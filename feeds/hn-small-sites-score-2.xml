September 3, 2020 | https://blog.bearer.sh/api-debugging-tools/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.bearer.sh/api-debugging-tools/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Integrating with APIs can be challenging. Each with its own <a href="https://blog.bearer.sh/best-practices-for-navigating-api-documentation/">documentation format</a>, SDK patterns, and authentication quirks. Once you get the integration up and running, the harder step is testing and debugging any problems. This part can be exploratory—before you finish building—or as part of problem resolution.</p>
<p>While you can certainly debug within your codebase, by testing methods and reviewing logs, it can be beneficial to isolate the API calls by using one of the many API testing tools available.</p>
<p>Rather than list the pros and cons of each, let's focus on what makes each tool unique and worth trying.</p>
<h2 id="postman">Postman</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid Plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/postman.png" alt="postman"></p>
<p><a href="https://postman.com/">Postman</a> is an institution in this space. It's been around for years, and went from a small app that made API calls into the full ecosystem that it is today. While Postman's primary use case is building and managing your own APIs, their emphasis on encouraging third-parties to publish collections has made it a great tool for exploring and debugging web services. These collections are what make Postman a fantastic tool for debugging external API calls.</p>
<p>Some providers, like Zendesk, <a href="https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/sunshine/custom_objects_api">link directly to their Postman collections</a> in their documentation. Others can be found on Postman's <a href="https://explore.postman.com/">Explore</a> page, and then opened within the Postman app. Once installed, you can explore endpoints and resources with minimal setup.</p>
<p><a href="https://postman.com/">Learn more about Postman</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hoppscotch">Hoppscotch</h2>
<p>Cost: Free</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/hoppscotch.png" alt="hoppscotch"></p>
<p><a href="https://hoppscotch.io/">Hoppscotch</a> started as a faster, browser-first alternative to Postman, called Postwoman. It has since been rebranded and continues to add features. Its main benefits are speed and availability. It is also <a href="https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch">open source</a>, and can even run as a browser extension or progressive web app (PWA).</p>
<p><a href="https://hoppscotch.io/">Learn more about Hoppscotch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="paw">Paw</h2>
<p>Cost: Free Trial, then $49.99</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/paw.png" alt="paw"></p>
<p>Moving on to platform-specific applications, <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a> is a paid Mac application for interacting with APIs. Like many of the others, it's core focus is on providing a tool to build, test, and document your own APIs. Perhaps Paw's greatest selling point is the UI. Compared to many of the other application's on this list, it really feels like quality Mac-first software. It also offers Team functionality, and an interesting feature called Pawprint that lets you share request/response pairs via a URL, even if the receiver doesn't use Paw.</p>
<p><a href="https://paw.cloud/">Learn more about Paw</a>.</p>
<h2 id="insomnia">Insomnia</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/insomnia.png" alt="insomnia"></p>
<p><a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a> is another API client that lets you design, debug, and test APIs. Unlike some of the other "all-inclusive" applications, Insomnia splits the API designer functionality into a seperate app. This makes the UI much more approachable, and makes it easier to quickly try out a new request without excess setup and configuration.</p>
<p>One additional tool that you can find in their documentation is a CLI version called Inso. It allows you to use the functionality from both their core Insomnia client as well as the designer app, right from the command line, and even from within CI/CD environments.</p>
<p><a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Learn more about Insomnia</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fiddler">Fiddler</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/fiddler.png" alt="fiddler"></p>
<p>While the rest of the applications in this list are centered around allowing you to directly interface with APIs, <a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a> takes a different approach. It is more of a general purpose web debugging tool. It acts as a proxy to capture local requests between your device and the internet. This means you can run your application locally, and inspect any outgoing requests and incoming responses from the Fiddler application.</p>
<p>This approach can be useful for live-debugging, but it also allows you to mock requests and responses that match specific rules. Combined with features around creating collections of requests and responses, and the ability to collaborate with a team, this approach could really help debugging more complex API problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Learn more about Fiddler</a></p>

<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/http-toolkit.png" alt="http-toolkit"></p>
<p><a href="https://httptoolkit.tech/">HTTP Toolkit</a> is another proxy-style tool like Fiddler, but it is much easier to use and allows you to target specific apps and devices. Where I had trouble getting Fiddler to recognize calls made from my terminal, HTTP Toolkit just worked immediately. The Pro plans offer some really interesting features, such as modifying calls as they are sent, simulating timeouts, and simulating connection failures. In a lot of ways, it feels like the browser's "Network" panel, but for any application.</p>
<p>There's clearly a goal of developer productivity, shown through small touches like inline documentation for status codes and headers, as well as the ability to export code for the API call itself in a variety of languages. It's also open source, which is always a nice bonus.</p>
<p><a href="https://httptoolkit.tech/">Learn more about HTTP Toolkit</a></p>
<h2 id="bearer">Bearer</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bearer.sh/">Bearer</a> takes a different approach, in that it monitors APIs from within your application with minimal code changes. Any common issues are detected and collected in the dashboard, but you can also set up custom rules for edge case problems. This is a great way to actively debug, but also passively keep watch for unexpected problems that may arise with web services.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/bearer.png" alt="bearer"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bearer.sh/">Learn more about Bearer</a></p>

<p>Choosing the right tool, not just for the task, but also for your workflow can be a challenge. Fortunately, all of the options we've looked at here are free or offer free trials to get you started. Whether you're doing some exploratory testing, debugging a rare problem, or looking for a way to make your integrations more reliable, there's an existing API debugging and testing tool that can help.</p>

<article>
  

    <section>
      <p>I recently read a somehow controversial <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56">article</a> on why CEOs are failing software engineers. In the article, software management theorist <a href="https://twitter.com/GeneTBond">Gene Bond</a> argues that since business-educated CEOs only learn about financial and business management, they can't understand the creative management necessary to discover and realise new works of value.</p><blockquote>"<em>New value is a function of failure, not success; and, much of software engineering is about discovering new value. So, in effect, nearly everything [they] are taught as a business major or leader is seemingly incompatible with software engineering.</em>"</blockquote><p>But what if CEOs were former software engineers? Would they still fail the software engineers they lead? Data seems to show otherwise when you know that eight of the ten <a href="https://fxssi.com/most-valuable-tech-companies">most valuable technology companies</a> have <strong>CEOs who also are engineers</strong>. Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, was exposed to tech and coding at a <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1058012110947373057?s=20">young age</a>. Bill Gates, the second richest, fell in love with programming at <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Early-Days-as-a-Computer-Programmer">13 years old</a>, and Mark Zuckerberg, famously kept coding Facebook while being CEO for years. Still, the majority of software engineers think they can only become CTO and have little interest in business.</p><h3 id="top-performing-ceos-have-engineering-degrees"><strong>Top-performing CEOs have engineering degrees</strong></h3><p>Every year since 2014, the Harvard Business Review has published an <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-ceo-100-2019-edition#the-best-performing-ceos-in-the-world-2019">annual ranking</a> of the best-performing CEOs in the world and, for the past three years, there have been <strong>more CEOs with engineering degrees than MBAs</strong>, including this year's number one, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. One likely explanation for this trend is the increase of technology CEOs on the list, as the industry has seen exponential growth in recent years. But maybe there's something else.</p><p>First of all, software engineers know how to set up the right environment for fellow developers because, well, they've been there. They know what developers <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/07/a-field-guide-to-developers/">look for in a job</a>. It's not surprising that <strong>twelve out of the twenty tech CEOs most favoured by their </strong><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Top-CEOs-LST_KQ0,8.htm"><strong>employees</strong></a><strong> have an engineering background</strong> or coded at some point in their careers. As Stack Overflow and Trello founder Joel Sposkly <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/">puts it</a>: "<em>building the company where the best software developers in the world would want to work [leads] to profits as naturally as chocolate leads to chubbiness or cartoon sex in video games leads to gangland-style shooting sprees</em>". After all, he did build two multi-million companies that considerably impacted the software ecosystem.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oPXEuhoN05pnwuxbStZyMOftjkpqzRkpZdIxi2KImveOn3p8CL0VOEr7OGcuXQjFr0_MsfHaGx4QJ9ps3JSHJd8TXpv7dSUypZTTqf0jURKiGppNFiGi4aXfiLGbiJ9xBZAa6UwD" alt=""><figcaption>Joel Spolsky’s formula on how to build profitable software companies</figcaption></figure><p>I also believe that having a software engineering mindset, even if self-taught, allows CEOs to manage their companies very differently than financially focused peers.</p><h3 id="approaching-business-processes-like-programming-tasks"><strong>Approaching business processes like programming tasks</strong></h3><p>While Microsoft valuation hardly moved during Steve Ballmer's fourteen years tenure as CEO, it grew over 200 % since Satya Nadella took over in 2014. The difference? Steve Ballmer was a sales-oriented business school drop-out, while Nadella is a former software engineer turned executive.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SCzxw685G5KsYSWFfNKU1WiU6J7yXXk1nZ-ZBMh-LpSe4gqKLKHwrLT6KCWZJl9bI2E7QHnssM1gCdMRRDVAuabgxYCNn9lQ9xLnbkSNTJ7vgMIhDM7sJecme7mGO_Wqhgxdatg4" alt=""><figcaption>Microsoft stock price under Satya Nadella - CB Insights<span>‌‌</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what does Nadella, and other engineers-turned-CEOs have in common? Well, suppose we take aside the ability to understand technology and have a long-term vision about it. In that case, I believe one of their key attributes is the ability to <strong>approach business processes like programming tasks</strong>.</p><p>Do you know what programmatic marketing, growth hacking and the lean startup have in common? They're all business methodologies that were created by engineers. They leverage <strong>logic and processes</strong> instead of intuition; they're <strong>data-driven</strong> and promote <strong>iterative experimentation</strong>. And, when you go beyond the buzzwords and watch the results, they're behind the wild success of tech companies like Dropbox and Slack (whose CEOs are, by the way, former developers).</p><p>Another trait of software engineers is their inclination to <strong>automate recurring and tedious tasks</strong>. As Bill Gates is known to say, "<em>I always choose a lazy person to do a hard job, because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.</em>" And software engineers are known to be lazy. So, as CEOs, they're more likely to look for scalable solutions through automation, rather than merely hiring more human beings. Some CEOs take this thinking to another level like GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij, who started the company's famous <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/">handbook</a> because he didn't want to repeat himself for every batch of new hires.</p><p>What's even more interesting is when software engineers become CEOs of non-software companies. In this case, they run their firm like a software company, <strong>making software the cornerstone of their strategy</strong>, like Elon Musk with Tesla. One key component of electric automaker Tesla's success, as <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation">spotted</a> by Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer, is that "<em>it introduced a new hardware and software architecture. For example, a Tesla has more software than the average vehicle and it is integrated around a single central software architecture. Although most gas-powered cars have software too, they typically have less software and operate on a different architecture making it more challenging to imitate Tesla's ability to update software and optimise vehicle performance.</em></p><p>Last but not least, they understand like Jeff Bezos that "<em>failure and invention are inseparable twins.</em>" In his famous <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm">letters to shareholders</a>, Bezos often shares that what makes Amazon successful is their ability to accept the failed experiments necessary to get to invention.</p><blockquote>“<em>Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten [...] In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs.</em>”</blockquote><h3 id="why-so-few-software-engineers-want-to-become-ceos"><strong>Why so few software engineers want to become CEOs</strong></h3><p>So if software engineers can become excellent CEOs, even in non-tech businesses, why so few of them make it to the top? According to a 2019 Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2019/10/05/new-ceo-study-the-undergraduate-degrees-and-majors-of-fortune-100-ceos/#623b360e4130">study</a>, still, 64% of F100 CEOs had a business-related undergraduate degree. I don't think it's just about software engineers' dislike for business. I believe it's also about how few of them consider the CEO position as a career choice. They're always told that if they're interested in management, the highest possible job is CTO. When hiring software engineers for a startup job, they first think they should be CTO.</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt=""></figure><p>Of course, not everyone wants to start a startup, the surest way to become CEO. But with more and more tech CEOs <strong>promoted from within after technology management roles</strong>, it's a choice to consider.</p><h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h3><ul><li>CEOs with a background in financial and business management often fail to understand software engineers</li><li>Former software engineers and self-taught developers make excellent CEO</li><li>One of their key attributes is their capacity to approach business like programming</li><li>CEO is a valid career choice for software engineers and they shouldn’t be afraid to consider it if they’re attracted to the business side</li></ul><h3 id="reading-list"><strong>Reading List</strong></h3><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56"><strong>Why are CEOs failing software engineers?</strong></a> -</p><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/"><strong>Hitting the High Notes</strong></a> - Joel Spolsky</p><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation"><strong>Lessons from Tesla’s Approach to Innovation</strong></a> - Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer</p>

                <div>
                    <p>One of the issues I discovered while playing with microk8s Kubernetes setup locally was that many services and tools like <code>Kubernetes Dashboard</code> uses HTTPS for access and I don't want to use Self-Signed SSL certificates as it would require me installing these certificates in every device I use which would be a pain in the butt. So I was on the journey finding a way to have an SSL Certificate for my internal IP addresses. This article will document my journey of getting automatic SSL certificates for my internal microk8s Kubernetes setup.</p><h2 id="ssl-certificate-for-internal-ip-address">SSL Certificate for internal IP address?</h2><p>My first question was is there a way to get an SSL certificate from Public trusted Certificate Authority after looking at many free services like Let's Encrypt and similar services don't provide certificates to IP addresses, but only to domain names.</p><p>After discovering the issue with no way to get an SSL certificate for internal IP I was looking into other options for my problem. After racking my brains for a few minutes I had a question: Could I create a DNS A record for internal IP and would it work? A quick visit to my DNS control panel adding A record to the local IP address and visiting the domain name and seeing my local IP address served website I was amazed that it worked.</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png 1212w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png" alt=""></figure><p>Discovering that I can have a domain name for internal IP working I was surprised now I had curiosity if I will be able to use service like Let's Encrypt to generate an SSL Certificate for this domain name but if I remember correctly the Let's Encrypt requires external access to verify domain name ownership. Hmm, maybe there is a way to verify domain name ownership without external access? After some digging around Let's Encrypt documentation, I found that there many ways to verify domain ownership one of them is DNS plugins which have many DNS providers to automatically verify domains by modifying DNS records using API from those providers. In my case it is DigitalOcean.</p><p>Following <code>certbot-dns-digitalocean</code> <a href="https://certbot-dns-digitalocean.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">documentation</a>I tried to generate a certificate for internal IP but I ran into the issue that default macOS <code>certbot</code> installation from <code>brew install certbot</code> had no <code>certbot-dns-digitalocean</code> plugin available.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>After a quick search online I found that DNS Plugins are not installed by default with <code>certbot</code>. I needed to install <code>certbox-dns-digitalocean</code> plugin using PIP</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Afterward, I was able to generate a certificate without many issues:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Applying SSL certificate to local HTTPS server I was able to get HTTPS valid response from the internal IP address using a domain name</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-5.png" alt=""></figure><p>Now that I know that I can generate &amp; use an SSL certificate for internal IP address just by using a domain name. Now I can try to migrate this knowledge to integrate this to microk8s local setup.</p><h2 id="integrating-let-s-encrypt-with-dns-challenge-into-microk8s-setup-using-cert-manager">Integrating Let's Encrypt with DNS challenge into microk8s setup using <code>cert-manager</code></h2><p>I am not going to describe microk8s Kubernetes setup as it is pretty straightforward compared to the plain Kubernetes setup.</p><p>The first step is to install <code>cert-manager</code> I will be using Helm to install it.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now let's configure Certificate Issuer.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>â€˜Just a second. I just need to respond to this one thing,â€™ I said to my daughter, as I attended to my iPhone.</p>
<p>Only much later could I count the mistakes in that statement. No, it wouldnâ€™t take â€˜just a secondâ€™; no, I didnâ€™t â€˜needâ€™ to respond to the email â€“ Iâ€™m an author and researcher, and thus rarely receive messages that have a drop-everything-and-answer urgency to them. And no, it wouldnâ€™t be â€˜one thingâ€™. My brain would be too tempted, Iâ€™d feast on it all.</p>
<p>After I finished, I looked up and my daughter was gone. The worst part: before I became distracted, we had been playing a lovely game, telling each other what superpower we most wished for. It could have brought us closer together, but Iâ€™d just blown the spirit and substance of it big-time.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re a parent in the 21st century, I bet youâ€™ve experienced your own version of this. But itâ€™s not just parents, itâ€™s all of us in our interactions with each other. Distraction has become the norm. Weâ€™re blessed with pocket-sized supercomputers that connect us to anyone and everyone, and a buffet of information. But thereâ€™s a dark side: those same gadgets distract us, often at the moments that matter most.</p>
<p>Of course, smartphones didnâ€™t invent distraction â€“ theyâ€™re just the latest culprit. Before that, we blamed television. And before that, it was the telephone, or comic books, or the radio. Go back more than 2,000 years, and Socrates was even criticising the written word, for causing â€˜forgetfulness in the learnersâ€™ soulsâ€™.</p>
<p>Still, our present feels different, with the sources of distraction seeming greater in number and more ubiquitous. One <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0013916514539755">study</a> in 2014 showed that when two people are talking, the mere presence of a smartphone resting on a table is enough to change the character of their conversation. Thatâ€™s a tame example. To see the seriousness of the problem, look at the sobering <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving">statistics</a> on â€˜distracted drivingâ€™ in the United States.</p>
<p>After I abandoned my daughter and our game for an utterly inconsequential email, I realised I needed to deal with my distraction problem. First, I tried a popular approach: I blamed technology and made a serious attempt at a â€˜digital detoxâ€™. I bought a flip phone, subscribed to a print newspaper, and even purchased a 1990s-era word processor without an internet connection. I convinced myself that, once I banished all the technology from my life, Iâ€™d become the disciplined writer and focused father Iâ€™d always strived to be.</p>
<p>Talk about a rude awakening. Sitting at my ancient word processor, my eyes began to peer over to my now-tantalising bookshelf. â€˜Hmmm,â€™ I said to myself, â€˜I really should take a glance at this bookâ€™. Iâ€™d justify the distraction as necessary for â€˜researchâ€™. And if it wasnâ€™t reading, then Iâ€™d find something else â€“ the laundry that <em>needed</em> to be folded right now, my desk that <em>needed</em> to be tidied-up this minute. The technology wasnâ€™t distracting me. <em>I</em> was distracting me.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s when I started a five-year journey to understand <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/distractions/">distraction</a>, its causes and its cures. I discovered a great deal that I found surprising and counterintuitive, and I developed methods to deal with my distraction that actually worked â€“ and didnâ€™t involve me trying to turn back time and operate a flip phone. I realised that distraction often begins from within, not without, and found that the fix came from identifying and managing the psychological discomfort that leads us off track.</p>
<p>As often as not, distraction is your brain ducking challenging feelings such as boredom, loneliness, insecurity, fatigue and uncertainty. These are the internal triggers â€“ the <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/kids-video-game-obsession/">root causes</a> â€“ that prompt you to find the comfort of distraction and open a browser tab, Twitter or email, instead of focusing on the matter at hand. Once you identify these internal triggers, you can decide to respond in a more advantageous manner. You wonâ€™t always be able to control how you feel â€“ but you can learn to control how you react to the way you feel. A trigger that once sent you to Twitter can perhaps lead instead to 10 deep breaths.</p>
<p>Distraction, in other words, is a symptom of a problem â€“ not the problem itself. Those deeper and systemic reasons â€“ such as an inability to cope with fear, anxiety or stress â€“ deserve our concern, because itâ€™s only when we start to address them that we can make real progress. When we begin to understand what weâ€™re trying to avoid by clicking over to Twitter or checking the news for the 10th time today, we can begin to address the issue itself, and not medicate it through more distraction. We also begin to appreciate how habitual the act of avoiding discomfort via distraction can be, and how much itâ€™s become a part of how we work and live.</p>
<p>The good news is that thereâ€™s something paradoxical about discomfort: itâ€™s actually the best tool we have for evolving and developing as a species. Feeling bad isnâ€™t actually bad; itâ€™s what helped us survive. Writing in 2001, the American psychologist Roy Baumeister and his colleagues <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-70020-001">observed</a>: â€˜If satisfaction and pleasure were permanent, there might be little incentive to continue seeking further benefits or advances.â€™ If we didnâ€™t feel bad, in other words, weâ€™d never achieve good.</p>
<p>Once you understand the depth of distraction, you can start to manage it and improve. After years of experiments, I found myself less distracted â€“ a quality that improved nearly every aspect of my life. It turns out that being able to focus on the subjects and people in my life who matter improved everything from my health to my happiness to my productivity. That can seem obvious, but I couldnâ€™t have fully appreciated the joys of living an indistractable life if I hadnâ€™t gotten there on my own after a five-year journey. Being indistractable can lead you to not just change your life for the better, but also experience life fully.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p><strong>Self-explore</strong></p>
<p>Identifying the triggers that made you feel bad in the first place requires self-exploration. When you notice yourself feeling distracted, pause and ask yourself what youâ€™re feeling. Are you worried? Are you afraid? Then go one step deeper. What caused the sensation? How does it feel in your body?</p>
<p>In exploring my own internal triggers, I began to appreciate that my anxiety about a project, which might lead me to find a tempting Wikipedia rabbit hole, was actually adaptive: the fact that I was anxious was good because it meant I was trying to become better. It was sometimes even as easy as saying to myself: â€˜Youâ€™re getting distracted right now because youâ€™re worried this wonâ€™t be up to snuff. Thatâ€™s okay. It means youâ€™re trying to do your best work, and thatâ€™s something to feel good about.â€™ It seems like a simple mental trick, but even that thought can have a profound influence in keeping you on track.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s an interesting paradox about internal triggers: they can be big, imposing, powerful issues, and yet the fixes can sometimes be easy and quick. Hereâ€™s an example: letâ€™s say that an internal trigger when youâ€™re about to get started on a looming project is boredom. You just canâ€™t bring yourself to get excited about doing your taxes. And because you get bored, you get distracted. But if you know youâ€™re going to get bored, you can find ways to avoid the distraction that will soothe the boredom. For instance, if you set a time limit to work on the otherwise mind-numbing task that is so short, you wonâ€™t have a chance to get bored. Anyone can work on their taxes for just 10 minutes. This is called the <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/strange-sex-habits-of-silicon-valley/">10-minute rule</a>, and itâ€™s an effective way to avoid distractions of all sorts. The point is to anticipate the internal trigger and then intercept it with a new routine rather than allowing yourself to slink away into doing something you didnâ€™t intend to do.</p>
<p>In the case of my interaction with my daughter, the internal trigger might have been anxiety about work or <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/fomo/">fear of missing out</a> (on an email). But I can address both of those proactively, so that they donâ€™t interfere with precious daddy-daughter time. In the case of my work anxiety, I could make sure that someone on my team is monitoring incoming messages. I could put up an â€˜out of officeâ€™ email that encourages people to call me if thereâ€™s really an emergency. Or in reality, I could get comfortable with the discomfort that I might indeed be missing out on something, but thatâ€™s all right too. Any one of those is a better and more constructive response to the internal trigger than being distracted.</p>
<p>Whatever approach you take to address your inner triggers, itâ€™s encouraging to note that merely recognising uncomfortable feelings and identifying them could be beneficial. For instance, in a smoking-cessation <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871611002535?via%3Dihub">study</a>, researchers found that participants who learned to acknowledge and explore their cravings managed to quit smoking at double the rates of those in the American Lung Associationâ€™s best-performing cessation programme. Just identifying and investigating a craving had a tremendous impact.</p>
<p><strong>Reframe</strong></p>
<p>Once youâ€™ve identified the triggers, you can reframe the task at hand. Sure, you might be â€˜forced to do your taxesâ€™. But another way of thinking about that is that you â€˜get to review last yearâ€™s business successesâ€™. It sounds laughable, but it works. When I hit rough patches mid-book writing, I would say: â€˜I get to share this with my audience,â€™ as opposed to: â€˜I really have to work on the book today.â€™</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s one strategy: I found the fun in whatever I was doing. Yes, I know, this is where you roll your eyes, but hear me out. I learned to stay focused on the tedious work of writing books by looking for and finding the mystery embedded in my work. I wasnâ€™t â€˜writingâ€™, I was â€˜exploringâ€™. I wasnâ€™t Ernest Hemingway; I was Scooby-Doo. Research indicates that even the simple act of thinking of something that you donâ€™t enjoy as …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

So this led to a surge in “digital credit” banking led by the private sector in low-income countries, which is increasing financial inclusion for people without formal credit.</p><p>China takes this up a notch with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.smartcitylab.com/blog/inclusive-sharing/can-big-data-eradicate-poverty/" target="_blank">a cloud computing platform to monitor the financial health of 6 million people living in poverty in 9,000 villages in Guizhou province</a>.

The problem that MEANS is attempting to solve is the mismatch of food between what food kitchens and charities need, and what is being given to them.</p><p>For example, 10,000 packets of sugar-laden Pop-Tarts are given to a charity with mostly diabetic members. In cases where large amounts of the wrong food are given to the wrong people, the food end up being disposed and that sucks.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the most anticipated general public neurotech events of the year happened last Friday: Neuralink’s second yearly update. Although last week was a particularly eventful one for neuroscience, with major announcements from multiple key players in the field, Elon Musk commands a level of attention unlike anyone else (warranted or not). So today we’ll focus on Neuralink and the technology they unveiled.
</p><p>
<b>The Neuralink system</b><br>
The system Neuralink presented during Friday's event is an evolution of the system they unveiled a year ago. Instead of implanting a single array of rigid electrodes into the brain, as is more common, their system inserts individual threads using a device reminiscent of a sewing machine. Indeed, a significant share of their efforts has been geared towards building a medical robot (i.e. the sewing machine) capable of quickly and precisely inserting the soft and flexible electrode threads into the brain. Individual threads are then connected to a custom chip that filters and compresses the recorded neural data, before sending it out through a low energy Bluetooth connection to a smartphone. A single chip can connect to around fifty to a hundred threads, each with multiple independent contacts, for a total of a thousand individual recording (and stimulation) sites. One of the major changes in the newly unveiled “second generation” device is that the entire system fits inside a capsule about the diameter of a quarter dollar coin, albeit five times thicker (2.3cm in diameter and 0.8cm thick). This package is meant to replace the piece of skull removed during surgery. In other words, a coin-sized hole is drilled into the skull, the electrodes are inserted into the brain using a robotic sewing machine, and then the hole in the bone is plugged with the device rather than the removed piece of skull. This allows for an elegant implant with limited wiring and no transcutaneous connectors. Of note, the surgical robot has also been significantly streamlined and improved, presumably moving it closer to something that could be used in an operating room and on humans. However, details were scarce, making it hard to evaluate any of these changes accurately. The short version is that the technology was very much in line with what had been shown last year, only improved, as can be expected of a company iterating towards a commercial product.
</p><p>
<b>A presentation light on details</b><br>
After their presentation last year, Neuralink received considerable backlash from the scientific community for excessive hype and failing to recognise similar existing technologies. While hype was still available in spades this year, there was in my view an effort to somewhat scale down ambitions. For example, Neuralink’s mission was stated in much more concrete terms this year: "The purpose of Neuralink is to solve important brain and spine problems." While there had certainly been talk of neurological disorders last year too, they had been overshadowed by very aspirational and futuristic mission statements within the first 5 minutes of the talk, including the distant idea of healthy people using brain interfaces to "achieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence”. These ideas still made it onto the stage this year, but only later in the event during the speculative part of the Q&amp;A session. Similarly, engineering efforts have been refocused and concretised. Last year’s plan of implanting 4000 channels in their first human participant appears to have been scaled down to a single 1024 channel device. This brings them much closer to the roughly 250 channels currently implanted in human participants enrolled in research studies, including at the University of Pittsburgh where I currently work.
</p><p>
While some neuroscientists are allergic to the hype and the grandiose statements Elon Musk is known for, it’s important to remember that Neuralink isn’t a research lab—it's a Silicon Valley startup. Their event had over a hundred thousand live streamers (despite being the middle of the night in Europe), and the video has since amassed over 2 million views. That’s a big reach—this was no scientific conference talk. A startup’s CEO needs to straddle the line between realistic short term goals and an overarching mesmerising vision to recruit talent and raise money. It’s the same duality that leads to sharing images of towns on Mars (perhaps even with a human-made atmosphere) all while building the world’s most advanced rockets. In Neuralink’s case, there is the added ethical danger of presenting treatments that clearly won't exist for decades, raising false hopes in people afflicted by neurological disorders. However, by offering no explicit timelines or plans, Neuralink is making no promises, only engaging in long term speculation. The same way we can trust people not to sell their homes in preparation for a move to Mars, we should trust them not to take dramatic health decisions based on 20 minutes of sci-fi thought experiments and speculation.
</p><p>
Neuralink’s scientific and engineering merits ought to be judged on the systems it produces, not its storytelling. That is what I will try to do here. Since there is  simply not enough information to make a thorough evaluation—educated guesses will have to do.
</p><p>
<b>Neuralink’s strength is not science, it’s engineering</b><br>
Despite the aforementioned lack of details, a few laudable achievements were on display at Friday's event. The biggest was a demonstration that Neuralink's new device (Neuralink’s Neuralink?) works in vivo (in pigs), and did so for two months. The ability to wirelessly stream from 1024 cortical channels in a freely behaving animal is a big step in the right direction and a demonstration of what money and a talented team can deliver. The same is true of another extremely well-funded neurotechnology startup: Kernel, as <a href="https://edoardodanna.ch/article/thoughts_on_kernel_announcement"> I discussed after their last announcement</a>. In both cases, the real breakthrough is the ability to take existing prototypes from research labs and integrate them into a well designed and engineered product. The robot and implantable system Neuralink showcased are more polished than anything currently available, even if none of the individual ideas or components is completely novel. At the end of the day, execution is what matters. The history of technology is littered with examples of companies successfully combining existing ideas and prototypes into compelling  products and popularising them (e.g. Apple’s first successful point and click user interface, which borrowed from Xerox's PARC in-house prototypes).
</p><p>
<b>The biggest challenges still lie ahead</b><br>
While the engineering progress is impressive, where Neuralink still needs to do some convincing is on the science. What we have seen so far is excellent execution of things we knew could be done (miniaturisation, wireless system, surgical robot, etc). The next steps for Neuralink will increasingly involve tackling unsolved scientific challenges, which are an entirely different flavour of problem. Science is much harder to rush, it's less amenable to a startup’s timeline. For instance, Neuralink currently uses thin-film based electrodes, which have yet to demonstrate long term viability in academic labs (where they are extensively studied and have been for some time). Thin films have interesting properties such as very small sizes, high mechanical flexibility, and well-established fabrication processes, which make them well suited for brain implants. But their long term stability remains a looming challenge. So far Neuralink has demonstrated their electrodes can work for 2 months in pigs. That’s a long shot from showing they can work for five or ten years in humans. As Matt Angle, the CEO of another high profile neurotech startup called Paradromics, recently put it: “if you want to test whether something can last 10 years, you really have to wait 10 years.”
</p><p>
The other big challenge is what to do with a thousand channels once they are implanted and stable. Many of the applications mentioned in the presentation are plausible and actively researched (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899314015674">stimulation of visual cortex to restore sight</a>, <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/8/361/361ra141?__hstc=12316075.07430159d50a3c91e72c280a7921bf0d.1525132800142.1525132800143.1525132800144.1&amp;__hssc=12316075.1.1525132800145&amp;__hsfp=1773666937">stimulation of the somatosensory cortex to restore touch</a>, etc). But each of these is an active area of research full of unanswered questions. Having a thousand channels instead of a few hundred will not significantly change the game. For instance, we know that electrically stimulating any of these sensory areas can elicit corresponding percepts (e.g. localised flashes of light when stimulating the visual cortex). But these sensations are often crude replicas of their natural counterparts, with limited spatial resolution, unnatural qualities and limited dynamic range. While one can extrapolate from these results and imagine a future where improved artificial sensations become practical and useful, it will take a lot more than increasing the number of available channels by one or even two orders of magnitude. 
</p><p>
Talking only about stimulation is perhaps a little unfair, since it's the less advanced side of the neural interface coin. Recording information from the brain is much better understood, especially for motor areas, as illustrated by <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2560/12/1/016011/meta">this study</a> from the University of Pittsburgh where a brain implant is used to control a robot with 10 degrees of freedom. Neuralink's first demonstration will likely be to help a paralysed person control a computer with their mind, or perhaps even a robotic device of some kind (this second one is less likely because of the added complexity). Concretely, a system like this could allow the user to interact with a computer by controlling a cursor (i.e. point and click) and input text (either by using a virtual keyboard, or perhaps a more cutting-edge approach like the one I discussed in <a href="https://edoardodanna.ch/article/brain_calligraphy">a recent post</a>). On top of that, the user could control a few additional virtual “buttons”. In other words, the first Neuralink product could be a virtual brain-steered controller, with a joystick, three or four buttons and a speech …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Even in Go, concurrency is still not easy (with an example)</h2>

	<p><small>September  1, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Go is famous for making concurrency easy, through good language
support for <a href="https://golangbot.com/goroutines/">goroutines</a>. Except
what Go makes easy is only one level of concurrency, the nuts and
bolts level of making your code do things concurrently and communicating
back and forth through channels. Making it do the right things
concurrently is still up to you, and unfortunately Go doesn't
currently provide a lot of standard library support for correctly
implemented standard concurrency patterns.</p>

<p>For example, one common need is for a limited amount of concurrency;
you want to do several things at once, but only so many of them.
At the moment this is up to you to implement on top of goroutines,
channels, and things like the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/"><code>sync</code></a>
package. This is not as easy as it looks, and quite competent people
can make mistakes here. As it happens, I have an example ready to
hand today.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/gops">Gops</a> is a convenient command to
list (and diagnose) Go processes that are currently running on your
system. Among other things, it'll tell you which version of Go they
were compiled with, which is handy if you want to see if you have out
of date binaries that should be rebuilt and redeployed. One of the
things <code>gops</code> needs to do is look at all of the Go processes on your
system, which it does concurrently. However, it doesn't want to look
at too many processes at once, because <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/pull/118">that can cause problems with
file descriptor limits</a>. This
is a classic case of <em>limited concurrency</em>.</p>

<p>Gops implements this at the moment with code in <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/blob/6fb0d860e5fa50629405d9e77e255cd32795967e/goprocess/gp.go#L29">goprocess.FindAll()</a>
that looks like this, in somewhat sketched and reduced form:</p>

<blockquote><pre>func FindAll() []P {
   pss, err := ps.Processes()
   [...]
   found := make(chan P)
   limitCh := make(chan struct{}, concurrencyProcesses)

   for _, pr := range pss {
      limitCh &lt;- struct{}{}
      pr := pr
      go func() {
         defer func() { &lt;-limitCh }()
         [... get a P with some error checking ...]
         found &lt;- P
      }()
   }
   [...]

   var results []P
   for p := range found {
      results = append(results, p)
   }
   return results
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(In the real code there's a WaitGroup for coordination, and the
<code>found</code> channel gets closed appropriately.)</p>

<p>How this works is clear, and is a standard pattern (covered in eg
Go 101's <a href="https://go101.org/article/channel-use-cases.html">Channel Use Cases</a>). We use a
buffered channel to provide a limited number of tokens; sending a
value into the channel implicitly takes a token (and blocks if the
token supply is exhausted), while receiving a value from it puts a
token back in. We take a token before we start a new goroutine, and
the goroutine releases the token when it's done.</p>

<p>Except that <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/issues/123">this code has a bug if there are too many processes
to examine</a>. Even knowing
that there is a bug in this code, it may not be obvious.</p>

<p>The bug is that the goroutines only receive from <code>limitCh</code> to release
their token after sending their result to the unbuffered <code>found</code>
channel, while the main code only starts receiving from <code>found</code>
after running through the entire loop, and <strong>the main code takes
the token in the loop and blocks if no tokens are available</strong>. So
if you have too many processes to go through, you start N goroutines,
they all block trying to write to <code>found</code> and don't receive from
<code>limitCh</code>, and the main <code>for</code> loop blocks trying to send to <code>limitCh</code>
and never reaches the point where it starts receiving from <code>found</code>.</p>

<p>At one level, this bug is a very fragile bug; it only exists because
of multiple circumstances. If the goroutines took the token by
sending to <code>limitCh</code> instead of the main <code>for</code> loop doing it, the
bug would not exist; the main <code>for</code> loop would start them all, many
would stop, and then it would go on to receive from <code>found</code> so that
they could receive from <code>limitCh</code> and release their token so other
goroutines would run. If the goroutines received from <code>limitCh</code> to
release their token before sending to <code>found</code>, it wouldn't exist
(but because of error handling, it's simpler and more reliable to
do the receive in a <code>defer</code>). And if the entire <code>for</code> loop was in
an additional goroutine, the main code would go on to receive from
<code>found</code> and unblock completed goroutines to release their tokens,
so the fact that the <code>for</code> loop was blocked waiting to send to
<code>limitCh</code> wouldn't matter.</p>

<p>At another level, this shows how concurrency is not easy as easy
as it looks in Go. All you need is one mistake and things skid to
a halt, and all of the code involved can look good to a casual
examination. Getting concurrency correct is simply hard for people
(we can debate about why, but I think that it is is very clear).</p>

<p>(I'm sure that the people who wrote and approved the change that
added this concurrency limiting code to gops were good programmers.
A tricky case still tripped them up, passing all of their scrutiny.
Even when I knew that there was a concurrency problem in the code
and where it was (because my <code>gops</code> was hanging all of a sudden,
and <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a> told me where
everything was stuck), it still took me some time to see what the
exact problem was.)</p>

<p>Dynamic, functional programming languages like Clojure are sometimes considered “slower” than their statically-typed and/or OO counterparts, due to facilities like dynamic function dispatch and immutable-orientation, etc. But this comparison is too general. </p>



<p>Clojure is <em>readily</em> optimizable in cases where utmost performance is key. Clojure embraces the “Get it working, then make it fast” approach to building up a software system—even large-scale systems with high performance demands<a href="#footnotes" data-type="internal" data-id="#footnotes">¹</a>.</p>



<p>This post is about micro-optimizing Clojure code: how can we improve our Clojure code performance on the JVM when we need it the most, when hot code paths and tight loops prevail—for example, in large-scale data processing systems.</p>



<p>General JVM performance, benchmarking, and tuning is a broad and deep skillset and there are many more considerations beyond Clojure. The focus here is Clojure-specific.</p>

<p>Before we get to our specific list of Clojure optimizations, we should emphasize that running your own benchmark and profiling experiments is essential to producing specific top-level performance outcomes for your own code and domain.</p>



<p>You could follow all of the advice in this post, shower your code with type hints, remove laziness and sequences, etc, etc, and⁠ without a <em>specific</em> performance model for where your costs are coming from and how to measure improvement, it is possible or even likely to see no dip in your processing latencies or reduction in your cloud bill<a href="#footnotes">²</a>.</p>



<p>We recommend the following tools for performing your own analyses; these were all used in developing this post:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium">criterium</a> A benchmarking tool that is a Clojure industry-standard at this point; most of the relative benchmarks in this post are generated from the REPL using criterium.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/clojure-goes-fast/clj-async-profiler">clj-async-profiler</a> For minimal quick and dirty Clojure profiling. REPL-enabled.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/gtrak/no.disassemble">no.disassemble</a> For inspecting Clojure-compiled byte code from the REPL. (If you’re familiar with <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javap.html">javap</a>, the output is what you would see from decompiling classes using javap -c on the command-line, except you can see what a compiled Clojure function looks like.)</li><li><a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/">jmh</a> (Java Microbenchmark Harness) A feature-rich benchmarking toolkit for the JVM. Its usage is heavily Java/annotation-based (so not REPL-friendly) but it has an expressive feature set, making it possible to run more specialized<a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/4a420afe8a9e/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/JMHSample_30_Interrupts.java"> </a>benchmarks such as <a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/4a420afe8a9e/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/JMHSample_30_Interrupts.java">ones</a> that could deadlock (and many others; see <a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/tip/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/">here</a>.) We find it essential in carrying out a comprehensive benchmarking analyses and we’ll demonstrate out how to use it with Clojure a bit later on.</li></ul>



<h2 id="avoiding-laziness">Avoiding Laziness</h2>



<p>Clojure’s sequence abstraction and laziness are powerful programming facilities but we must shy away from these tools when memory and compute are in high demand. </p>



<p>Why? Lazy implementations require generating&nbsp;<em>per-element&nbsp;</em>state and this can be substantial overhead when compared to non-lazy alternatives like arrays and vectors whose elements each contribute just their own value’s size to memory.</p>



<p>Accordingly there is computation overhead in laziness due to this per element construction; compare lazy implementations of map and filter to transform values in a vector with a non-lazy (<a href="https://clojure.org/reference/transducers">transducer</a>-based) alternative:</p>

<p>into has first-class transducer support; the same over-<em>2x</em> gains follow when using transducers + transduce in favor of laziness + reduce.</p>



<p>Avoid laziness where scale matters.</p>



<h2 id="first-and-last">first and last</h2>



<p>This one is particularly frustrating. We might expect <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/first">first</a> and <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/last">last</a> to have special consideration of their provided type. But this is not the case; they are implemented over Clojure’s lazy sequence API without respect of type. Even with a vector, last will obtain the result using a full linear pass over the data. Both first and last <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/seq">seq</a> the input unnecessarily which is additional computation cost.</p>



<p>Of course we have a way out⁠—but the moral of the story is to stay well away from first and last when optimal performance is required. Here’s a full sequence of benchmarks; notice the dramatic relative cost of first and last on vectors. Pick the latencies you like the best:</p>

<p>Edit: Clojure’s <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/peek">peek</a> will answer the last item of a vector optimally.

<h2 id="equiv-equals">equiv and equals</h2>



<p>An occasional need in high-performing applications is a read-heavy, in-memory cache or value registry, commonly with some kind of composite/tuple for its map keys. It turns out that the choice of datatype (for both map and key) are… erm… key here.</p>



<p>Consider the following benchmarks for a simple map lookup using different combinations of map type (Clojure’s PersistentHashMap vs. Java’s HashMap) and composite key type.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>PersistentHashMap</td><td>[“a” “b”]</td><td>167 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(ArrayList. [“a” “b”])</td><td>95 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“a:b”</td><td>78 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(→CacheKey “a” “b”)</td><td>116 ns</td></tr><tr><td>HashMap</td><td>[“a” “b”]</td><td>36 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(ArrayList. [“a” “b”])</td><td>53 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“a:b”</td><td>33 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(→CacheKey “a” “b”)</td><td>152 ns</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Benchmarks for (get map key) for different map and key types. CacheKey is a basic defrecord type; “a:b” is a simple String with the composite values concatenated, etc.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is quite a lot of variation in performance: JDK’s HashMap performs significantly better (except when using a record key—we’ll look at that one later). What accounts for this? </p>



<p>Clojure defines <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/equality">equality</a> (i.e., clojure.core/=) more generically than Java’s .equals and this definition is used by Clojure’s data structures for equality comparison, PersistentHashMap in this case:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>v <span>[</span><span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>]</span> v2 <span>[</span><span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>report<span>-</span>result<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span><span>=</span> v v2<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 91.347726 ns</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>report<span>-</span>result<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span><span>.</span>equals v v2<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 10.741904 ns</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>Significant performance difference for these composite (vector) keys.</p>



<p>Of course, Clojure’s = is more general than Java .equals, which is a stricter comparison in several cases; here is just one example:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>.</span>equals <span>[</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>[</span><span>(</span>int <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br>
⇒ false<br>
<span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>[</span><span>(</span>int <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br>
⇒ true</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>So we need to be sure that the keys we use in our map are carefully constructed to always compare correctly with the stronger .equals semantics.</p>



<p>Lastly, using a defrecord (CacheKey) appears to offer the worst performance. Let’s use some lightweight profiling to understand what is going on here, by comparing records vs vectors as keys:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>k <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span><br>

Map lookup using a vector tuple as the key.</figcaption></figure>



<p>From our profiling, the map equality used by the CacheKey record looks suspicious. We can confirm its performance is much worse than vector equals:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>ka <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span> kb <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><br>

<span>;; Execution time mean : 11.376671 ns</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>The performance overhead we’ve discussed here is minimal for map lookups of singular values like keywords; we are generally okay to stick to Clojure datatypes for data entities where these key types are idiomatic. Still, using records (defrecord) for data entities can have a significant twofactor impact on key lookups:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>k <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>:<span>a</span> k<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : &nbsp;5.638519 ns</span><br>
&nbsp; <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>k <span>{</span>:<span>a</span> <span>"a"</span> :<span>b</span> <span>"b"</span><span>}</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>:<span>a</span> k<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 10.495481 ns</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>To make a broader generalization to wrap up this section, the JDK ecosystem at large has battled-hardened collection and data structure offerings for high performance use cases and Clojure’s Java interop (with type hints!) gives us access to any of these that make sense for our code hot spots.</p>



<h2 id="dynamic-vars">Dynamic Vars vs. ThreadLocal</h2>



<p>Another occasional need is for a per-thread state mechanism. Clojure has dynamic vars and binding, but the Clojure implementation of reading a dynamic var is far less optimal than using a ThreadLocal directly:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br></p></td><td><div><p><span>(</span><span>def</span> <span>^</span>:<span>dynamic</span> <span>*</span>dyna<span>-</span>state<span>*</span> nil<span>)</span><br>

        <p>When developing a website, the web security part of the site is often forgotten or not the most crucial consideration. But in today’s society where everyone is on the internet surfing and sharing their personal information everywhere. Web security should be considered the number one priority.</p>
<p>To make a more secure web a list of the most common web vulnerbiliteis exsists. The Open Web Application Security Project helps you discover vulnerabilities and preventing them.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-open-web-application-security-project">What is The Open Web Application Security Project</h2>
<p>In September 2001, Mark Curphey started a non-profit organisation called The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), OWASP was a spin-off of the “webappsec” mailing list (Huseby, 2004). OWASP goal was to document and share knowledge and tools on web application security to help developers secure their web application against common security flaws. OWASP’s core values are to be open, innovative, global and have Integrity in the community (OWASP, n.d. B). All of the content from OWASP is freely and easily accessible from the OWASP website(OWASP, n.d. B).</p>
<p>OWASP provides many types of tools for testing the security of web applications, for example, OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP). ZAP is an open-source project that can help to find security vulnerabilities automatically. OWASP also provides lists of the top security vulnerabilities that exist on the web, the most known List from OWASP is the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks. They also provide a Top 10 API vulnerabilities list.</p>
<p>OWASP top 10 Web Application Security Risks is a list of the top 10 security concerns that is a common threat to web applications in the last few years (Cloudflare, n.d. A). This report is updated by a team of security expert from all over the world every few years (Cloudflare, n.d. A). OWASP claims on their site that implementing the OWASP top 10 is the most effective step toward changing the development culture in an organisation to produce more secure code (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p><strong>This OWASP list is from the top 10 from 2017</strong></p>

<p>Stuttard (2011) claims in his book “The web application hacker’s handbook” that every web site he have tested between 2007 and 2011 was vulnerable to some of these. As high as 94% was susceptible to XSS, 78% had Sensitive Data Exposure, 62% had broken authentication, and 32% was vulnerable to SQL injection.</p>
<h3 id="1-injectionhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a1-injectionhtml">1. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection.html">Injection</a></h3>
<p>Injection vulnerability is the number one biggest problem on the web; injection is when untrusted data is sent via a form or other data submission, and then this data goes to a code interpreter. The most know injection form is SQL injection, SQL injection happens when someone sends specially crafted data to a format that expects a plaintext string to send through a SQL quarry to evaluate to return the desired data (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>To prevent Injection attacks, all input on a site must be validating the input and rejecting suspicious data and then sanitisation of the data by cleaning it for symbols that could potentially lead to injections (Cloudflare, n.d. A).</p>
<h3 id="2-broken-authenticationhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a2-broken_authentication">2. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication">Broken Authentication</a></h3>
<p>Login and authentication system that is implemented incorrectly could potentially have critical vulnerabilities that make it possible to gain access to someone else’s account and potentially compromise the whole system via an admin account (OWASP, n.d. A). Some example of broken authentication could be credential stuffing attack which means automatic injecting username/password pairs from earlier web site breaches (OWASP, n.d. C). The username/password pair list is then automatically entered into the site to check if one hacked account from another site is the same on other websites.</p>
<p>To reduce the attack factor for authentication vulnerabilities, a 2-factor authenticator should be implemented as it limits the ways that an attacker could access the system (Cloudflare, n.d. A). The authentication system should also be limited to how many times someone can try to login with the use of rate-limiting.</p>
<h3 id="3-sensitive-data-exposurehttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a3-sensitive_data_exposure">3. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure">Sensitive Data Exposure</a></h3>
<p>A web application that exposes sensitive information either via not adequately protected API’s and websites. The data can be stolen either by just being exposed without proper authentication or via a man in the middle attack (MITM). MITM is when someone is listening in on the traffic that is exchanged via a client and a server (Cloudflare, n.d. B).</p>
<p>To minimise the data exposure, all data that contains sensitive information must be encrypted both when the data is in rest and when in transit, and the web application should only store essential sensitive data.</p>
<h3 id="4-xml-external-entities-xeehttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a4-xml_external_entities_xxe">4. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A4-XML_External_Entities_(XXE)">XML External Entities (XEE)</a></h3>
<p>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a human and machine-readable markup language. The XML is processed by an XML parser if the parser is poorly configured, the input can reference external entities like a file URI and then sending the data to an attacker.</p>
<p>Due to the complexity and many security vulnerabilities that exist in XML parsers, XML should be phased out with a more straightforward data format or patch the XML parser and turn off the external entities.</p>
<h3 id="5-broken-access-controlhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a5-broken_access_control">5. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control">Broken Access Control</a></h3>
<p>An access control system should enforce what a user is allowed to do on a system, when this is not adequately enforced, or the system is broken, users can have access to data and functions that they should not be able to access (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>Broken Access Control can be secured by using Authorisation tokens on the web application (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Authorisation tokens is a token that is sent with each request to check that the request comes from the right person. The token should be checked for each request for what it is allowed to do.</p>
<h3 id="6-security-misconfigurationhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a6-security_misconfiguration">6. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A6-Security_Misconfiguration">Security Misconfiguration</a></h3>
<p>Misconfiguration is when a system is not configured correctly, incomplete or by using default configuration that leads to displaying verbose error messages, that can contain sensitive data either about users or about the system which could lead to revealing vulnerabilities in the application (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>Misconfiguration can be mitigated by removing unused code from the code base and make the configuration less complicated and also check that the production code is not giving out debug messages and making error messages more general (Cloudflare, n.d. A).</p>
<h3 id="7-cross-site-scripting-xsshttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a7-cross-site_scripting_xss">7. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A7-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)">Cross-site Scripting (XSS)</a></h3>
<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) occurs when untrusted data is displayed on a webpage without the data being properly validated and sanitised (OWASP, n.d. A). XSS can occur when an input filed without proper validation and sanitising is saved and then return to the site again, like a comment on a forum. XSS can create HTML object on the site and even run untrusted JavaScript code in the client browser, which can lead to session hijacking, defacing the site or redirect the user to a malicious site which looks like the original site.</p>
<p>Like Injection, XSS vulnerabilities can be mitigated by validating and sanitise every input fields that users can write content (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Every HTTP request also needs to escape all data that is sent via URLs. Modern web development frameworks often provide build-in cross-site scripting protection (Cloudflare, n.d. A).</p>
<h3 id="8-insecure-deserialisationhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a8-insecure_deserialization">8. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A8-Insecure_Deserialization">Insecure Deserialisation</a></h3>
<p>Serialisation is a concept of taking one object and turning it into a format that is more fitting to other tasks, like storing it on disk or in a database or for sending the data over a network (OWASP, n.d. A). Deserialisation is when a serialised object is converted back to its original form that can be easier for software to work with (OWASP, n.d. A). When deserialisation is not done correctly, it can lead to remote code execution, replay attacks, injection attacks and even privilege escalation attacks.</p>
<p>Deserialisation vulnerabilities are not easy to mitigate. However, there are some ways of preventing it from happening, like implementing strong type checking and monitoring the deserialisation process (Cloudflare, n.d. A). However, the only way to be sure that it is not exploited is to not deserialisation untrusted data streams.</p>
<h3 id="9-using-components-with-known-vulnerabilitieshttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a9-using_components_with_known_vulnerabilities">9. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities">Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities</a></h3>
<p>Modern Web applications today are not coded 100% at the company, external components and libraries are often used to make the process faster to build as it helps the developer reduce to code needed to be written (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Some example libraries are the widely used front-end framework like Angular.js and Vue.js or backend frameworks like express.js. Thousands of websites are built on top of these frameworks, and often have multiple different types of libraries. If a vulnerability is found in a library that is popular potentially, several hundred thousand webpages are vulnerable to exploit (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>Update all library often with the latest security fixes and stay up-to-date on what libraries that have vulnerabilities in them (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Go over the web application often and reconsider every single library used and remove libraries that are not used or not actively maintained.</p>
<h3 id="10-insufficient-logging-and-monitoringhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a10-insufficient_logging252526monitoring">10. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A10-Insufficient_Logging%252526Monitoring">Insufficient Logging and Monitoring</a></h3>
<p>A data breach on average take up to 200 days from the attack happened to it get discovered (Cloudflare, n.d. A), which gives an attacker a lot of time to find the data they want and take over other systems on the network. When it is discovered the logs can be erased or not be complete enough even to investigate what happened.</p>
<p>Logs need to be stored multiple places, and on remote servers, the logging service needs to be an append-only database mode so no one can overwrite the logs that exist (Cloudflare, n.d. A),. There should be integrity control on every record that is written, so no log files can be tampered with. Every action taken on the site needs to be logged, access …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<!-- Horizontal Top Article -->
<p>GPT-3 has become famous overnight through viral posts on social networks. Between hype and anxiety, what exactly is GPT-3? <strong>Why this AI surprised so many devs in particular?</strong> Is this game changer?</p>



<h3>For science</h3>



<p>Today, we will discuss artificial intelligence. And I know that this subject tends to piss off a lot of people very quickly. Especially developers. Y<strong>et, for now, AI is just a tool like any other.</strong></p>



<p>I’m not going to explain what AI is or how a model works. We will only talk about what unleashes passions, <strong>generator of hype or anxiety attack depending on the point of view</strong>, GPT-3!</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kLrSCZK.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/kLrSCZK.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>The company behind this technology is <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI</a>. OpenAI is famous for three main reasons.</p>



<p><strong>The first is that one of the founders is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elon Musk</a>.</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/27/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-ai-biggest-existential-threat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The person who is the most afraid of artificial intelligence in the world</a>. The other founder is <a href="https://twitter.com/sama" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Altman</a> who we will talk about later.</p>



<p><strong>The second is the reason why this company exists.</strong> The goal of OpenAI is to develop artificial intelligence in a safe and sustainable way for human beings. Musk is convinced that uncontrolled AI will cause the end of humanity, so OpenIA promote a safe way to control it.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="OpenAI - Non-profit AI company by Elon Musk and Sam Altman" width="940" height="529" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AbcRlDBnwjM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>The third is that OpenAI is frequently in the news with these impressive repeated successes in its field.</strong> Notably the former <a href="https://openai.com/blog/language-unsupervised/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPT</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPT2</a> models. The last one being our hot topic of the day.</p>



<h3>What’s GPT-3</h3>



<p><strong>Generative Pretrained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">language model</a> that uses deep learning (neural network) to produce text. </strong>For the uninitiated, I’m embarking on a highly simplified explanation that will make specialists cry blood.</p>



<p>The principle of a language model is to look at one part of a sentence and predict the next word. <strong>GPT-3 is a technology that has been trained on a SCANDALOUS amount of text written by humans</strong>. Nearly a <strong><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/05/29/openai-debuts-gigantic-gpt-3-language-model-with-175-billion-parameters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TRILLION</a></strong> words via <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common crawl</a>. Based on this small sample, it generates text (output) that makes the most sense for an input.</p>



<p>Concretely,<strong> by learning to predict which letters and words tend to follow each other when written by a human</strong>, GPT-3 is able to predict text that makes sense in a context. It’s the same concept as your cell phone predicting the next word when you write a message. Except that it’s infinitely bigger, more complicated and more advanced.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xwi5mbF.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/xwi5mbF.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>And so far, GPT-3 is not bringing much new. The architecture of this technology (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-chaturangarajapakshe-text-classification-with-transformer-models-d370944b50ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transformer-based</a>) is the same as the previous version (GPT-2). <strong>This architecture is almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3 years old</a>.</strong> So what is so special about GPT-3?</p>



<h3>Huge</h3>



<p>GPT-3 is absolutely gigantic! GPT-2 was already huge with no less than 1.5 billion parameters. The previous record was held by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turing-NLG of microsoft</a> with these 17 billion parameters. <strong>GPT-3 explodes all records with an indecent 175 billion parameters!</strong> Never seen before.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And the aftermath of this is impressive results. GPT-3 is capable of far too much.</p>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#william-shakespeare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write poems</a></strong> in the style of certain authors</li><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/OthersideAI/status/1285776335638614017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write your emails</a></strong> with your own style</li><li><strong><a href="https://maraoz.com/2020/07/18/openai-gpt3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write blog posts about himself</a></strong></li><li>write <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>number one blog posts on hacker news</strong></a></li><li>write<strong> <a href="https://jamesyu.org/singular/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whole fictions</a></strong>, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many fictions</a></li><li>even <a href="https://play.aidungeon.io/main/landing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>infinite interactive fiction games</strong></a></li><li>design <a href="https://twitter.com/jsngr/status/1284511080715362304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>simple applications</strong></a></li><li>the list is endless and it’s getting longer every day… if you want to scare yourself, here’s <a href="https://gpt3examples.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>a website that groups them together</strong></a>.<br></li></ul>



<div><p>And GPT-3 is capable of something else that immediately worried developers. <strong>GPT-3 is capable of producing code.</strong> Do you want a todo list application in ReactJS instantly? Just ask for it.</p></div>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I built a todo list app simply by describing it to GPT-3.</p><p>It generated the React code for a fully functioning app within seconds.</p><p>I'm becoming more impressed and aware of its capabilities every single day. <a href="https://t.co/QGrClar03s">pic.twitter.com/QGrClar03s</a></p></div>— Sharif Shameem (@sharifshameem) <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1284421499915403264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dat-tran-a1602320_wow-sharif-shameem-created-a-gpt-3-code-generator-activity-6689448377245147136-H_0c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">She can produce code</a> but also <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1285789362647478272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read and interpret it</a>. <strong>She can do this in <a href="https://twitter.com/josephbrionesaz/status/1283097878223675392?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any language</a>.</strong> Some SQL to do ? <a href="https://twitter.com/FaraazNishtar/status/1285934622891667457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">No problem</a>.

Even 3D in Javascript <a href="https://twitter.com/Antonio_GomezM/status/1287969287110443008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can be done</a>. In short,  some easy developer tasks can now be automated by GPT-3.</p>



<p>Of course, with all this exploding at the same time on the Internet, many have asked themselves the question of <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/will-gpt-3-kill-coding-630e4518c04d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the future of developers</a>. <strong>For some <a href="https://kitze.io/posts/gpt3-is-the-beginning-of-the-end" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s the beginning of the end</a>.</strong></p>



<p>As I write this, <strong><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/gpt-3-is-an-amazing-research-tool-openai-isnt-sharing-the-code-d048ba39bbfd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI refuses to give away the source code despite its goal of transparency</a></strong>. The official reason? This technology is too big and greedy for people to run it themselves. They put it behind <a href="https://beta.openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a paywall</a> that allows OpenAI to monetize its research.</p>



<p>Two months after the first appearance of GPT-3, most people agree on one thing. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2020/07/19/gpt-3-is-amazingand-overhyped/#36405ce81b1c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>GPT-3 is as superb as overrated.</strong></a> And this is especially true for developers.</p>



<h3>Overhyped</h3>



<p>GPT-3 is super impressive. It’s a great tool to do a lot of things. <strong>But the important thing to understand is that <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/22/1007539/gpt3-openai-language-generator-artificial-intelligence-ai-opinion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPT-3 doesn’t understand anything it produces</a></strong>. It makes a mathematical prediction that certain letters should appear in a certain order.</p>



<p><strong>A developer’s job is infinitely more complicated.</strong> Developing a complete application that meets a human need requires a lot of thought. No algorithm has the ability to think about problems the way humans do. No thinking, no reasoning ability, no nothing…</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZVSbJQuPouw/maxresdefault.jpg" data-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZVSbJQuPouw/maxresdefault.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>Going further in the reflection we realize that <strong>GPT-3 is simply a new tool for developers</strong>. It is almost a new language where the interface would be directly explanations of what needs to be done instead of code.</p>



<p>And it’s quite relevant to compare the instructions given in GPT-3 to code. <strong>GPT-3 doesn’t understand vague requirements.</strong> GPT-3 needs very precise, surgical instructions, or it will produce crap. Where a human being will translate, correct and arrange vague requirements, GPT-3 will just produce crap. Or produce nothing at all.</p>



<p>GPT-3 is the largest look-up table ever created. Superintelligence is another story. It’s anything but today, and Sam Altam, the second founder of OpenAI, says so himself.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The GPT-3 hype is way too much. It’s impressive (thanks for the nice compliments!) but it still has serious weaknesses and sometimes makes very silly mistakes. AI is going to change the world, but GPT-3 is just a very early glimpse. We have a lot still to figure out.</p>— Sam Altman (@sama) <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1284922296348454913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>And all this, not to mention the many limitations and nonsense that GPT-3 produces every day. So right now, developer are safe. </p>



<h3>What about tomorrow?</h3>



<p>Last year, I posted this article on <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/quel-avenir-pour-les-developpeureuses-informatiques/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the future of developers</a> (french version). I’m talking about no-code, low-code, quantum computing and many other nice things. <strong>I made the crazy prediction that in 30 years (that’s a lot) the machine will start to nibble away at some parts of our work.</strong> No replacement, just a nibbling of certain tasks, or even certain parts.</p>



<p>I had been crucified. Insults by email and on Twitter, unsubscribing and disappointment. I left the comments section as is (as always), it’s a beauty.</p>



<p>A year later, GPT-3 makes its appearance and proves that some very simple developer tasks can already be delegated to the machine.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i7j0QCj.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/i7j0QCj.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>GPT-3 can’t do anything against the job of developer. <strong>But this technology raises <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/openais-gpt-3-the-end-of-cargo-cult-programmers-23102f70f855" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the skill bar for becoming a developer very slightly</a>.</strong> To do what the machine can’t do on its own.</p>



<p>And if this bar is already rising today, where will it be in 30 years? I’m the first to find the speeches that demonize current IAs ridiculous. But the speeches that talk about an AI as stupid as its feet for eternity seem very naive to me. <strong>Where will be the skill bar needed to beat the machine in 30 years?</strong></p>



<p>I am also well aware that the way we make artificial intelligence today is <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/openais-gigantic-gpt-3-hints-at-the-limits-of-language-models-for-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaching a ceiling</a>. <strong>It would take a new and innovative way of doing artificial intelligence to make sense of my concerns.</strong> How can we be sure that these new ways of doing things will not emerge in the future?</p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>For now, the future of programming is programming. Artificial intelligence continues its path, but as long as it doesn’t understand what it does, it’s going to be fine. You just have to put up with the fact that it is capable of more and more destabilizing things. How can you be sure that the article you just read is not written by an artificial intelligence?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>From time to time newly graduated hackers ask me: <em>“Do you have any advice for beginning my career?”</em></p><p>I’ve found myself repeating 3 principles over and over again. On reflection, I realized these principles apply more broadly. I <em>think</em> they might answer the question <em>“Do you have any advice on for beginning my life as an adult?”</em></p><p>I thought I’d share these ideas with you here. The style and the examples I wrote are career-oriented, but I think the core ideas will still help in your decision making. I hope you enjoy them : ).</p><p><em>What should you do?</em> is one of the hardest questions to answer when you start out.</p><p>The default path is to follow what’s popular or prestigious. That can lead to a bunch of problems: What’s prestigious is already highly competitive. When you compete with smart people in a game that has established rules, just keeping up will take most of your time. That leaves little time to explore what interests you. When you don’t explore what interests you, you won’t understand things as deeply, and that leaves you with an undifferentiated skillset.</p><p><strong>The solution here is to follow your taste.</strong> Popularity and prestige are lagging indicators. Your taste, especially as a young, curious person, is a signal for <em>what will be</em> popular in the future. Regardless though, when you follow you taste, you’ll find yourself much more interested in the problems you’re solving. When you’re interested in the problems you’re solving, you’ll discover deeper truths, build deeper expertise, a differentiated skillset, and have more fun along the way.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering: <strong>What if you don’t even know what you’re interested in?</strong></p><p>Don’t worry. You just need to tune into and strengthen your taste. To do that, just do <em>anything</em>. Once you do <em>anything</em>, ask yourself, what part of that thing do you  find interesting?</p><p>Start going deeper there, and all of a sudden, you’ll discover a wealth of interests.</p><p>Next up, you may be wondering: <strong>What if your interests keep changing?</strong></p><p>Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. Just follow it. You’ll be surprised how things will serve you down the road. As long as you’re working hard and you’re learning, it’s a good use of time.</p><p>You may also wonder: <strong>What if your interests <em>are</em> what’s popular and prestigious today?</strong></p><p>That’s great. Follow that, but instead of competing, start sensing what actually interests you in that field and go deeper.</p><p>The ideas may seem career oriented, so you may be wondering: <strong>What if I just want to travel and explore the world?</strong></p><p>That’s great too! It’s your taste, telling you that you want to travel. Follow it and see where it leads you.</p><p>As you discover your interests, you may find that they’re not necessarily popular. Yet, when you go deeper and do your thing, something magical will happen…which leads us into the second principle:</p><p>As you explore and follow your taste, you’ll discover a subset of people who share your core interests and values.</p><p>Nurture those relationships. Some of these people will be your friends for life. Many of those people will become very successful in the future.</p><p>The people you know will show you what’s possible and work alongside you in deepening, exploring, and innovating on your shared interests.</p><p>You may be wondering: <em>what if you live in the middle of nowhere, and there aren’t people who get you?</em> Do your best to go to the center of wherever your community is. That may be SF for hackers or Los Angeles for entertainers or Paris for artists, the list goes on. You know where it is for you.</p><p>Now, this may sound impractical to you, but you’ll be surprised with what you can do. You can start off online in the meantime.</p><p>One common pitfall here is <em>focusing only on successful people in your field.</em> This misses the point. Sure, reach out to those successful people, but remember that the young, curious, interested people right next you, <em>will become those successful people in the future.</em> You have tons of time to spend together, so it’s great way to deepen your relationships. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t reach out to successful people (you definitely should), but to remove “success” as a criteria altogether for choosing who you spend your time with.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering, <em>how do you deepen those relationships?</em> That leads to us to the third principle:</p><p>As you form your community, new ideas and ways to collaborate will spring up. Take those opportunities: work together, support each-other and play. Over time, which you have a lot of right now, you will form a tight tribe of friends.</p><p>As a happy side effect, you’ll become exposed to new fields, new technologies, interesting problems, and interesting opportunities. Start taking them, and you’re well on your way to a career that’s <em>made for you.</em></p><p>One common issue here is a lack of self belief. This may lead you into choosing what you think “you are capable of”, rather than what you’re interested in. One way to get around this is to just experiment: let yourself dream and work with your friends, even if the problems seem fantastically hard.</p><p>There are a lot of examples I can give you if you’re interested in what I’m interesting in: From <a href="https://m.stopa.io/my-favorite-books-11e6b5a3ac0a" target="_blank">my favorite books</a> to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html" target="_blank">Paul Graham’s essays</a> to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paradigms-Artificial-Intelligence-Programming-Studies/dp/1558601910" target="_blank">Norvig’s Paradgims of AI programming</a>, to <a href="https://m.stopa.io/favorite-rich-hickey-talks-6bcb23da6ff2" target="_blank">Rich Hickey talks</a>. But, instead I encourage you to think: <em>what interests you right now?</em></p><p>If you’re up for it, I’d love to know your answer: <strong><em>what interests you right now?</em></strong> Feel free to leave your answer in the comments or to email me directly, I’d be curious to hear : )</p><p>There’s a slew of people who have influenced and mentored me. These ideas are just as much them as me.</p><p>On the idea of taste specifically, the big shoutout has to go to Paul Graham. A lot of my thinking about this was inspired by reading his essays over and over when I started out. I highly suggest reading them.</p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Woelfel, Talha Baig, Martin Raison, Irakli Safareli, David Magaltadze, Joe Averbukh, Julien Odent, for reviewing this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

Hey everyone,</p>

<p>It's long overdue for Twitter to add an edit button. It's really not that hard.</p>

<p>Help us put this billboard next to Twitter HQ so we can get the 2 days of
<br>engineering work that's required prioritized.</p>

<p>If we raise more than the $2,590 goal, we'll get a bigger billboard.</p>

<p>I heard they use Rails, so I went ahead and wrote the code for them:

<p>There, now just copy and paste!</p>

<p>With â�¤ï¸�,</p>

<p>The internet.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I like my two big hi-res monitors. I love my keyboard and my mouse. And I connect them to my stationary
“main” PC and to several other Windows and Mac laptops, alternatively. I’d like to easily switch where these peripheral
devices are connected to, and that’s the traditional role of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch">KVM switch</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, KVM switches that support 4K/60hz resolutions cost hundreds of dollars, there are
no KVM switches that support USB-C, and I couldn’t find KVM switches that support multiple high-res monitors
either.</p><p>So I decided to implement a mixed hardware/software solution: my monitors (all monitors today really) have more
than one input, so I can connect all my computers simultaneously. The idea is:</p><ul><li>Switch USB devices in hardware.</li><li>Detect this switch in software, and switch monitors inputs as needed.</li></ul><p>To switch USB devices, I ordered <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01N6GD9JO">this USB 3.0 two-computer switch</a> from Amazon,
that’s $38 Canadian, under $30 USD.</p><p>To automatically switch monitor inputs, I <a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch">wrote some software</a>.</p><p>My plan was:</p><ul><li>Watch for USB device connections/disconnections.</li><li>When a configured device is connected, use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel#DDC/CI">DDC/CI</a> to
send a command to all connected monitors to switch inputs.</li><li>In case the power management turned the video output off, turn it on again (otherwise the monitors will auto-switch
back to the input that actually supplies video output).</li></ul><p>I needed this to happen on Windows and on a Mac, and mature cross-platform support for USB low-level
control and hot plug, DDC/CI and monitor power management is non-existent. I ended up implementing this two
times: <a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch/tree/master/MacOS">once in Swift</a>, for MacOS, and the
<a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch/tree/master/Windows">second time in Rust</a>, for Windows.</p><p>Amazingly enough, this works really well: when I press the button on the USB switch, monitor input is changed
instantaneously, it feels like a “real” KVM switch! 🎉</p></div></div>]]>

<p>We create a 5-rule parser to efficiently and accurately parse affirmative present tense sentences in Japanese.  With just 5 rules you can understand Japanese grammar deeply.</p>



<h2>Deconstructing Japanese</h2>



<p>Linguistics is often unnecessarily complicated.  “Why state concisely with one term when there are 300 different varieties for these intimates and particulars?!”  Simplicity speaks volumes and good teachers teach simple concepts that help unify greater features easily.</p>



<p>To that end, let’s see if we can produce Japanese with an EBNF grammar.</p>



<p>For this we will be using <a href="https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse">an excellent functional library for clojure called Instaparse</a>.  </p>



<p><a href="http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-LxnE95QbDy2LZ_m5XAZ/v1">You can see a <em>live</em> <em>demo</em> of Instaparse online with this grammar here.</a></p>



<p>Update: 2020-1-8: A fully recursive parser can be found here <a href="http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-Ly5y7xvJoDkHhIs0UKD/v1">http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-Ly5y7xvJoDkHhIs0UKD/v1</a></p>



<h2>What’s an EBNF grammar?</h2>



<p>It’s like a regular expression for sentences.  “Extended Backus-Naur Form.” If you’re familiar, skip ahead.  If not…<br><a href="https://condor.depaul.edu/ichu/csc447/notes/wk3/BNF.pdf">Here’s a useful slideshow.</a>  The wikipedia article is not for the uninitiated, but <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/grammars-bnf-ebnf/">this article</a> is a bit clearer if you are new to this way of representing grammars.       EBNF is from the realm of “Context-Free Grammars” and is mainly used in computing.  Given that it is definitely about grammar and syntax, EBNF proves very useful in language analysis and generation.  You make rules for breaking down sequences of characters (sentences) into labeled output chunks (parse tree).</p>



<h2>Is it possible to parse Japanese with EBNF?</h2>



<p>Can we make any real headway using <em>computer syntax</em> to decipher human language?  English seems impossible for native language speakers to parse at times.  Is it really possible to parse Japanese with EBNF and label parts of speech accurately?</p>



<h3>はい！ Yes!</h3>



<p>Yes!  However, for <strong>real</strong> Japanese from the wild there would need to be many many rules, and any slight deviations from the rules would not result in a full parse.  So, rather than try and build our own google translate today, why don’t we just try to cover the maximum amount of Japanese with the minimum amount of rules.</p>

<h2>Rules for an EBNF Japanese Grammar</h2>



<p>Japanese has nouns, verbs, particles, and sentence-final-fitters.  That’s it. *  <strong>With 5 concepts we can cover the whole Japanese grammar.</strong>  Amazing.  Japanese is regular enough that its composition can be described in a handful of rules.</p>



<ol><li>A sentence is made of zero or more Bunsetsu-Jars and a Sentence-Final-Fitter. <br><strong>S = JAR* SFF</strong></li><li>A Bunsetsu-Jar is made of zero or more Modifiers, and must have a noun and a particle. <br><strong>JAR = M* noun-no P |  JAR* noun-no no</strong> <p><em>[UPDATE 2020-1-8: fully recursive with extension of rule 2]</em></p></li><li>Particles can be any of the Japanese grammar particles that describe the role of their preceding word in a sentence: が、を、と、で、に、etc。 <br><strong>P = が | を | と | で | に …</strong></li><li>Sentence-Final-Fitters have only 4 options and can be either nouns with the Copula だ (da), or simply verbs with u, or verbs with i.<br><strong>SFF = noun-no だ。 | noun-na だ。 | verb-u。 | verb-i。<br></strong>(sentence-final period included in this rule)</li><li>Modifiers can be nouns  with their relevant letter (“no” or “na”), or simply verb-u or verb-i.<br><strong>M = noun-no の | noun-na な | verb-u | verb-i</strong></li></ol>



<p>With just 5 main rules we can parse all of Japanese.  That’s exciting!  Granted, this is not negation or past tense, just present affirmative, but with small extensions those advancements are accommodatable. </p>

<p>Notice Japanese has no spaces, all parsing relies on accurate detection of symbol in sequence.  ImagineifEnglishhadnospaceswoulditbehardtoread?</p>



<h2><strong>Recursion Update 2020-1-8</strong></h2>



<p>By extending Rule 2 (JAR = … ) to include JAR*, we achieve full recursion on Japanese terms using の [no]</p>

<h2>Death to Adjectives</h2>



<p>Japanese has nouns that take な [na] and nouns that take の [no] when they are used as modifiers.  </p>



<p>Japanese also has verbs that end with an う [u = oo as in “food”] sound and verbs that end with an い [i = ee as in “week”] sound.</p>



<p>Bringing “adjectives” into the mix just gets things really dirty and offers no benefit to the learner.  Stick with 2 kinds of verb and 2 kinds of noun and Japanese will be easy to master.</p>

<h2>Parsing Improves Comprehension</h2>



<p>Important in language learning are the exercises that parse written language correctly.  Learning how the written language is parsed can help one’s mental model, and this will lend to stronger audible comprehension thanks to a deeper understanding of the underlying structure.</p>

<p>*When we say “that’s it,” we are putting words like おいしい into the verb-i column, and words like げんきな into the noun-na column.  Simplifying into two categories, nouns and verbs, actually proves immensely useful and practical in Japanese.  It’s a simplification that should be in all the textbooks and literature.  Congrats 2020.</p>

    <p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/enterprise_say_no/sorry-dave.jpg" alt="Sorry Dave">
Nobody likes being told “No”</p>

<p>To sell your product to enterprise buyers, minimize the times when you need to say “No” during the sales cycle.</p>

<p>Enterprise software purchasing is a complex process with potentially innumerable stakeholders and procedural hurdles to cross. Even if you have a badass product that will perfectly fit your customer’s needs, you still need to wade through a complex buying process.</p>

<p>The decision to buy a product like Netflix is simple: I want to watch a once-in-a-generation classic like “<a href="https://bestlifeonline.com/selling-sunset/">Selling Sunset</a>,” so I pay for Netflix to stream it into my greedy eyeballs. As an individual, I make the purchasing decision and enjoy the rewards alone (thankfully).</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/enterprise_say_no/sunset.jpeg" alt="Selling Sunset">
I actually think that most of the characters on this show would be absolutely lethal at selling enterprise software</p>

<p>Contrast this to a buyer like the US Air Force deciding to use Slack – even just calculating the number of users that they’ll have is a non-trivial task, and that’s for a relatively straightforward, consumer-friendly SaaS product. Transformational changes – say, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/jedi-10-billion-department-of-defense-bidding/">moving to the cloud</a> – can be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/microsoft-and-aws-exchange-poisoned-pen-blog-posts-in-latest-pentagon-jedi-contract-spat/">exponentially more complex</a>. The number of stakeholder approvals and compliance hurdles that must be vanquished on the way to this sort of purchase boggles the mind, but this is exactly where you make your bones as an enterprise SaaS business.</p>

<h2 id="detractors-want-you-to-say-no">Detractors Want You to Say “No”</h2>

<p>Innumerable potential blockers can arise during a sales cycle: you’ll have to say “No” to a particular use-case provided by the product that you’ll be replacing, or explain why you lack a feature that a buyer was expecting from a previous job. In most cases these gaps are unimportant… but these blockers can really throw a wrench into the sales process.</p>

<p>Adversaries who oppose a new software vendor will latch onto any time when you don’t say “Yes” like a lamprey – poking holes in the case to buy your product. Blocking stakeholders are typically incentivized to either preserve the status quo or explicitly harm your case, and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Teams who are incentivized to minimize risk, such as Compliance, Legal, IT, and (in some cases) Security.</li>
  <li>Teams who are frequently blamed if a poor buying decision is made, such as Procurement. Some companies also just have risk-averse, blame-heavy cultures in general.</li>
  <li>Champions of incumbent solutions – for example, an executive who originally purchased the product that you’re replacing.</li>
  <li>People who don’t want to do the work of changing to a new vendor.</li>
  <li>Competitors.</li>
  <li>(Rarely, but occasionally) people who are just nihilistic or obstructionist jerks.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the biggest enemies when selling to a complex organization is <strong>time</strong>. Buyers get discouraged if it’s taking too long to sign a new vendor, and there’s often a small window when a company is ready for change and the stars have aligned for them to drop some serious coin for it. Detractors will latch onto any “Nos” that they hear and use it to delay or kill a sales cycle. This is especially common when replacing a strong incumbent – you had better believe that Oracle knows every trick in the book to make it seem that your product is untrustworthy or incomplete.</p>

<p>In order to overcome this, allow your sales team to say “Yes” as often as possible. The client is worried about some niche use-case? We have a partner who will make it happen. The client wants a particular security feature? We can make sure that the particular risk the Security team flagged will be handled. The client needs to format their data <em>just right</em> for board meetings? With a little bit of elbow grease on the customer’s part, we can support it.</p>

<p>Ways to say Yes more:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make your product as flexible as possible - eg make everything programmable via API or expose webhook callbacks for all major business actions. This helps customers, consultants, or your implementation teams extend your product’s capabilities for use-cases that are unique to them, which you’ll never directly build yourself.</li>
  <li>Identify major gaps that will be a pain to build for, and find quality partners who can fill in these capabilities. Similar to the above, this allows you to cover niche functionality that only a few customers will need.</li>
  <li>Make it easy to transfer raw data into or out of your platform. For example, virtually every enterprise product requires some amount of internal executive level reporting, which is typically both critical and highly team-specific. By furnishing raw data exports you can check the box of helping to provide these reports. Being able to ingest or output large volumes of data also helps check the box of whether it’ll be easy to migrate to your product.</li>
  <li>Building common no-regrets enterprise features. For example, the areas of governance (SAML, RBAC), security (password controls, 2FA, internal endpoint protection), compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA), and audit logs are all areas where it’s easy to have a gap that will scare the shit out of a conservative buyer. By building for lots of use-cases in this area, you can ensure that you won’t get ruled out for missing features that are peripheral to your core value proposition.</li>
  <li>Find the right customers. If you’re constantly finding yourself saying No during the sales cycle, you’re probably selling to the wrong folks. This is common for early-stage startups or when your sales &amp; marketing teams aren’t generating enough pipeline (forcing you to sell to weak leads). Having a very strong perspective on why your product is special, and who it’s special for, can help you to avoid this trap. So can having discipline – you’re often better off doubling down on making your core customer deliriously happy than stretching for a flashy new logo.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the strongest form of #1 and #2 is turning yourself into a platform that others can build on top of.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-salesforce">Case Study: Salesforce</h2>

<p>Salesforce has a <em>decent</em> product. It’s by far the dominant player in the CRM industry, but it’s hardly a loveable product like (say) Zoom, Uber, Datadog, the iPhone, or even Excel. However, Salesforce has used this product to become the #1 in their industry, in part because their team can sell the hell out of it.</p>

<p>If you look at Salesforce, you’ll see that they use all of the techniques described above to ensure that they always have a story for how they can deliver, even if it requires extra integration work. Combined with their ferocious marketing, it’s little surprise that they’re approaching a $200B market cap as of this writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They’re well instrumented with open APIs, and use ampscript to build custom functionality.</li>
  <li>They have an app marketplace built on these APIs that’s filled with niche solutions, creating a platform ecosystem, and will also acquire companies to fill product holes.</li>
  <li>They have a robust set of reporting and data import/export functionality, allowing complex organizations to onboard rapidly with services (if necessary).</li>
  <li>Salesforce has a metric ton of enterprise features, and also aggressively moves to support new platform expansions that enterprises might want, such as migrating to Microsoft Azure for their hosting.</li>
  <li>Salesforce’s target customer is well-defined and obvious – it’s literally in the name.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="case-study-slack">Case Study: Slack</h2>

<p>Slack got its start by selling to smaller organizations and startups, but has since extended their reach into the enterprise. As time has gone on and they’ve begun to see real competitors, they’ve used all of the this post’s enterprise sales tactics to continue to move up-market:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They have a web of Slash <code>/commands</code>, webhooks, and APIs that allow for easy integration.</li>
  <li>They used these tools to build a successful app marketplace, completing the platform strategy.</li>
  <li>They once made it dead simple <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/360001851047-FAQs-about-migrating-from-Atlassian-to-Slack">to migrate from their once-largest competitor, Hipchat</a> (they’ve since killed Hipchat in their sleep like Washington crossing the Delaware). <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/migrate-slack-to-teams">They still provide this for Microsoft Teams</a>.</li>
  <li>Slack is now packed with enterprise-grade security and compliance features.</li>
  <li>As a horizontal SaaS product, Slack is a good fit for many organizations and relatively unlikely to find a particularly bad-fit customer.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>Saying Yes often (or saying No infrequently) is important in enterprise sales cycles. To find more ways to say Yes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build a flexible product with programmable hooks.</li>
  <li>Fill niche functionality with partners, turning yourself into a platform.</li>
  <li>Make it easy to import and export data in bulk.</li>
  <li>Build no-regrets enterprise features.</li>
  <li>Sell to the right customers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>12) Ensure IP is Setup</h3>
<p>If not already done, select ‘Deny Outbound’ under ‘Action’. There are additional configurations available to include GeoIP and Reputation blocking. For GeoIP, select ‘Deny Outbound’ for any Continents you wish to block and modify these lists, as needed by selecting the pencil to edit.</p>

<h3>13) DNS Block List (DNSBL) Config</h3>
<p>DNSBL or a sinkhole/blackhole renders a site in it’s lists inaccessible. This gives you control over what users are able to access on your network.</p>
<h4>DNSBL SafeSearch</h4>
<p>If desired, enable SafeSearch network wide on Google, Yandex, DuckDuckGo, Bing, and PixaBay. You can also set Youtube restrictions and block Firefox DNS over HTTPS.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="382" src="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15.png" alt="pfBlockerNG Safe Search Config" srcset="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15.png 800w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15-300x143.png 300w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15-768x367.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>DNSBL SafeSearch</figcaption></figure>
<h4>DNSBL &amp; IP Feeds</h4>
<p>We recommend you activate additional DNSBL not enabled by the pfBlockerNG Setup Wizard. To do that, you must select ‘Feeds’ and simply select the + next to the ones you would like to add. <strong>DO NOT</strong> select all feeds – we don’t add any IP feeds but instead limit our additions to DNSBL ‘Easylist’, all Ad Blockers, and some of the Malicious options. Don’t worry if some of the lists have duplicates, pfBlockerNG will make sure each entry exists only once. </p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="216" src="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16.png" alt="pfBlockerNG Feeds" srcset="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16.png 800w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16-300x81.png 300w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16-768x207.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption><em>DNSBL &amp; IP Feeds</em></figcaption></figure>
<h4>Feed Grouping and Setup</h4>
<p>pfBlockerNG groups DNSBL together on its own. You will need to access these groups to make sure they are enabled and properly configured. This page also allows you to remove a list whose URL is no longer active or that you no longer want to use. The main things to check are that the ‘State’ is ‘ON’ and the ‘Action’ is ‘Unbound’.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="539" src="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17.png" alt="pfBlockerNG DNSBL Config" srcset="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17.png 800w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17-300x202.png 300w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17-768x517.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>Feed Grouping and Setup</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Adult Content Limitations</h2>
<p>The pfBlockerNG configuration above does a great job at everything we’ve discussed, but falls a bit short when it comes to blocking adult content. There is an option under DNSBL Category ‘Blacklists’ where you can enable Shallalist to block adult sites, but the list is large and not comprehensive. Other similar lists are also resource intensive so we ditched these lists and instead setup our pfSense firewall to use <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-1-1-1-1-for-families/" target="_blank">Cloudflare Family</a>&nbsp;as our DNS provider – a free service that blocks both adult content and malware. This paired with our pfSense firewall running pfBlockerNG gives us everything we need for a safe home network. </p>
<h2>Final Tweaks</h2>
<p>At this point you should have pfBlockerNG configured and running on your network. Now all devices on your network will enjoy blocked ads, improved security, and more privacy while online. Further pfBlockerNG tuning might be needed if you discover a page blocked or want additional blocks – just hop back into pfSense to make your tweaks. </p>
<p>Hope this helped you get pfSense pfBlockerNG setup on your home network. Let us know if we missed something or you have any questions.</p>

September 2, 2020 | https://kickstartcoding.online/learn/articles/i-converted-reactjs-org-to-use-hooks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kickstartcoding.online/learn/articles/i-converted-reactjs-org-to-use-hooks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://kickstartcoding.online/learn/articles/hooks-or-not-hooks">When we decided to convert our React curriculum to React Hooks</a>, one of the biggest stumbling blocks we ran into was that almost all of the guides, tutorials, and blog posts about React Hooks are written with the assumption that the audience already knows React. Most resources are written from the perspective of ”How to switch from class-style React to hooks-style React”, not “How to learn hooks-style React from scratch”.</p>
<p>Our curriculum has a lot of supplementary reading links in it and it wasn't clear where we would be able to find supplementary reading that taught React Hooks with a beginner rather than a veteran audience in mind.</p>
<p>After some discussion, we came up with a possible solution. <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/">The ReactJS.org documentation</a> is an excellent resource for all things React, but the beginner guides and tutorial still use class-based React, and the hooks guides have the "aimed at React veterans" problem. This makes sense for these guides in context — a lot of people are still using class-style React, and most of the audience for hooks probably <em>is</em> React veterans — it just doesn't make as much sense for us as a coding school.</p>
<p>But the ReactJS.org site is also completely open source. So we thought: what if we just…updated it ourselves?</p>
<p>We decided to take a stab at doing just that and see how it went. This part of our curriculum update fell to me, so a couple of months ago I cloned the ReactJS.org repo and started experimenting to see how hard it would be to get up and running, adapted, and deployed.</p>
<h2>The Result</h2>
<p>It took a lot of work, and I’ll be talking about all the ins and outs of the update in a future post, because there were a lot of interesting challenges both pedagogically and technically. But for now the result is live at <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/">reactwithhooks.netlify.app</a>, and you can take a look at the repo where the changes were made at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks">github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org</a> on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks">the convert-all-to-hooks branch</a>.</p>
<p>The places you’ll find most of the converted examples and explanations are <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/tutorial/tutorial.html">the tutorial</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/docs/hello-world.html">the main concepts sections</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/docs/accessibility.html">the advanced guides sections</a>. For those, we converted the concept explanations, the directions, and all of the examples (including the ones on CodePen so you can see and run working code snippets). Everything from the step-by-step directions for writing a tic-tac-toe game in React to explanations on how to integrate React with older library’s like Backbone.js is now written with hooks in mind.</p>
<p>We hope this will be a useful resource for anyone who either wants to learn React the hooks way from scratch, or who wants to see examples and/or explanations of some of the more complex React concepts implemented in the hooks style.</p>
<h2>Helping Out</h2>
<p>There were a few sections that were particularly tricky to figure out how to convert, or to figure out if conversion was even possible. If you’d like to help us out, take a look at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks#unresolved-issues-with-modifying-the-docs-to-be-100-hooks">the ”unresolved issues” section of the README</a> and let us know if you know how to handle any of the things we couldn’t figure out.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://kickstartcoding.online/media-content/share/1599066782/407/"></p><p>There's still work left to do!</p>
</div><p>Also, of course, please let us know about any issues or bugs you fine to us the converted documentation. We definitely want to make sure it is as useful and error-free as possible.</p>
<h2>Fin.</h2>
<p>All in all, making this adaptation was one of the most fun projects I’ve been able to work on recently. We got a chance to use it as a resource for students during our last cohort, and it seemed to work pretty well. I’m hoping that it will be useful for other people trying to learn React as well, so check it out and let us know what you think!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><figure><p>If you’re here, you’ve likely been tasked with building SAML-based SSO as a requirement for an enterprise deal. If you’re just diving into the problem space of SSO / SAML, we’d first suggest checking out <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">The Developer’s Guide to SSO</a>. Otherwise, buckle up for a brief but titillating foray into why XML-based authentication is... challenging.</p><h2>Why is SAML SSO so vulnerability-prone</h2><p>The attack surface for SAML authentication is extensive, mostly due to the fact that SAML is XML-based. <a href="https://everypageispageone.com/2016/01/28/why-does-xml-suck/">XML is a semantic-free meta-language</a> - it’s hard to form, hard to read, and hard to parse. Combined with the high complexity of the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.pdf">SAML specification</a> and the number of parties involved in establishing authentication, we get what often feels like a <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html">big ball of mud</a> and all the accompanying implications. Be prepared to tackle a steep learning curve, lots of bugs, high maintenance costs, attack vectors galore, and an absurd spread of edge cases.</p><p>Most SAML SSO security vulnerabilities are introduced by Service Providers (SPs) improperly validating and processing SAML responses received from Identity Providers (IdPs). This happens because SAML SSO is typically not a core-value feature for an application, nor is the implementation common knowledge for most developers. Unknowns become even more unlikely to be identified and addressed when the pressure is on to just deliver <em>something </em>to unblock a high-value contract - as is oftentimes the case. However, to build SAML SSO safely and securely in-house requires significant buy-in and <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/07/11/single-sign-on-sso-stack-overflow-okta-integration/">investment by teams</a> - on the scale of months, representing hundreds of thousands of dollars in developer time.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>If not done right, you expose your application and your customers to potentially huge security risks. </strong>To drive that home, here are just a few recently published SAML-related vulnerabilities:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15585">January 27, 2020</a> - “... GitLab SAML integration had a validation issue that permitted an attacker to takeover another user's account.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4427">May 7, 2020</a> - “... an attacker could exploit this [SAML] vulnerability to bypass the authentication process and gain full administrative access to the system [IBM Data Risk Manager].”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-21263">June 19, 2020</a> - “An attacker could authenticate to a different user's [Mattermost] account via a crafted SAML response.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2021">June 29, 2020</a> - “... improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources.”</li></ul><p>It should be evident by now that oversights in SAML implementations are ubiquitous and problematic, even among experienced engineering teams.</p><p>So let’s dive into some of the more common security pitfalls developers building SAML-based SSO should be aware of, as well as cover a few suggested countermeasures. Just to be clear, <strong>this guide is by no means comprehensive</strong> and is meant to provide a starting point for SAML security considerations as well as some follow-on resources.</p><h2>Brief anatomy of a SAML response</h2><p>Let's say we're integrating our application with Okta via SAML. Below is an example of an XML document we might get when attempting to authenticate a user, containing a simplified but valid SAML response:</p><p>Like we mentioned earlier, the SAML spec is complex and responses can get lengthy, so this example is comparatively quite terse. Keeping things to what you should know before we go into SAML vulnerabilities, let’s walk through what the response (<strong><em>&lt;saml2p:Response&gt;</em></strong>) is communicating:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Line 2 begins the SAML response, which has the unique ID <strong><em>id72697176167120131651975993</em></strong> and is intended for consumption by the <strong><em>workos-test</em></strong> service provider’s Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL, i.e. the endpoint <strong><em>https://api.workos-test.com/auth/okta/callback</em></strong>.</li><li>Line 3 specifies the issuer (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Issuer&gt;</em></strong>) and contains the unique URI (also referred to as EntityID) of the IdP that issued the response, in this case <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357.</em></strong></li><li>Line 7 begins the assertion (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Assertion&gt;</em></strong>) with the unique ID <strong><em>id7269717616793800631152500</em></strong>. An assertion is a package of information asserting the identity of a user, often containing additional user attributes like first / last name, email, ID, etc.</li><li>Line 8 specifies the issuer of the assertion itself, in this case also <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357</em></strong>.</li><li>Lines 9 - 30 contains the digital signature (<strong><em>&lt;ds:Signature&gt;</em></strong>) over the assertion, which should be validated to determine the authenticity of the assertion.</li><li>Lines 31 - 36 specify the subject (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Subject&gt;</em></strong>) of the assertion, i.e. the authenticated principal / user corresponding to the unique identifier found in <strong><em>&lt;saml2:NameID&gt;</em></strong>, who in this case is <strong><em><a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="5b3f3e36341b2c34293034287634302f3a75383436">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em></strong>.</li><li>Line 37 (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Conditions&gt;</em></strong>) defines the window of time for which the assertion should considered valid, i.e. from <strong><em>NotBefore</em></strong> (inclusive) to <strong><em>NotOnOrAfter</em></strong> (exclusive).</li></ul><p>For the purposes of readability, the SAML 2.0 XML snippets in the remainder of this blog will be simplified, use shorthand, and be stripped of nodes that would otherwise be required in reality but are not relevant to what’s being illustrated. We’ll use a mythical IssueTracker, ContractManager, and PayrollService as hypothetical SPs that have implemented SAML authentication, which you should think of as placeholders for your application or other SAML SSO-enabled apps.</p><h2>Disable DTD processing</h2><p>The first step in processing a SAML response is parsing the payload. Parsing and loading an XML document into memory is an inherently expensive set of operations, but can be unexpectedly costly due to a feature of XML that allows references to external or remote documents, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition">Document Type Definitions</a> (DTDs).</p><p>When a DTD is encountered, parsers will try to fetch and load the referenced document as well. If the referenced document is large enough or results in infinitely looping references, your server can be slowed or even brought down trying to complete the process. The same holds true if the payload itself is very large, DTDs or not.</p><p>Two low-hanging mitigations you should implement to prevent buffer overflows are:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Limiting SAML payload size to &lt; 1MB. 1MB is a generous upper limit and should be tuned down based on average received payload size.</li><li>Configuring your XML parser to never fetch remote files or try to load and parse DTDs. Some XML parsers do so by default, for example, Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html"><strong><em>xml.etree.ElementTree</em></strong></a> module.</li></ol><p>XML processing, and thus by extension SAML response processing, is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks from other scenarios described later on in this post. And unfortunately, protecting your application from a service outage is among the most mild of outcomes compared to the <a href="https://www.vsecurity.com//download/papers/XMLDTDEntityAttacks.pdf">possibilities exploiting XML DTD</a> allows - it is a dark and anxiety-inducing rabbit hole.</p><p>So, if you’re not writing your own XML parser (generally not suggested), it’s important to <strong>vet the XML parser(s) your application and its dependencies use</strong> - ensure they handle other exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack">Billion Laughs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">Zip Bombs</a>.</p><h2>Validate the SAML response schema first<br></h2><p>The primary security mechanism in the SAML handshake is the cryptographic validation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Signature">XML Signatures</a> (XML-DSig) - which establishes the trust chain between IdPs and SPs. XML-DSig validation should always be done prior to executing business logic; however, the separation between signature verification and operating on the rest of a SAML payload opens up SAML authentication to vulnerabilities exposed by what are called XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) attacks. &nbsp;These attacks have numerous permutations which can result in outcomes such as (but not limited to):<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Denial-of-service by inserting arbitrary elements that lead to buffer overflows.</li><li>Escalating permissions by injecting assertions that allow an adversary to impersonate and be authenticated as another user, like an account admin.</li></ul><p>The exploit here consists of modifying the payload without invalidating any signatures - think <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a> or <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">Cross Site Scripting,</a> but for for XML.</p><p>Original response (pre-XSW):</p><p>Modified response (post-XSW):</p><p>The broadest countermeasure to XSW attacks is <strong>validating the schema</strong> of the SAML XML document. Payloads for SAML responses of any given IdP should have a deterministic standard schema that can be used as a reference in a schema compliance validation module, which should be executed prior to XML-DSig verification. Here are <a href="https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml/tree/master/src/onelogin/saml2/schemas">example schemas</a> used by OneLogin’s <strong><em>python3-saml</em></strong> package to perform <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/python-saml/library/saml2.html#saml2.utils.OneLogin_Saml2_Utils.validate_xml">XML schema validation</a>. <strong>Schemas should be vetted local copies</strong> as opposed to being fetched from 3rd party remote locations at runtime or on server start.</p><p>All of that being said, <a href="https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2013/03/25/paper.pdf">schema validation isn’t foolproof</a>; there is room for error in the validation module logic itself, as well as in the syntactic rigor of the reference schema. A second low-hanging countermeasure to XSW attacks that should be employed for the sake of redundancy is to <strong>always use absolute XPath expressions</strong> to select elements in processes post-schema validation. Explicit absolute XPath expressions set an unambiguous expectation for the location of elements.</p><p>Here’s an example of a valid response that’s been modified in an XSW attack (specifically a signature exclusion attack, more on that later):</p><p>This modification also exploits the common, incorrect, but not unreasonable assumption that a well-formed SAML response will only ever have a single assertion. So while XML-DSig verification would succeed for the signature returned by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Signature”)[0]</em></strong>, the assertion returned and processed by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Assertion”)[0]</em></strong> would be the injected <strong><em>snek</em></strong> assertion. This attack would have been more likely to fail if the XPath expression&nbsp;<strong><em>“/Response/Assertion[0]/Signature”</em></strong> was used in the assertion signature validation logic.</p><h2>Check that you’re the intended recipient</h2><p>This sounds obvious, but make sure to check that a SAML response is intended for your app. This is low-hanging fruit that can prevent attacks exploiting IdPs that use a shared private signing key for all integrated SPs of a given tenant, as opposed to issuing unique keys per application. The most common attack entails the …</p></figure></div></div></div>

<p><em>Figure 1: The Jabber RCE vulnerability in action.</em></p>
<p>Security consultants from Watchcom discovered the four high severity vulnerabilities while pen-testing for a client. The vulnerabilities affect all currently supported versions of the Cisco Jabber client (12.1 – 12.9). The four vulnerabilities and their corresponding CVE numbers are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2020-3495: Cisco Jabber Message Handling Arbitrary Code Execution (CVSS 9.9)</li>
<li>CVE-2020-3430: Cisco Jabber Protocol Handler Command Injection (CVSS 8.0)</li>
<li>CVE-2020-3498: Cisco Jabber Information Disclosure (CVSS 6.5)</li>
<li>CVE-2020-3537: Cisco Jabber Universal Naming Convention Link Handling (CVSS 5.7)</li>
</ul>
<p>This article describes the technical details of the vulnerabilities and gives useful advice for detection and mitigation.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Cisco Jabber is a video conferencing and instant messaging application. It is mainly used for internal communication, but can also be used to chat, call or conduct meetings with people outside of the organization. These days a lot of people are working from home and applications like Cisco Jabber are essential to stay connected, communicate efficiently and keep businesses running smoothly.</p>
<p>Given their newfound prevalence in organizations of all sizes, these applications are becoming an increasingly attractive target for attackers. A lot of sensitive information is shared through video calls or instant messages and the applications are used by the majority of employees, including those with privileged access to other IT-systems.</p>
<p>The security of these applications is therefore paramount, and it is important to ensure that both the applications themselves, and the infrastructure they are using, are regularly audited for security gaps.</p>
<p>During a recent penetration test for an unrelated client, security consultants Olav Sortland Thoresen and Torjus Bryne Retterstøl from Watchcom discovered four serious vulnerabilities in Cisco Jabber. The vulnerabilities range from medium to critical severity and two of the vulnerabilities can be used to gain remote code execution. The most severe vulnerability is also wormable, meaning that it can be used to automatically spread malware without any user interaction.</p>
<p>Watchcom immediately reported these vulnerabilities to Cisco and coordinated a responsible disclosure. Patches have been issued and all Cisco Jabber users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest version.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>All four vulnerabilities affect the Cisco Jabber client application and were tested on Windows. The Cisco Jabber client is based on the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) and uses the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) for instant messages and presence updates. These two technologies are important for understanding the vulnerabilities and their implications. A brief overview of each of them is therefore provided below.</p>
<h3>Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)</h3>
<p>CEF is a framework that allows developers to embed Chromium-based web browsers in their applications. It is used to create desktop applications based on web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Normally, the code running in the embedded web browser is sandboxed and cannot access files or perform system calls. While this is a good security measure, application developers often want such functionality in their application and therefore find or create ways to bypass the sandbox.</p>
<p><em><strong>This leaves applications vulnerable in scenarios where the sandbox normally would’ve provided protection.</strong></em></p>
<p>Additionally, many applications that use CEF choose to pass through command line flags to the embedded web browser. This means that many CEF applications accept <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags" target="_blank">Chromium command line flags</a>. Some of these flags can be used to execute arbitrary commands or load arbitrary DLLs and should therefore be treated with caution.</p>
<h3>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)</h3>
<p>XMPP is an XML-based protocol for instant messaging and presence. It is based on an open standard and is widely used in both open-source and proprietary software. XMPP is an extensible protocol and several extensions that provide additional functionality to the protocol exist.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure2.png" height="209" width="1137"> <em>Figure 2: An XMPP message containing both a plaintext and an HTML version of a message.</em></p>
<p>One of these extensions is XEP-0071: XHTML-IM. This extension defines how instant messages containing HTML formatted content can be exchanged over XMPP. Since HTML content can contain malicious elements, the specification states that applications must assume that messages containing HTML are malicious and sanitize them accordingly.</p>
<p>It also states that it must be possible for users to prevent automatic loading of images. Not all applications take such precautions and we will later see how this is the root cause of two of the vulnerabilities that we discovered.</p>
<h3>Cross Site Scripting Leading to RCE Vulnerability</h3>
<p>Cisco Jabber is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) through XHTML-IM messages. The application does not properly sanitize incoming HTML messages and instead passes them through a flawed XSS filter.</p>
<p>The filter is based on a blacklist of known-bad tags and attributes, but it is not comprehensive. Since the application is based on CEF, its embedded web browser will execute any scripts that can pass through the filter.</p>
<p>We discovered that the filter could be bypassed using the lesser-known onanimationstart attribute. Tags that had this attribute were not caught by the filter and were directly inserted into the embedded web browser’s DOM. This attribute is used to specify a JavaScript function that will be called when an element’s CSS animation starts playing. To achieve XSS using this attribute the element must have an animation assigned to it. It was not possible to inject custom CSS animations since &lt;style&gt; tags were caught by the filter, but we discovered a built-in animation called spinner-grow by grepping through the files in the installation directory. By combining these two, it was possible to create malicious HTML tags that bypassed the filter and were executed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure3.png" height="387" width="1003"> <em>Figure 3: An XHTML-IM message that has been intercepted and modified. A malicious &lt;img&gt; tag has been added.</em></p>
<p>Cisco Jabber uses XHTML-IM by default for all messages. A malicious message can therefore easily be created by intercepting an XMPP message sent by the application and modifying it. Attackers can do this manually on their own machine or it can be automated to create a worm that spreads automatically.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure4.png" height="783" width="1123"> <em>Figure 4: When the victim receives the message, the JavaScript code is executed. In this case the code opens an alert box as a proof of concept.</em></p>
<p>After achieving XSS, we started looking for ways to escape the CEF sandbox. A vulnerable function (named window.CallCppFunction) was identified. This function is used to invoke native C++ code and the application uses it to, among other things, open files received from other Cisco Jabber users.</p>
<p>We discovered that this function can be abused by an attacker to run arbitrary executable files on the victim’s machine. The function takes a file:// URL as its second parameter and by manipulating this parameter an attacker can execute arbitrary .exe files.</p>
<p><em><strong>Since Cisco Jabber supports file transfers, an attacker can initiate a file transfer containing a malicious .exe file and force the victim to accept it using an XSS attack. </strong></em></p>
<p>The attacker can then trigger a call to window.CallCppFunction, causing the malicious file to be executed on the victim´s machine.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure5.png" height="464" width="794"> <em>Figure 5: An XHTML-IM message containing exploit code that escapes the CEF sandbox and launches calc.exe on the victim’s machine.</em></p>
<p>This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-3495 with a CVSS score of 9.9 (Critical) / CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H</p>
<h3>Protocol Handler Vulnerability</h3>
<p>While researching the XSS vulnerability, we discovered another high severity vulnerability concerning the handling of URLs with custom protocols.</p>
<p>Upon installation, Cisco Jabber registers protocol handlers for a number of different protocols. These are used to tell the operating system that whenever a user clicks on a URL containing one of the custom protocols (e.g. ciscoim:test@example.com) the URL should be passed to Cisco Jabber. In this case, the protocol handlers specify that the URL should be passed as a command line flag.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure6.png" height="255" width="1032"> <em>Figure 6: One of Cisco Jabber’s protocol handlers. The protocol handler specifies that URLs should be passed to the application as a command line flag.</em></p>
<p>These protocol handlers are vulnerable to command injection because they fail to consider URLs that contain spaces. By including a space in the URL, an attacker can inject arbitrary command line flags that will be passed to the application. Since the application uses CEF and accepts Chromium command line flags, several flags that can be used to execute arbitrary commands or load arbitrary DLLs exist. An example of such a flag is --GPU-launcher. This flag specifies a command that will be executed when CEFs GPU process is started.</p>
<p>This vulnerability can be combined with the XSS vulnerability to achieve code execution without transferring any files to the victim. This makes it possible to deliver malware without writing any files to disk, thus bypassing most antivirus software.</p>
<p>The video below shows the vulnerability being exploited. The attacker sends a malicious message, containing an XSS payload that escapes the CEF sandbox and uses the protocol handler vulnerability to execute commands on the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>I went through Y Combinator’s W16 batch for my company StrongIntro — we helped tech companies grow their engineering teams through employee referrals. I was 17 at the time and the youngest founder in the batch of 300+ entrepreneurs. Here's what I learned:</p> <h2>The people you respect are closer than you think</h2> <p>I devoured all of PG's essays and read founder bios in my spare time growing up. Coming from a Boston suburb, I thought it would take ages to get to Silicon Valley and meet the founders I respected, let alone work alongside them. But I was able to get a job in SF with a single cold email and zero connections. A year later I was in YC listening to the founders of Reddit and Airbnb share their stories and getting advice from PG.</p> <p>This is not the case in the rest of the world, but Silicon Valley is incredibly welcoming to newcomers. If you're willing to work hard and create value it's entirely possible to work alongside the people you most respect within a short time period. I consider that magic.</p> <h2>No one knows the right answer</h2> <p>One of the first lessons YC taught us is that the partners, who were successful entrepreneurs and operators, would give us conflicting advice and that that's normal. This felt wrong to me. In school, the experts — teachers — always knew the right answer, and yet these partners who were the most successful people I'd met couldn't give me “correct” answers that would guarantee my startup’s success.</p> <p>This dampened my amazement at the time but it was also empowering. It showed me that my ideas could be just as valid as someone who's incredibly successful.</p> <h2>You don't need experience to get started</h2> <p>Outside of my own experience of getting into YC at a young age, there are numerous other examples of founders succeeding wildly with little to no experience. The Airbnb founders didn't have experience in hospitality, and they only came up with the idea after brainstorming startup ideas because they wanted to start a company (ironically VCs usually say this is not a good way to start a company). More recently, my batchmate Boom has been making waves building supersonic passenger airplanes. The founder was a software engineer at Groupon before starting the company.</p> <h2>Experience is only loosely correlated with age</h2> <p>The average age of the founders in my batch was 30. Going into the program I was intimidated that everyone else had so much more working experience than me, but I quickly learned that we were all winging it as most were first time founders like myself. YC's group office hours were a time for founders to share what they were struggling with, and everyone, regardless of age struggled with the same general problems such customers not liking their product enough, not growing fast enough, and cofounder difficulties.</p> <h2>Silicon Valley doesn't care about your background</h2> <p>In the East Coast experience and status are highly valued. Bill Gates created class scheduling software in high school, and I wanted to replicate that. I approached our school admin about doing the same when I was 16 and was promptly shut down because I was too young and "entire companies are required to create scheduling software." I wasn't even given the chance to fail.</p> <p>In contrast, no one cared about my age in YC. Most people didn't realize I was 17, and if they learned my age they always saw it as a positive trait instead of something that would hold me back. This stark difference in mindset makes sense when you consider how many young founders have famously succeeded in Silicon Valley (Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg) which is a trend that still persists to this day (Scale, Brex, Luminar).</p> <h2>Failure is acceptable</h2> <p>My company ultimately didn't succeed (we realized we needed to build a services business more than a technology business and that's not what we set out to do), and that was entirely okay. Most YC companies fail and it's baked into their business model — YC partners were even willing to fund my next business. This surprised me because school trained me to avoid failure at all costs — a single bad grade could tarnish my GPA permanently. The consensus goal was to get the right grades and internships to build a good resume, without any gaps that could tarnish the record.</p> <p>Silicon Valley's willingness to embrace failure is unintuitive but entirely logical. Startups aren't like school because there's no guaranteed playbook for starting a successful company — you need good execution but also experimentation and luck. Most applicants get rejected from YC multiple times before getting in, and most founders fail multiple times before succeeding. Travis Kalanick's first company failed. His second company had a modest exit after 6 years of grinding, and his third company was Uber. The Honey founders ran startups that didn’t go anywhere for years before they started Honey. Twitch was a struggling general-purpose streaming site before they doubled down on the gaming niche. The examples are endless. Failure is a necessary ingredient to success and Silicon Valley rightly internalizes that.</p> <div> <h3>Random musings</h3> <h4>East Coast vs West Coast</h4> <p>There's a more generalizable point in that the East Coast is typically more conservative than the West Coast. This is observable when dealing with venture capitalists from both sides as well. East Coast VCs are much more conservative, which is ultimately bad because it results in less moonshots succeeding. There are exceptions as well of course (ie Thrive Capital is ambitious and will bet on moonshots).</p> </div> </div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Monitoring Fleet Health with Heartbeat Metrics]]>

        <p>Releasing a connected device in today’s world without some form of monitoring in
place is a recipe for trouble. How would you know how often or if devices are
experiencing faults or crashing? How can the release lead be confident that no
connectivity, performance, or battery-life regressions have occurred between the
past and current firmware update?</p>

<p><strong>The answer is that you need device monitoring in place long before ever
shipping a firmware update to devices in the field.</strong></p>

<p>There have been several occasions in the past where I’ve introduced several
performance and battery-life regressions that were never caught in internal beta
testing of 50 devices. They were always subtle changes, such as an
“optimization” that ended up causing high file system churn (which reduced
battery life), or issues that crop up when connected over certain transports or
to different mobile phone models. These bugs were caught in one of two ways:
either a customer angry enough would submit a bug report, or we’d catch the
regression on our internal dashboards which were powered by our suite of SQL
queries that would run periodically.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this post, we lay the foundation for how an organization should instrument
their embedded firmware to measure performance, stability, and the overall
“health” of each device and an entire fleet of devices. We also compare and
contrast the various approaches projects generally take to surface these metrics
and I’ll discuss why I believe heartbeat metrics are the best method for driving
product decisions.</p>

  <p>This post is guaranteed to be the tip of the iceberg in a series of posts
about how to do device monitoring <em>properly</em> at scale. With this in mind, this
post will be slightly more high-level than a typical “Interrupt” post.</p>

<h2 id="fleet-monitoring-overview">Fleet Monitoring Overview</h2>

<p>Device and software monitoring is not a new concept. There have been many new
ambitious projects to solve the problem from a couple of devices to monitoring
millions of servers or containers.</p>

<p>I’d like to talk about a few different variations of monitoring and how they
relate to us in the world of embedded systems.</p>

<h3 id="application-performance-monitoring-apm">Application Performance Monitoring (APM)</h3>

<p>Application performance monitoring services collect and aggregate different
metrics on computer systems and software, and they alert customers when these
numbers either increase or decrease in abnormal ways. Common metrics that are
collected by APM’s are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CPU, RAM, and hard drive usage</li>
  <li>Response times and values</li>
  <li>Request rates and failures</li>
</ul>

<p>They work by installing hooks in various places in the code. Common examples are
the pre/post request handlers for a web application and the pre/post handlers
for a database transaction. By hooking into both sides of common operations,
they can take a snapshot of the system before and after, and compare memory
usage and time deltas.</p>

<p>When an APM is hooked up to every instance of an application, it can paint a
detailed picture of how an application, server, or fleet of either are
performing at any given time.</p>

<p>APM’s aren’t a new concept, as one of the largest ones, New Relic, was founded
in 2008 and is now a publicly-traded company.</p>

<p><strong>Software services:</strong> New Relic<sup id="fnref:new_relic"><a href="#fn:new_relic">1</a></sup>, Datadog<sup id="fnref:datadog"><a href="#fn:datadog">2</a></sup>,
ScoutAPM<sup id="fnref:scout_apm"><a href="#fn:scout_apm">3</a></sup><br> <strong>Open Source Libraries</strong>: StatsD<sup id="fnref:statsd"><a href="#fn:statsd">4</a></sup>,
CollectD<sup id="fnref:collectd"><a href="#fn:collectd">5</a></sup>, Prometheus<sup id="fnref:prometheus"><a href="#fn:prometheus">6</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="tracing-and-logging">Tracing and Logging</h3>

<p>I’ve grouped these into a single group because they accomplish the same goal.</p>

<p>Traces and logs give you an in-depth timeline view of what happened on a single
device and allow you to zero-in on issues as long as you know what you are
looking for. They work by having the developer install logs or trace events
during the coding phase or automatically by installing hooks in the context
switch handler and various system API calls.</p>

<p>Traces and logs, just like an APM, can tell you where most of the time is spent
in an application or system, but there are drawbacks.</p>

<p>The amount of data collected by tracing and logging tools is immense, and most
of the data doesn’t get used or processed. In their raw form, they are not
easily aggregated or actionable.</p>

<p>I view tracing and logging as a silo of (valuable) data that is only queried
when developers <strong>know</strong> there is an issue with a specific device.</p>

<p><strong>Software services:</strong> New Relic<sup id="fnref:new_relic:1"><a href="#fn:new_relic">1</a></sup>, Datadog<sup id="fnref:datadog:1"><a href="#fn:datadog">2</a></sup><br> <strong>Firmware
services:</strong> Percepio<sup id="fnref:percepio"><a href="#fn:percepio">7</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="crash-reporting">Crash Reporting</h3>

<p>How nice would it be to have in-depth analysis and alerts for every unique
crash, fault, assert, and error log that devices in the field experience? That
is what these services provide.</p>

<p>When any of the listed error handlers are triggered, these libraries gather all
of the relevant data, such as previous logs, backtraces of the currently running
threads, local variables, global variables, etc. and push all of this data to a
central server to be processed. These issues are then de-duplicated and
presented in a bug-tracker like fashion to the user.</p>

<p>These systems usually require an SDK to be shipped with the application. These
services must build and support an SDK that is written in the same language and
for the same framework as the application they monitor.</p>

<p>For firmware, they would likely install hooks into the
<a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/asserts-in-embedded-systems">assert</a>,
<a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/cortex-m-fault-debug">fault</a>, and
<a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-logs-stack-trace">logging</a> handlers.</p>

<p>The beautiful thing about crash reporting tools is they are relatively easy to
integrate because the entry-points they hook into are standardized by the
language and frameworks. They also surface hard to reproduce or never before
seen issues easily and provide a wealth of data to fix the problem quickly.</p>

<h3 id="instantaneous-state-monitoring">Instantaneous State Monitoring</h3>

<p>This is the category that most of today’s “IoT monitoring solutions” fall into.
They assume a near-constant connection to the Internet and hold the state of
every device in the service.</p>

<p>Devices can either push this information whenever states change, at regular
intervals, or the remote server can pull data as well.</p>

<p>These systems ingest many of the system vitals that developers and managers want
to know, like heap usage, current battery life, or whether certain peripherals
are on or off. These values can be queried across the entire fleet or a subset
of devices, but trends or custom queries are more difficult.</p>

<p>For instance, attempting to query for the amount of time the Bluetooth radio is
on per day is nearly impossible, unless the infrastructure is <strong>100% certain</strong>
that it received every state change event from the device.</p>

<p>The statistic of time-active is a critical measurement for embedded devices, and
is one of the best predictors of battery-life drain and performance.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-embedded-systems">What About Embedded Systems?</h3>

<p>Most of the above services or strategies listed above do not apply to
constrained embedded systems. Save for Memfault and Percepio, most of the
solutions would require orders of magnitude more memory, CPU, power, and
Internet bandwidth.</p>

<p>There is hope though. We will explore how we can manage to get the most
important and actionable metrics out of embedded systems and gain an
understanding of how devices are performing in the field.</p>

<h2 id="logging-vs-metrics">Logging vs Metrics</h2>

<p>I want to quickly cover the difference and use-cases for two common forms of
data collected from systems: logs and metrics.</p>

<h3 id="logs">Logs</h3>

<p>Logs are immutable events that happened over time to a single device. They are
instrumental in debugging as they help a developer determine what happened
before and after issues occur.</p>

<p>Logs are usually forwarded from individual devices to a centralized datastore
such as S3, or to a log aggregator, such as Elastisearch, to be further
transformed and processed. Unfortunately, more often than not, the logs are
ingested and forgotten about.</p>

<p>A developer might dig up a particular device’s log files in response to a
customer support request, but that requires a <code>pull-logs-from-s3.py</code> script and
a decent amount of time to determine where the device behaved unexpectedly.</p>

<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>

<p>Metrics are a set of numbers that give information about a particular process or
activity. They are measured over intervals of time and are usually just numbers.
This means that they are pre-processed and more compact than logs, which means
that you can store and query many more of them at once.</p>

<p>Metrics themselves don’t help developers debug individual instances of issues or
bugs, but they help organizations <strong>detect</strong> issues by measuring the data points
that matter most. For many hardware makers, these metrics might be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Crash-free hours</li>
  <li>Average battery life</li>
  <li>Wi-Fi/BLE connected time per hour</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="transforming-logs-into-metrics">Transforming Logs into Metrics</h3>

<p>Logs can be transformed, processed, and aggregated into metrics, but this
usually involves massive and complex data pipelines.</p>

<p>After working as a firmware engineer at a few hardware companies in the past, I
can tell you that I was out of my depth trying to parse logs at scale, and I was
rarely getting the help I needed from the web and infrastructure teams because
they had their own roadmaps to complete.</p>

<p>The other problem with logs is that they generally log state transitions and
force the developer or log aggregator to measure the time between these state
transitions. Let’s try to calculate one of the important device metrics above,
Wi-Fi connected time per hour.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[E][11:30:00] Wi-Fi connected
[W][11:45:00] Wi-Fi disconnected, reason: -2
[I][12:30:00] Wi-Fi connected
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This calculation is relatively easy assuming we can process logs linearly. We
see at 11:30 the device was connected to Wi-Fi, then disconnected at 11:45, so
the time connected this hour was 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Let’s present a problem that happens all the time with embedded systems.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[E][11:30:00] Wi-Fi connected

# Wi-Fi disconnect event lost by device or in transport

[I][12:30:00] Wi-Fi connected
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oh no! A dropped log message.</p>

<p>Can we compute accurately how long the device was connected to Wi-Fi given the
information above? <strong>No we can’t</strong>. We’d probably throw away this event during
processing or accidentally include it and say Wi-Fi was connected for the entire
hour.</p>

<p>We can do …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Running a profitable agency is hard.</p><p>Using said profits to reinvest into real estate, stocks and tech startups is much harder. Jay Vasantharajah did exactly that. He is a very inspiring entrepreneur who has built an award-winning PPC agency and 7-figure eCommerce business. Something tells me this empire is just starting. I was curious to learn about his story and hear about what built his discipline to focus on cashflow and create an impressive investment portfolio.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>How did you get started in digital marketing?</strong></p><p>I started building websites for fun, and eventually convinced a small local accountant that I could build him a website. I think I made $500 for it, and quickly realized that I really enjoyed building websites. I went on to build&nbsp; websites for all the student councils in my university.</p><p>I then started learning PPC and SEO to help my dad drive business for his airport limo business. By the time I graduated university (I studied finance and accounting btw) I had a pretty good handle of digital marketing and web development.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What is the origin story behind your agency, ClientFlo?</strong></p><p>I spotted the opportunity when I came across a large communication company selling a packaged PPC service to SMBs across Canada. The PPC packages being offered were terrible; they&nbsp; consisted of cookie cutter landing pages and copy/pasted campaign setups, and the results were terrible.</p><p>Yet this company was selling these PPC packages like hot cakes. I would spend hours reading and analyzing the negative consumer reviews. The demand for these services was there, and I knew based on my knowledge I could do better. And that’s when I decided to start ClientFlo out of my condo. I had no clients or connections, but the confidence that I could offer SMB’s better services.&nbsp;</p><p>I incorporated ClientFlo on a Friday, starting cold calling the following Monday and closed my first client within a week. That instantly gave me the confidence to keep going, close more clients and to grow my company. I would spend all day cold-calling potential clients, stay up all night managing the campaigns. Once ClientFlo had around 10 clients, I knew it was time to get help and a start to build a team.</p><p>As ClientFlo continued to grow, we moved to our first office.</p><figure id="w-node-679817d579f7-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f4ea500bc40bb28d71956d6_n4pj6bovIRI1ZU927m4iAqUKwOKelJ8HXRsUwG8iCIH4BzPYSoesJEqQTCL-cTFGd7A8Y9iHwnoAp9d3e2NpADmTuMVvcHv40o6sS8MHylx-fdS0ZH0urbWFkxevwhVfeJMxUDbW.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>At the peak of the agency, what was the annual revenue and how many employees?</strong></p><p>Low seven-figures per year with about 5 full-time employees (including myself) and a couple contractors.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>How did you get initial sales for the agency?</strong></p><p>Straight <a href="https://jayvas.com/cold-calling-isnt-dead-and-why-all-entrepreneurs-should-learn-it/">cold-calling clients</a>. It was a grind, but ended up being very effective. I highly recommend all entrepreneurs to try cold-calling as early in their career as possible. It’s the “school of hard knocks” way to learn how to sell. And as any successful entrepreneur would tell you, the selling never stops - so get great at it!</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Describe the process of being a general investor from an agency operator?</strong></p><p>Investing, for me, started way before my agency, ClientFlo. The cash-flow from my agency accelerated the growth of my investments portfolio.</p><p>I started my investing career <a href="https://jayvas.com/charlie-munger-is-right-haul-ass-for-your-first-100k/">buying a cash-flowing real estate property</a>, which made it easier for me to quit my job and start ClientFlo. I continued to reinvest cash flows from ClientFlo into more real estate and stocks. As my cash flows and asset values continued to snowball, it enabled me to <a href="https://jayvas.com/investing/">invest in riskier/higher potential opportunities</a> like my <a href="https://www.starterstory.com/stories/how-we-re-expanding-our-product-line-and-growing-our-top-line">eCommerce business</a> and tech startups. I now manage a diversified portfolio of investments full-time.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What are the major lessons you’ve learned from growing the agency?</strong></p><p>Since this was my first business, I quickly learned how to be an entrepreneur.&nbsp; In entrepreneurship, perseverance is key. Things are given to you and taken from you, so don't let either get to your head. Stay focused, enjoy the process, and have as much fun as possible.</p><p>An agency-specific lesson that I learned is - choose a niche industry as early as possible. We started off as a generalist PPC agency, but eventually specialized in the medical industry. There are a lot of generalist PPC agencies and therefore more competition. But becoming the expert in a specific industry gives you a competitive edge.&nbsp;</p><p>Having deep product knowledge in a specific industry allows you to service your clients better, which leads to more referrals, industry connections, and positions you as the go-to firm. Not to mention that specialist services are billed at a higher rate.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What advice do you have for agency owners that want to use consulting revenues to fund new ventures?</strong></p><p>Not only are agencies great cash-flow businesses, they are also great <a href="https://jayvas.com/how-i-used-my-ppc-agency-as-an-idea-machine">idea generating machines</a>. If you are working with clients/industries that interest you, it won’t be long before you spot an opportunity that you can capitalize on.<br></p><p>Be curious and ask your clients a lot of questions to gain a deeper understanding of their business. Focus on your cash flows to help fund new ventures, and if you spot something -&nbsp;roll the dice. You never know what may become of it, unless you try!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div><p>MONTREAL -- 
	The Quebec government <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/quebec-hasn-t-released-official-data-on-school-outbreaks-and-hasn-t-said-when-it-will-do-so-1.5088184">hasn't said whether it will start updating the public</a> on COVID-19 cases in schools -- but some citizens don’t seem willing to wait.</p><p>
	
	A Montreal father who started a new crowd-sourced website meant to track school COVID-19 cases says it’s already garnered more than 100,000 page views.</p></div>
<p>
	By August, “I concluded we were going towards a second wave and our children would be in an experiment,” Olivier Drouin told CTV News.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	“I wanted to capture the data at the source and make it available to all parents [and] teachers, for them to make informed decisions about back-to-school.”</p>

<p>
	Last week, as French-language schools reopened, he launched a homemade site called <a href="https://www.covidecolesquebec.org/">Covid Ecoles Quebec</a> that allows the public to submit reports of coronavirus cases at schools across the province.</p>
<p>
	It provides a list, and a map, showing the cases Drouin has been able to confirm to his standards after his own basic verification process.</p>
<p>
	Of course, it’s not an exhaustive list, and he says if the government started releasing its own numbers, he’d stop collecting his—but after losing some trust in official numbers, he’d want to check first that they were doing a good job, he said in an email.</p>
<p>
	Drouin is vice-president of a technology company that provides high-tech human resources software. He lives in Montreal and has two daughters, one 13 and one 15, he said.</p>
<p>
	His site so far has published the names of 33 schools with at least one COVID-19 case each. Aside from the skyrocketing page views, Drouin said he’s gotten “hundreds of submissions” in the last week from parents and others.</p>
<p>
	“Not all are published,” he said, as sometimes “information is missing” or, in many cases, he gets duplicate reports for the same case.</p>
<p>
	Aside from the fact that it’s crowd-sourced, there are some important caveats to keep in mind for anyone looking at his site: for one thing, he doesn’t try to count the number of cases, but the number of schools, he said.</p>
<p>
	If he can confirm, to his standards, one case linked to a school, the school goes on the list. The government, meanwhile, counts an outbreak as two or more cases.</p>
<p>
	As for verification, the “easiest way to verify is with a copy of the letter schools send to all parents when a case occurs, as this is now mandatory across Quebec,” he said.</p>
<p>
	If he doesn’t have this, he said, “I look for media coverage.” Some of the schools listed on his website have a link to a news article.</p>
<p>
	The website also has a map showing where the affected schools are. These come with another caveat: at first glance, the map seems to show huge outbreaks, with dozens of numbers attached to the pinpoint for each school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	But those big numbers are not meant to show the number of cases, he said. They’re chronological to when he entered them, so a pinpoint showing “32,” for example, means it was the 32nd school he found, not that there are 32 cases there.</p>
<p>
	Drouin said his frustration with the government’s handling of the pandemic, and especially its transparency around data, had been growing for months before he thought of crowd-sourcing data.</p>
<p>
	“In particular, when schools reopened in May outside Montreal,” he said, “the government claimed a big success—however, no data was available to measure that.”</p>
<p>
	Quebecers only learned later that there were 41 cases linked to schools, he said. (That news was announced about two to three weeks after schools reopened.)</p>
<p>
	He believes that others have grown distrusting, too, due to a combination of government choices and data errors.</p>
<p>
	“Because the government fails to make this data available and accessible, it lacks transparency,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	“People don’t trust the numbers reported every day, as there have been so many data reporting issues,” he added, referencing the infamous fax machines used to collect infection reports, and the data that has been reported as misplaced or contaminated at various points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Drouin said he’s not against kids going back to school, but he wanted more safety measures to be taken, including shrinking class sizes, improving ventilation, mandating masks in classes and giving more people the option of remote learning.</p>
<p>
	The Quebec government hasn’t said whether it’s even considering releasing data on COVID-19 cases at schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	So far, the outbreaks that have been made public—including one involving <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/81-quebec-city-students-in-isolation-after-covid-19-cases-confirmed-at-two-schools-1.5086503">81 people at a Quebec City school</a> and <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/two-more-cases-of-covid-19-confirmed-quarantine-extended-for-20-quebec-teachers-in-isolation-1.5087658">a Deux-Montagnes outbreak</a> that has 20 teachers in quarantine—have been largely up to the media to confirm, with the cooperation of the schools and regional health authorities.</p>
<p>
	Drouin said he’d like it if the province did begin releasing routine data on schools.</p>
<p>
	“Based on the quality, accessibility of the data they would produce, yes, I would [shut my site down],” he said. “I have a day job.”</p>
                                              </div></div>]]>

September 2, 2020 | https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/thoughts-on-product | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/thoughts-on-product">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My day job is, officially, as a Growth Engineer working primarily on Unauth Product at Pinterest. It’s slightly different from my previous software engineering roles - typically, in other roles, I would be handed a spec sheet or design and had to implement it. Sometimes I’d design it myself, but the challenges were uniquely <em>technical</em> - I had to build something, and there was creativity in so far as what technologies and design patterns I’d use, but the features and product itself were usually dictated to you. They would either be so obvious that they were trivial, or they’d be handed down by some PM some point above the line.</p><p>Working on growth engineering is different - you’re responsible for the ideation and product, and focus around a north star metric, and can gauge the success of your ideas <em>objectively</em>. You own the entirety of the process, and have a quantifiable number at the end (for unauth and SEO, it’s usually traffic, time on site, and, most importantly, user acquisition).</p><p>This lends itself to an interesting focus at work every day. You want to build a product that is actually enjoyed and valuable to users, while still trying to “game” their attention and behavior.</p><p>The following are some thoughts I’ve had from working and consulting in growth at startups and companies of various sizes, mostly in the consumer tech space:</p><h2 id="thoughts-on-users-and-product">Thoughts on users and product</h2><ul><li><p>Trying to get users to do something is less like being an omnipotent god that tells people what to do than it is reshaping rivers of user intent. You can’t control what a user does, merely guide the flow of their actions. Adding a huge button doesn’t mean they’ll click on it.</p></li><li><p>Removing the ability to do something won’t prevent them from doing it (and will most likely just increase distaste for your product).</p></li><li><p>Users are simultaneously smarter and dumber than you think. Dumber in the sense that, when you take the average level of product comprehension for a user of any site that is used by a significant portion of the world population every day, it’s fairly low. Especially when you’re focused on new user acquisition, they don’t know what to expect, or how to use what you’re providing them. At the same time, though, they’re <strong>on your site for a reason</strong>, and usually know what they want.</p></li><li><p>You need to make sure to put yourself in the same headspace as your users. As someone building a product, you have to remember that you have a significantly higher familiarity with it than the people using it. You’ll have specific names for each product feature and know the user flows and reasoning behind each action, but for a lot of the people that visit your site, it’s their first time there.</p></li><li><p>It’s easy for me, as an early 20s San Francisco based software engineer, to have a fairly skewed perception of the world. Remember the user can have every possible demographic and characteristic.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you track what your users do when they come to your site, and experiment often with major shifts to your platform. It’s incredibly easy to <em>think</em> that users are doing something for a certain reason, when in reality it’s baseless.</p></li><li><p>Everything comes at a trade-off. Sometimes this is strictly better, metrics wise, but other times the trade-offs aren’t as clear - it doesn’t mean they don’t exist, though. The choices in button ordering, what you put above the fold, the font size, it all pulls and pushes the user experience in different directions.</p></li><li><p>Build for everyone, not just the professional. It’s easy when building products at work to be in a professional mindset - you’re not really thinking about <strong>every</strong> possible aspect that someone could be using your product for. Users get value in ways you never could predict - it’s better to build a platform that is flexible and ambiguous than imagine a single purpose use for what you’re building.</p></li><li><p>You do not and can not control users, and should view yourself more as at their mercy than them at yours. Working on a product is a lot more like swinging your arms around blindly in a room hoping you hit the light switch than it is knowing exactly what people want and how to deliver it to them.</p></li><li><p>Question all of your previous learnings. Something might’ve been true in the past, but is no longer. The same experiment or feature can lead to differences in results based on some slight change in the product or flow.</p></li></ul><h2 id="thoughts-on-growth">Thoughts on growth</h2><ul><li><p>Your user metrics are almost always proxies for what you’re trying to measure. You’ll pick some north star metric and say that this is what you’re building around, but this is just a shadow of what you’re trying to measure - the nebulous cloud of “user enjoyment”</p></li><li><p>Sometimes building a more aggressive user experience is worth it in the long run. For example: By default, your site could have a 2% conversion rate and a 20% bounce rate. A new feature is introduced behind an experiment that increases the conversion rate to 3%, but increases the bounce rate to 80%. This is clearly a subpar experience - it increases your bounce rate by 400%. However, it also increases your conversion rate by <strong>50%</strong>. Depending on your product this can make sense (for example, anything with an LTV for each user that is really high, or that has a really high CAC). It might not be ideal in the long term, but having a short term lever like this can be instrumental to a product’s success.</p></li><li><p>User growth is often cyclical. Some products will have the same traffic every day of the year, whereas others will have time of day, day of week, week of month, or seasonal patterns.</p></li><li><p>Monitor everything. As a product grows, you’ll build out one-off features that are significant wins at the time, but which aren’t actively monitored. It’s cheap to add a log to something and just page a team when it drops to 0. This is significantly eased by TDD, but TDD is rarely the right answer when your main concern is growth (you should move quickly).</p></li><li><p>You should move as quickly as possible. Don’t work on an idea for a long time - build out the smallest possible version that gives you directionality (positive or negative for the user metrics you’re looking at) and iterate from there. Especially in the early stages of a company, moving slowly and not adapting to shifting market conditions can kill you.</p></li><li><p>Growth is product + a direction + fuel. Each of these is a multiplier on the others - any combination of these can make a successful company. The dream is to have a great product that knows exactly where it wants to go, with all the resources it needs, but this is very rarely the case. More often than not you’ll have a mediocre product that’s floated along for a bit while being severely understaffed. If any of them is 0, you’re DOA.

        <p>Shell is the essential tool for every programmer. The more familiar you become with the available tools, the more efficient you can be with using your computer. Here's a list of command-line tools written in Rust that aim to provide modern, often much faster, alternatives to the existing shell commands.</p>
<h2 id="bat"><code>bat</code></h2>
<p><code>bat</code> is a <code>cat</code> clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration that works on Windows, MacOS and Linux. It provides syntax highlighting for many file extensions by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223573-9b9eb780-de0e-11ea-94e3-908957fe5a4e.png" alt="bat"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="exa"><code>exa</code></h2>
<p><code>exa</code> is a modern replacement for <code>ls</code>, the default command-line program in Unix/Linux for listing directory contents. <code>exa</code> supports icons with the <code>--icons</code> flag.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223612-aa856a00-de0e-11ea-8cec-133becefa6f2.png" alt="exa">
<a href="https://github.com/ogham/exa">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="fd"><code>fd</code></h2>
<p><code>fd</code> is a fast and user-friendly alternative to <code>find</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for walking a file hierarchy. <code>fd</code> provides opinionated defaults for the most common use cases. To find a specific file by name, you write <code>fd PATTERN</code> instead of <code>find -iname ‘*PATTERN*’</code>. <code>fd</code> is also extremely fast and it comes with a ton of options like ignoring hidden directories, files and patterns from <code>.gitignore</code> by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223646-bbce7680-de0e-11ea-98f4-0ef2d5f30920.png" alt="fd"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="procs"><code>procs</code></h2>
<p><code>procs</code> is a modern replacement for <code>ps</code>, the default command-line program in Unix/Linux for getting information about processes. It provides convenient, human-readable (and colored) output format by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223676-c8eb6580-de0e-11ea-8e3e-fea30f173aab.png" alt="procs"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dalance/procs">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="sd"><code>sd</code></h2>
<p><code>sd</code> is an intuitive find &amp; replace command-line tool, it is an alternative to <code>sed</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for parsing and transforming text (). <code>sd</code> has simpler syntax for replacing all occurrences and it uses the convenient regex syntax that you already know from JavaScript and Python. <code>sd</code> is also 2x-11x faster than <code>sed</code>.</p>
<p><code>sed</code> is a programmable text editor, with search and replace being a common use case. In that light, <code>sd</code> is more like <code>tr</code>, but on steroids. (thanks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/oleid/">/u/oleid</a> for the suggestion).</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223698-d6a0eb00-de0e-11ea-85e7-7bf590794ac0.png" alt="sd"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/chmln/sd">GitHub</a></p>

<p>The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell.</p>
<p><a href="https://starship.rs/guide/">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></h2>
<p><code>ripgrep</code> is an extremely fast alternative to <code>grep</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for searching files by pattern. <code>ripgrep</code> is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep respects <code>.gitignore</code> and automatically skips hidden files, directories and binary files.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223748-ecaeab80-de0e-11ea-9140-ac9219f5747c.gif" alt="ripgrep"></p>

<p>1st September 2020, by Elliott Brown</p>
<h4>Today we're announcing NUM, a new DNS-based protocol to store and retrieve structured data</h4>
<p>
  The Namespace Utility Modules (NUM) protocol can be used to store structured data for any domain name or email address. NUM&nbsp;records can be stored in the DNS of the independent NUM zone (e.g. <code>_num.example.com</code>) or in the hosted NUM zone (a DNS-based store of NUM records below the domain <code>num.net</code>) using a simple web interface: <a href="https://www.numserver.com/" target="_blank">NUM Server</a> <img src="https://www.num.uk/images/link-external.png" title="Content on another site." alt="Content on another site.">.
</p>
<p>
  We're announcing this experimental protocol to the technical community today and are very interested in feedback and input.
</p>
<h5>Custom and standardised records</h5>
<p>
  Custom NUM records can store structured data for any purpose, particular use cases are standardised with <a href="https://www.num.uk/modules">modules</a> <img src="https://www.num.uk/images/link-internal.png" title="Content elsewhere on this site." alt="Content elsewhere on this site.">. One of our leading use cases for NUM is contact information. Enabling organisations and individuals to store contact data in the DNS opens up lots of new possibilities like dialling a domain name or email address.
</p>
<h5>Automatically populating the DNS with millions of pieces of structured data</h5>
<p>
  As well as offering a simple, user-friendly way to adopt NUM, the NUM Server also helps overcome the chicken-and-egg problem. We&nbsp;intend to populate NUM records for millions of domain names based on website information hosted on those domain names. We&nbsp;expect to publish this data in early 2021.
</p>
<h5>Free, unrestricted and unlimited access to data</h5>
<p>
  Since NUM data is stored and served using DNS it's ultra-fast, reliable and massively scalable. Access to records on the NUM Server is free, unrestricted and unlimited forever. NUM enables organisations and individuals to take back control of their data and provides a valuable resource to developers building devices, apps and services.
</p>
<h5>Find out more</h5>

<h5>Experimenting with NUM</h5>

<h2 id="what-is-xls">What is XLS?</h2>
<p>The XLS (Accelerated HW Synthesis) project aims to enable the rapid development
of <em>hardware IP</em> that also runs as efficient <em>host software</em> via "software
style" methodology.</p>
<p>XLS implements a High Level Synthesis (HLS) toolchain which produces
synthesizable designs from flexible, high-level descriptions of functionality.
It is fully Open Source: Apache 2 licensed and developed via GitHub.</p>
<p>XLS is used inside of Google for generating feed-forward pipelines from
"building block" routines / libraries that can be easily retargeted, reused, and
composed in a latency-insensitive manner.</p>
<p><em>Not yet available</em>, but active work in progress is the implementation of XLS
<em>concurrent processes</em>, in Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) style, that
allow pipelines to communicate with each other and induct over time.</p>
<p>XLS is still experimental, undergoing rapid development, and not an officially
supported Google product. Expect bugs and sharp edges. Please help by trying it
out, <a href="https://github.com/google/xls/issues">reporting bugs</a>, and letting us know
what you think!</p>
<h2 id="building-from-source">Building From Source</h2>
<p>Currently, XLS must be built from source using the Bazel build system.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Binary distributions of the XLS library are not currently available, but
we hope to enable them via continuous integration, <a href="https://github.com/google/xls/issues/108">see this issue</a>.</p>
<p>The following instructions are for the Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) Linux distribution.
Note that we start by assuming <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html">Bazel has been
installed</a>.</p>
<pre><code># Follow the bazel install instructions:
# https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html
#
# Afterwards we observe:

$ bazel --version
bazel 3.2.0

$ sudo apt install python3-dev python3-distutils python3-dev libtinfo5

# py_binary currently assume they can refer to /usr/bin/env python
# even though Ubuntu 20.04 has no `python`, only `python3`.
# See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8685

$ mkdir -p $HOME/opt/bin/
$ ln -s $(which python3) $HOME/opt/bin/python
$ echo 'export PATH=$HOME/opt/bin:$PATH' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc

$ bazel test -c opt ...
</code></pre>

<p>A reference build/test environment setup is also provided via <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>~$ git clone https://github.com/google/xls.git
~$ cd xls
~/xls$ docker build .  # Performs optimized build and test.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="stack-diagram-and-project-layout">Stack Diagram and Project Layout</h2>
<p>Navigating a new code base can be daunting; the following description provides a
high-level view of the important directories and their intended organization /
purpose, and correspond to the components in this XLS stack diagram:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>The phrase, "no man is an island," penned by English poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Donne" rel="noopener" target="_self">John Donne</a> in the 17th century, and championed in Bon Jovi’s song, Santa Fe, offers insight into a hallmark of productive workplaces: the importance of collaboration. When people can work together in harmony to achieve goals and get into a flow, the output isn’t just better, the environment is too. A Stanford <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103114000420?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener" target="_self">study</a> found teams that work collaboratively report significantly higher levels of engagement, lower fatigue, and overall higher success rates.</p><p>These days, so many of our workstreams and processes are cross-functional and require some form of cooperation. Which is why a well run system of collaboration is critical to team effectiveness. And while collaboration in a shared workspace can be challenging, collaborating with a remote team can be even more daunting. Especially when the main reason your company decided to go remote is a global pandemic.</p><p>Working from home can often feel like you're on an island, separated from colleagues, and left to deal with complex problems on your own. Or to figure out how to connect with your team while being respectful of their time. For most of us, it feels more comfortable brainstorming and bouncing ideas off one another in person—partially because it's what's familiar. But how do we take this clearly beneficial activity (collaborating) that’s vital to achieving our goals, and make it work effectively in our remote world?</p><p>Understanding what makes collaboration useful and how to adapt your processes to improve the way you collaborate is a start. Also, it’s important to address root issues that can derail remote collaboration and to have fun while doing it. Being intentional about how you bring people together and rejiggering your operational processes is essential to making sure your team functions like a well-oiled machine.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/1372b1fa5071c46caf22a64a946dae10481353e7-2000x945.png?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="What is remote collaboration?"></p><h3><strong></strong></h3><h2><strong>What is remote collaboration?</strong></h2><p>At the most basic level, collaboration is the act of working jointly with others. It's people with different perspectives, roles, and subject knowledge coming together to share and shape work. Ideally this effort leads to a result that is better—more effective, more efficient, more impactful—than if someone toiled away on their own.</p><p>From landing humankind on the moon to mending centuries old divides between countries, when collaboration works well, it can yield breakthroughs previously thought impossible.&nbsp; It can even create social networks that change the face of human interaction, connecting over <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-statistics-for-social-media-managers/" rel="noopener" target="_self">50% of the world's population or more than 3.8 billion people</a>.</p><h2><strong>Remote work has changed the way we collaborate</strong></h2><p>In the past, we've almost exclusively done collaboration in-person. Whether it's bringing teams together that are spread across the globe for offsites or hopping into a meeting room in the office and creating elaborate "brainstorming art" on the whiteboard for all to see.</p><p>However, the way we work has shifted in the last few years—accelerated by the adoption of remote work due to COVID-19. But just because your entire team is dispersed, doesn't mean that collaboration is any less meaningful or critical&nbsp; to your team's success.</p><p>So, how do you make sure your team can still collaborate, and do it effectively? To avoid being one of the <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/06/75-of-cross-functional-teams-are-dysfunctional" rel="noopener" target="_self">75% of cross functional teams</a> that are dysfunctional because they lack a systemic approach to working together, we’ve put together 5 actionable tactics you can put into practice stat.<br></p><h3><strong>1) Know how and when to collaborate synchronously</strong></h3><p>Planning an office collaboration session typically involves finding time on people's calendars, booking a room, and making sure there are dry-erase markers for the meeting. For better or for worse, you and your team let the magic of being in one place for a singular purpose take over from there.</p><p>However, for remote collaboration to work well, there's an added element to keep in mind: being intentional when it comes to topics and outcomes. Without many of the same organic interpersonal cues that creative work sessions provide, being clear and upfront about what everyone hopes to get out of the session and how folks can help is essential.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/bd25745327c1a3485da1464ff7ad43f662089347-2000x945.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Planning for your remote collaborate ahead of time"></p><p>One way to do this is to encourage attendees to prepare a topic, a goal, and what type of input would be most useful ahead of time. This tactic will help keep the group focused and make sure you're maximizing time.</p><p>At the end of the session, do a recap to see if it was successful. Ask these two questions: "Has this session pushed the project forward in a meaningful way?" And "Do owners feel more prepared or have clear directives to tackle the challenges in front of them?"</p><p>It should be noted that not all real-time collaboration sessions need to conclude with clear action items to be meaningful. But this should be stated at the outset and the goal should reflect this as well.</p><p>Before you close Google Hangouts, Zoom, or Microsoft Teams, take a moment to assess how things went in terms of process and if there's something everyone would like to do differently in the next session. Iteration is an important part of the process.</p><p>Speaking of next time, another item to consider is the cadence or frequency of your collaboration sessions. These structured meetings for creative problem solving not only serve the purpose of pushing projects forward using your team's hive mind—in lieu of an office—they are a way to <a href="https://www.cmswire.com/social-business/energize-you-enterprise-with-collaboration/" rel="noopener" target="_self">connect and energize the team</a>.</p><p>Try hosting collaboration sessions twice a week, weekly, or every two weeks to determine what makes the most sense for your remote team. At the beginning, keep it consistent so that everyone gets used to the format and make the appropriate adjustments as you go along.</p><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/@headwayio" rel="noopener" target="_self"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/11eb91a1a0ac7f3a9e3168358fef18c7a66cd8d3-5472x3648.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Man communicating with his hands during collaboration."></a></p><p>Photo by Headway on Unsplash</p><h3><strong>2) Document your processes</strong></h3><p>When it comes to collaborating as a remote team, a shared understanding of process makes all the difference. This doesn't mean adding one new process after another. Instead, update your old processes for the remote context to help your team set expectations and be accountable to one another. It will give everyone a roadmap on how best to interact and communicate, and also take the guesswork out of <a href="https://www.range.co/blog/remote-onboarding-tips">onboarding new team members</a>.</p><p>One way to put a standard in place is to create a handbook—using a shared doc— that includes details about the best ways to communicate different types of messages and request feedback.</p><p>Think of it as a living document that can be updated as you test and learn how to best run your remote collaboration sessions. It should also add more color about how best to engage with someone on the team. Because everyone is working in very different environments, it can be difficult to know what impact having school-aged children doing remote learning or a roommate who hosts online fitness classes in the apartment will have on someone’s availability to collaborate. As things change, you’ll continue to update and evolve this document.</p><h3><strong>3) Make asynchronous collaboration a strength</strong></h3><p>One of the truly unique benefits of working remotely is leaning into collaborating asynchronously. In other words, being able to share and connect on topics and projects at the convenience of each team member and their schedules.</p><p>The staggered nature of asynchronous communication is a particular asset when you’re trying to keep the number of meetings down, while still ensuring everyone is in the loop and contributing. It will make your team more flexible and able to adjust to external influences more readily.</p><p>Start with the basics. There are a ton of tools and apps that make staying in sync when you’re not collaborating in real-time easy, like Google Docs, Asana, and Range. Build a culture of using comments and channels that allow people to share without being in the same place at the same time.<br></p><h3><strong>4) Your remote collaboration tool belt</strong></h3><p>Tools! They make collaborating across spaces and timezones possible. We’ve written about the <a href="https://www.range.co/blog/collaboration-tools-slack">magic of integrations</a> and how tools like Range are designed not to just facilitate remote collaboration, but also strengthen team culture every day with features like team building questions and sharing a mood with an emoji. Here a few other tools to have that will slot right into your new framework. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/49f172ea53d27bac3468d4c70b7fa2a5e8c6fd10-747x539.png?fm=jpg&amp;w=330&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="App integrations in Range"></p><ul><li><a href="https://slack.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Slack</a> - business communication platform</li><li><a href="https://www.range.co/">Range</a> - team success platform that keeps teams connected and on track</li><li><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">G Suite</a> - full suite of office productivity tools</li><li><a href="https://asana.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Asana</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/home" rel="noopener" target="_self">Trello</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" rel="noopener" target="_self">Jira</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://github.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">GitHub</a> - project management and file tracking tools</li><li><a href="https://mural.co/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Mural</a> -<strong> </strong>whiteboarding app<br></li></ul><h3><strong>5) All work and no play makes for dull collaboration</strong></h3><p>While collaborating remotely is undoubtedly about getting work done, you can still have a little bit of fun while you're at it. In fact, adding fun into the mix can help strengthen ties between your team and encourage engagement.</p><p>Playing a <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ice-breaker-games" rel="noopener" target="_self">quick game</a>, answering an <a href="https://icebreaker.range.co/" rel="noopener" target="_self">icebreaker</a>, or putting on music to kick things off are great ways to include levity and get people in the spirit of creative problem solving. Test different ones, rotate them around, and collectively figure out what works to get your team into the best collaboration mode.</p><h3><strong>Go forth and collaborate!</strong></h3><p>Now that you’re armed with these five tips on how to work better together as a team, it’s time to go reimagine the way your remote team collaborates. But the fun doesn’t stop once you’re safely back in the office—you should continue many of these practices when you’re co-located again. At the heart of this exercise is improving how you collaborate in general. Afterall all, great remote collaboration is just great collaboration.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/25a15bef9b76411971fd43c5d8a52fcb76f43685-480x270.gif" alt="Christina Tosi saying teamwork on Master Cher"></p><hr><p><a href="https://range.co/signup">Sign up for Range</a></p></div></div></section></div>]]>

</span><span>Videos</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>and</span> 
</span><span>Texts</span><span work="" sans";"=""><span>. The posts are similar enough that they will share certain attributes (like a title), but also different enough that they will require unique columns (a url column for video). In addition, we want to have a newsfeed feature where we display all posts by most recently created. This means we need to have a way to query across the entire</span> 
</span><span>Posts</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>architecture.</span></span></p><p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>This problem is generally solved in one of two ways in Rails:</span> 
</span><span>single table inheritance</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>(STI) or</span> 
</span><span>abstract classes</span><span>. Since ActiveRecord models do not have to be backed by a database table, these solutions leverage Plain Old Ruby Objects in order to represent this inheritance hierarchy. Polymorphic associations also often get thrown into the mix but don't quite fit our use case (we’ll briefly touch on this). We’ll discuss the pros and cons of each of these approaches and shed light on a new Rails feature that combines the best of both worlds.</span></p>  
  
 <h4><span>Single Table Inheritance (STI)</span></h4> 
  
<p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>In an STI implementation, attributes are stored in a single parent class table and a</span> 
</span><span>type</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>column holds the name of the subclass for the given row. Subclasses inherit from the parent class which allows us to write Text specific methods on the Text class without polluting the Video class.&nbsp; Generating a newsfeed is also very straightforward since all the data is in a single table, i.e. we can do things like</span> 
</span><span>Posts.order(created_at: :desc)</span><span>.<br></span><span><br></span></p></div> <p><a id="1268435434" data-caption="STI example"><img src="https://lirp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/8a8eebaa/dms3rep/multi/opt/Screen+Shot+2020-08-02+at+11.00.04+AM-1920w.png" alt="" id="1798209722" data-dm-image-path="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/8a8eebaa/dms3rep/multi/Screen+Shot+2020-08-02+at+11.00.04+AM.png" onerror="handleImageLoadError(this)"></a> 
</p> 
 <div data-dmtmpl="true" data-element-type="paragraph" data-version="5" id="1828567217" data-uialign="center"><p><span>STI is simple to implement but can quickly get unwieldy as slight differences in models introduce new fields.&nbsp; This leads to wide tables that are full of null values storing information for a collection of now distinct models that are forced to share the same table.</span></p>  
 <h4><span>Abstract Classes</span></h4> 
  
<p><span>Abstract Classes solve the problem of wide tables by giving each model its own table and connecting them via an Abstract Base Model - the parent class cannot be instantiated and must be subclassed to be utilized. Where the entire hierarchy was represented in a single table in STI, the opposite is true using abstract classes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>This gives us the ability to separate unique attributes to distinct tables, but now we have the opposite problem - repetitive columns. The</span> 
</span><span>author</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>and</span> 
</span><span>title</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>columns will have to be included in all subclasses. We have also lost the ability to query across the entire hierarchy (i.e.</span> 
</span><span>Posts.all</span><span work="" sans";"=""><span>), making our newsfeed unnecessarily cumbersome.</span> 
</span></p></div>

</p> 
  
 <p><span>We've established that both methods have their strengths but are not without significant drawbacks. So what's the solution?</span></p> 
  
 <div data-dmtmpl="true" data-element-type="paragraph" data-version="5" id="1670289024" data-uialign="center"> <h4><span>Delegated Types</span></h4> 
  
<p><span><span>*At the time of writing, this feature is only included in edge Rails and is expected to be included in the next minor release (6.1.0). However,</span> 
</span><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/39341" target="_blank" runtime_url="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/39341" type="url">the code</a><span> <span>can be pulled from the Rails codebase and included in ApplicationRecord to be used right away*</span></span></p><p><span>Delegated types take the best of STI and abstract classes and merge them into a single solution. Both the superclass and subclasses are backed by database tables, allowing for common attributes to live in the parent class table and unique attributes to live in the subclass tables.</span><span><br></span></p></div>

 <div data-dmtmpl="true" data-element-type="paragraph" data-version="5" id="1860625639" data-uialign="center"><p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>So what's happening here? By including</span> 
</span><span>delegated_type :postable</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>on the</span> 
</span><span>Post</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>model, it adds a polymorphic belongs_to relationship to</span> 
</span><span>postable</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>under the hood. So far, this is the same as setting up a regular polymorphic association minus the syntactical difference. However, where polymorphic relationships define an interface for a “has_many” relationship, delegated types define an interface for “has_one”. That distinction is what allows us to isolate shared attributes in a separate table, but still be able to retrieve values specific to a delegated type row.&nbsp;</span></span></p></div>

</span><span>can</span><span single-space="true"> <span></span> 
</span><span>be</span><span> <span>commented on” vs “X and Y models are</span> 
</span><span>types</span><span> <span>of comments”.</span></span></p><p><span><br>Going back to delegated types, creating a new Video record looks something like this:</span></p></div>

<b>Summary</b>: In this course we explain how category theory—a branch of mathematics known for its ability to organize the key abstractions that structure much of the mathematical universe—has become useful for writing elegant and maintainable code. In particular, we'll use examples from the Haskell programming language to motivate category-theoretic constructs, and then explain these constructs from a more abstract and inclusive viewpoint. Hands-on programming exercises will be used to demonstrate categorical ideas like "the universal property of products" in working Haskell code. A rough list of topics includes: 
</p><ol>
<li>Sets, types, categories, functors, natural transformations</li>
<li>Universal constructions and associated data types</li>
<li>Adjunctions and cartesian closed categories</li>
<li>Algebras, catamorphisms, anamorphisms</li>
<li>Monads, comonads, Kleisli arrows</li>
<li>Monoids, monoidal categories, lax monoidal functors, applicatives</li>
<li>Profunctors, (co)ends, optics</li>
</ol>
<b>We will assume no background knowledge on behalf of the student</b>, starting from scratch on both the programming and mathematics.

The aging heavy lifter, which will be phased out and replaced by <a href="https://www.ulalaunch.com/rockets/vulcan-centaur" target="_blank">Vulcan</a> over the next few years, had a <a href="https://twitter.com/torybruno/status/1299623698090135552" target="_blank">T-3 sec hotfire abort</a> complete with a dramatic fireball (<a href="https://youtu.be/1jkjgo0Cs_8" target="_blank">video</a>). The rocket and payload are undamaged, but launch is delayed a week or more while expendable ground systems are replaced. Next up was SpaceX, launching <a href="https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/saocom-1.htm" target="_blank">SAOCOM-1B</a> into a polar orbit, the <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/08/spacex-polar-cape-50-years/" target="_blank">first such southward flight path from Florida since 1969</a> when <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/science/herd-shot-around-the-world-the-last-east-coast-polar-launch/article/567614" target="_blank">booster debris landed on Cuba</a> and <a href="https://www.mapfreglobalrisks.com/risks/images/Seguros_de_satelites_ENU_tcm1366-435032.pdf" target="_blank">killed a cow named Rufina</a> 🐮. Returning to this flight path was only possible due to the Falcon 9’s automated self-destruct systems—rocket exhaust in this flight path can block manually radioed abort messages. This launch was also temporarily halted due to its overflight of ULA’s aborted NROL-44 payload (expensive!) and required last minute approval from the NRO. To cap the weekend off,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/i-cant-believe-its-not-optical/" target="_blank">Rocket Lab returned to flight with their 14th mission</a> (and announced that they will be conducting a first soft ocean splashdown of the booster for their 17th mission). Their&nbsp;<em>I Can’t Believe It’s Not Optical</em> mission was a dedicated launch for <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/technology" target="_blank">Capella Space</a>, a startup focused on capturing 0.5 m resolution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar" target="_blank">synthetic aperture radar</a> (SAR) data as a service, the first of an eight satellite constellation. (<em>Ed., amusingly, this satellite was originally supposed to launch as a rideshare with SAOCOM-1B, but when that mission was delayed, Capella switched to Rocket Lab, which was then delayed by a July 4th failure, eventually launching just a few hours after the original mission. You just can’t get ahead. </em>🤷‍♂️)</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#etc">¶</a><strong id="etc">Etc.</strong></p><ul><li>Explore Mars has <a href="https://www.exploremars.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/H2MR_2020_Web_v1.pdf" target="_blank">released their annual Humans to Mars report</a> detailing progress towards human exploration of the planet in the 2030s.</li><li>The US Department of Education has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ctemissioncubesat.com/" target="_blank">announced a CubeSat mission design and prototyping challenge for High School students</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>By now, we all have learned to work with Zoom, GMeet, and other online tools. But what’s going on in the event industry? How do organizers attract speakers and grow their audience for online events? I interviewed Oli Makhasoeva – the main organizer of the biggest Haskell online event, Haskell Love Conference, in which <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-to-core">our developer Vlad had a chance to participate in</a>.</em></p><p><em>We talk about their experience organizing Haskell Love, how they kept it accessible for developers of all levels, and what things one should definitely keep in mind when organizing an online conference.</em></p><p><strong>– Hi Oli, first of all, thank you for organizing the biggest Haskell online event! How did it go from your point of view?</strong></p><p>Thank you! We were relatively lucky; no major incidents, although we had some technical challenges. On the first day, we were unable to use our remote desktop, but we were fortunate enough to have a backup. Otherwise, the conference went amazing: a lot of participation from the audience, endless chats; the statistics say we had more than 2000 unique attendees. Many people reached out directly and thanked us for the event – the Haskell community is truly friendly and welcoming. We were happy to see people having conversations during the event at the Hallway track: not only about Haskell, but also about technology and life in general.</p><p><strong>– Tell us about your team of organizers. How did you decide to work together and create the Haskell Love Conference?</strong></p><p>I am proud to say it’s a women organized conference! Most of us know each other for quite a while, from university times. We have Elena who is responsible for planning, Ida who held communications, Margarita worked with sponsors. All of them are professionals, and I am happy to have them. What’s also important, our volunteers had a wide variety of skills and did an amazing job staffing the conference and inspiring others.</p><p>The idea to organize Haskell Love came after we organized the Scala Love conference together. We thought – why not spread the love further to other communities? To achieve this goal, we started a company called <a href="https://konfy.care/">Konfy</a>. Our motto is “Konfy - make your conference comfortable”. Our conferences will always be virtual and free to attend. &lt;3
<img src="https://serokell.io/files/nf/nfjjia3k.oli.png" alt="Oli Makhasoeva"></p><p><strong>– The website says that the conference accepts people with monad-o-phobia. ;) How do you make Haskell events exciting and accessible for everyone, no matter the level of experience the audience has?</strong></p><p>Our program committee worked hard on making sure we included talks of different levels. However, we did not properly promote the level of the talks. We should have tagged all the talks and let people know the levels of the sessions. Action item for the next conference is created! We know how to make it better :)</p><p><strong>– What are the main pros and cons of online conferences vs. offline ones? Are there any specific things you did to make the online conference feel more like the offline one?</strong></p><p>Unlike offline ones, online conferences are accessible from everywhere to anyone with the internet (we even provided a low res streaming option because it was requested by someone with a weak internet connection). You can cover multiple time zones! No dietary restriction problems! Zero CO<sub>2</sub> footprint! And a bigger audience for sponsors! :) These are the advantages of virtual events.</p><p>At an offline event, we gather people in a conference room. You go to a closed place, focus on a speaker, and emerge with new insights. In the case of online events, you think: “I’ll watch a talk and do my other stuff so I don’t lose time.” But let’s be honest, it is harder to concentrate on an FP-oriented talk when you do something simultaneously. To help people to focus and to make our conference feel more like the offline one, we are trying to create an interactive and engaging environment at everyone’s home. That is, we are trying to immerse the person into the atmosphere of the conference with Q&amp;A rooms, the Hallway track, and the Twitter live stream. According to the feedback we got, we didn’t fail, but there is room for improvement.</p><p><strong>– The conference featured many impressive names such as Philip Wadler, Simon Peyton Jones, and others. How did you gather so many bright minds in one place?</strong></p><p>The Haskell community is full of enthusiasts who are willing to spend their time on a free conference and help the community. Speakers were awesome and supported our desire to gather Haskellers from around the world (also, they wanted to get our avatar 😉).</p><p><strong>– What is the most challenging thing in organizing an event like that?</strong></p><p>Building a flow for attendees: Q&amp;A sessions, the Hallway track, announcements, participation, how to move between them, and where to find information about each activity. We still need to improve that part a lot: people were confused by time zones, it wasn’t easy for them to keep track of so many places, etc.</p><p><strong>– To finish it up: what would be one piece of advice you would give to all who want to organize their own FP event?</strong></p><p>Indeed, it was challenging, and we had to scramble, so we’d like to share what we learned in order to help others who are thinking about whether and how to host large events in the coming months: facilitation is the key. Investing in tools to make the sessions as interactive as possible, call-outs for questions before/during, live polls, etc. Don’t let people be silent and just watch a video, make an experience where many people get the feel of a community. If you need help with organizing an online event, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:info@konfy.care">info@konfy.care</a>!</p><p>Many thanks to all who participated in this conference, we enjoyed it a lot and will come back next year! Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/_haskellove">Twitter</a> to be up to date with our plans. And don’t be upset if you missed the event, the videos are already out on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Konfy">our Youtube channel</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://www.karimarttila.fi/img/2020-09-01-using-clojure-in-command-line-with-babashka_img_1.png" alt="Ordinary Clojure code"></p>

<p><em>Ordinary Clojure code - can be run in REPL or in command line with Babashka (the whole file can be found <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/bb_postgres.clj">here</a> )</em></p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>I never bothered to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a> so that I could be really fluent with it. If I needed anything beyond basic Bash stuff I immediately used <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> in command-line scripting.</p>

<p>I’m currently implementing my Clojure simple server again, this time using the <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/integrant">Integrant</a> library. In this new version, I implemented three data stores: CSV, AWS DynamoDB, and Postgres. I had already implemented importing development data into DynamoDB (using Python), this time I used <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/Babashka">Babashka</a> to import development data into Postgres - mainly just to have an excuse to try if I could replace Python with Clojure when scripting something with Bash.</p>

<p>The scripts can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure">Clojure git</a> repo in directory <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/tree/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres">postgres</a>.</p>

<h3 id="developing-with-babashka">Developing with Babashka</h3>

<p>The really neat thing with Babashka is that you can develop your Babashka scripts as part of your Clojure project, or independently but using your favorite Clojure IDE. The picture above shows Clojure code in my favorite Clojure IDE, <a href="https://cursive-ide.com/">Cursive</a>. I have the Clojure code that imports data into the Postgres database in directory <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/tree/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres">postgres</a>, so I have the following extra path in my <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/deps.edn">deps.edn</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span> </span><span>:postgres</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:extra-paths</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"postgres"</span><span>]}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the nice thing is that I can develop the Clojure code as part of project’s other Clojure code. Let’s first create a short bash script that tells Babashka to run your Clojure code with a flag so that we know in the Clojure code when we are running the code using Babashka or using Clojure IDE REPL (file <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/run-bb-load-data.sh">run-bb-load-data.sh</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#/bin/bash</span>

<span>export </span><span>POSTGRES_PASSWORD</span><span>=</span>simpleserver
<span>export </span><span>RUNNING_BB</span><span>=</span>TRUE
bb bb_postgres.clj
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The flag is the <code>RUNNING_BB</code> export above.</p>

<p>Then in the Clojure code we have a top level form <code>(run-me)</code> in the namespace (file <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/bb_postgres.clj">bb_postgres.clj</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>run-me</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span>
  </span><span>"Loads data only if running from Babashka script which sets the environment variable.
  We don't want the repl to load the data when reloading the namespace.
  In repl experimentation use the rich comment below."</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>running-bb?</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>System/getenv</span><span> </span><span>"RUNNING_BB"</span><span>)]</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>running-bb?</span><span> </span><span>"TRUE"</span><span>)</span><span>
      </span><span>(</span><span>import-data</span><span>))))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>run-me</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I.e. when reloading the namespace REPL runs the code but if the flag is not set it doesn’t actually do anything - it imports the code only if we are running the code using Babashka. The reason for this is that when I reload the namespace as part of my Clojure workflow I don’t want the data import to happen. For development purposes to test importing data, or any other function, I have a <code>rich comment</code> at the end of the file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>comment</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span> </span><span>"dev-resources/data"</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>get-raw-products</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>get-product-groups</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>do</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>delete-products!</span><span>)</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>delete-product-groups!</span><span>))</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>vals</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>get-users</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span>))</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>load-users</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>vals</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>get-users</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span>)))</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>import-data</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>db-get-all-product-groups</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>db-get-all-products</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>comment</code> block is here so that REPL does not run this code when reloading, of course. The function calls you see inside the comment block are just experiments added in no particular order. I can send any of these forms individually to be evaluated in the REPL - a typical Clojure trick when developing with REPL.</p>

<h3 id="babashka-use-cases">Babashka Use Cases</h3>

<p>I really like the idea that I can now use Clojure in shell scripting. Of course I could use Clojure in shell scripting also without Babashka but JVM boot takes quite a long time which makes testing of the script in command line a bit painful. Not so with Babashka - Babashka boots lightning fast:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ&gt; <span>time </span>bb <span>'(println "Hello world!")'</span>
Hello world!

real	0m0.006s
user	0m0.003s
sys	0m0.003s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The use cases using Babashka in my personal scripting probably is a bit like I used Babashka to import data into the Postgres database in this exercise:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>run-sql</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>command</span><span>]</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>insert-product-group!</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>product-group</span><span>]</span><span>

<p>I.e. parsing CSV, transforming data, and then call some program with the transformed data, possibly read what was returned and do other stuff. You could possibly do all this using plain old Bash but I never bothered to learn Bash in that level that I can do more than test some flags and call other programs using Bash.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-use-the-babashka-script-in-this-exercise">How Do I Use the Babashka Script in This Exercise?</h3>

<p>I used Babashka to load development data into the Postgres data store. During development I built a custom Postgres image and provided a <a href="https://github.com/casey/just">Just</a> recipe to start the data store (file <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/Justfile">Justfile</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Start local postgres</span>
@postgres:
    <span>cd </span>postgres <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ./run-docker-compose.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/run-docker-compose.sh">run-docker-compose.sh</a> starts the Postgres docker container, creates the schema and finally calls <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/run-bb-load-data.sh">./run-bb-load-data.sh</a> which loads the data into the development Postgres data store:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"NOTE: Remember to destroy the container if running again!"</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"Starting docker compose..."</span>

<span>sleep </span>5
<span>echo</span> <span>"Creating Simple Server schemas..."</span>
./create-schema.sh
<span>sleep </span>1
<span>echo</span> <span>"Loading data..."</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="clojure-babashka-vs-python-in-shell-scripting">Clojure (Babashka) vs Python in Shell Scripting</h3>

<p>Let’s finally compare Python and Clojure (Babashka) when doing some Linux shell scripting.</p>

<p><strong>Easiness</strong>. Both languages are pretty easy and fast to work if you have used them. Developing Python scripts is pretty fast - you just run the script in command line. Working with Clojure has one additional plus: you can use the Clojure REPL.</p>

<p><strong>Library support</strong>: Python wins. When you are scripting in Python and you realize that it would be nice e.g. to use some AWS library - just use it (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/dynamodb/pysrc/table_importer.py">table_importer.py</a> - the AWS <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html">boto3</a> library). The library support for Babashka is not as extensive, of course - but Babashka supports quite many namespaces outside <code>clojure.core</code> and also some additional libraries: <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka#built-in-namespaces">Babashka built-in namespaces</a> - keep eye on that page, maybe Babashka library support is growing in the future!</p>

<p>So, the library support might not be as good as with Python. But I really do love Clojure and if I’m implementing apps using Clojure it is really nice to do some ad hoc scripting using Babashka.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>It’s nice to have another scripting tool in my toolbox: <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka">Babashka</a>. Time will tell if I start using Clojure instead of Python as my preferred scripting language, thanks to Babashka. At least in this exercise Babashka did really well.</p>

                <!-- Toc if any -->

<p>Once <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices/" target="_blank">you have adopted an AWS tagging strategy</a>, you’ll need to make sure that all your existing AWS resources and any new ones you create abide by it. Consistency is the key - if you don’t proactively enforce your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll always be playing catch up and chasing down team members to make sure they add the right tags to their resources.</p>

<p>While you can apply AWS tags to your resources manually using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/resourcegroupstaggingapi/tag-resources.html" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/tag-editor.html" target="_blank">AWS Tag Editor</a>, you’ll probably find this cumbersome and error-prone at scale. A better approach is to automatically apply AWS tags to your resources and use rules to enforce their consistent usage.</p>

<p>Depending on the tool you use to maintain your infrastructure on AWS, your method of proactively enforcing AWS tags on new resources may vary. In this guide, I’ll highlight two tools: Terraform and AWS CloudFormation. You’ll see how to use each to create and update AWS cost allocation tags on your resources and then enforce the proper use of specific tags for new resources. By proactively enforcing your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll minimize your time spent auditing and correcting improper AWS tags and force developers to learn best AWS tagging best practices for your environment.</p>



<p>The first infrastructure management tool I’ll cover is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a>. Terraform works across a variety of cloud hosting providers to help you provision and maintain your AWS resources. With Terraform, you can define your servers, databases, and networks in code and apply your changes programmatically to your AWS account.</p>

<p>If you’re new to Terraform, they have a well-documented <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/intro" target="_blank">Getting Started guide</a> and several <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/tree/master/examples" target="_blank">AWS template examples on GitHub</a>. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo Terraform project and module that <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-terraform-demo" target="_blank">is available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</li>
  <li>Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</li>
  <li>Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tag-a-new-aws-ec2-instance-with-terraform">Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</h3>

<p>If you want to deploy an EC2 instance with AWS Tags using Terraform, your configuration might include something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28
29
30
31
</pre></td><td><pre>resource "aws_instance" "cart" {
  connection {
    type = "ssh"
    user = "ubuntu"
    host = self.public_ip
    private_key = file(var.private_key_path)
  }

  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  ami = var.aws_amis[var.aws_region]

  key_name = aws_key_pair.auth.key_name

  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.default.id]

  subnet_id = aws_subnet.default.id

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get -y update",
      "sudo apt-get -y install nginx",
      "sudo service nginx start",
    ]
  }
  tags = {
    contact = "j-mark"
    env = "dev"
    service = "cart"
  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above example includes three AWS cost allocation tags: <code>contact</code>, <code>env</code>, and <code>service</code> with values described as strings. When you <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html" target="_blank">apply this configuration</a>, Terraform will connect to AWS and deploy an EC2 instance having the AWS tags you specified.</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383259429_cf-2020-08-02-a.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="using-terraform-to-update-existing-aws-tags">Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</h3>

<p>Terraform makes it easy to update already existing resources with AWS tags in reversible and consistent ways. If you’re using AWS tags to keep track of a resource’s contact (e.g.: <code>j-mark</code> in the above example), you’re likely to need to update the AWS tag when the team member leaves or changes roles.</p>

<p>To update the AWS tags on your resource, simply update the corresponding tags in your Terraform configuration. The new tags will overwrite any previous tags assigned to the resource, including tags added outside of Terraform.</p>

<p>For example, to change the <code>contact</code> cost allocation tag on the EC2 instance above, you might update the <code>tags</code> block above with the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>tags = {
  contact = "l-duke"
  env = "dev"
  service = "cart"
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you apply this configuration, the AWS tags will be automatically updated in the AWS console:</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383277121_cf-2020-08-02-b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If you keep your Terraform configuration files in version control - which is probably a good idea - you will be able to see how tags have changed over time. You can also review changes using the same code review process that your application code goes through to help you catch mistakes in the execution of your tagging strategy.</p>

<h3 id="enforce-aws-tags-with-terraform">Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</h3>

<p>As your infrastructure grows, a code review process likely won’t be enough to prevent improper AWS tagging. Fortunately, you can enforce AWS tag names and values using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html" target="_blank">variables</a> and custom validation rules in Terraform.</p>

<p>In the examples above, the <code>tags</code> list was hard-coded into the EC2 instance definition. A more scalable pattern would be to break your EC2 instance template into its own <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/modules.html" target="_blank">module</a> and use a <code>tags</code> variable. You can then write a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#custom-validation-rules" target="_blank">custom validation rule</a> to check that the tags comply with your strategy.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to check that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The user specifies at least one tag</li>
  <li>The <code>contact</code> tag is either <code>j-mark</code> or <code>l-duke</code></li>
  <li>The <code>env</code> tag is set</li>
  <li>The <code>service</code> tag is either <code>cart</code> or <code>search</code></li>
</ol>

<p>You might create a module with a variable specified like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre>variable "tags" {
  description = "The tags for this resource."
  validation {
    condition = length(var.tags) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; contains(["j-mark", "l-duke"], var.tags.contact) &amp;&amp; var.tags.env != null &amp;&amp; contains(["cart", "search", "cart:search"], var.tags.service)
    error_message = "Invalid resource tags applied."

  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now when you run <code>terraform plan</code> with a missing or invalid tag, you’ll get an error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>Error: Invalid value for variable
...
Invalid resource tags applied.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your rules can be as complex as <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html" target="_blank">Terraform’s Configuration Language</a> allows, so functions like <code>regex()</code>, <code>substr()</code>, and <code>distinct()</code> are all available. That said, there are some caveats to this approach.</p>

<p>First, custom variable validation is an experimental feature in Terraform. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/terraform.html#experimental-language-features" target="_blank">Experimental features</a> are subject to change, meaning that you might need to pay attention to Terraform update mores closely. To enable <code>variable_validation</code>, add the following to your <code>terraform</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>terraform {
  experiments = [variable_validation]
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Second, Terraform’s variable validation only happens during the <code>terraform plan</code> phase of your infrastructure’s lifecycle. It can’t prevent users from accidentally changing your tags directly in the AWS console, and it’s only as good as the validation rules you write. If you start using a new resource but forget to add validation rules, you might end up with lots of resources that don’t adhere to your tagging strategy.</p>

<p>Another option for paid Terraform Cloud customers is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/index.html" target="_blank">Sentinel</a>, which allows you to create custom policies for your resources. I won’t cover this method here, but Terraform has created an <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/examples.html" target="_blank">example policy</a> to show you how to enforce mandatory AWS tags.</p>



<p>Similar to Terraform, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">CloudFormation</a> lets you provision AWS resources based on configuration files. Unlike Terraform, CloudFormation is part of Amazon’s offerings, so it won’t necessarily help you if you want to use another infrastructure provider. The approach to tagging your resources in CloudFormation is similar to that used by Terraform, but as you’ll see, the configuration format is different.</p>

<p>If you’re new to AWS CloudFormation, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/GettingStarted.Walkthrough.html" target="_blank">Amazon’s official walkthrough</a> will help you get started deploying some basic templates. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo AWS CloudFormation template which is <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-cloudformation-demo" target="_blank">also available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags section:</p>

<ol>
  <li>AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</li>
  <li>Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</li>
  <li>CloudFormation Template to Enforce AWS Tags</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="aws-cloudformation-template-to-deploy-tags">AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</h3>

<p>AWS CloudFormation is designed to make it easy to create AWS resources with a single template file. Using a CloudFormation template, every resource that can be deployed with an AWS tag.</p>

<p>For example, to create a new EC2 instance with the same three AWS tags used in the Terraform example above, add an array of <code>Tags</code> to the resource’s <code>Properties</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8

14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21

23
24
</pre></td><td><pre>"Resources" : {
  "WebServerInstance": {  
    "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
    "Metadata" : {...},
    "Properties": {
      "Tags" : [
       {
          "Key" : "contact",
          "Value" : "j-mark"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "env",
          "Value" : "dev"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "service",
          "Value" : "cart"
       }
      ],
      ...       
    }
  },
  ...         
},
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a>, you can <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack.html" target="_blank">deploy this CloudFormation template as a new stack</a>. This will ensure your template is valid and create the specified resources with their tags on AWS:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you have lots of similar resources in your template, you can deploy AWS tags to all the resources in the stack at once using the <code>--tags</code>  flag with the <code>create-stack</code> or <code>update-stack</code> commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre># Creating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"

# Updating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation update-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="using-cloudformation-to-update-aws-tags">Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</h3>

<p>If you want to change the contact on your EC2 instance created above, simply change the <code>Tags</code> section of your template file and use the <code>[update-stack](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html)</code> <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html" target="_blank">command</a> to deploy your changes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre>"Tags" : [
 {
    "Key" : "contact",
    "Value" : "l-duke"
 },
  ...
],
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>AWS CloudFormation behaves the same way that Terraform does when you update tags outside your template file. Any tags set manually will be overridden by the <code>update-stack</code> …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I started investigating full-text search options recently. The use-case is real-time search over key-value pairs where the keys are strings and the values are either strings, numbers, or dates. It should enable full-text search over keys and values and range queries over numbers and dates with 1.5 million unique key-value pairs as the expected maximum search index size. The search company Algolia recommends an <a href="https://blog.algolia.com/algolia-v-elasticsearch-latency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">end-to-end latency budget</a> of no more than 50ms, so we’ll use that as our threshold.</p><h2 id="postgresql"><a href="#postgresql" jsx="[object Object]"></a>PostgreSQL</h2><p>I’m already familiar with PostgreSQL, so let’s see if it meets these requirements.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>When I was 15</strong>, one of my closest friends died unexpectedly. Our physics teacher broke the news to me after Iâ€™d sat an exam, having wondered all the way through why my friend wasnâ€™t there doing the same. I still donâ€™t have the words to describe how I felt: it was something approaching shock, distress, disorientation. I didnâ€™t know what to think, much less what to do. I spent many nights awake and many days in a daze.</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, when I was in graduate school, another friend died suddenly, a man I loved very much. I remember checking my phone and finding out, to my dismay, via text message. But while my initial response was much the same as before, there was a palpable difference in how I felt later on. While I was again surprised and saddened, I was much less disoriented than Iâ€™d been as a teenager. I could still think, and I could still get things done. It seemed to me that Iâ€™d become better at living with loss.</p>
<p>You might think that the reason for this difference is obvious â€“ I was older, and Iâ€™d had more experience in coping with death. But raw experience alone isnâ€™t enough: what matters more is whether we learn from experience. And learning from experience, especially an experience as difficult as the death of a loved one, can involve quite a lot. Among other things, it can involve creativity.</p>
<p>This claim might seem surprising. After all, creativity is often associated with the idea of a lone creative genius, an individual who not only excels at what they do, but also transforms the world in the process. Further, even if we donâ€™t limit ourselves to romantic or heroic perspectives on the nature and value of creativity, itâ€™s commonly thought that creativity at least aims at novelty or originality.</p>
<p>This way of thinking about creativity isnâ€™t universal. The <a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-complete-works-of-zhuangzi/9780231164740"><em>Zhuangzi</em></a> (èŽŠå­�), a classical Chinese philosophical and literary text, provides a different perspective. On one interpretation, creativity isnâ€™t conceived as aiming at novelty or originality, but rather <em>integration</em>. Instead of aiming at something new, it aims at something that combines well with the situation of which itâ€™s a part.</p>
<p>The story of Wheelwright Pian, from a chapter of the Zhuangzi known as the <em>Tian Dao</em> (å¤©é�“), meaning â€˜Heavenâ€™s Wayâ€™ or â€˜The Way of Heavenâ€™, effectively illustrates this perspective on creativity as it pertains to artists or artisans. In this short vignette, a wheelwright known as Pian (æ‰�) tells a duke that the book of sagesâ€™ advice heâ€™s reading is nothing but â€˜chaff and dregsâ€™. Angered, the duke demands an explanation. The wheelwright responds that, at least concerning his craft, he can create what he does only because heâ€™s developed a â€˜knackâ€™ for it that canâ€™t be wholly conveyed in words. If the blows of his mallet are too gentle, his chisel slides and wonâ€™t take hold. If theyâ€™re too hard, it bites in and wonâ€™t budge. â€˜Not too gentle, not too hard â€“ you can get it in your hand and feel it in your mind,â€™ he says. â€˜So, Iâ€™ve gone along for 70 years and at my age Iâ€™m still chiselling wheels. When the men of old died, they took with them the things that couldnâ€™t be handed down. So, what you are reading there must be nothing but the chaff and dregs of the men of old.â€™</p>
<p>Although heâ€™s a â€˜lowlyâ€™ craftsperson, the wheelwright has something important to teach the duke. Heâ€™s been creating wheels by hand for many years and has developed an ability to act and to execute his craft in an integrated manner that canâ€™t be fully captured through an algorithmic list of instructions. He responds to precise particularities in the wood, his tools and his body to create what he wants â€“ something he doesnâ€™t accomplish by imposing a plan.</p>
<p>Striving for originality can be counterproductive when it comes to achieving genuinely fresh results</p>
<p>The sagesâ€™ advice for living well is therefore mere â€˜dregsâ€™ if itâ€™s interpreted as instructions that one can simply read and then complete. Living well in general involves much more than this; namely, a spontaneous integration between contrasting types such as the hard and the soft, as well as the learned and the spontaneous, the active and the passive, and even the unproductive and the productive â€“ all of which apply in the case of carving wheels, as well as elsewhere. In other words, living well involves creativity.</p>
<p>This kind of creativity isnâ€™t taken to aim at novelty or originality as such. The wheelwright is presented as creative not because of anything to do with his, or his projectsâ€™, novelty or originality, but instead because of his ability to create wheels in a sensitive, responsive and â€“ crucially â€“ well-integrated manner: one not learned by rote, but rather via engaging in sustained, spontaneous activity.</p>
<p>We can use the story of Wheelwright Pian to better understand why learning to live with loss is a creative pursuit. Although thereâ€™s an abundance of books dispensing advice on how to do so, ultimately learning to live with death is a deeply personal endeavour that â€“ like carving wheels â€“ canâ€™t be fully captured through a programmatic set of directions. We must respond to precise particularities of our situation (concerning our thoughts, feelings and overall circumstances) to create what we want to create (such as a sense of peace or closure). This isnâ€™t something that can be accomplished by imposing a plan, even if we make various provisional and highly malleable â€˜plansâ€™ on the fly as we go along.</p>
<p>Moreover, in working through our thoughts, feelings and circumstances in all their particularities, itâ€™s not that weâ€™re doing anything all that different from what countless others have had to do as theyâ€™ve learned to cope with loss. Nonetheless â€“ again, like carving wheels â€“ itâ€™s plausibly a creative activity, in that it involves a spontaneous integration between contrasting types such as the grieving and the celebratory, the resentful and the grateful, the distressed and the joyous. The ability to live with death, too, in a sensitive, responsive, and well-integrated manner isnâ€™t learned by rote, but rather via engaging in sustained, spontaneous activity. Indeed, even the philosopher Zhuangzi himself can be understood as engaging in such a creative process after the death of his own wife in chapter 18 of the text, the <em>Zhi Le</em> (è‡³æ¨‚), meaning â€˜Perfect Happinessâ€™ or â€˜Perfect Joyâ€™.</p>
<p><strong>This way of thinking</strong> about creativity has a variety of other potential benefits. First, even if creativity were taken to aim at originality, de-emphasising originality might ironically result in greater creativity. This is because striving for originality can actually be counterproductive when it comes to achieving genuinely fresh results: if we focus on the task of achieving something original, weâ€™ll explore only the range of possibilities deemed sufficiently likely to yield that result, leaving out a lot that could have contributed to achieving something original.</p>
<p>But imagine instead that we worked with idea that creativity wasnâ€™t about novelty. That doesnâ€™t mean weâ€™d have to give up the value of originality entirely, but rather see it as one of a range of possible outcomes. Casting a wider net in this way might hence make creativity (whatever it involves) easier to achieve.</p>
<p>Second, focusing on integration could encourage us to better understand creative agents as being intimately connected with, and products of, their environments. This would broaden our notion of creativity in a way that might allow us to see creativity demanded in a greater range of activities. After all, many of lifeâ€™s activities, from the mundane to the meaningful, arenâ€™t learned by rote, but rather via spontaneous action that integrates contrasting aspects. Just for starters, additional examples might include getting along with oneâ€™s family, building relationships with colleagues and organising oneâ€™s finances.</p>
<p>This alternative perspective on creativity might help us to see it as an everyday phenomenon in which we all participate â€“ rather than an extraordinary talent or gift that only a few enjoy. And it might also allow us to make sense of the idea of <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-43893-1_19#:~:text=As%20an%20art%20practice%2C%20calligraphy,Daoist%20aesthetic%20concerns%20discussed%20here.&amp;text=The%20aesthetic%20of%20the%20everyday,and%20the%20need%20for%20imagination">living creatively</a>: of an integrated life, lived spontaneously, in which all of lifeâ€™s contrasting aspects can be arranged to form a rich and variegated whole.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="about-the-course"> About the course</h2>
<p>This is an online course on Functional Programming that uses the Haskell programming language. You can study at your own pace. All the material and exercises are openly available.</p>
<p>This course is aimed at beginners who wish to learn functional programming, but also people who have experience with functional programming and want to learn Haskell in particular. The course assumes no previous knowledge, but knowing at least one programming language beforehand will make the course easier.</p>
<p>Working on the exercises involves knowing how to use the command line, and basic usage of the Git version control system.</p>
<p>This is part 1 of a two-part course. Part 1 covers the basics of Haskell syntax and features. You will learn about recursion, higher-order functions, algebraic data types and some of Haskell’s advanced features. However, part 1 will stick to pure functional programming, without side-effects. I/O and Monads will be introduced in part 2.</p>
<h3 id="course-structure"> Course structure</h3>
<p>The course is split into 8 lectures. They are roughly the same size, but some lectures have more material than others. Each lecture set ends with 10-30 small programming exercises on the topics of the lecture.</p>
<h3 id="administrative-information-grading"> Administrative information, grading</h3>
<p>The course is worth 5 ECTS credits.</p>
<p>Grading is Fail/Pass/5. To pass the course you must complete at least 50% of each lecture’s exercises. A special grade of 5 is awarded to those who complete 99% of all exercises.</p>

<h2 id="haskell"> Haskell</h2>
<p>Haskell is</p>
<p><strong>Functional</strong> – the basic building blocks of programs are functions. Functions can return functions and take functions as arguments. Also, the only looping construct in Haskell is recursion.</p>
<p><strong>Pure</strong> - Haskell functions are pure, that is, they don’t have side effects. Side effects mean things like reading a file, printing out text, or changing global variables. All inputs to a function must be in its arguments, and all outputs from a function in its return value. This sounds restricting, but makes reasoning about programs easier, and allows for more optimizations by the compiler.</p>
<p><strong>Lazy</strong> - values are only evaluated when they are needed. This makes it possible to work with infinite data structures, and also makes pure programs more efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Strongly typed</strong> - every Haskell value and expression has a type. The compiler checks the types at compile-time and guarantees that no type errors can happen at runtime. This means no AttributeErrors (a la Python), ClassCastExceptions (a la Java) or segmentation faults (a la C). The Haskell type system is very powerful and can help you design better programs.</p>
<p><strong>Type inferred</strong> - in addition to checking the types, the compiler can deduce the types for most programs. This makes working with a strongly typed language easier. Indeed, most Haskell functions can be written completely without types. However programmers can still give functions and values type annotations to make finding type errors easier. Type annotations also make reading programs easier.</p>
<p><strong>Garbage-collected</strong> - like most high-level languages these days, Haskell has automatic memory management via garbage collection. This means that the programmer doesn’t need to worry about allocating or freeing memory, the language runtime handles all of it automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Compiled</strong> - even though we mostly use Haskell via the interactive GHCi environment on this course, Haskell is a compiled language. Haskell programs can be compiled to very efficient binaries, and the GHC compiler is very good at optimising functional code into performant machine code.</p>
<p>You’ll learn what these terms mean in practice during this course. Don’t worry if some of them sound abstract right now.</p>

<h3 id="features"> Features</h3>
<p>Here’s a showcase of some of the Haskell’s cool features:</p>
<p><strong>Higher-order functions</strong> – functions can take functions as arguments:</p>

<p>This results in <code>[3,6]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Anonymous functions aka lambdas</strong> – you can define single-use helper functions without giving them a name</p>

<p>This results in <code>["abc","ef"]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Partial application</strong> – you can define new functions by giving another function only some of the arguments it needs. For example this multiplies all elements in a list by 3:</p>

<p><strong>Algebraic datatypes</strong> – a syntax for defining datatypes that can contain a number of different cases:</p>

<p>Now the type <code>Shape</code> can have values like <code>Point</code>, <code>Rectangle 3 6</code> and <code>Circle 5</code></p>
<p><strong>Pattern matching</strong> – defining functions based on cases that correspond to your data definitions:</p>

<p><strong>Lists</strong> – Unlike many languages, Haskell has a concise built-in syntax for lists. Lists can be built from other lists using <em>list comprehensions</em>. Here’s a snippet that generates names of even length from a set of options for first and last names:</p>

<p>This results in <code>["EvaSmith","EvaOdd","MikeWood"]</code>. Thanks to the laziness of Haskell, we can even create so-called <em>infinite lists</em>:</p>

<p>The first ten prime numbers can be then obtained by evaluating</p>

<p>This evaluates to <code>[2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Parameterized types</strong> – you can define types that are parameterized by other types. For example <code>[Int]</code> is a list of <code>Int</code>s and <code>[Bool]</code> is a list of booleans. You can define typed functions that work on all kinds of lists, for example <code>reverse</code> has the type <code>[a] -&gt; [a]</code> which means it takes a list containing any type <code>a</code>, and returns a list of the same type.</p>
<p><strong>Type classes</strong> – another form of polymorphism where you can give a function a different implementation depending on the arguments’ types. For example the <code>Show</code> type class defines the function <code>show</code> that can convert types of various values to strings. The <code>Num</code> type class defines arithmetic operators like <code>+</code> that work on all number types (<code>Int</code>, <code>Double</code>, <code>Complex</code>, …).</p>
<h3 id="some-history"> Some History</h3>
<p>A brief timeline of Haskell:</p>
<ul>
<li>1930s: Lamba Calculus</li>
<li>1950s-1970s: Lisp, Pattern Matching, Scheme, ML</li>
<li>1978 John Backus: <a href="https://www.thocp.net/biographies/papers/backus_turingaward_lecture.pdf">Can programming be liberated from the von Neumann style?</a></li>
<li>1987 A decision was made to unify the field of pure functional languages</li>
<li>1990 Haskell 1.0</li>
<li>1991 Haskell 1.1 (let-syntax, sections)</li>
<li>1992 Haskell 1.2, GHC</li>
<li>1996 Haskell 1.3 (Monads, do-syntax, type system improvements)</li>
<li>1999 Haskell 98</li>
<li>2000’s: GHC development, many extensions to the language</li>
<li>2009 <a href="http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/">The Haskell 2010 standard</a></li>
<li>2010’s: GHC development, Haskell Platform, Haskell Stack</li>
</ul>
<p>The word ‘haskel’ means wisdom in Hebrew, but the name of the Haskell programming language comes from the logician Haskell Curry. The name Haskell comes from the Old Norse words áss (god) and ketill (helmet).</p>
<h3 id="uses-of-haskell"> Uses of Haskell</h3>
<p>Here are some examples of software projects that were written in Haskell.</p>

<li>The <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> tool for converting between different document formats – it’s also used to produce this course material</li>
<li>The <a href="http://postgrest.org/">PostgREST</a> server that exposes a HTTP REST API for a PostgreSQL database</li>

<h2 id="running-haskell"> Running Haskell</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get Haskell is to install the <code>stack</code> tool, see <a href="http://haskellstack.org/">http://haskellstack.org</a>. The exercises on this course are intended to work with Stack, so you should use it for now.</p>
<p>By the way, if you’re interested in what Stack is, and how it relates to other Haskell tools like Cabal and GHC, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Cabal-and-Stack-in-Haskell-projects-Which-one-do-you-recommend-and-why">read more here</a> or <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/faq/">here</a>. We’ll get back to Haskell packages and using them in detail in part 2 of the course.</p>
<p>For now, after installing Stack, just run <code>stack ghci</code> to get an interactive Haskell environment.</p>
<h2 id="lets-start"> Let’s start!</h2>
<p>GHCi is the interactive Haskell interpreter. Here’s an example session:</p>
<pre><code>$ stack ghci
GHCi, version 8.0.1: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Prelude&gt; 1+1
2
Prelude&gt; "asdf"
"asdf"
Prelude&gt; reverse "asdf"
"fdsa"
Prelude&gt; :type "asdf"
"asdf" :: [Char]
Prelude&gt; tail "asdf"
"sdf"
Prelude&gt; :type tail "asdf"
tail "asdf" :: [Char]
Prelude&gt; :type tail
tail :: [a] -&gt; [a]
Prelude&gt; :quit
Leaving GHCi.</code></pre>
<p>By the way, the first time you run <code>stack ghci</code> it will download GHC and some libraries, so don’t worry if you see some output and have to wait for a while before getting the <code>Prelude&gt;</code> prompt.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through this. Don’t worry if you don’t understand things yet, this is just a first brush with expressions and types.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; 1+1
2</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Prelude&gt;</code> is the GHCi prompt. It indicates we can use the functions from the Haskell base library called Prelude. We evaluate 1 plus 1, and the result is 2.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; "asdf"
"asdf"</code></pre>
<p>Here we evaluate a string literal, and the result is the same string.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; reverse "asdf"
"fdsa"</code></pre>
<p>Here we compute the reverse of a string by applying the function <code>reverse</code> to the value <code>"asdf"</code>.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; :type "asdf"
"asdf" :: [Char]</code></pre>
<p>In addition to evaluating expressions we can also ask for their type with the <code>:type</code> (abbreviated <code>:t</code>) GHCi command. The type of <code>"asdf"</code> is a list of characters. Commands that start with <code>:</code> are part of the user interface of GHCi, not part of the Haskell language.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; tail "asdf"
"sdf"
Prelude&gt; :t tail "asdf"
tail "asdf" :: [Char]</code></pre>
<p>The <code>tail</code> function works on lists and returns all except the first element of the list. Here we see <code>tail</code> applied to <code>"asdf"</code>. We also check the type of the …</p></div></div></div>

September 2, 2020 | https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoConcurrencyStillNotEasy | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoConcurrencyStillNotEasy">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Even in Go, concurrency is still not easy (with an example)</h2>

	<p><small>September  1, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Go is famous for making concurrency easy, through good language
support for <a href="https://golangbot.com/goroutines/">goroutines</a>. Except
what Go makes easy is only one level of concurrency, the nuts and
bolts level of making your code do things concurrently and communicating
back and forth through channels. Making it do the right things
concurrently is still up to you, and unfortunately Go doesn't
currently provide a lot of standard library support for correctly
implemented standard concurrency patterns.</p>

<p>For example, one common need is for a limited amount of concurrency;
you want to do several things at once, but only so many of them.
At the moment this is up to you to implement on top of goroutines,
channels, and things like the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/"><code>sync</code></a>
package. This is not as easy as it looks, and quite competent people
can make mistakes here. As it happens, I have an example ready to
hand today.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/gops">Gops</a> is a convenient command to
list (and diagnose) Go processes that are currently running on your
system. Among other things, it'll tell you which version of Go they
were compiled with, which is handy if you want to see if you have out
of date binaries that should be rebuilt and redeployed. One of the
things <code>gops</code> needs to do is look at all of the Go processes on your
system, which it does concurrently. However, it doesn't want to look
at too many processes at once, because <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/pull/118">that can cause problems with
file descriptor limits</a>. This
is a classic case of <em>limited concurrency</em>.</p>

<p>Gops implements this at the moment with code in <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/blob/6fb0d860e5fa50629405d9e77e255cd32795967e/goprocess/gp.go#L29">goprocess.FindAll()</a>
that looks like this, in somewhat sketched and reduced form:</p>

<blockquote><pre>func FindAll() []P {
   pss, err := ps.Processes()
   [...]
   found := make(chan P)
   limitCh := make(chan struct{}, concurrencyProcesses)

   for _, pr := range pss {
      limitCh &lt;- struct{}{}
      pr := pr
      go func() {
         defer func() { &lt;-limitCh }()
         [... get a P with some error checking ...]
         found &lt;- P
      }()
   }
   [...]

   var results []P
   for p := range found {
      results = append(results, p)
   }
   return results
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(In the real code there's a WaitGroup for coordination, and the
<code>found</code> channel gets closed appropriately.)</p>

<p>How this works is clear, and is a standard pattern (covered in eg
Go 101's <a href="https://go101.org/article/channel-use-cases.html">Channel Use Cases</a>). We use a
buffered channel to provide a limited number of tokens; sending a
value into the channel implicitly takes a token (and blocks if the
token supply is exhausted), while receiving a value from it puts a
token back in. We take a token before we start a new goroutine, and
the goroutine releases the token when it's done.</p>

<p>Except that <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/issues/123">this code has a bug if there are too many processes
to examine</a>. Even knowing
that there is a bug in this code, it may not be obvious.</p>

<p>The bug is that the goroutines only receive from <code>limitCh</code> to release
their token after sending their result to the unbuffered <code>found</code>
channel, while the main code only starts receiving from <code>found</code>
after running through the entire loop, and <strong>the main code takes
the token in the loop and blocks if no tokens are available</strong>. So
if you have too many processes to go through, you start N goroutines,
they all block trying to write to <code>found</code> and don't receive from
<code>limitCh</code>, and the main <code>for</code> loop blocks trying to send to <code>limitCh</code>
and never reaches the point where it starts receiving from <code>found</code>.</p>

<p>At one level, this bug is a very fragile bug; it only exists because
of multiple circumstances. If the goroutines took the token by
sending to <code>limitCh</code> instead of the main <code>for</code> loop doing it, the
bug would not exist; the main <code>for</code> loop would start them all, many
would stop, and then it would go on to receive from <code>found</code> so that
they could receive from <code>limitCh</code> and release their token so other
goroutines would run. If the goroutines received from <code>limitCh</code> to
release their token before sending to <code>found</code>, it wouldn't exist
(but because of error handling, it's simpler and more reliable to
do the receive in a <code>defer</code>). And if the entire <code>for</code> loop was in
an additional goroutine, the main code would go on to receive from
<code>found</code> and unblock completed goroutines to release their tokens,
so the fact that the <code>for</code> loop was blocked waiting to send to
<code>limitCh</code> wouldn't matter.</p>

<p>At another level, this shows how concurrency is not easy as easy
as it looks in Go. All you need is one mistake and things skid to
a halt, and all of the code involved can look good to a casual
examination. Getting concurrency correct is simply hard for people
(we can debate about why, but I think that it is is very clear).</p>

<p>(I'm sure that the people who wrote and approved the change that
added this concurrency limiting code to gops were good programmers.
A tricky case still tripped them up, passing all of their scrutiny.
Even when I knew that there was a concurrency problem in the code
and where it was (because my <code>gops</code> was hanging all of a sudden,
and <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a> told me where
everything was stuck), it still took me some time to see what the
exact problem was.)</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>To build your own you'll need</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> (model Zero W works pretty good)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/">Raspberry Pi Camera Module</a></li>
<li>16GB SD Card or bigger</li>
<li>(optionally Wi-Fi connectivity for easy access)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is even an official <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/">High Quality Camera</a>, that will give even better quality time-lapses!</p>

</ul></li>
<li><a href="#raspberry-pi-time-lapse-repository">raspberry-pi-time-lapse repository</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<h3>Flash the Pi</h3>
<p>You'll need to flash Raspberry Pi OS on a fresh SD Card.</p>
<p>Either with <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">Balena Etcher</a> or the official <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a>. The procedure is extremely straight forward.</p>
<p>Just go through the steps and you have Rasperry Pi OS installed on a SD card.</p>
<h3>Set up Wi-Fi connectivity</h3>
<p>To get the Pi connect to your Wi-Fi, you'll need to create a file called <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> in the SD card.</p>
<p>The contents of <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> should look like this (configure it accordingly):</p>
<pre><code>ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
ap_scan=1
update_config=1

network={
  scan_ssid=1
  ssid="YOUR_WIFI_ACCESS_POINT"
  psk="YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Enable SSH access</h3>
<p>To enable SSH access (with the user <code>pi</code> and password <code>raspberry</code>), simply create an empty file (without extension), called <code>ssh</code> in the SD card.</p>
<h3>Enable Camera module</h3>
<p>To enable to camera module, you can configure it through the <code>raspi-config</code> utility.</p>
<p>But also with the file <code>config.txt</code> in SD card.</p>
<p>Open it and add the following to it:</p>
<pre><code>start_x=1
gpu_mem=128
</code></pre>
<p>Just make sure there are no other occurrencies for <code>start_x</code> or <code>gpu_mem</code></p>

<h2>Take image with raspistill</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><code>raspistill</code> is the command line tool for capturing still photographs with the camera module.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is to take a snapshot every x minutes using <code>raspistill</code></p>
<p>To take a single image, I'm using the following bash script called <code>/home/pi/take-snapshot</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

set -e

DATE=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
SNAPSHOTS_DIR=/home/pi/snapshots
SNAPSHOT_PATH="$SNAPSHOTS_DIR/$DATE.jpg"
CURRENT_PATH="$SNAPSHOTS_DIR/current.jpg"

echo "$DATE"
mkdir -p "$SNAPSHOTS_DIR"
echo "taking snapshot $SNAPSHOT_PATH"
raspistill \
    --width 1280 \
    --height 960 \
    --quality 100 \
    --output "$SNAPSHOT_PATH"
echo "snapshot saved $SNAPSHOT_PATH"

echo "adding watermark $SNAPSHOT_PATH"
cd $SNAPSHOTS_DIR
montage \
  -label "$DATE" \
  $SNAPSHOT_PATH \
  -pointsize 30 \
  -gravity Center \
  -geometry +0+0 \
  $SNAPSHOT_PATH

cp $SNAPSHOT_PATH $CURRENT_PATH
</code></pre>
<p>This script will take a snapshot, name it in the format <code>%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ.jpg</code> and put it in the folder <code>/home/pi/snapshots</code>.</p>
<p>At the end this photo is also watermarked using <code>montage</code> from the ImageMagick family.</p>
<h2>Schedule capture with crontab</h2>
<p>To take a photo every 5 minutes using the above script, you can set up a simple cron job for that.</p>
<p>Just run <code>crontab -e</code> to edit the cron schedules and add the following lines</p>
<pre><code>SHELL=/bin/bash
*/5 * * * * sh /home/pi/take-snapshot &gt;&gt; /home/pi/snapshots.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre>
<h2>Directory listing of snapshots</h2>
<p>You can expose a web server on port 80 to easily list all images (and time-lapses) taken in the folder <code>/home/pi/snapshots</code>.</p>
<p>Start the server at boot by adding the following to your crontab</p>
<pre><code>@reboot sudo python3 -m http.server --directory /home/pi/snapshots 80
</code></pre>
<h2>Create time-lapse with ffmpeg</h2>
<p>Taking a time-lapse for the day <code>2020-08-31</code> with ffmpeg is as easy as running</p>
<pre><code>cat 2020-08-31*.jpg | ffmpeg -r 10 -i - -c:v libx264 -vf "format=yuv420p,scale=1280:-2" time-lapse-2020-08-31.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>You can clone / fork the repo <a href="https://github.com/christian-fei/raspberry-pi-time-lapse">christian-fei/raspberry-pi-time-lapse</a> and create your first time-lapse in no time.</p>
<p>There are various scripts that simplify the steps above:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>take-snapshot</code> to take a watermarked and timestamped photo in the folder <code>snapshots/</code></li>
<li><code>server</code> to start a HTTP server on port 80 listing all snapshots and time-lapses taken so far</li>
<li><code>rsync-snapshots</code> to sync the snapshots to from the Raspberry Pi to your PC</li>
<li><code>create-time-lapse</code> to create a time-lapse for a specific date</li>
<li><code>crontab</code> to schedule the snapshots and spin up the server</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Something my colleagues know well is how little I trust online tools like <a href="https://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a>, online JSON validators or online tooling in general, but it also bleeds into <a href="https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2020/08/zebqf/">comments I make online</a> and in my blog posts, too, and I thought I'd share a little bit of a reason as to why.</p><p>Instead of using an online service, I will reach for a way to run it locally, using whichever programming language toolchain I have available. But why? Why wouldn't I recommend something like jwt.io? Or an online JSON validator, especially if they boast client-side functionality, and mean I don't need things installed?</p><p>Let's start with a bit of background. Firstly, I'd just like to caveat this all with the note that <strong>I have no access to Production data, customer or otherwise</strong>. All of these examples are referencing Non-Production examples.</p><p>I also want to caveat this with the fact that this is <strong>not a personal attack</strong> on jwt.io. I am using them as an example as they're a well-known and well-used service, and I've seen issues with it before. Auth0 run it, and are probably one of the few companies we'd want to be running it. It's also <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io">Open Source</a> <em>but</em> one of the great difficulties of Web-hosted services are that we have no idea if the source code that we're told is being used is actually being used!</p><p>I'm currently working on the Open Banking platform for Capital One. We're fortunate to have very restricted access to Production, which makes things safer for everyone. One thing we strive to do is to treat Non-Production secrets like Production ones where possible - where we shouldn't have access to them at all, and shouldn't be sharing them with external services. Some of these Non-Production secrets may be usable outside of Capital One, for instance Open Banking Sandbox signing certificates.</p><p>We perform a fair bit of testing in our Non-Production environments and sometimes need to debug things, such as what's inside a JWT (as Open Banking introduces several places they're used). I've been burned a number of times by folks putting a Non-Production JWT or an Open Banking Sandbox certificate into jwt.io. Although Non-Production, these are sensitive in of themselves, as they have implementation details for our services, and as mentioned, certain things could be used outside of Capital One.</p><p>The biggest reason I hear from folks using online tooling is that it's easier, and that they'd rather do that than find out how to run it locally. I disagree with this, but am quite biased, as I often have a blog post for many of these common issues. I love sharing my blog with others and having a handy solution, or if I don't have an answer to a problem, I'll find out how and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/tags/blogumentation/">blogument it for later</a>. So I see that reaching for online tooling is more just because we've got folks who aren't aware of how they could do otherwise.</p><p>One great thing about removing the need for an online tool is that you can self-serve it once you have the tools locally. You can run it locally when you've got no internet (which isn't as much of an issue in these Coronavirus times) but also regardless of whether the upstream service is broken. You can use it with other i.e. command-line tooling, for instance how I've set up <a href="https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/dotfiles-arch/-/blob/master/terminal/home/bin/unpack">this command-line script</a> to handle a lot of common data formats I deal with and unpack them to a human-readable format.</p><p>But most importantly, by telling people to put sensitive data (such as credentials, configuration files, etc) it's a really dangerous lesson for our teams. We're teaching people to blindly trust arbitrary websites that they don't have any relationship with, nor have fully audited the source code, when posting potentially sensitive data.</p><p>I realise this may not be something you do when running it locally, but it's less likely for a well-known library running locally to need to reach outbound.</p><p>jwt.io is an interesting example, because although it boasts that it runs as a client-side solution, you may not have been aware that <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io/commit/b362ab19a9f37e337b5f8ea38987aa680aa6e0a9">until last September</a>, there were metrics being determined which although may have seemed innocent, show that it's easy for other functionality to be hidden in a seemingly client-side-only website. Unless you audit everything, every time, you're in a risky position where you may be leaking data you're not expecting to.</p><p>I feel that we can do something to help services that handle potentially sensitive data with helping educate the user that they should be more careful, because jwt.io's warning definitely doesn't help with folks who don't fully appreciate what the risk is if jwt.io isn't actually as trustworthy as the user thinks:</p><blockquote><p>Warning: JWTs are credentials, which can grant access to resources. Be careful where you paste them! We do not record tokens, all validation and debugging is done on the client side.</p></blockquote><p>What do you think? Am I maybe being a little too sensitive? Am I not being sensitive enough?</p><p>Edit: Based on some conversations being had in response to the post, I thought it'd mention I've written about how to <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/06/13/pretty-printing-jwt-openssl/">pretty-print a JWT locally with OpenSSL</a> and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2018/08/31/pretty-printing-jwt-ruby/">a Ruby alternative</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>In the early 70s, C was created at Bell Labs as a byproduct of the development of UNIX.
It quickly became one of the most popular programming languages.
But it was not expressive enough for Bjarne Stroustrup.
And so, in 1983, as a byproduct of his Ph.D. thesis, he extended C.</p>
<p>C with classes was born.</p>
<p>At the time, Bjarne Stroustrup understood that a programming language has many components,
not only the language, its compiler, but also a linker and libraries.
Offering a familiar tool also makes adoption easier.
In this historical context, it makes sense that C++ would be based on C.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 40 years later.</p>
<p>Both C and C++ are widely used in the industry.
But go 5 minutes on the Internet and C developers will tell you that C++ is the most horrific man-made creation,
while many C++ developers wait for the day when C finally burns in the hot flames of hell.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h2>
<p>On the surface, C and C++ cater to the same use cases: high performance, deterministic, native but portable code for the widest range of hardware and applications.</p>
<p>But C is proudly a low-level language. A nicer assembly.</p>
<p>From day one, C++ had magic. Dark witchcraft: destructors. Suddenly the compiler was doing things on its own.
It also had type inference very early on, but the developers of the mid-80s were not quite ready for that and Bjarne Stroustrup
was pressured into removing <code>auto</code>, until it was added back to C++11.</p>
<p>From then, C++ got more and more tools to build abstractions.
I don’t think it would be fair to say that C++ is a low-level or high-level language. It’s both, by design.
But building high-level abstractions while not sacrificing performance is hard.
C++ then needed tools to achieve that: <code>constexpr</code>, move semantics, templates, and an ever-growing standard library.</p>
<p>Fundamentally I think C trusts developers while C++ trusts compilers.
This is a massive difference that sharing the same native types or syntax for while loop cannot hide.</p>
<p>C++ developers blame C for all their lost limbs, while C developers probably think C++ is batshit crazy.
I imagine that is a fair perspective if you look at C++ through a C lense. C++ is pretty wild <em>as a superset of C</em>.
A seasoned C person looking at C++ expecting familiarity in C++ will not find it. C++ is not C.
This is enough to feed flamewars for generations.</p>
<p>But as much as I dislike C, I don’t have any legitimacy to make fun of it. See, I have some experience with C++ but I
wrote very little C. It was probably bad C.
A language is also its good practices, patterns, idioms, and these take years to learn. If you try to write C code like it’s C++ or C++ like it is C, you will have a bad time.
Knowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk">C doesn’t teach you C++</a>. Knowing C++ does not teach you C.</p>
<p>So can we all stop saying C/C++, regret the unfortunate naming, and sing kumbaya in harmony?
Not so fast.</p>
<p>See, despite being philosophically different from C, C++ is still somewhat a superset of C.
That is to say, you can include a C header in a C++ translation unit and that should compile.
And this is where it gets messy.</p>
<p>C++ is not an extension of C.
It is designed as a separate standard, by a different committee, different people.
Logically, people who like C++'s philosophy will get involved in the C++ community and the C++ standardization process
while other people might try to get involved with C.
Committees, whether its C’s or C++'s, only manifest intent and direction through their respective end-product: the standards; standards which are the fruits of numerous voting.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is difficult for a compiler to know that it is dealing with a C header or a C++ header.</p>
<p><code>extern "C"</code> is not used consistently and only affects mangling, but neither grammar nor semantics.
And headers only exists in the eyes of the preprocessor, for a C++ compiler, everything is a C++ translation unit, and therefore C++.
And yet, people include C headers in C++ and expect it to “just work” ™️.
Which it mostly does.</p>
<p>We can wonder then,</p>
<h2 id="how-c-maintains-c-compatibility-while-being-developed-by-different-people-in-different-places">How C++ maintains C compatibility while being developed by different people in different places?</h2>
<p>Badly, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>A coworker recently reminded me of Conway’s law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that logic, it would stand to reason that if the two committees don’t interoperate,
neither would the languages they produce.</p>
<p>C++ maintains a list of <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.iso">incompatibilities with C</a> and <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.library">its standard library</a>.
This list does not seem to reflect the many features that were added to C11 and C18 but are not valid C++ constructs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a> draws a clearer picture.</p>
<p>Listing incompatibilities isn’t sufficient to get a measure of incompatibilities between both languages.</p>
<p>Functions that exist in the C++ standard library but whose primary declaration is expected to come from C are difficult to make <code>constexpr</code>, and more difficult still to make <code>noexcept</code>.
C compatibility translates to performance costs and C functions are optimization barriers.</p>
<p>Many C constructs are valid C++ but should never pass a code review (<code>NULL</code>, <code>longjmp</code>, <code>malloc</code>, create/destroy functions, <code>free</code>, C  casts), etc.</p>
<p>These might not be bad C idioms, but they are bad C++. C++ has a stronger type system,
and unfortunately using C idioms punch a giant hole in that type system, and so C compatibility has a cost in terms of safety.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, C++ still care about C compatibility. Somewhat.
And interestingly C cares about C++. Somewhat.
Truth be told, C might care about C++ more than C++ cares about C.
So each committee cares somewhat about what the other does.
We care reluctantly.</p>
<p>See, C++ is aware of the many foundational libraries written in C, not only the <code>libc</code> but also <code>zip</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>openssl</code> (!), and countless others, which are used in many, many C++ projects.
We can’t break that.</p>
<p>But recently, especially over the past decade, C++ has become much bigger than C.
C++ has more users - and a much more active community: <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/">There Are No C Conferences</a>.
Maybe that’s why the C++ committee is now over 10 times the size of the C committee.</p>
<p>C++ then is a force to be reckoned with and the C committee has to consider not breaking C++.
To the point that if a standard would track another, these days, C++ leads and C follow.</p>
<p>C++ is now on a steady three years cycle come rain or shine, or deadly pandemics.
Meanwhile, C has a major release every decade or so.
This makes sense. As a lower-level language, C doesn’t need to evolve as fast.</p>
<p>The C landscape is also rather different from the C++ landscape.
C caters to more platforms and a lot more compilers.
Everybody and their dog is writing C compilers because the language has a surface area small enough to make that possible, whereas the C++ committee will only really consider 4 implementations, all of which are represented at every meeting.
As a result, many features in C are implementation-defined or optionally supported so that the variety of compilers that exist can claim conformance without doing much work, which I’m told pleases regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>C++ these days is more interested in portability than implementation freedom. Yet another difference of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="so-your-proposal-breaks-c-compatibility">So, your proposal breaks C compatibility</h2>
<p>Parts of my <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2178r1.pdf">P2178</a> paper theoretically affects C compatibility.
In such cases, none of the options seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>You could be told that you have to first get your feature into C. Which means more meetings.
Meetings you might not be able to attend because C has strict <a href="https://thephd.github.io/follow-the-river-wg14-ithaca-2019">attendance rules</a> - Excluding individuals not willing to put down thousands of dollars to become ISO members.
This is because the C committee is forced to adhere strictly to ISO rules.</p>
<p>It might also take a decade if the standard just shipped.
And most importantly, it might go nowhere if the C committee doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about the particular problem you are trying to solve.
And they probably don’t have the bandwidth to deal with it.
And you may not have the bandwidth to deal with C. After all, you joined C++ to improve C++.
In fact, if the room invites you to “talk to the C committee”, it is likely your proposal is dead, even in the unlikely event that no one in the room was against it.</p>
<p>Another likely scenario is that the C committee accepts a version of a proposal that is slightly different from what exists in C++.
<code>true</code>? Let’s make that a macro. <code>char16_t</code> ? Let’s make that a typedef. <code>char32_t</code>? Not necessarily UTF-32. <code>static_assert</code> ? <code>_Static_assert</code>.</p>
<p>The list goes on. Should we blame C? Probably not. Their committee does what they think is best for their language.
The opposite is true too. In C++20 designated initializers were inspired by C’s but are slightly different because they would otherwise not fit with the C++ initialization rules.</p>
<p>I am part of the problem. C has VLAs. I would vote against a proposal to adopt that in standard C++, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Kills-The-VLA">too many security issues</a>. A proposal to add <code>_Generic</code> to C++ would be over-my-dead-body. I am not sure if <code>_Generic</code> attempts to palliate to the lack of template or the lack of overloads, but C++ has both these features - from my point of view <code>_Generic</code> doesn’t fit into the big picture of what I imagine C++ to be.</p>
<p>Both committees seem also inconsistent in how much they care about the other language.
Sometimes we go to great lenghts (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex">std::complex</a>), sometimes we don’t care at all (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array">static array parameters</a>).</p>
<p>There is no way around this. Don’t forget that each committee is a bunch of people
voting at different times in different rooms and trying to control the outcome would defeat the purpose
of having a vote.
Putting people in the same room is not realistic either. ISO might object and the participation inbalance
would put C people at an enormous disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="c-compatibility-doesnt-matter-kinda">C compatibility doesn’t matter, kinda</h2>
<p>If you are a C developer, I imagine you see C as a neat programming language.
But for the rest of us, C is something else.</p>
<p>C is the universal, cross-language glue that ties it all together.</p>
<p>For C++ users, C is …</p></div></div>

September 2, 2020 | https://www.causal.app/blog/cac-is-not-sales-marketing-expense | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.causal.app/blog/cac-is-not-sales-marketing-expense">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note:&nbsp;this was originally published at </em><a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/" target="_blank"><em>https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/</em></a></p><p>Generally accepted accounting principles were designed to create a single standard for comparing any and all businesses using the same terms and metrics. This is a very powerful tool, but it is a clear exchange for breadth over specificity. As a result, the economic reality of a business will likely differ from what the accounting metrics represent. By looking at a subset of business models, we can improve specificity - terms like <em>ARR </em>and <em>GMV</em> are both examples of this. While these terms have their own challenges with definitions, I think most agree what they represent: ARR is annualized recurring revenue for SaaS companies, and GMV is gross merchandise/marketplace value for marketplace companies.</p><p>One of my favorite examples of this is CAC - customer acquisition cost. It’s relevant for both SaaS businesses and marketplaces. Average CAC is the cost to acquire a single customer and Total CAC is the full spend for a cohort of customers. So what is the difference between <strong>CAC</strong> and <strong>Sales &amp; Marketing</strong> expense? The truth is that Total CAC and S&amp;M over a given period of time <em>might </em>be the same. That being said, the usually differ by a <em>time offset </em>that depends on <strong><em>sales cycle length</em></strong>.</p><p>The critical distinction is <strong>sales cycle length</strong>. <em>Sales cycle is how long it takes for a customer to go from first contact to closing a deal</em>. We measure sales cycle by segment and can use simple reports in Salesforce or another CRM tool to figure out how long it takes on average for customers to move through the sales funnel. Generally sales opportunities begin as leads, some of those convert to <em>qualified for sales</em> and then some of those convert to <em>closed-won</em>. The Sales Funnel shows the volume and conversion at each step in the process and is usually in the hands of the CRO or sales operations team. The two lengths of time that we care about in finance are: top of funnel to sales qualification (i.e. marketing cycle length) and then sales qualification to closed-won (i.e. sales cycle length).</p><p>There is a large variance in sales cycle lengths from business to business. For example, consumer software might have a &lt;1 month sales cycle that runs entirely on marketing. On the other end of the spectrum, a complex sale to a large institution may take over a year and involve a number of different people and teams.</p><p>For the in-month sales cycle, New ARR in Month X will be attributed to the Marketing expense in Month X. Pretty straightforward.</p><p>As soon as you have a separate marketing funnel and sales funnel and things take longer than a few weeks, it becomes more complicated to measure, track and predict.</p><p>I often see operating stats that look like this:</p><figure id="w-node-be6f6b2d374d-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f4e9f755f630ab3e0e98ebd_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F79d18d99-150c-4eae-b10a-cc00916f9da3_1168x196.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The high level sales efficiency metric is New ARR / S&amp;M: the idea being that we are investing in S&amp;M in order to generate new ARR. The missing piece of information here is <strong>how long are the customers in the marketing funnel and how long are they in the sales funnel</strong>. Without that info, people often assume that it is in the same time period - whether that is a month, a quarter or a year. Switching over to a CAC calculation based on sales cycle length gives a more accurate picture of the sales efficiency.<br></p><p>For example: let’s say the marketing funnel takes <strong>1 month</strong> and the sales funnel takes <strong>3 months</strong>.<br></p><p>As a result, CAC would be the Marketing expense from 3 months prior and the average of the Sales expense over the last 3 months. So in the above example, new ARR acquired in April would be associated with the Marketing spend in January and the average of the Sales spend in Feb, March and April. Because this is a growing business, CAC will be lower than the S&amp;M in the same month, meaning that efficiency numbers are actually higher when based on CAC. Quick note to operating executives: don’t use a basic formula and sell yourself short.<br></p><p>Now looking at it through the lens of sales cycle-dependent CAC:<br></p><figure id="w-node-5b3f68252472-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f4e9f8ca3a860067d1d36b8_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fce0d6249-9d70-4cff-87bb-36004dfe03c8_1168x278.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Once you have the CAC line in the model, you can use it for SaaS Magic number, CAC payback, and a number of other metrics. (Of course, as the sales cycle changes, the CAC calculation must also change.) These metrics are important because they usually stay constant for a given product and business operation and allow you to project into the future.</p><p>The CAC calculation gets you one level deeper towards operating metrics from the high level financial metrics and is often a good bridge between the two. It represents the detailed funnels at a high level, and will ultimately drive projections with a higher degree of accuracy. For example, we now know that leads acquired through marketing spend in December will not yield sales until 3 months later in March. Based on historical metrics, we know roughly how many leads this spend will get us and therefore what kind of sales capacity we need to close on those leads and can plan sales hiring accordingly.<br></p><p>Coming from the financial perspective down into the operating perspective is a bit of a rabbit hole, so there’s an art in knowing where to stop, and it’s usually the point where precision starts to overtake accuracy in the model and digging deeper stops yielding better results. One step down from this, for example, would be to look into the sales expense - sales people are generally paid 50%+ of their total salary in commissions. If those commissions are paid in the month of sale, half of the sales expense should be weighted from that month and the other half weighted across the earlier months. If sales people are paid later on, then looking at it from a purely economic perspective as it pertains to commission rates will yield a much better result than looking at the accounting outputs for sales expense.<br></p></div></div>]]>

  <time datetime="2020-09-02T00:00:00+00:00">September 02, 2020</time>
</header>

  <p>Recently I came across a <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/if-else-is-a-poor-mans-polymorphism-ab0b333b7265">blog post</a>
whose author claims, from the perspective of good coding practices, polymorphism is strictly superior to branching. 
In the post they make general statements about how branching statements lead to unreadable, unmaintainable, inflexible code and
how they are a sign of immaturity. However, in my opinion, the topic is much deeper and in this post 
I try to objectively discuss the reasons for and against branching.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>Before I dive into polymorphism vs branching dilemma, let’s first define what we mean when we say some code is
flexible and easy to extend. In my career I reviewed thousands of lines of code, and I had thousands of lines of my code
reviewed by others, and during these reviews it often occured that the terms <em>code extensibility</em> or <em>flexibility</em> 
mean different things to different people. Familiarity with the code-base or particular programming style plays a huge role.</p>

<p>For example, someone used to writing code in a Java/C# OOP style would generally consider dynamic polymorphism through 
interfaces a standard way of providing extensibility to the code, 
while a C programmer may find a switch or if/else much more 
approachable than OOP. There are also many other factors related 
to maintainability as quality of documentation, good naming, separation of concerns, etc. These factors are orthogonal 
to the “polymorphism vs branching” dimension and also far too broad for a single blog post, so I won’t discuss them.</p>

<p>For the sake of this post, let’s define <em>extensibility</em> as the inverse of number of distinct units in the codebase
that need to be changed in order to implement a new feature. The more places you have to touch to implement the feature, 
the harder the code is to change. Obviously, it is much better when you have to touch only
one unit of code (one function, one class, one module, one package) rather than change 10 distinct unrelated units.</p>


<p>Imagine you’re writing a calculator. Your program gets an expression as an input and outputs the computed value.
For example the user inputs <code>1 + 2 * 3</code> and the output is <code>7</code> 
(or <code>9</code> if you’ve messed up the operator precedence like one of my former CS students).</p>

<p>Why such a silly example? Who is writing calculators these days? Probably no-one, but this looks like a classic example given
in many programming classes. And it is easy enough to illustrate the concept.</p>

<p>How can we model a structure to represent an expression?
You’d probably use classes or structures. Here is the code in Scala:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>value</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span> <span>+</span> <span>right</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then it is quite easy to build an expression and evaluate it:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)).</span><span>eval</span> <span>// evaluates to 5 </span>
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>This OOP-based solution is indeed very extensible when it comes to add a new operator.
The example above is missing subtraction operation. We can add one by defining a new class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Sub</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span> <span>-</span> <span>right</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s really awesome – we didn’t have to touch any old code at all! 
OOP definitely rocks here.</p>


<p>Imagine you continued to extend our calculation engine with more operation classes over the next few years.
You’ve added multiplication, division, modulo, variables, logarithms, trigonometric functions, etc.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a new requirement comes – users want to not only evaluate the value of an expression,
but also do symbolic manipulation – e.g. simplify expressions. For example, given an expression
<code>a + a</code> they want to get an expression <code>2 * a</code> as a result.</p>

<p>This requirement can’t be captured by the <code>eval</code> method on the <code>Expression</code> interface. We need a new method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>simplify</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And as the next step, they would likely want to be able to display the expression as a String:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>simplify</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>toString</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How many units of code do you have to change now to implement these features?
<strong>All the implementations of <code>Expression</code></strong>. Before touching all the classes, the code wouldn’t even compile.
It looks like in the context of this kind of feature, our polymorphic solution is terribly non-extensible.</p>


<p>Let’s take a step back and let’s see how we could implement this differently.
Scala and many other modern languages have a feature called <em>pattern matching</em>
which can be considered a very flexible, powerful switch.</p>

<p>Instead of defining the operations like <code>eval</code> or <code>simplify</code> on the case classes,
let’s pull them up:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Now adding a new operation like <code>Sub</code> would require two changes to the code – adding a new class
<em>and</em> adding a new case in the match (switch) statement.</p>

<p>Some may say this much worse not only because of more places to update, but because of a possibility of
forgetting to update the switches which could lead to runtime errors due to unhandled cases.
Fortunately, Scala designers thought about this by providing the <code>sealed</code> keyword, which instructs the compiler
that all case classes can be defined in the same module only. This unlocks pattern exhaustiveness analysis and the
compiler would warn about missing cases:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sealed</span> <span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What about adding new functions like <code>simplify</code> or <code>toString</code>? 
It requires to changle only <strong>one place</strong> – by adding the required methods. 
No changes to the existing code are needed!</p>

<p>The blog post I mentioned in the introduction stated that using polymorphism instead of
branching leads to more readable code. I find this statement far too general and actually very debatable.</p>

<p>First, even in their own example given by the author of that blog, the solution using branching was a lot
shorter and less complex than the solution using OOP. While brief code is not always more readable than a longer version of it,
in that case, I found branching to be very explicit and easy to follow. 
It is much easier to understand the control flow
in such a program because all targets are explicitly given in a single place. In the OOP solution, 
the actual implementations are hidden behind the interface and it is much harder to find them all without additional 
help of a good IDE with a “jump to implementations” feature 
(which fortunately often works well for statically typed languages, but I’ve seen IDEs sometimes 
struggle with dynamic languages like Python).</p>

<p>Second, in general case, branching has an advantage that the function logic may depend on more than
one object type or even the actual data. For example, in the example from this post, 
the transformation <code>a * (b + c)</code> =&gt; <code>a * b + a * c</code> would depend on 
both addition and multiplication. In the classic OOP solution, would you place it in the <code>Add</code> or in the <code>Mul</code> class? 
Neither seems right. Also, putting it into one of them creates a dependency on the other one. 
An expression simplifier with code scattered accross multiple classes heavily depending on each other 
would be hard to understand.</p>


<p>This is a blog on high performance programming, so the post would be incomplete without a 
section on performance. In theory, a sufficiently good compiler should produce the same
code regardless of the choice between branching or dynamic polymorphism, but is this the case in reality?
Compilers have limitations and often don’t generate the best result code possible.</p>

<p>Let’s consider a more realistic example this time.
Some time ago I was working on serializing/deserializing code in a database system.
I stumbled upon a set of classes that described data types. They all implemented 
a common interface defining methods for serializing and deserializing values of given data type
and also computing serialized data lenghts. The following Rust snippet is a huge simplification 
of that code, but it illustrates the concept:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>IntType</span><span>;</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>for</span> <span>BoolType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>for</span> <span>IntType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span> <span>4</span> <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>data_len</span><span>(</span><span>data_type</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>DataType</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>data_type</span><span>.len</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Given a reference to a <code>DataType</code> object, it is trivial to compute the data size associated with it, 
without knowing the exact static type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>t1</span> <span>=</span> <span>IntType</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>t2</span> <span>=</span> <span>LongType</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>v</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>DataType</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>t1</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>t2</span><span>];</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>data_len</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]));</span>  <span>// prints 4</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>data_len</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]));</span>  <span>// prints 8</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="performance-of-dynamic-dispatch">Performance of Dynamic Dispatch</h2>

<p>The implementation of the <code>data_len</code> function is actually very simple:</p>


<p>Wow! A single assembly instruction! 
It jumps to the address stored in the the vtable of the object pointed by the <code>rsi</code> register.
The target of the jump depends on the actual type of the object. Here is the code generated for <code>IntType.len</code>:</p>



<p>The codes for the other types differ only in the constant value.</p>

<p>These are only 3 instructions to return the result. Shouldn’t it be fast? 
Let’s measure this. Let’s put more random <code>DataType</code> objects …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>At Buffer, we’ve been using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/case-studies/buffer/">Kubernetes since 2016</a>.  We’ve been managing our k8s (kubernetes) cluster with <a href="https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/">kops</a>, it has about 60 nodes (on AWS), and runs about 1500 containers. Our transition to a micro-service architecture has been full of trial and errors. Even after a few years running k8s, we are still learning its secrets. This post will talk about how something we thought was a good thing, but ended up to be not as great as we thought: <strong>CPU limits</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="cpu-limits-and-throttling">CPU limits and Throttling</h2>
<p>It is s general recommendation to set CPU limits. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/kubernetes-best-practices-resource-requests-and-limits">Google, among others, highly recommends it</a>. The danger of not setting a CPU limit is that containers running in the node could exhaust all CPU available. This can trigger a cascade of unwanted events such as having key Kubernetes processes (such as <code>kubelet</code>) to become unresponsive. So it is in theory a great thing to set CPU limit in order to protect your nodes.</p>
<p>CPU limits is the maximum CPU time a container can uses at a given period (100ms by default). The CPU usage for a container will never go above that limit you specified. Kubernetes use a mechanism called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_Fair_Scheduler">CFS Quota</a> to <strong>throttle</strong> the container to prevent the CPU usage from going above the limit. That means CPU will be artificially restricted, making the performance of your containers lower (and slower when it comes to latency).</p>
<h2 id="what-can-happen-if-we-dont-set-cpu-limits">What can happen if we don’t set CPU limits?</h2>
<p>We unfortunately experienced the issue. The <code>kubelet</code> , a process running on every node, and in charge of managing the containers (pods)  in the nodes became unresponsive. The node will turn into a <code>NotReady</code> state, and containers (pods) that were present will be rescheduled somewhere else, and create the issue in the new nodes. Definitely not ideal isn’t it?</p>
<h2 id="discovering-the-throttling-and-latency-issue">Discovering the throttling and latency issue</h2>
<p>A key metric to check when you are running container is the <code>throttling</code> . This indicate the number of time your container has been throttled. Interestingly, we’ve discovered a lot of containers having throttling no matter if the CPU usage was near the limits or not. Here the example of one of our main API:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/cpu-usage-limits.png" alt="Kubernetes pods CPU usage and limits"></p>
<p>You can see in the animation that the CPU limits is set at <code>800m</code> (0.8 core, 80% of a core), and the peak usage is at most <code>200m</code> (20% of a core). After seeing, we might think we have plenty of CPU to let the service running before it throttle right? . Now check this one out:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/cpu-throttling-low-usage.gif" alt="Kubernetes pods Low CPU usage, High limit, lot of throttling"></p>
<p>You can notice the CPU throttling occurs, even though the CPU usage is below the CPU Limits. The maximum CPU usage isn’t even near the CPU limits.</p>
<p>We’ve then found a few resources(<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577">github issue</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpFApeaGv7A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1204">zanado talk</a>,  <a href="https://medium.com/omio-engineering/cpu-limits-and-aggressive-throttling-in-kubernetes-c5b20bd8a718">omio post</a>) talking about how throttling lead to poorer performances and latency for your services.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we see CPU throttling while CPU usage is low?</strong>
The tldr is basically a bug in the Linux kernel throttling unecessarly containers with CPU limit. If you’re curious about the nature of it, I invite you to check Dave Chiluk’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE7QX98-kO0">great talk</a>, a <a href="https://engineering.indeedblog.com/blog/2019/12/unthrottled-fixing-cpu-limits-in-the-cloud/">written version</a> also exists with more details.</p>

<p>After many long discussions, we’ve decided to remove the CPU limits for all services that were directly or indirectly on the critical path of our users.</p>
<p>This wasn’t an easy decision since we value the stability of our cluster. We’ve experimented in the past some instability in our cluster with services using too much resources and disrupting all other services present in the same node.  That time was a bit different, we understood more about how our services needed to be and had a good strategy to roll this out.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/unleash-k8s.jpg" alt="Buffer-remove-cpu-limits-announcement"></p>
<h2 id="how-to-keep-your-nodes-safe-when-removing-limits-">How to keep your nodes safe when removing limits ?</h2>
<p><strong>Isolating “No CPU Limits” services:</strong></p>
<p>In the past we’ve seen some nodes going to a <code>notReady</code> state, mainly because some services were using too much resources in a node.</p>
<p>We’ve decided to put those services on some specific nodes (tainted nodes), so those services will not disrupt all the “bounded” ones.  We have better control and could identify easier if any issue occurs with a node. We did this by tainting some nodes and adding toleration to services that were “unbounded”. Check <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/">the documentation</a> on how you can do that.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/buffer-k8s-infrastructure-nodes.jpg" alt="Buffer k8s nodes infrastructure"></p>
<p><strong>Assigning the correct CPU and memory request:</strong></p>
<p>The main worry we had was service using too much resources and leading to nodes becoming unresponsive. Because we now had great observability of all services running in our cluster (with Datadog), I’ve analyzed a few months of usage of each service we wanted to “unbound”. I’ve assigned the maximum CPU usage as the CPU request with a &gt; 20% margin. This will make sure to have allocated space in a node. If k8s won’t try to schedule any other service in that node.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/choose-cpu-request-based-on-max.png" alt="Chose CPU request based on max"></p>
<p>You can see in the graph that the peak CPU usage was <code>242m</code> CPU core (0.242 CPU core). Simply take this number and make it a bit higher to become the CPU request. You can notice that since the service is user facing, the peak CPU usage matches peak traffic time.</p>
<p>Do the same with your memory usage and requests, and you will be all set!
To add more safety, you can use the horizontal pod autoscaler to create new pods if the resource usage is high, so kubernetes will schedule it in nodes that have room for it. Set an alert if your cluster do not have any room, or use the node austoscaler to add it automatically.</p>
<p>The downsides are that we lose in “<a href="https://wiki.openvz.org/WP/Containers_density">container density</a>”, the number of containers that can run in a single node. We could also end up with a lot of “slack” during a low traffic time.
You could also hit some high CPU usage, but nodes autoscaling should help you with it.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>I’m happy to publish really great results after few weeks of experimentation, we’ve already seen really great latency improvements across all the services we’ve modified:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/speedup-no-cpu-limits2.png" alt="faster-kubernetes-containers"></p>
<p>The best result happened on our main landing page (<a href="https://buffer.com/">buffer.com</a>) where we speed the service up to <strong>22x</strong> faster!</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/no-cpu-limit-speedup-buffer-com.jpg" alt="buffer.com speedup without cpu limits"></p>
<h2 id="is-the-linux-kernel-bug-fixed">Is the Linux kernel bug fixed?</h2>
<p>The bug <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=763a9ec06c4">has been fixed and merged into the kernel</a> for Linux distribution running 4.19 or higher (kudo again to <a href="https://twitter.com/dchiluk">Dave Chiluk</a> for finding and fixing that).</p>
<p>However, as for <em>September 2nd 2020</em>, when reading <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577">the kubernetes issue</a>, we can see various Linux projects that keep referencing the issue, so I guess some Linux distribution still have the bug and working into integrating the fix.</p>
<p>If you are below a Linux distribution that has a kernel version below 4.19, I’d recommend you to upgrade to the latest Linux distribution for your nodes, but in any case, you should try removing the CPU limits and see if you have any throttling.  Here a non exhausting list of various managed Kubernetes services or Linux distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debian: The latest version <a href="https://erickhun.com/posts/kubernetes-faster-services-no-cpu-limits/%5Bhttps://www.debian.org/releases/buster/">buster</a> has the fix,  it looks <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/1167353/accepted-linux-latest-419-105deb10u5deb9u1-source-amd64-into-oldstable-oldstable/">quite recent (august 2020)</a>. Some previous version might have get patched</li>
<li>Ubuntu: The latest version <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/">Ubuntu Focal Fosa 20.04</a> has the fix.</li>
<li>EKS has the fix since <a href="https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/175">December 2019</a>. Upgrade your AMI if you have a version below than that</li>
<li>kops: Since <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9283">June 2020</a>,  <code>kops 1.18+</code> will start using <code>Ubuntu 20.04</code> as the default host image. If you’re using a lower version of kops, you’ll have to probably to wait the fix. We are currently in this situation.</li>
<li>GKE (Goggle Cloud) : The kernel fix was merged in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/release-notes#cos-stable-77-12371-141-0">January 2020</a>. But it does looks like throttling are <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24356903">still hapenning</a></li>
</ul>
<p>ps: Feel free to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351566">comment</a> if you have more precise information, I’ll update the post accordingly</p>
<p><strong>If the fix solved the throttling issue?</strong></p>
<p>I’m unsure if totally solved the issue. I will give it a try once we hit a kernel version where the fix has been implemented and will update this post accordingly. If anyone have upgrade I’m keen to hear their results.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you run Docker containers under Linux (no matter Kubernetes/Mesos/Swarm) you might have your containers underperforming because of throttling</li>
<li>Upgrade to the latest version of your distribution hoping the bug is fixed</li>
<li>Removing CPU limit is a solution to solve this issue, but this is dangerous and should be made with extra-care (prefer upgrading your kernel first and monitor throttling first)</li>
<li>If you remove CPU limits, carefully monitor CPU and  memory usage in your nodes, and make sure your CPU requests are</li>
<li>A safe way to is to use the Horizontal pod autoscaler to create new pods if the resource usage is high, so kubernetes will schedule it in nodes that have space.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Supervised learning is perhaps the most common form of machine learning task in use nowadays.</p>
<p>This form of learning makes use of a labeled training dataset to create a model that predicts a target of interest. If this line makes absolutely no sense to you, don't worry. After reading this article you will have a clear understanding of supervised learning and its two most popular applications: regression and classification.</p>
<h2 id="trainingmachineswithexamples">Training machines with examples</h2>
<p>Supervised learning is a process in which you teach a machine to predict a particular result by feeding it examples 'with the right answers'.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know is what are you trying to predict. You might want to create a program that classifies pet photos as <em>dog photos</em> or <em>cat photos</em>, or a program that predicts the prices of houses in different districts in Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>After deciding the variable you are trying to predict (your <strong>target</strong>), it's time to gather data examples from the real world and <em>label them</em>. In our first example, we would start gathering photos with dogs and photos with cats and tagging them with the right category. This photo of a puppy is a dog photo, that photo of a cat playing with a laser is a cat photo, and so on for every example.</p>
<p>Before the training stage, you will set aside a percentage of your training set to test the performance of your models. Afterwards, you will feed your labeled examples into an algorithm that will learn to generalize a relationship between the inputs (the photos) and the targets (dog/cat), producing a model you can use to classify fresh images it has never seen before. In this context, this is what <em>training</em> means: teaching a machine to perform actions learned from training data.</p>
<p>You can evaluate how well the model performs on your training set, the one you put aside before training. If the results are satisfying, you can deploy the model into production and use it to solve the original problem. The following diagram shows a high-level view of the supervised learning process.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/SupervisedLearning.png" alt="SupervisedLearning"></p>
<p>This is an example of a classification task.</p>
<p><strong>Classification</strong> and <strong>regression</strong> are the most common applications of supervised learning. If you are interested in a career in machine learning you will likely spend most of your time creating these types of models, so let's take a look at them.</p>
<h2 id="classifyingtheworld">Classifying the world</h2>
<p>A classifier is a model that tells you the <strong>class</strong>(category) an instance of your data belongs to. In the previous example, our instances were photos of pets, and the classes were <em>cat photos</em> and <em>dog photos</em>.</p>
<p>The training set for classification tasks is usually a collection of instances (individual instances of the phenomenon you are trying to model) with a <em>label</em> that specifies the class they belong to.</p>
<p>Classifiers can be further classified ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ) into different subtypes depending on the number of target classes (binary or multiclass) and how many categories an instance can belong to at the same time (single-label and multi-label), let's take a look at those.</p>
<h4 id="binaryclassifiers">Binary classifiers</h4>
<p>A binary classifier is a model that classifies examples into two possible classes. Classifiers are capable of telling you if an email is either <strong>spam</strong> or <strong>not spam</strong>, if a photo of a face is <strong>happy</strong> or <strong>sad</strong> or if a substance is <strong>harmless</strong> or <strong>dangerous</strong>.</p>
<p>The most common setup for binary classification is to have a positive class (<em>class</em>) and a negative class (<em>not-class</em>). In this sense, you can re-define the previous examples as spam/not-spam, happy/not-happy and dangerous/not-dangerous.</p>
<p>Some types of binary classifiers don't just tell you a result, but they also provide you a probability that the instance you are classifying belongs to the predicted class.</p>
<p>Binary classifiers are some of the most studied and used models in machine learning, and many other models build on top of them (like some forms of multiclass classifiers).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/BinaryClassifier.png" alt="BinaryClassifier"></p>
<h4 id="multiclassclassifiers">Multiclass classifiers</h4>
<p>As you might imagine from the title, a multiclass classifier is a model that classifies instances into many categories. Like in the previous case you can get the results as the probability of belonging to a particular class.</p>
<p>It's important to note that there is a difference depending on the number of classes an instance can belong to at the same time.</p>
<p>If the classes are mutually exclusive (an object can only belong to one class at a time) you are building a <strong>single-label multiclass classifier</strong>. If an instance can belong to more than 1 class at the same time then you need a <strong>multi-label classifier</strong>.</p>
<p>Depending on the particular scenario, your choice of algorithms and evaluation methods will differ.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/MulticlassClassifier.png" alt="MulticlassClassifier"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/MultilabelClassifier.png" alt="MultilabelClassifier"></p>
<h2 id="regression">Regression</h2>
<p>The goal of a regression model is to predict a continuous value. The training set for a regression problem is usually a collection of instances with the associated numeric value you are trying to predict.</p>
<p>The following are some examples of regression problems</p>
<ul>
<li>Predict the price of houses in Amsterdam given the size of the house (in square meters), the year the house was built, the average income of the area in which the house is located, the number of bedrooms and the color of the mailbox.</li>
<li>Predict a person's likelihood developing diabetes given the height, weight, number of cigarettes smoked per day, average caloric intake, average hours of physical activity per week and amount of carbs consumed per day.</li>
<li>Predict the stock price of a company one year from now based on the number of Disney films released last year, the color of underwear the CEO wears with more frequency and the title of his/her aunt's favorite song.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regression tasks are extremely common in machine learning. If you decide to pursue a career in data science or ML engineering, many of the models you'll build are likely aimed to solve regression problems.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/SimpleRegressor.png" alt="SimpleRegressor"></p>
<h2 id="thecoreassumptionofsupervisedlearning">The core assumption of supervised learning</h2>
<p>Ok, now you have an idea of what supervised learning is and how the process works. In brief, you collect a lot of data relevant to the problem you are trying to solve and label it with the <em>correct answers</em>, or the expected result your model is trying to predict. Then, all this training data is fed into an algorithm that will generate a model that maps the inputs into classes(classification) or values(regression).</p>
<p>For this process to work, the information contained in the training set needs to have enough <strong>predictive power</strong> for the algorithm to find a correlation between the two sets.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to predict the likelihood a given person has to develop diabetes, you might want data like the BMI, genetic predisposition and dietary habits. All 3 with powerful correlation with the variable you are trying to find (likelihood to develop a disease, in this case). Other data, like favorite film, shoe size, and favorite headphone brand has less predictive power for this particular target, so it makes little sense to add it to the training set.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the data gathered doesn't provide enough information to build a model that performs well, in this scenario you need to reformulate the problem or find data with better quality.</p>
<p>Supervised learning is a huge topic with lots of important concepts. The goal of this article was to present a high-level view of the topic. Hopefully, by now you have a better understanding of supervised learning, and we will be prepared to dig deeper in more elaborate topics in future articles.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Starting an IHP app</strong>

                    <p>
                        Let's first take a look at what happens when you start your IHP app by running <code>./start</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-boilerplate/blob/master/start" target="_blank"><code>./start</code></a> script in your project is basically just a small wrapper that makes sure that all dependencies that are managed by nix are available and then calls the <code>RunDevServer</code> binary. <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/blob/master/IHP/IDE/DevServer.hs" target="_blank">This binary is part of IHP</a> and does the actual application startup as well as managing the postgres server.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can think of <code>RunDevServer</code> as a small process manager. When <code>RunDevServer</code> is started, it will directly start all processes required for your application to run:
                        </p><ul>
                            <li>the web-based IDE</li>
                            <li>a status server on port 8000 showing the compiler status and possible type errors</li>
                            <li>a websocket server used for communicating file changes for live reloading</li>
                            <li>a ghci (the standard haskell REPL) where it directly loads your app</li>
                            <li>a postgres server bound to unix socket</li>
                            <li>a file watcher to track haskell and css file changes</li>
                        </ul>
                    

                    <p>
                        All these processes are started in parallel for fast performance and synchronised in the main event loop of the dev server. Made possible thanks to haskells great concurrency capabilities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The most important process is the ghci process with your app. Instead of fully recompiling your app on every file change, IHP loads your app in the repl and then refreshes only the changed files. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At first ghci needs a couple of seconds to load all haskell files of your application. While loading your application the status server is serving all http requests on localhost:8000. The status server will also show all type errors in case ghci failed to load your app. When the ghci finished loading, the status server is stopped and your application is started on localhost:8000.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Haskell File Changes</strong>

                    <p>
                        <iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTjjDo57B8g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once your application is started, the dev server mainly deals with file changes. Using a file watcher the dev server is notified about any changes to your haskell files in your project. When a haskell file is changed the app process running in the ghci process is stopped and a refresh (<code>:r</code>) is triggered. The refresh is usually very fast. Once completed the app server will be started again.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once the haskell app has started, open browser pages will be notified using a websocket connection. The open pages will fetch the current page via ajax and will then update the dom using <a href="https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom" target="_blank">a diff and patch approach</a>. So only dom nodes that have actually changed will be touched during the live reloading. This approach will keep existing page state like scroll position or text typed into a form field. It allows for a very fast and productive feedback cycle.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>CSS File Changes</strong>

                    <blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Did you know: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ihp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ihp</a> also supports live reloading of CSS. <a href="https://t.co/uRCCr3gkHz">pic.twitter.com/uRCCr3gkHz</a></p>— digitally induced (@digitallyinduce) <a href="https://twitter.com/digitallyinduce/status/1277583045919375363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2020</a></blockquote> 
                    

                    <p>
                        IHP also supports live reloading of CSS files. Once IHP sees a file change to your CSS files in the <code>static</code> directory it will notify all open browser tabs using its websocket connection. Once notified in the browser IHP will look for any <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code> and <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/blob/master/lib/IHP/static/livereload.js#L68" target="_blank">will reload the css file using a cache buster</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is only possible because nix allows us to pin down the set of package definitions to a specific git commit of the nix package registry.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Type Errors</strong>

                    <p>
                        Sometimes you make a change which will stop your application from compiling. In these error cases the status server jumps in and starts listening on localhost:8000. The status server will then display the error message so you can quickly fix it:
                    </p>

Эту информацию Onliner подтвердил основатель и руководитель компании Микита Микадо. По его словам, обыск проводят сотрудники Департамента финансовых расследований.</p>





<p>Большинство сотрудников PandaDoc работает из дома, поэтому информации о происходящем в офисе пока почти нет. Также Микита сообщил, что «директора забрали».</p>

<p>Руководитель PandaDoc Микита Микадо в августе предложил инициативу по финансовой помощи сотрудникам силовых ведомств, которые уйдут со службы.</p>

<p>Микита записал обращение на своей странице в Facebook:</p>

September 2, 2020 | https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/09/02/wparentheses/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/09/02/wparentheses/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Today I finally write down some musings on two peripheral aspects of
compiler diagnostic design that I think are very important for certain kinds of warnings.
My first musing relates to <em>fixits</em>, and my second to <em>suppression mechanisms</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-fixit">What is a fixit?</h2>

<p>Most C++ compilers these days don’t just tell you <em>that</em> a problem occurred
(like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.txt"><code>ed</code>’s famous <code>?</code> prompt</a>),
and <em>what</em> the problem is (“expected identifier,” for example).
They’ll try to tell you <em>how to fix</em> the problem.</p>

<p>Compare GCC 4.1’s error messages with GCC 4.6’s. (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/KM8P9E">Godbolt.</a>)
For this input:</p>



<p>GCC 4.1 complains merely that you have put <code>multiple types in one declaration</code>.
GCC 4.6 more helpfully complains that it <code>expected ';' after struct definition</code>,
and points to the exact position where it believes a semicolon should be inserted.</p>

<p>GCC 7 goes even further, and suggests a <em>fixit</em> — a machine-readable “spellcheck suggestion”
that some IDEs are able to apply with a single click.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>test.cc:1:12: error: expected ';' after struct definition
 struct S {}
            ^
            ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In medical terms, the compiler has gone from simply detecting the <em>symptom</em>
(“this declaration seems to contain two types, which isn’t valid C++”)
to producing a <em>diagnosis</em> of the disease (“I bet you forgot a semicolon somewhere”);
and a compiler that supports fixits is actually <em>prescribing a treatment plan</em>.
Each of these steps is a quantum leap beyond the previous one in terms of both user-friendliness
and implementation complexity.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-suppression-mechanism">What is a suppression mechanism?</h2>

<p>Suppression mechanisms relate to compiler <em>warnings</em>, not compiler errors.
Consider the following snippet (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/fTnao9">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (argc = 1)
    puts("hello");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Every mainstream compiler warns on this suspicious-looking code (GCC and Clang with <code>-Wall</code>; MSVC with <code>-W4</code>).
Here’s GCC’s diagnostic:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: suggest parentheses around assignment used as truth value [-Wparentheses]
    4 |     if (argc = 1)
      |         ~~~~~^~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that GCC doesn’t even bother to explain really what its diagnosis is;
it emits a passive-aggressive warning message that does nothing more than suggest how to
shut itself up!</p>

<p>The diagnosis, of course, is that frequently people mean to write <code>if (argc == 1)</code>
but their finger slips and they write <code>if (argc = 1)</code> instead, which unfortunately
is also valid C++ code. Every mainstream compiler has evolved the same way to deal with this:
if you really mean <code>=</code>, then you write an extra pair of parentheses around the expression, like so:</p>



<p>The extra pair of parentheses is what I’m calling a “suppression mechanism.”
It’s just an arbitrary way of silencing a warning diagnostic — telling the compiler
“no, I really <em>meant</em> to write this legal but unusual construct.”</p>

<p>Another well-known suppression mechanism is writing <code>(void)</code> in front of unused results
to silence <code>-Wunused-value</code> and <code>-Wunused-result</code> warnings (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/WdrhrE">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[[nodiscard]] int foo();
void test(int x) {
    (void)x;
    (void)foo();
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And a trivial suppression mechanism is implied by the name of the <code>-Wparentheses</code> warning:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: '&amp;&amp;' within '||' [-Wlogical-op-parentheses]
    return (a &amp;&amp; b || c);
            ~~^~~~ ~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here the compiler just wants you to add a pair of parentheses to clarify the precedence for the reader.</p>

<h2 id="musing-a-single-fixit-must-preserve-actual-behavior-or-likely-intent-but-cant-do-both">Musing: A single fixit must preserve (actual) behavior or (likely) intent, but can’t do both</h2>

<p>It’s easy for the programmer to “fix” diagnostics like <code>-Wunused-result</code> and <code>-Wlogical-op-parentheses</code>,
because they’re just asking the programmer to clarify intent that is already pretty clear:
<em>Yes</em>, I mean to discard this result. <em>Yes</em>, I mean to evaluate <code>(a &amp;&amp; b) || c</code>.</p>

<p>The more interesting diagnostics are the ones where the compiler believes it has identified a mismatch
between the code’s actual <em>behavior</em> and the programmer’s <em>intent</em>. Our <code>if (argc = 1)</code> example
above was like that. A more realistic example might be something like</p>



<p>Here it is almost certain that the programmer intended to write</p>



<p>However, the literal behavior of the code as written is equivalent to</p>



<p>When the compiler suggests a fixit for this warning, it has to choose: Should we suggest the fix
that changes the behavior of the code to what you probably meant to type — the “spellcheck” option?
Or should we show how to silence the warning while preserving the existing code’s behavior — the
“Add To Dictionary” option, if you will? (Or, continuing our medical analogy, there’s the “treatment”
option and the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_resuscitate">DNR</a>” option.)</p>

<p>Showing just the “treatment” option puts the compiler in the awkward position of “recommending” that you change
the behavior of code that is, after all, perfectly legal C++ already; blindly applying the fixit to
working code might break that code. But showing just the “suppression” option might encourage a programmer to
blindly apply the fixit to <em>broken</em> code, thus leaving the bug in place but making it harder to detect
in the future.</p>

<p>For certain kinds of warnings, Clang shows <em>both</em> fixits. Two examples of this in Clang 10
are (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/aWf9s6">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: using the result of an assignment as a condition without parentheses [-Wparentheses]
    if (x = foo())
        ~~^~~~~~~
note: place parentheses around the assignment to silence this warning
    if (x = foo())
          ^
        (        )
note: use '==' to turn this assignment into an equality comparison
     if (x = foo())
          ^
          ==
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: &amp; has lower precedence than !=; != will be evaluated first [-Wparentheses]
    return (foo() &amp; mask != 0);
                  ^~~~~~~~~~~
note: place parentheses around the '!=' expression to silence this warning
    return (foo() &amp; mask != 0);
                  ^
                    (        )
note: place parentheses around the &amp; expression to evaluate it first
    return (foo() &amp; mask != 0);
                  ^
            (           )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that in both cases, Clang decides to print the “suppression” option first
and the “treatment” option second.
But sometimes Clang prints the “treatment” option first and the “suppression” option second:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: size argument in 'strncmp' call is a comparison [-Wmemsize-comparison]
    return strncmp(a, b, len &lt; 0);
                         ~~~~^~~
note: did you mean to compare the result of 'strncmp' instead?
    return strncmp(a, b, len &lt; 0);
           ^                    ~
                            )
note: explicitly cast the argument to size_t to silence this warning
    return strncmp(a, b, len &lt; 0);
                         ^
                         (size_t)( )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: logical not is only applied to the left hand side of this comparison [-Wlogical-not-parentheses]
    return x == y &amp;&amp; !x == z;
                     ^  ~~
note: add parentheses after the '!' to evaluate the comparison first
    return x == y &amp;&amp; !x == z;
                     ^
                      (     )
note: add parentheses around left hand side expression to silence this warning
    return x == y &amp;&amp; !x == z;
                     ^
                     ( )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, there are many more cases where Clang emits <em>only</em> the “suppression” option
as a fixit, leaving the programmer to figure out the “treatment” on their own. (GCC 10.2
emits a fixit for only the last of these four examples; and it’s the “suppression” option.)</p>

<p>Even in the absence of any machine-readable fixits, the phrasing of the warning message
itself can induce the human reader to think in terms of suppression or in
terms of treatment. A warning message can be phrased as “Please confirm that you meant X”;
or “You did X; did you mean Y?”; or even as “Your attempt to do Y failed.”</p>

<h2 id="musing-suppression-mechanisms-are-about-edit-distance-and-about-signaling">Musing: Suppression mechanisms are about edit distance, and about signaling</h2>

<p>Compiler warnings of the kind we’re discussing here are basically of the form
“You wrote X, but I think you meant Y.” This happens only when X and Y are
in some sense <em>close together</em>. Sometimes the “closeness” is semantic, not syntactic
(as when the programmer means to invoke copy elision but writes <code>return std::move(x)</code> instead).
But for our purposes today, let’s just think about <em>syntactic</em> closeness. You meant
to write Y, but a minor typographical slip caused you to write X. In the examples above,
the slips are things like “omit one <code>=</code>,” or “omit a pair of parens” or
“put <code>&lt; 0</code> inside the parens instead of outside.”</p>

<p>Take X=”equality-compare <code>!a</code> to <code>b</code>” and Y=”negate the sense of <code>a == b</code>.”
There are some pieces of code that clearly intend to express X, such as <code>(!a)==(b)</code>.
There are some that clearly intend to express Y, such as <code>a != b</code>.
But you wrote <code>(!a==b)</code>, which falls into a gray area: it’s not clear which of
X and Y you really intended to express.</p>

<p>The job of the compiler-diagnostic-developer is to create some separation between
the space of inputs that the compiler considers “clearly X”
and the space of inputs that the compiler considers “clearly Y.”
Essentially, we create an error-correcting code by deliberately increasing the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">edit distance</a>
between pairs of inequivalent C++ programs — deliberately increasing the number of keystrokes
the programmer would have to screw up in order to transform a working (and warning-free)
C++ program into an inequivalent broken (yet warning-free) C++ program.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in cases where Y is more commonly intended than X, it should be relatively <em>easier</em>
to write Y than X. In our example that’s true even at the core-language level: <code>a != b</code> is
already easier to write than <code>!a == b</code>. But when we increase the distance between X-space and Y-space,
we shrink X-space by more than we shrink Y-space. If you really intend to express <code>!a == b</code>, we’ll force you
to retreat all the way to <code>(!a) == b</code>. This is kind of analogous to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)">signaling principle</a>
in economics or evolutionary biology: Basically, if you want the compiler to accept your intent,
your code must adopt some cumbersome and frankly maladaptive ornamentation in order to <em>prove</em>
its worthiness to the compiler.</p>

<p>According to the prevailing theory of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle">sexual selection in the animal kingdom</a>,
when a peahen is deciding whether to accept
a particular peacock, she uses …</p></div></div>

This material is collected on disk as PCAP files containing any form of handshake supported by hashcat, including full and half WPA handshakes as well as PMKIDs. Or put quickly, it's a tamagochi who eats WiFi handshakes to be happy.</p><p>Hash Monster runs in a smaller size and cheaper platform superior to the Pwnagotchi in several aspects. While Pwnagotchi is based on the Raspberry Pi Zero and requires assembling a DIY kit with various components such as an eInk screen and an external powerbank, the Hash Monster works on directly on the tiny M5Stack device. M5 Stack couples an ESP32 with a small LCD display, buttons and internal battery. It’s a modular, stackable, scalable, and portable device which is powered with an ESP-32 core, which makes it open source, low cost, full-function, and easy for developers to handle ESP32 IoT product development. You can program M5Stack through Arduino, C++, Blockly or MicroPython to name a few. The complete development kit for M5 Stack just under $45 provides a friendly price and full-featured resources which makes it a good starter kit for you to explore ESP32. While the M5 Stack includes a built-in battery 110mAh, it can be upgraded with a stackable 700 mAh lipo battery extension module.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/615059260bcadb5085e71de543154bec6c52222f5d1efda91cdcafdbe403cce2.png"></p><p>The similarity between Pwnagotchi and Hash Monster is that they capture both PSK handshakes from WPA / WPA2 networks and PSK hashes contained in beacon frames with PMKID. A great advantage of PMKID cracking is that everything you need is available over the air even if there are no stations connected and only a single packet capture is required. Later we can crack these hashes with standard tools such as aircrack or hashcat, and thus obtain the credentials. Of course, we should only do this in networks that we manage ourselves or that we have permission to audit.</p><p><strong>The process.</strong></p><p>Hardware requirements:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bit.ly/3jFAnl8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">M5Stack CORE Development Kit</a> with built-in 110mAh Battery ($45)</li></ul><p>Optionally:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bit.ly/3gYtI48" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Extended Battery M5Stack Core Development Kit Capacity 700mAh Stackable Module</a> (USD$12)</li><li><a href="https://www.banggood.com/M5Stack-Multi-function-Digital-Watch-with-700mAh-Battery-for-M5Stack-ESP32-Core-p-1551727.html?rmmds=search&amp;cur_warehouse=CN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Smart Watch Module with 700mAh Battery for M5Stack ESP32 Core</a> ($15)</li></ul><p>The software installation is pretty straight forward:</p><p>1.Setup Arduino IDE environment.</p><p><em>M5Stack Arduino IDE Setup in 5 minutes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2es-l4z2Zg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2es-l4z2Zg</a></em></p><p>2.

We will do this with two known tools – Aircrack-ng and Hashcat, which relies respectively on CPU and GPU power. We will be running these tools from linux, even though they are both found in a Windows version as well. Remember to use recent versions to benefit from the PMKID attack in addition to the traditional cracking of handshakes.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/adb3724e47a02d9fe14b83454cae422f882a9c99ccc78f0f2db6ef6e7a7f6f9b.png"></p><p>Aircrack-ng can be used for very basic dictionary attacks running on your CPU. Before you run the attack you need a wordlist. I recommend using the infamous rockyou dictionary file:</p><p># download the 134MB rockyou dictionary file</p><pre><code><code>curl -L -o rockyou.txt https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt</code></code></pre><p>Note, that if the network password is not in the wordlist you will not crack the password.</p><p># -a2 specifies WPA2, -b is the BSSID, -w is the wordfile</p><pre><code><code>aircrack-ng -a2 -b AC:FC:E3:C9:AB:C0 -w rockyou.txt 3.cap</code></code></pre><p>If the password is cracked you will see a KEY FOUND! message in the terminal followed by the plain text version of the network password.</p><p>Cracking an WiFi password using brute force attack for a long WiFi password without GPUs or Cloud help, will be a nightmare but if the password is short or you know the key pattern it will be "easily" cracked.</p><p>Here you have a small guide for linux (Ubuntu) to crack the WiFi password using the files stored on the SD_Card of the Purple Hash Monster using your computer.</p><p>First we need to install <strong>hashcat</strong></p><pre><code><code>sudo apt-get update</code><br>
<code> sudo apt install hashcat</code></code></pre><p>EAPOL/PMKID stored on the SD-Card are <em>pcap</em> files, we have to convert to <em>hccapx</em> format to work with hashcat. In terminal from the directory were we have the <em>pcap</em> file from the SD-CARD:</p><pre><code><code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashcat/hashcat-utils/master/src/cap2hccapx.c</code><br>
<code> gcc -o cap2hccapx cap2hccapx.c</code><br>
<code> ./cap2hccapx 1.pcap 1.hccapx</code></code></pre><p>For example if we know that the wifi password has a lenght of 8 digits we can run the following command, and in few seconds we will have the WiFi Password :)</p><pre><code><code>hashcat --force -m 2500 -a 3 -1 ?d -o cracked 1.hccapx ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1</code></code></pre><p><strong>Final notes</strong></p><p>Although in my case I exclusively use the M5 Stack for the pocket monster hash, there are undoubtedly several projects that run on the M5 Stack and you will certainly want to take a look if you are interested in wifi and bluetooth security attack tools for this platform.</p><p>M5 Stack WiFi SSID Scanner by Elkentaro</p><p><a href="https://github.com/elkentaro/M5_SSID_scanner_collector" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/elkentaro/M5_SSID_scanner_collector</a></p><p>Covid Sniffer: BLE COVID exposure app sniffer using M5 Stack</p><p><a href="https://gitlab.com/mschmidl/covidsniffer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gitlab.com/mschmidl/covidsniffer</a></p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/02ee78aa44062073eb950642e19a44a548daf55d3217643f1a98cc84d37bc7d6.jpeg"></p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><code>API</code> is the acronym for Application Programming Interface which defines interactions between multiple software architecture layers. Programmers carry out complex tasks easily using APIs in software development. Without APIs, a programmer's life would have been miserable with no proper(security, for example) access to data,  knowing unnecessary low level details etc.</p>
<p>When it comes to Web APIs, there are extremely useful  objects, properties and functions available to perform tasks as minor as accessing DOM to as complex as managing audios, videos, graphics, etc. </p>

<p>If you are from the web development background, you are using many of them already. Here is the list of very well known web APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API">History</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API">Geolocation</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console_API">Console</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API">Drag &amp; Drop API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I am going to talk about 10 more web APIs that are not so popular. Lesser popular doesn't mean, they are not useful. You can use them in various use-cases of your project. Please have a look.</p>

<p>If you would like to jump into the source code or see the demonstration immediately, here are the quick links to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/atapas/demolab/tree/master/code/src/demos/web-apis">Link to the Source Code @GitHub</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://demo.greenroots.info/categories/web-apis/">Link to the Web API DemoLab</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Web APIs are nothing but the interfaces, functions, objects, properties written and exposed using vanilla JavaScript. However the usage of the web APIs is not limited to the vanilla JavaScript based application alone. It is very straightforward to use them with an Angular, React or Vue based applications as well.</p>
<p>All the examples I have used to demonstrate the web apis in this article are written using reactjs. You can find them in the github link mentioned above. Please feel free to fork, change and use!</p>

<p>A big (pain) point about  using a web API is, most of them are not standardized yet. It means, the support for a web API  may differ from one browser vendor to another. For example, You may find an API working with the Chrome browser but, not supported by Firefox or Edge browsers yet.</p>
<p>I would suggest a couple of ways to have a check on this,</p>


<p>Alright, time to get started knowing them. Hope you also find these useful.</p>
<h2 id="1-fullscreen-api">1. 📺 Fullscreen API</h2>
<p>Do you have the need to show any of the DOM elements in full-screen mode? The full-screen use-case is very demanding for gaming applications, online video platforms(like, youtube) etc. </p>
<p>The <code>Fullscreen API</code> provides methods to present a specific Element (and its children) in a full-screen mode. There is a method available to exit full-screen mode once it is no longer needed. Not only that, this API can also help to perform any actions when a DOM element transition into a full-screen mode or comes out of it.</p>
<p>In the example below, my favorite Santa Claus can get into the full-screen mode and come out of it with ease.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598715764074/fR7trCfsA.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="full_screen.gif"></p>
<p>In the code below, the <code>manageFullScreen()</code> function uses  the <code>requestFullscreen()</code> API on an element which is having an id called, <code>fs_id</code>. </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> manageFullscreen = () =&gt; {
   <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'fs_id'</span>).requestFullscreen();
}
</code></pre>
<p>This element with id, <code>fs_id</code> is a <code>DIV</code> with a child element, i.e, the Santa Clause image.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div className=<span>"column"</span>&gt;
  <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"fs_id"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Img</span> <span>fixed</span>=<span>{imageData.image.childImageSharp.fixed}</span> <span>alt</span>=<span>"santa"</span> /&gt;</span>
   <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;<span>StyledButton</span> 
         <span>onClick</span>=<span>{manageFullscreen}</span>&gt;</span>
            Enter Fullscreen with Santa
    <span>&lt;/<span>StyledButton</span>&gt;</span>
 <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can check if the <code>Fullscreen API</code> is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (<span>document</span>.fullscreenEnabled) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Also watch out for the useful handlers like,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>onfullscreenchange</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenchange event.</li>
<li><code>onfullscreenerror</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenerror event.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-clipboard-async-api">2. 📋 Clipboard Async API</h2>
<p>What is a clipboard in comuping?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The clipboard is a buffer that some operating systems provide for short-term storage and transfer within and between application programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are mainly three operations you can perform with the clipboard. They are, <code>copy</code>, <code>cut</code> and <code>paste</code>. The Clipboard API provides the ability to respond to these three operations. </p>
<p>Interestingly, copying content to the clipboard is open as in, there is no need of a user permission. However, for pasting the content from the clipboard to the user application, the user needs to grant permission for it. It is achieved using another web API called, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API">Permission API</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716493747/PwPwDDK8Y.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Here is a simple example of the copy-paste operation,</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716547383/PoXUNZmnr.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="clip_board.gif"></p>
<p>This is how to check if the feature is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (navigator.clipboard 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.read 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.write) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the async API function for writing the content to the clipboard,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performCopy</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
      <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.writeText(copyText);
      <span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${copyText}</span> copied to clipboard`</span>);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to copy: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Async API function to read the content from the clipboard and do something with it,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performPaste</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
       <span>const</span> text = <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.readText();
       setPastetext(text);
       <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Pasted content: '</span>, text);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to read clipboard contents: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note: With the inclusion of the <code>Clipboard Async API</code>, you can get rid of the usage of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand">document.execCommad()</a> function as it is obsolete now.</p>

<h2 id="3-resize-observer-api">3. 🧐 Resize Observer API</h2>
<p>Do you want to take some actions based on the changes to the content or border box of a DOM element? Are you thinking of writing a handler by yourself? What if I tell you, there is already one provided by the web API implementation?</p>
<p>Here is a story about a dumb button. We use a range slider to resize the button. While the button gets resized, we also want to control the text color, without letting the button know much about it. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717277220/dITL6Nog2.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="resizer.gif"></p>
<p>First, create a button and specify an id so that, we can access the button later using the id.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;StyledButton id=<span>"dumbBtnId"</span>&gt;
   I am a Dumb Button
&lt;<span>/StyledButton&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now we create a slider using the <code>range</code> input type from HTML5. A <code>resize()</code> function is invoked when the slider value changes.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
   <span><span>&lt;<span>input</span> 
         <span>onChange</span>=<span>{(event)</span> =&gt;</span> resize(event)} 
         type="range" 
         min={minRange} 
         max={maxRange} 
         defaultValue={rangeValue} /&gt;
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>resize()</code> function simply sets the width of the button as the slider range value so that, it can be resized dynamically.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> resize = event =&gt; {
   <span>const</span> value = event.target.valueAsNumber;
   setRangeValue(value);
   <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
   dumbBtn.style.width = <span>`<span>${value}</span>px`</span>;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>So far, so good? Now for every range value change, the button gets resized. We have a <code>ResizeObserver</code> observing this change and change the color of the button text.</p>
<pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {
   <span>try</span> {
            <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
            <span>var</span> resizeObserver = <span>new</span> ResizeObserver(entries =&gt; {
                <span>for</span>(<span>const</span> entry <span>of</span> entries) {
                    
                    
                   entry.target.style.color = <span>'green`;
                }
      });
      resizeObserver.observe(dumbBtn);
   } catch(e) {
            setSupported(false);
            console.log(e);      
   }
}, [rangeValue]);</span>
</code></pre>

<p>There are some cool and useful APIs around user media like, audio, video etc. I love the <code>Image Capture API</code> which helps us to capture an image or grab a frame from the video devices(like webcam). Not only that, you can also perform actions on capturing an image or grabbing a frame.</p>
<p>First, get the user media access. In this case we are getting the webcam access.</p>
<pre><code>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: <span>true</span>})
  .then(mediaStream =&gt; {
     <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'video'</span>).srcObject = mediaStream;
     <span>const</span> track = mediaStream.getVideoTracks()[<span>0</span>];
     setTrack(track);
  }).catch(error =&gt; {
     <span>console</span>.error(<span>` <span>${error}</span> is not yet supported`</span>);
     setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Just like the clipboard paste operation, a webcam media access permission has to be granted by the user.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717565379/MCRNY49Tl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Now Grab a frame and do something. In this example, I am just drawing the frame on a Canvas.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.grabFrame()
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#grabFrameCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>I can also take a picture and do the similar thing.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.takePhoto().then(blob =&gt; createImageBitmap(blob))
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#takePhotoCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>To stop the video streaming from the webcam, just call he method <code>stop()</code> on the running video track.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> videoOff = () =&gt; {
   track.stop();
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Also watch out for the methods,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getPhotoCapabilities()</code>: To get the ranges of available configuration options.</li>
<li><code>getPhotoSettings()</code>: To get the current photo configuration settings.</li>
</ul>

        <p>With this year’s <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2020">International Conference on Machine Learning&nbsp;(ICML)</a>
being over, it is time to have another instalment of this series.
Similar to <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/icml_tda_roundup/">last year’s post</a>, I shall cover
several papers that caught my attention because of their use of
topological concepts—however, <em>unlike</em> last year, I shall not
restrict the selection to papers using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis">topological data analysis&nbsp;(TDA)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat lector:</strong> I might have missed some promising papers. Any
suggestions for additions are more than welcome! Please reach out

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04881">Learning Flat Latent Manifolds with VAEs</a>
by <a href="https://argmax.ai/team/nutan-chen">Nutan Chen</a>, <a href="https://www.argmax.ai/team/alexej-klushyn">Alexej Klushyn</a>,
Francesco Ferroni, <a href="http://bayerj.github.io/">Justin Bayer</a>, and
<a href="https://argmax.ai/team/patrick-van-der-smagt">Patrick van der Smagt</a>
discusses an interesting modification of variational autoencoders, viz.
an extended loss term that regularises the latent space to be
<em>flat</em>&nbsp;(i.e. having no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature">curvature</a>).
The main idea is to ensure that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor">Riemannian metric tensor</a>
is the identity matrix.</p>
<p>The ingenious implication of such a latent space is that the Euclidean
distance is a good proxy for the similarity between data points, whereas
this is <em>not</em> a priori the case for other latent spaces. It is interesting
to note that there is a ‘sibling’ paper to this one, which was published
at ICLR 2020, namely <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1g6xeSKDS">Mixed-curvature Variational Autoencoders</a>.
This paper presents an autoencoder whose latent space is a product of
Riemannian manifolds, whose curvature is either fixed or learnable.</p>
<p>I am glad to see that curvature is starting to attract more attention
from the machine learning community. It is such a fundamental property
of a manifold but can influence the validity of many calculations in
latent spaces. It also has some beneficial properties for <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BylEqnVFDB">graph
classification</a>, but this is
maybe a better topic for a subsequent post!</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10996">Graph Filtration Learning</a> by
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christoph_Hofer8">Christoph Hofer</a>,
<a href="https://www.uni-salzburg.at/index.php?id=213185&amp;L=1">Florian Graf</a>,
<a href="https://bastian.rieck.me/">Bastian Rieck</a>,
<a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~mn/?q=content/overview">Marc Niethammer</a>, and
<a href="https://rkwitt.github.io/">Roland Kwitt</a> is arguably<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> the first step
towards properly integrating topological features into neural networks
for graph classification! Briefly put, we developed a homological
<code>READOUT</code> function&nbsp;(to use the parlance of graph neural networks)
that gives rise to a learnable filter function—a <em>filtration</em>.</p>
<p>This concept might be unknown to some readers, but a filtration in this
context is a scalar-valued function on the vertices of a graph that
permits <em>sorting</em> it. Filtrations serve as the backbone for many
topology-based algorithms, primarily for the aforementioned <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology/">persistent homology</a>,
which permits us to study multi-scale topological
features&nbsp;(connected components, cycles, etc.) of an object.
Prior to this paper, filtrations were pre-defined or chosen based on
some target function, such as the vertex degree function of a graph. Our
approach changes this—leading to a filtration that is learnable in an
end-to-end fashion and thus specifically designed for a classification
problem.</p>
<p>We manage to achieve this by first initialising our filter function
based on a regular graph neural network; essentially, one level of
message passing between nodes is sufficient. This provides us with
a non-trivial filter function whose performance we can subsequently
adjust by calculating the topological features induced by said filter,
and vectorising the resulting representations. Since each of these steps
is differentiable<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, the resulting function is also differentiable,
making it possible to adjust the filter for the best classification
results.</p>
<p>I would recommend this paper to anyone who is interested in learning
more about the benefits that a topology-based perspective brings to
certain application problems. Being able to learn the <em>right</em> topological features
to classify a set of graphs opens up exciting opportunities.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04805">Topologically Densified Distributions</a>
by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christoph_Hofer8">Christoph Hofer</a>,
<a href="https://www.uni-salzburg.at/index.php?id=213185&amp;L=1">Florian Graf</a>,
<a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~mn/?q=content/overview">Marc Niethammer</a>, and
<a href="https://rkwitt.github.io/">Roland Kwitt</a> studies regularisation properties of
over-parametrised neural networks in the context of small sample-size learning.
This is achieved by studying the properties of latent
representations&nbsp;(the paper uses the term <em>internal representation</em>,
but this is equivalent). More precisely, generalisation properties are
analysed via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_measure">push-forward probability measure</a>
induced by the latent representation&nbsp;(or <em>encoding</em>).</p>
<p>The authors show that probability mass concentration around training
samples in the latent space is linked to the generalisation capabilities
of a model, but, even more exciting, such a concentration can be achieved by applying
topological constraints on samples from that space! In the context of
this paper, such constraints pertain to measuring the <em>connectivity</em> of
samples. This is achieved using <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology/">persistent homology</a>, specifically,
by calculating a zero-dimensional Vietoris–Rips complex—if you are
not familiar with this term, just think of a minimum spanning tree.</p>
<p>What I particularly enjoyed about this paper is that it starts providing
solid answers to fundamental concepts in machine learning. All too often,
we remain in the realm of the empirical and just <em>observe</em> whether our
network generalises. This paper ventures into hitherto-unknown territories
and gives us a theoretical justification!</p>

<a href="https://bastian.rieck.me/">Bastian Rieck</a>, and
<a href="https://bsse.ethz.ch/mlcb/karsten.html">Karsten Borgwardt</a> deals with
regularising the latent space in terms of its topology. More precisely,
we preserve the topological features of the input data in the respective
latent space&nbsp;(on the batch level, respectively). While we restrict
our experiments to connected components for now&nbsp;(so no cycles
yet, even though our method generalises to higher dimensions),
our approach makes it possible to create latent representations
that ‘mimic’ the topological features of the input.</p>
<p>This leads to a nice plug-and-play loss term that can be easily
integrated into most architectures, and we can demonstrate that, among
others, it considerably improves the quality of a ‘vanilla’ autoencoder
architecture. To achieve this goal, we had to solve all kinds of
interesting adventures, one of them being how to make everything
differentiable. Interestingly, we end up with a similar necessary
condition for differentiability than for the graph filtration learning
paper, viz. the pairwise distances between different samples of the
input batch need to be <em>unique</em>.</p>
<p>The coolest feature of our method is that it technically <em>only</em> requires
a distance metric between input samples<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, nothing more—no feature
vector representation or anything. It can thus conceivably be used to
represent the topology of any object you fancy&nbsp;(including
documents, images, and graphs).</p>
<p>If you are interested in a beautifully-animated high-level introduction
to this publication, you should take the time to read Michael’s <a href="https://michaelmoor.ml/blog/topoae/main/">blog post on our paper</a>.</p>

<a href="https://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/shanahan_phiala.html">Phiala E.  Shanahan</a>,
and <a href="http://theoryandpractice.org/">Kyle Cranmer</a>
present a novel method for calculating normalising flows on more complex
spaces than the usual Euclidean ones. Specifically, as the title
implies, they develop methods for calculating such flows on tori and
spheres.</p>
<p>What I enjoyed about this paper is the smart way of constructing flows
iteratively: first, flows on the circle are being constructed&nbsp;(using
different concepts for defining a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism">diffeomorphism</a>, the most favourite of
mine being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation">Möbius transformation</a>).
Since a torus can be described as the Cartesian product of circles, this
is sufficient to describe flows on tori of arbitrary dimensions! Next,
the flows are generalised to higher-dimensional spheres.</p>
<p>While I am by no means and expert in normalising flows, I liked
reading this paper a lot. The theory is well-developed and it is another
one of those publications that shows you how to go beyond the boundaries
of what is currently possible. Moreover, I enjoyed the discussion of the
implementation details—it turns out that achieving numerical stability
here is another feat that deserves some mention!</p>

<p>This year’s ICML also featured an interesting array of topology-based
papers. Not all of them fit neatly into the field of topological data
analysis&nbsp;(TDA), but I am happy to see that the community is
starting to pick up this fundamental topic. I remain convinced that
a topology-driven perspective is needed to answer certain foundational
questions in machine learning. Here’s to the future of topology!</p>

September 1, 2020 | https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/fight.jpeg" alt="Fish"></p>
<p>In the early 70s, C was created at Bell Labs as a byproduct of the development of UNIX.
It quickly became one of the most popular programming languages.
But it was not expressive enough for Bjarne Stroustrup.
And so, in 1983, as a byproduct of his Ph.D. thesis, he extended C.</p>
<p>C with classes was born.</p>
<p>At the time, Bjarne Stroustrup understood that a programming language has many components,
not only the language, its compiler, but also a linker and libraries.
Offering a familiar tool also makes adoption easier.
In this historical context, it makes sense that C++ would be based on C.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 40 years later.</p>
<p>Both C and C++ are widely used in the industry.
But go 5 minutes on the Internet and C developers will tell you that C++ is the most horrific man-made creation,
while many C++ developers wait for the day when C finally burns in the hot flames of hell.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h2>
<p>On the surface, C and C++ cater to the same use cases: high performance, deterministic, native but portable code for the widest range of hardware and applications.</p>
<p>But C is proudly a low-level language. A nicer assembly.</p>
<p>From day one, C++ had magic. Dark witchcraft: destructors. Suddenly the compiler was doing things on its own.
It also had type inference very early on, but the developers of the mid-80s were not quite ready for that and Bjarne Stroustrup
was pressured into removing <code>auto</code>, until it was added back to C++11.</p>
<p>From then, C++ got more and more tools to build abstractions.
I don’t think it would be fair to say that C++ is a low-level or high-level language. It’s both, by design.
But building high-level abstractions while not sacrificing performance is hard.
C++ then needed tools to achieve that: <code>constexpr</code>, move semantics, templates, and an ever-growing standard library.</p>
<p>Fundamentally I think C trusts developers while C++ trusts compilers.
This is a massive difference that sharing the same native types or syntax for while loop cannot hide.</p>
<p>C++ developers blame C for all their lost limbs, while C developers probably think C++ is batshit crazy.
I imagine that is a fair perspective if you look at C++ through a C lense. C++ is pretty wild <em>as a superset of C</em>.
A seasoned C person looking at C++ expecting familiarity in C++ will not find it. C++ is not C.
This is enough to feed flamewars for generations.</p>
<p>But as much as I dislike C, I don’t have any legitimacy to make fun of it. See, I have some experience with C++ but I
wrote very little C. It was probably bad C.
A language is also its good practices, patterns, idioms, and these take years to learn. If you try to write C code like it’s C++ or C++ like it is C, you will have a bad time.
Knowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk">C doesn’t teach you C++</a>. Knowing C++ does not teach you C.</p>
<p>So can we all stop saying C/C++, regret the unfortunate naming, and sing kumbaya in harmony?
Not so fast.</p>
<p>See, despite being philosophically different from C, C++ is still somewhat a superset of C.
That is to say, you can include a C header in a C++ translation unit and that should compile.
And this is where it gets messy.</p>
<p>C++ is not an extension of C.
It is designed as a separate standard, by a different committee, different people.
Logically, people who like C++'s philosophy will get involved in the C++ community and the C++ standardization process
while other people might try to get involved with C.
Committees, whether its C’s or C++'s, only manifest intent and direction through their respective end-product: the standards; standards which are the fruits of numerous voting.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is difficult for a compiler to know that it is dealing with a C header or a C++ header.</p>
<p><code>extern "C"</code> is not used consistently and only affects mangling, but neither grammar nor semantics.
And headers only exists in the eyes of the preprocessor, for a C++ compiler, everything is a C++ translation unit, and therefore C++.
And yet, people include C headers in C++ and expect it to “just work” ™️.
Which it mostly does.</p>
<p>We can wonder then,</p>
<h2 id="how-c-maintains-c-compatibility-while-being-developed-by-different-people-in-different-places">How C++ maintains C compatibility while being developed by different people in different places?</h2>
<p>Badly, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>A coworker recently reminded me of Conway’s law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that logic, it would stand to reason that if the two committees don’t interoperate,
neither would the languages they produce.</p>
<p>C++ maintains a list of <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.iso">incompatibilities with C</a> and <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.library">its standard library</a>.
This list does not seem to reflect the many features that were added to C11 and C18 but are not valid C++ constructs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a> draws a clearer picture.</p>
<p>Listing incompatibilities isn’t sufficient to get a measure of incompatibilities between both languages.</p>
<p>Functions that exist in the C++ standard library but whose primary declaration is expected to come from C are difficult to make <code>constexpr</code>, and more difficult still to make <code>noexcept</code>.
C compatibility translates to performance costs and C functions are optimization barriers.</p>
<p>Many C constructs are valid C++ but should never pass a code review (<code>NULL</code>, <code>longjmp</code>, <code>malloc</code>, create/destroy functions, <code>free</code>, C  casts), etc.</p>
<p>These might not be bad C idioms, but they are bad C++. C++ has a stronger type system,
and unfortunately using C idioms punch a giant hole in that type system, and so C compatibility has a cost in terms of safety.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, C++ still care about C compatibility. Somewhat.
And interestingly C cares about C++. Somewhat.
Truth be told, C might care about C++ more than C++ cares about C.
So each committee cares somewhat about what the other does.
We care reluctantly.</p>
<p>See, C++ is aware of the many foundational libraries written in C, not only the <code>libc</code> but also <code>zip</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>openssl</code> (!), and countless others, which are used in many, many C++ projects.
We can’t break that.</p>
<p>But recently, especially over the past decade, C++ has become much bigger than C.
C++ has more users - and a much more active community: <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/">There Are No C Conferences</a>.
Maybe that’s why the C++ committee is now over 10 times the size of the C committee.</p>
<p>C++ then is a force to be reckoned with and the C committee has to consider not breaking C++.
To the point that if a standard would track another, these days, C++ leads and C follow.</p>
<p>C++ is now on a steady three years cycle come rain or shine, or deadly pandemics.
Meanwhile, C has a major release every decade or so.
This makes sense. As a lower-level language, C doesn’t need to evolve as fast.</p>
<p>The C landscape is also rather different from the C++ landscape.
C caters to more platforms and a lot more compilers.
Everybody and their dog is writing C compilers because the language has a surface area small enough to make that possible, whereas the C++ committee will only really consider 4 implementations, all of which are represented at every meeting.
As a result, many features in C are implementation-defined or optionally supported so that the variety of compilers that exist can claim conformance without doing much work, which I’m told pleases regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>C++ these days is more interested in portability than implementation freedom. Yet another difference of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="so-your-proposal-breaks-c-compatibility">So, your proposal breaks C compatibility</h2>
<p>Parts of my <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2178r1.pdf">P2178</a> paper theoretically affects C compatibility.
In such cases, none of the options seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>You could be told that you have to first get your feature into C. Which means more meetings.
Meetings you might not be able to attend because C has strict <a href="https://thephd.github.io/follow-the-river-wg14-ithaca-2019">attendance rules</a> - Excluding individuals not willing to put down thousands of dollars to become ISO members.
This is because the C committee is forced to adhere strictly to ISO rules.</p>
<p>It might also take a decade if the standard just shipped.
And most importantly, it might go nowhere if the C committee doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about the particular problem you are trying to solve.
And they probably don’t have the bandwidth to deal with it.
And you may not have the bandwidth to deal with C. After all, you joined C++ to improve C++.
In fact, if the room invites you to “talk to the C committee”, it is likely your proposal is dead, even in the unlikely event that no one in the room was against it.</p>
<p>Another likely scenario is that the C committee accepts a version of a proposal that is slightly different from what exists in C++.
<code>true</code>? Let’s make that a macro. <code>char16_t</code> ? Let’s make that a typedef. <code>char32_t</code>? Not necessarily UTF-32. <code>static_assert</code> ? <code>_Static_assert</code>.</p>
<p>The list goes on. Should we blame C? Probably not. Their committee does what they think is best for their language.
The opposite is true too. In C++20 designated initializers were inspired by C’s but are slightly different because they would otherwise not fit with the C++ initialization rules.</p>
<p>I am part of the problem. C has VLAs. I would vote against a proposal to adopt that in standard C++, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Kills-The-VLA">too many security issues</a>. A proposal to add <code>_Generic</code> to C++ would be over-my-dead-body. I am not sure if <code>_Generic</code> attempts to palliate to the lack of template or the lack of overloads, but C++ has both these features - from my point of view <code>_Generic</code> doesn’t fit into the big picture of what I imagine C++ to be.</p>
<p>Both committees seem also inconsistent in how much they care about the other language.
Sometimes we go to great lenghts (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex">std::complex</a>), sometimes we don’t care at all (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array">static array parameters</a>).</p>
<p>There is no way around this. Don’t forget that each committee is a bunch of people
voting at different times in different rooms and trying to control the outcome would defeat the purpose
of having a vote.
Putting people in the same room is not realistic either. ISO might object and the participation inbalance
would put C people at an enormous disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="c-compatibility-doesnt-matter-kinda">C compatibility doesn’t matter, kinda</h2>
<p>If you are a C developer, I imagine you see C as a neat programming language.
But for the rest of us, C is something else.</p>
<p>C is the universal, cross-language glue that ties it all together.</p>
<p>For C++ users, C is …</p></div></div>

<p>This is an exploratory post of what extensible unions (a.k.a. polymorphic variants) might look like in Elm. This mainly a post to plant a seed in the minds of the collective Elm community and is not a call to action that they need to be implemented in Elm (although I would really really really love if they were).</p>
<p>One-line headline: I think extensible unions not only fill in a missing abstract corner of Elm’s type system (rather than being a entirely novel extension to its type system), but also solve many real-world problems affecting Elm codebases today, all without compromising and indeed augmenting the Elm compiler’s excellent way of guiding users through refactors.</p>
<p>This post is jumping off a separate post <a href="https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/how-to-represent-many-subsets-of-an-enum/6088/22">here</a> with some folks who were interested in a deeper explanation of extensible unions/polymorphic variants.</p>
<p>This post ended up being <strong>really</strong> long, so I apologize for its length in advance, but I do hope that people find it useful.</p>
<p>Because of its length I’ll just lead off with a high-level summary.</p>
<p>Polymorphic variants or extensible union types are to normal Elm union types (e.g.&nbsp;<code>type MyUnionType = UnionVariant0 | UnionVariant1 | UnionVariant2</code>) what records and extensible records are to normal Elm product types (e.g.&nbsp;<code>type MyProductType = ProductType TypeOfElement0 TypeOfElement1 TypeOfElement2</code>).</p>
<p>As such they allow for many of the same benefits that records and extensible records bring to input types of functions and modularizing Elm models, to output types of functions and modularizing Elm messages and update functions.</p>
<p>This post is split up into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#what-are-extensible-union-types">What are extensible union types</a>: A introduction to some pseudo-Elm to help familiarize people with what extensible unions are. If you already know what extensible unions/polymorphic variants are you can skip this. <strong>The crucial take away is that we already have the equivalent of extensible unions for products, i.e.&nbsp;extensible records. This is just filling in a hole for current union types.</strong></li>
<li><a href="#what-are-the-benefits-of-extensible-unions">What are the benefits of extensible unions (the basics)</a>: Walking through some basic, contrived cases where extensible unions can come in handy.</li>
<li><a href="#everyday-elm-cases">Everyday Elm cases</a>: A non-exhaustive list of case studies of where extensible unions can help in code you’re likely to see in real Elm codebases.
<ul>
<li>Reminding you when you forget certain output cases for decoding</li>
<li>Unifying different error types</li>
<li>Modular Elm code: Unifying NoMap, OutMsg, and Translator</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="#drawbacks">Drawbacks and things-you-might-think-are-drawbacks-but-aren’t (a.k.a. literature review of other implementations)</a>: A dive into some cons and not-really-cons of extensible unions as well as how they’re implemented in other languages (mainly OCaml).</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s begin with a very short primer on union (a.k.a. sum types) and product types. We’ll approach them individually even though in Elm we can mix and match them together in a single type declaration. This hopefully will make some of the later presentation of extensible union types a little easier to follow.</p>
<p>Union types are those types that express an “or” relationship among its type constructors.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>-- MyColor is Red *or* Green *or* Blue</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>MyColor</span> <span>=</span> <span>Red</span> <span>|</span> <span>Green</span> <span>|</span> <span>Blue</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Product types are those types that express an “and” relationship in its (single) type constructor.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>-- MyUserType is a MyUser that consists of a String *and* another String (maybe</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span>-- a first and last name)</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a><span>type</span> <span>MyUserType</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyUser</span> <span>String</span> <span>String</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>These two kinds of types are dual, i.e.&nbsp;complements, to one another, where you’ll see each of them playing “opposite” roles in a lot of circumstances. We’ve already seen one example here, whereas a union type can have multiple type constructors, only one of which can be used at any given time for a single value (i.e.&nbsp;only one of <code>Red</code>, <code>Green</code>, or <code>Blue</code> can be in use for a single value of type <code>MyColor</code>), a product type has a single constructor with multiple fields, all of which must be filled in for a single value (for any value of <code>MyUserType</code> both strings must be provided to <code>MyUser</code>). Notice the inverted relationship between multiple and single between the two (i.e. multiple type constructors vs single type constructor and single variant in use vs multiple fields must all be filled in). This sort of “dual” inversion will show up a lot more later on.</p>
<p>Even though the two are complements to one another, statically typed programming languages in general seem to favor product types over union types. You see this with languages like Java that allow for the creation of product types (i.e.&nbsp;Java classes), but have no union types. Statically typed FP languages such as Elm address this imbalance by also allowing union types. This unlocks a host of data modeling goodies and is the core of how Elm allows us to create “correct by construction” models that make errors unrepresentable.</p>
<p>Elm, however, goes further than some other statically typed FP languages and bestows more power to product types through record types and extensible record types. These essentially are product types on steroids. To see that records are fundamentally product types, note that you could in theory replace every record type with a product type, it’d just make for really annoying code because all of a sudden your fields are all anonymous and position-based.</p>
<p>However, Elm, in a fashion that somewhat echoes Java’s choice to disadvantage union types, doesn’t provide equivalent power to union types. The rest of this post is an exploration in what that might look like if Elm did.</p>
<p>To understand the relationship between extensible union types and normal union types, it’s perhaps illuminating to first consider the relationship between record types and normal product types.</p>
<p>Notice that Elm records differ from Elm’s normal product types by being</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Structural: Normal product types in Elm are nominal, that is name-based. Every product type you use must have been declared somewhere and is given an explicit, unique name that is used for typechecking. On the other hand record types are anonymous. Though they can be given a name with <code>type alias</code> that name is non-canonical (the same record type can be given multiple different names) and plays no role in typechecking. In other words <em>the structure of a record type is all that matters to the type checker, not its name.</em></li>
<li>Extensible: Normal product type signatures must specify all possible fields it supports. Extensible records only need to specify a subset of fields and then leave the others unspecified.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just to make this clear, here are the three versions of a product type that Elm supports at the current moment.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>-- Normal Elm product type</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>SomeProductType</span> <span>=</span> <span>ProductTypeConstructor</span> <span>Int</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4"></a><span>-- Normal Elm record, notice the type alias rather than type</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>SomeRecord</span> <span>=</span> { <span>field0</span> : <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>field1</span> : <span>String</span> }</span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7"></a><span>-- Extensible Elm record, notice the type variable</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8"><a href="#cb3-8"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>ExtensibleRecord</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> { <span>a</span> <span>|</span> <span>field0</span> : <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>field1</span> : <span>String</span> }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Extensible union types introduce these two features, namely making a type structural and extensible, to union types. I find actual code to often be hepful here, so I’m going to introduce some hypothetical Elm syntax here.</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>-- Normal Elm sum type</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>User0</span> <span>=</span> <span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>|</span> <span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a><span>-- Hypothetical extensible union type, again note that this is a type alias</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>User1</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7"></a><span>-- Hypothetical extensible union type actually using the extensible portion,</span></span>
<span id="cb4-8"><a href="#cb4-8"></a><span>-- note the type variable</span></span>
<span id="cb4-9"><a href="#cb4-9"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>User2</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s go over <code>User1</code> and <code>User2</code> in more detail. Names prefixed with a an <code>@</code> symbol such as <code>@RegularUser</code> are extensible union tags. These play an analogous role to field names in a record type. That is <code>@RegularUser Int</code> is an independent type in the same way <code>{ field0 : Int }</code> is an independent type, rather than just a value like <code>RegularUser Int</code>.</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>@</span><span>SomeVariantTag</span> <span>MyType</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a><span>^</span> <span>tag</span> <span>name</span>      <span>^</span> <span>tagged</span> <span>type</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a>{ <span>recordField</span> : <span>MyType</span> }</span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a>  <span>^</span> <span>tag</span> <span>name</span>    <span>^</span> <span>tagged</span> <span>type</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Likewise, just like record field names can be used as the value level to directly create a value, extensible union tags can be used at the value level to directly create a value.</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>someRegularUser</span> : <span>User1</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a><span>-- Equivalently</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a><span>-- someRegularUser : @RegularUser Int or @AdminUser String</span></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4"></a><span>-- or</span></span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5"></a><span>-- someRegularUser : @AdminUser String or @RegularUser Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6"></a><span>-- Notice just like for record fields the order doesn't matter</span></span>
<span id="cb6-7"><a href="#cb6-7"></a><span>-- This is different from a normal sum type where Result String Int is</span></span>
<span id="cb6-8"><a href="#cb6-8"></a><span>-- different from Result Int String</span></span>
<span id="cb6-9"><a href="#cb6-9"></a><span>someRegularUser</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we could also have assigned this type</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>someOtherRegularUser</span> : <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a><span>someOtherRegularUser</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>or</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>lotsOfIrrelevantVariants</span> : <span>@</span><span>Blah</span> <span>String</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>Blahblah</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a><span>lotsOfIrrelevantVariants</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For now let’s leave aside why all these type signatures work other than to hand-wave it and say they all make sense if you think of “or”. We’ll return to that in just a bit when we look close at extensible types. Instead, let’s look at how to actually work with extensible unions.</p>
<p>Fundamentally the only thing you can do with a product type is pull out its fields. On the flip side, fundamentally the only thing you can do with a union type is pattern match on its variants with a case statement.</p>
<p>This remains true for extensible unions, which have their own associated case statement for pattern matching on them, introduced by <code>case#</code> instead of <code>case</code> (you could unify them as a single <code>case</code> statement, but I’m separating them for clarity here).</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>toInt</span> : <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a><span>toInt</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span><span>#</span> <span>user</span> <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a>    <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>x</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>x</span></span>

          <div><p>NeoAxis company releases a new version of NeoAxis Engine, an integrated development environment with built-in 3D and 2D game engine. The environment can be used to develop all kinds of 3D and 2D projects such as computer games, visual trainers, VR systems, to visualize processes and develop windowed applications.</p>
<p>In this release, the engine has been translated to .NET Core 3.1 from .NET Framework, has been added support for Visual Studio Code, Rider and other C# IDEs, the editor has been improved and optimized, in the launcher you can now create Window App projects, also examples of creating add-ons have been added to the Assets\Samples\Addons folder.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.neoaxis.com/images/2020_5/NeoAxis_2020_5_ScifiDemo.png"><img src="https://www.neoaxis.com/images/2020_5/NeoAxis_2020_5_ScifiDemo.jpg" alt="" width="900"></a></p>
<h2>.NET Core 3.1</h2>
<p>In this release, the engine was upgraded to .NET Core 3.1, previously .NET Framework 4.6 was used. This gave a performance improvement. The engine and editor are noticeably faster. Now the created application does not require .NET installation, it is included into the project. It is also now easy to update the project to newer versions of .NET such as .NET 5.</p>
<h2>Support for Visual Studio Code, Rider and other C# IDEs</h2>
<p>Project compilation is now supported using any IDE that supports C# and .NET Core 3.1.</p>
<h2>Window app creation</h2>
<p>The ability to create windowed applications has been improved. When creating a new project, you can choose a Window App template, with which you can set the initial settings. The engine includes its own GUI system and GUI designer. This allows you to create full-fledged windowed applications, however, creating of windowed applications is still a new feature of NeoAxis.</p>

        Zstandard is a real-time compression algorithm,
        providing high compression ratios.
        It offers a very wide range of compression / speed trade-off,
        while being backed by a very fast decoder (see <a href="#benchmarks">benchmarks</a> below).
        It also offers a special mode for small data, called <a href="#small-data">dictionary compression</a>,
        and can create dictionaries from any sample set.
        Zstandard library is provided as open source software using a BSD license.

That’s the question at the heart of a new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Union-Democrat-Republican-Search-Common/dp/0316423793" rel=" noopener"><em><span>Union: A Democrat, a Republican, and a Search for Common Ground</span></em></a>, by Jordan Blashek and Christopher Haugh.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Chris and Jordan’s search for common ground despite their political differences is a mission that aligns well with The Factual. So I was delighted to sit down with them a few weeks ago to see if their road trip revealed insights that may be useful to all of us grappling with an <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/"><span>increasingly polarized society</span></a>. Here are five excerpts from our <a href="https://bookpassage.extendedsession.com/session/jordan-blashek-chris-haugh/#registermodalheader"><span>fascinating conversation</span></a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e24da16992bfa6b6c3185d6/5e2641e4edc1c820dd1651f9_img-portrait-605KB.png" alt="5e2641e4edc1c820dd1651f9_img-portrait-605KB" width="2000"></p>
<h6><strong>You had many arguments on the road. Did you ever feel like throwing in the towel and saying this road trip was a bad idea?</strong></h6>
<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> I’m pretty sure Chris feels that way every time we have these arguments! I’m the combative one and love instigating our arguments. We have definitely had these moments. But over time we learned where our limits are and were respectful of them.</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> We were lucky that our first argument was in a car, hundreds of miles away from the closest town. When you’re in the midst of one of those fights and suddenly one person says “I’m done,” he can’t really get out of the car. Something about being forced together taught us this lesson of coming back to the table and how important that is.</p>
<p>We were forced to go through this thought process of: “Oh my God, I can’t believe I’m here. I can’t believe I’m with him. I can’t believe he said that.” Then you start to think, “well, maybe I shouldn’t have said that one thing. And maybe he had a point about that one thing.” You start to go through a full-circle process. And that first fight ended with “I love you, man. I’m still angry and we haven’t resolved this. But I’m committed to this project and friendship.”&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>At the end of this trip, Chris said “I’m still a Democrat” and Jordan said “I’m still a Republican.” So what changed for you two on this trip?</strong></h6>
<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> For both of us two things have changed. One is personal to ourselves and the other is our views of the country.</p>
<p>When we started out on this trip I was the optimist. I was sure that wherever we went we’d find signs that America was strong, healthy, and vibrant. That the American people were good. And that it would be evident everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Chris was more of a skeptic based on what he was hearing in the news and the data about various parts of American life. There would be signs of America coming apart and there would be signs of decay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the course of three road trips, it changed both our views. In the end, Chris saw a lot of what led to my optimism and it made him view the country differently and I also saw a lot of the structural problems that Chris was worried about and it tempered my optimism.</p>
<p>On an individual level, having these individual conversations and fights and figuring out how our friendship can navigate that made us deeper people. We developed more empathy for the other side. We found blind spots in our own views and politics. And though we didn’t switch parties or change our beliefs it made our beliefs more rigorous and gave us the ability to see the world through other people’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> I like to say that Jordan has made me a better liberal, and I think Jordan says the same about my impact on his conservatism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes we don’t muster all the right evidence or are not aware of our blind spots, and our friends who think the same way we do are incapable of pointing them out. [When you engage with someone who has different beliefs] you’re able to refresh your arguments, have these moments of crisis, and come back stronger. Sometimes that means moderation, sometimes it means we become more radical. But hopefully, we become better citizens as a result.</p>
<h6><strong>A lot of your book is about a very diverse and memorable set of people you met on the road. For both of you, who was the most impactful person you met?</strong></h6>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Someone who’s a friend of mine these days is Pete Mylen. He’s a trucker from Daytona Beach, Florida who’s been on the road for 40 years. When we met him he had a Make America Great Again shirt, but we quickly realized he’s far more complex than that shirt might indicate.</p>
<p>The first time we brought up politics Pete said, “You know, I support the president but I really wish he’d talk more about climate change.” This coming from a guy driving a diesel truck at 80 miles an hour!&nbsp;</p>
<p>He went from there to talk about his faith, his support for LGBTQ marriage — all these policy ideas and values that I wouldn’t have necessarily associated with someone who wore a MAGA shirt four out of the five days we were with him. He really taught us how hard it is to look at someone and say “I know who that person is.” If you don’t actually talk to them, if you don’t actually engage with them, you don’t get to know what they actually think because oftentimes it’s easy to ascribe values to someone without looking more deeply into them.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> For me, it was this man Gabriel, who was in <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/corrections/0,4551,7-119-68854_1381_1388-5339--,00.html" rel=" noopener">Parnall prison</a>. After our time with Pete, we did another road trip where we wanted to explore this idea of redemption. We believe that America is built on this idea of second chances, it’s a uniquely American value that pervades our ethos. And yet we had heard that the criminal justice system is a place where this might be out of sync with our ideal.</p>
<p>So in Detroit, we met this Shakespeare ensemble of 30 men from prison who were performing King Lear, and we were going to have a discussion on redemption afterward. And this one guy, Gabriel, is just throwing himself into the play, acting with all his energy. He’s interpreting everything with so much depth that Chris and I were in awe of his talent and his drive to better himself. Afterward, he talked about what it means to take personal responsibility and the a-ha moment that it takes to do something better with your life. He’s on my mind now because Parnall prison has been hit pretty hard by Covid and it’s a reminder that these men are in a really hard situation and are suffering. But I’m also thinking about the amount of talent and will Gabriel has, but knowing the barriers he’s going to face . . . really tugs at my heart.&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>My favorite line in the book is “we are at our worst when we speak for a flag or a group.” Can you expand on that?</strong></h6>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Union-Democrat-Republican-Search-Common/dp/0316423793" rel=" noopener"><img src="https://images.booksense.com/images/793/423/9780316423793.jpg" alt="9780316423793" width="258"></a>Chris:</strong> This was a phenomenon we found over and over again. When we argue on behalf of people we had never met or groups whose policies we don’t always agree with, like the Democratic or Republican party, or a media organization like <em>The Times</em>, we were at our worst. Because we felt we had to be these two-dimensional figures because we had to defend these groups that we didn’t know all that well. And you’re searching for the talking points and trying to win because it’s almost like you have this symbol or value that represents good and the other person represents bad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when we were able to get away from that, when we were able to speak as other identities, just Jordan and Chris, conversations were about getting to the bottom of things.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan: </strong>I think it’s very unproductive when we’re speaking on behalf of our parties and defending things that might not necessarily align fully with our own beliefs. I think there’s a counterpart to it which is another way of engaging is through loyalty tests — “do you agree with x?” And if I say no then all of a sudden I’m not on your side anymore. It’s all about figuring out which tribe are you part of. Chris and I found that whenever we engaged in a way that seemed to say “if you disagree with me then you’re in that box and that box has bad things associated with it,” it led to more defensive arguments because now a bad association is leveled on me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last few years I’ve had to face this question of “Do you support Donald Trump?” And the implication is that if you do then you’re a bad person. But it doesn’t get to the nuance that there are some things he does that I agree with, some things he does that I don’t agree with, and some things I probably hate. But putting it as a binary context puts me into a bind. So over time we moved away from thinking like that.</p>
<h6><strong>Do you think we talk about politics too much as a society?</strong></h6>
<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Yes, absolutely. Politics has become everything. As Chris and I found, outside the glare of the cameras and political rhetoric the people we met were good people. We were able to connect at this very human level. Politics is all about line drawing. If you’re on this side of the line, you’re on my team. If you’re on that side of the line, you’re my enemy. So the fact that politics has invaded every aspect of life today, it’s not healthy. It’s what drives our intense polarization. It’s making us angrier and testier and doesn’t allow for the cultivation of friendship, grace, love, compassion, empathy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

September 1, 2020 | https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2020/jsonptr.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2020/jsonptr.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      
      

      

<p><em>Summary: <code>jsonptr</code> is a new, sandboxed command-line tool that formats JSON and
speaks the JSON Pointer query syntax. Wuffs standard library’s JSON decoder can
run in O(1) memory, even with arbitrarily long input (containing arbitrarily
long strings) because it uses multiple tokens to represent each JSON string.
Processing the JSON Pointer query during (instead of after) parsing can
dramatically impact performance. <code>jsonptr</code> can be faster, use less memory and
be safer than alternatives such as <code>jq</code>, <code>serde_json</code> and <code>simdjson</code>.</em></p>

<h2 id="jsonptr"><code>jsonptr</code></h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/a325d7860f9c922b805d959a7f66c726adc92593/example/jsonptr/jsonptr.cc"><code>jsonptr</code></a> is
a command-line formatter for <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a>, a ubiquitous,
human-readable file format. It also implements the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6901.txt">JSON
Pointer</a> syntax for identifying a
sub-node of the JSON input. For example, Chromium’s Preferences files are
compact (minified, with no extra whitespace or line breaks) but <code>jsonptr</code> can
make them more readable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/google/wuffs.git
$ g++ -O3 -Wall wuffs/example/jsonptr/jsonptr.cc -o my-jsonptr
$ ./my-jsonptr -query=/browser/window_placement \
&gt; ~/.config/google-chrome/Profile\ 1/Preferences
{
    "bottom": 1200,
    "docked": false,
    "left": 0,
    "maximized": false,
    "right": 1920,
    "top": 0,
    "work_area_bottom": 1200,
    "work_area_left": 0,
    "work_area_right": 1920,
    "work_area_top": 0
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By itself, that’s not particularly novel. Many existing JSON processing tools
do this. Picking <code>jq</code> as a popular example, its syntax isn’t JSON Pointer
syntax, but <code>jq .browser.window_placement ~/.config/google-chrome/Profile\
1/Preferences</code> will print something similar, and <code>jq</code> comes with <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/">many more
useful features</a>.</p>

<p>Looking closer, there are several advantages to <code>jsonptr</code>. <strong>The first is
speed</strong>. Here are some numbers from throwing an <code>x86_64</code> Broadwell desktop CPU
at some JSON files from the
<a href="https://github.com/miloyip/nativejson-benchmark"><code>miloyip/nativejson-benchmark</code></a>
and <a href="https://github.com/zemirco/sf-city-lots-json"><code>zemirco/sf-city-lots-json</code></a>
repositories. The <code>time</code> output (and later, the <code>/usr/bin/time</code> output), a
median of three runs, has been edited for brevity and embellished with a N.NNx
ratio (N.NN greater than 1 means that <code>jsonptr</code> is better).</p>

real    0m0.863s   (1.00x by definition)

<p><strong>The third is safety</strong>. <code>jq</code> is written in C, a memory-unsafe language. The
<a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/a325d7860f9c922b805d959a7f66c726adc92593/example/jsonptr/jsonptr.cc"><code>jsonptr.cc</code></a>
file is written in C++, also memory-unsafe, but the core JSON decoder is
written in <a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs">Wuffs</a>, a
<a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/a325d7860f9c922b805d959a7f66c726adc92593/doc/note/memory-safety.md">memory-safe</a>
language designed for crafting

libraries.</p>

<h3 id="sandboxing">Sandboxing</h3>

<p>For additional defence in depth, on Linux, the second thing that <code>jsonptr</code>’s
<code>main</code> function does is to
<a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/a325d7860f9c922b805d959a7f66c726adc92593/example/jsonptr/jsonptr.cc#L1434">self-impose</a>
a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html"><code>SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT</code></a>
sandbox. The first thing that it does is to open (but not read) the file named
in the command line arguments, which the sandbox would otherwise prohibit.</p>

<p>A <code>SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT</code> sandbox effectively restricts the program to only read
from the input file, compute on its bytes and write to <code>stdout</code>. Even if</p>

<ol>
  <li>malicious input tickled</li>
  <li>a bug in Wuffs’ JSON library that combined with</li>
  <li>a bug in the Wuffs compiler’s proofs of safety</li>
</ol>

<p>decoding such input still couldn’t access the file system or the network, run
other programs, etc.</p>

<p>One implication of the <code>SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT</code> sandbox is that <strong>the program
cannot dynamically allocate memory</strong>, and indeed, Wuffs’ JSON library runs with
zero dynamic allocations. It never calls <code>malloc</code> or invokes <code>new</code>. That’s not
“zero dynamic allocations in the steady state”, that’s “zero dynamic
allocations, full stop”.</p>

<p>The program statically allocates <a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/a325d7860f9c922b805d959a7f66c726adc92593/example/jsonptr/jsonptr.cc#L438-L447">three 32 KiB
buffers</a>
for the JSON decoder to use, but <code>jsonptr</code> can still handle megabytes of input,
or even individual megabyte-long JSON strings. How it does this is discussed
further below, starting with the “Wuffs Buffers” section.</p>

<p>Being sandboxed means that it’s less worrisome to process untrusted files from
the network, even when downloading over HTTP (not HTTPS).</p>

                    "id": "976",
                    "firstname": "John",

                    "motivation": "\"for the development of lithium-ion batteries\"",
                    "share": "3"
                },
                {
                    "id": "977",

                    "share": "3"
                },
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For an additional party trick, <code>jsonptr</code> can print a depth-limited summary of
the JSON node tree.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ wget -q -O - http://api.nobelprize.org/v1/prize.json | \
&gt; ./my-jsonptr -query=/prizes/0 -max-output-depth=2
{
    "year": "2019",
    "category": "chemistry",
    "laureates": [
        "{…}",
        "{…}",
        "{…}"
    ]
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="trade-offs">Trade-Offs</h2>

<p>To be clear, <code>jq</code> (or any other software discussed below) isn’t bad software.
It’s great software, deserving its many happy users. There’s simply trade-offs
where <code>jsonptr</code> and <code>jq</code> make different but equally reasonable choices.</p>

<h3 id="sorting-keys">Sorting Keys</h3>

<p>Unlike <code>jsonptr</code>, <code>jq</code> is able to sort object keys.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ echo '{"three":3,"four":4}' | ./my-jsonptr
{
    "three": 3,
    "four": 4
}
$ echo '{"three":3,"four":4}' | jq .
{
  "three": 3,
  "four": 4
}
$ echo '{"three":3,"four":4}' | jq --sort-keys .
{
  "four": 4,
  "three": 3
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sorting keys is certainly a useful feature, and while the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8259.txt">JSON specification
(RFC 8259)</a> does not rule out duplicate
keys, many applications assume (often implicitly) that keys are unique, and
sorting keys helps efficiently detect duplicates.</p>

<p>However, if the top-level JSON value is an object (a dictionary of key-value
pairs) then a formatter cannot print anything other than the opening <code>{</code>
character until the entire value is parsed. <strong>This requires <code>O(N)</code> memory,
where <code>N</code> is the length of the input</strong>. In comparison, the <code>jsonptr</code> program
does not sort keys and requires only <code>O(1)</code> memory. Again, neither better or
worse per se, just making different trade-offs.</p>

<h3 id="parsing-numbers">Parsing Numbers</h3>

<p>Unlike <code>jsonptr</code>, <code>jq</code> will convert JSON numbers from strings (<code>"123"</code> being
one two three) to numbers (<code>123</code> being one hundred and twenty three), using
IEEE 754 <code>double</code> precision.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ echo 0.99999999999999999 | ./my-jsonptr
0.99999999999999999
$ echo 0.99999999999999999 | jq .
1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is certainly useful when comparing values to other numbers. <code>jq</code>’s query
language allows filters like <code>map(select(. &gt;= 2))</code>. It’s also more convenient,
for a programming API instead of a command-line tool, to work with JSON numbers
as a <code>double</code> instead of a <code>std::string</code>. Nonetheless, having the parser
(instead of the caller) always convert from <code>std::string</code> to <code>double</code> can be
surprisingly expensive. <strong>Optimizing <code>StringToDouble</code> (or its equivalent) can
dramatically <a href="https://github.com/google/double-conversion/issues/137">speed up a JSON
parser</a></strong>. For a
formatter, skipping a redundant <code>StringToDouble</code> and <code>DoubleToString</code> round
trip entirely means a faster program.</p>

<h2 id="rust">Rust</h2>

<p>Wuffs is most often compared with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. Both are
memory-safe (but not garbage collected) languages with C/C++ interoperability.</p>

<p>One difference is that Wuffs’ standard library is transpiled to C, not compiled
to object code, so that existing C/C++ projects can <strong>use Wuffs’ standard
library like any other third party C library</strong> (it’s just not hand-written C),
without needing to pull in another language toolchain. The “<code>git clone</code> and
then <code>g++</code>” instructions at the top of this article do not involve “install the
Wuffs compiler”.</p>

<p>Again, neither better or worse per se, just making different trade-offs.
There’s also the <a href="https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc"><code>mrustc</code></a>
alternative Rust compiler, a work-in-progress.</p>

<h3 id="jsonxf"><code>jsonxf</code></h3>

<p><code>jsonxf</code> is a JSON pretty-printer written in Rust (without any use of
<code>unsafe</code>). The <code>-m</code> flag minifies output.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cargo install jsonxf
$ time ~/.cargo/bin/jsonxf    &lt; citylots.json &gt; /dev/null
real    0m1.928s  (1.72x vs jsonptr)
$ time ~/.cargo/bin/jsonxf -m &lt; citylots.json &gt; /dev/null
real    0m1.871s  (2.17x vs jsonptr)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It does not validate JSON escape sequences. This is <a href="https://github.com/gamache/jsonxf/blob/cd2835dc33f6c03999baa4ae4a9ff1dbd860134e/src/jsonxf.rs#L12-L15">a deliberate design
decision</a>,
not a bug, but it is a point of difference from <code>jsonptr</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ echo -n '"Backslash-t (\t) is   valid JSON."' | ./my-jsonptr; echo $?
"Backslash-t (\t) is   valid JSON."
0
$ echo -n '"Backslash-a (\a) is invalid JSON."' | ./my-jsonptr; echo $?
"Backslash-a (
json: bad backslash-escape
1
$ echo -n '"No final double-quote'              | ./my-jsonptr; echo $?
"No final double-quote
json: bad input
1

$ echo -n '"Backslash-t (\t) is   valid JSON."' | ~/.cargo/bin/jsonxf; echo $?
"Backslash-t (\t) is   valid JSON."0
$ echo -n '"Backslash-a (\a) is invalid …</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<div>
<p id="c8d2" data-selectable-paragraph="">At&nbsp;<a href="https://upside.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upside</a>, we take pride in our deployment culture. We ship new versions of code multiple times per day through our various environments powered by AWS and Kubernetes. We run an infrastructure stack that leverages the powerful&nbsp;<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/microservices/what-are-microservices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">microservice architecture pattern</a>&nbsp;that sees our applications broken up into smaller segments that each do one thing, but do it very well. Thanks to our applications being loosely coupled, we feel safe deploying fast and deploying often due to blast radius being minimized.</p>
<p id="2da5" data-selectable-paragraph="">Half the battle of implementing true CI/CD is already won at Upside due to our awesome engineering management and teams being fully supportive of the culture. The other half of the battle is implementing it from a technical standpoint. A big portion of this effort involves weighing the pros and cons of the many tools out there in regards to your specific CI/CD needs. This is very important; just because there is a shiny new item out there, doesn’t necessarily mean that it is a one size fits all for everyone. To quote the late American psychologist Abraham Maslow, “If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail”.</p>

<p id="e50c" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let’s take a step back to fully flesh out what CI/CD means, because it can help us start to visualize the problem that we believe Spinnaker helps us to solve.</p>
<p id="9258" data-selectable-paragraph="">CI/CD stands for “Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment”:</p>
<h2 id="79eb" data-selectable-paragraph="">Continuous Integration</h2>
<p id="a26e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Continuous Integration deals with the culture of integrating code into a shared repository multiple times per day. Often times, automated tests are run on every merge, and artifact builds are kicked off. In our case at Upside, upon every merge to master, we run tests and then build and push a new Docker image that represents that version of the code.</p>
<h2 id="225b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Continuous Delivery/Deployment</h2>
<p id="4231" data-selectable-paragraph="">These are actually two different cultures and the difference between the two can really elevate a team’s ability to roll new services out. Continuous Delivery deals with automating the process of deploying artifacts into your environments. Typically this involves an automated deployment into dev, in which some sort of a manual judgement is needed to then deploy that artifact to later environments, and then finally ending in a deployment to production. Continuous Deployment takes this a step further and removes these manual judgements. This can be a heavy undertaking due to engineers having to write and rely on automated testing which will dictate if the code should be promoted to the next environment or not. Another roadblock to Continuous Deployment is finding the right tooling that balances out-of-the-box functionality but still leaving enough room for customization. At Upside, we are making the push to get to full Continuous Deployment, and Spinnaker is what is enabling us to get there.</p>

<p id="c0b7" data-selectable-paragraph="">Now that we can start to see what the true nature of Continuous Deployment looks like, let’s talk about the open-sourced tool developed by Netflix called Spinnaker that helps to enable it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="a137" data-selectable-paragraph="">Also, a disclaimer that this article is less of a “how to use Spinnaker”, and more of a high level “how we are leveraging Spinnaker at Upside”. If you are interested in how to get started, check out the Spinnaker docs on&nbsp;<a href="https://spinnaker.io/setup/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to install it</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://spinnaker.io/guides/user/get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create your first pipeline</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="bccd" data-selectable-paragraph="">Okay, I understand the problem — but what exactly is Spinnaker?</h2>
<p id="d0f6" data-selectable-paragraph="">In a nutshell, Spinnaker is an open-sourced and self-hosted platform that allows you to quickly build out deployment pipelines. It is also multi-cloud in that you can easily deploy with built in functions to AWS, Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes to name a few. For example, need a stage in your pipeline to deploy a Helm chart to a Kubernetes cluster? Easy, there’s a built in function for this. Oh, but it needs to be a Canary deployment and analysis? Done, Spinnaker comes with that built in functionality as well. At Upside, these built in functionalities are a big reason of what sold us on Spinnaker — could you imagine scripting these in Jenkins?</p>
<h2 id="5117" data-selectable-paragraph="">A few Spinnaker terms</h2>
<ul>
<li id="46a1" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Application</strong>&nbsp;— an application can have 0 to many&nbsp;<em>pipelines</em>. In our case, each one of our microservices is its own application in Spinnaker.</li>
<li id="0bd5" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Pipeline</strong>&nbsp;— a pipeline has 0 to many&nbsp;<em>stages</em>. At Upside, each of our Spinnaker applications has a pipeline that deploys to our dev environment, another that deploys to our staging environment, and finally one for our prod environment.</li>
<li id="69d2" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Stage</strong>&nbsp;— represents an action in a pipeline. For example, a stage to deploy a Helm chart, another stage to publish this deployment information to our centralized logging solution, and a stage that may require a manual approval to continue the pipeline, to name a few.</li>
<li id="4823" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Pipeline-template</strong>&nbsp;— this is a parameterized JSON file that represents a pipeline. This is where we can define a pipeline and its stages in code. The purpose of this is for reuse. For example, at Upside, we deploy most of our 200+ microservices in the same fashion, therefore we want a single source of truth when we define our pipelines. So when the time comes to add an application to Spinnaker, we just create its dev, stage, and prod pipelines and point each to its respective pipeline-template. Another benefit of this is if, for example, a new stage needs to be added to all of our applications’ dev pipelines, we just edit the dev pipeline-template, and the change propagates to all of our applications.</li>
</ul>

</div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph=""></figcaption></figure>
<p id="f252" data-selectable-paragraph="">Above is a somewhat simple deployment pipeline that we use here at Upside, but still nonetheless complex. I won’t get into the specifics of what each stage is doing, but the pipeline is triggered either manually in the Spinnaker UI, or triggered on a new image hitting a Docker registry. The pipeline then uses Helm to bundle our Kubernetes spec files into an artifact that can be used downstream by our Deploy stage.</p>
<p id="aa94" data-selectable-paragraph="">Then we have a manual approval stage that is dynamically enabled if our Run Tests stage sees something in our newly deployed resources that would need human intervention for. This manual approval has 3 options:</p>
<ol>
<li id="b9c9" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Stop</strong>&nbsp;— this stops the pipeline and the next environment’s pipeline will not execute.</li>
<li id="fed0" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Stop and Rollback&nbsp;</strong>— this option is selected via the dropdown in the image below and will stop the deployment from going to the next environment, as well as also rolling back the current environment’s deployment to the previous image version.</li>
<li id="d09e" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Continue</strong>&nbsp;— this continues the deployment to the next environment.</li>

<h2 id="0e20" data-selectable-paragraph="">Why this deployment flow is an improvement</h2>
<p id="36cc" data-selectable-paragraph="">Previously at Upside, we had continuous deployment to our Dev environment in that upon merge to master, Jenkins would use Helm to deploy to Dev. It was then up to the engineering teams to trigger this Jenkins job to promote that to our Staging environment, and then finally to Prod. Spinnaker helps improve upon this in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li id="93e7" data-selectable-paragraph="">More complexity and robustness in our pipelines flows. We began to hit a ceiling with Jenkins in that scripting any further complexity was going to become very tedious. Spinnaker enables us to quickly roll out more robust pipeline workflows.</li>
<li id="df3b" data-selectable-paragraph="">A single pane of glass. The Spinnaker UI allows diving into various bits of the infrastructure that each pipeline deploys such as pod logs, ReplicaSet information, the ability to scale up and down pods, etc. Also, engineers are able to make manual judgements to continue/stop/rollback within the Spinnaker UI.</li>
<li id="543b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Engineers dictate their own Continuous Deployment fate. At Upside, we allow our engineering teams the freedom to write their own tests that dictate whether or not to have full automation to Prod with no manual approvals needed (aka Continuous Deployment). If their self-defined tests pass, then the deployment will automatically continue to the next environment. Spinnaker helps to enable this due to the ease of dictating pipeline branching with conditionals.</li>
<li id="d8c2" data-selectable-paragraph="">Much more robust built in functionality for&nbsp;<a href="https://spinnaker.io/guides/user/kubernetes-v2/rollout-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deployment strategies</a>&nbsp;such as Dark, Red/Black, Highlander, and Canary. Again, for emphasis — could you imagine scripting all of this in Jenkins? For us, this is what sold us on Spinnaker.</li>
</ul>

    Tracking position of something is a topic that I like, cause it makes me
    feel like to be a human with a sixth sense. With this sense I know where an
    object is and how it moves, in spite of&nbsp; I can't see the object
    directly with my naked eyes. Then how do we get a sixth sense? Because as
    ordinary human we only have five senses.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    In my opinion, living in this digital age today, we already had a sixth
    sense which is called technology that implemented in an application. Related
    with our topic in this post about flight tracking, there are numerous flight
    tracking applications out there such as flightradar24, FlightAware,
    flightview and so on, which enabled us to monitor position of airplanes
    around the earth. This post won't discuss about those applications, moreover
    I will discuss how to make our own flight tracking application with
    python.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously I already posted two tutorials about flight tracking with python.
    The first one is about
    <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2018/11/create-simple-live-flight-tracking-python.html">creating a simple flight tracking application with python</a>
    and the another one is
    <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2019/01/realtime-flight-tracking-pandas-bokeh-python.html">creating a flight tracking application with pandas and bokeh</a>. What is the difference with this one? The main difference is data source.
    In those two previous posts, I used
    <a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ADS-B Exchange</a>
    and in this tutorial I'm using
    <a href="https://opensky-network.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Opensky Network</a>. Another difference is module version. In this tutorial I'm using the
    latest version python library in particular for plotting library. So there
    will be a slight change in the code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enough for introduction. Now let's move to our main topic how to build a
    flight tracking application with python using open air traffic data. This
    tutorial consists of several sub-topics, there are: Getting data, importing
    required libraries, loading basemap, plotting aircraft's position and make a
    "realtime" flight tracking application. We will discuss each part, and at
    the end of this tutorial we will get a flight tracking application which is
    running in a browser as shown in figure 1.

</div><h3>Getting Air Traffic Data

<ins data-ad-client="ca-pub-5632482621101280" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-slot="7655392618"></ins>
</h3>
<p>
  As I mentioned earlier, in this tutorial we are using open air traffic data
  from OpenSky Network. OpenSky Network is an non-profit consortium that
  provides open air traffic data to the public in particular for research and
  non-commercial purposes. The data can be accessed through REST API, Python API
  and Java API. In this tutorial we will use REST API to retrieve the live air
  traffic data.
</p>
<p>
  To retrieve the data using REST API can be done using request operation. There
  are two types of requests can be used. The first one is request for specific
  airplane based on time in UNIX timestamp or ICAO24 address. The second one we
  can get all airplane data within an area extent using WGS84 coordinates
  system. Moreover the access for the data can be done anonymously or registered
  user. For anonymously request, it has 10 seconds resolution and 5 seconds for
  registered user. <br>
</p>
<p>
  In this tutorial we will use the second one. We will define an area extent
  with minimum and maximum coordinates, and then send the query to get all
  airplane data within the area. For example we want to fetch the data over United States
  with minimum coordinate -125.974,30.038 and maximum coordinate -68.748,52.214. The query for both anonymously and registered user will be as follow.
</p>
<pre><span>#</span>Anonymously Request
https:<span>//</span>opensky<span>-</span>network.org<span>/</span>api<span>/</span>states<span>/</span><span>all</span><span>?</span>lamin<span>=30.038</span><span>&amp;</span>lomin<span>=-125.974</span><span>&amp;</span>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>lamax<span>=52.214</span><span>&amp;</span>lomax<span>=-68.748</span><span></span>

<span>#</span>Registered User Request
https:<span>//</span>username:password<span>@</span>opensky<span>-</span>network.org<span>/</span>api<span>/</span>states<span>/</span><span>all</span><span>?</span>lamin<span>=</span><span>30.038</span><span>&amp;</span>lomin<span>=-125.974</span><span>&amp;</span>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>lamax<span>=52.214</span><span>&amp;</span>lomax<span>=</span><span>-68.748</span><span></span></pre>
<p>
  Before continuing reading and to make sure the query is right, let's try it.
  Copy the anonymously query and paste into a browser. If you get a response
  like figure 2 below, then it works.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

        Figure 2. Air traffic data response<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  The return response as shown in figure 2 is in JSON structure with two keys.
  The first one is <i>time </i>and the second one is <i>States</i> that contains
  data for each airplane in a list array. The list array stores many data such
  as: ICAO24 address, airplane call sign, origin country, time position, last
  contact, longitude, latitude, barometer altitude and so on. For complete
  explanation about the data response and also further information about OpenSky
  Network API please refer to
  <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2020/08/OpenSky%20Network%20API" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OpenSky Network API Documentation</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<h3>Getting Air Traffic Data in Python</h3>

<p>
  We already retrieved the traffic data using REST API in a browser. Now let's
  do it in Python and process the response for the next purpose. For this
  tutorial I'm using Jupyter notebook with Python 3.8.2 and some libraries such
  as Bokeh 2.1.1, Pandas 0.25.3, requests, json and numpy. <br>
</p>
<p>
  Below is the code to make a request and do a little processing on the
  data. At the beginning, we import the required libraries such as requests,
  json and Pandas. Then define the extent coordinate in WGS84 with respective
  variable <i>lon_min,lat_min, lon_max and lat_max</i>.&nbsp; Based on the
  extent coordinate, make the request query. If you are a registered user, give
  the user name and password in <i>user_name</i> and <i>password</i> variable at
  line 11-12. Based on given extent coordinate and user data, we create a
  request query in <i>url_data</i> variable as in line 13 and get the response
  in json format. The remain of the code is used to dump the response data into
  Pandas data frame and replace the blank/empty data with 'NaN' value with 'No
  Data'. The last line which is data frame's <i>head</i> method is used to view
  the first 5 top row of the data as shown in figure 3. &nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p>Make sure after executing the code, you have a result as in figure 3. If you
  get it, it means everything is fine, and we have the data that will be used
  for the next step.</p><h3>Plotting Airplane on the Map</h3>
<p>
  After getting the data, now let's plot the location of all airplanes on a
  map.&nbsp; For plotting purpose, we are using Bokeh library. Therefore we need
  to import the library first. Additionally we also need to import NumPy library
  that will be used in coordinate conversion.
</p>
<p>
  The conversion of coordinate system is implemented in a function which is
  called <i>wgs84_web_mercator</i>_. As it's name this function will be used to
  transform WGS84 coordinate into web Mercator coordinate system. This
  transformation is required because we are using a
  <i>STAMEN_TERRAIN</i> basemap in a web browser that has web Mercator
  projection (EPSG: 3857).
</p>
<p>
  After creating coordinate conversion function and perform the transformation
  for data frame and extent coordinates. Next we set up plotting figure settings
  by specifying plotting area extent based on the range of x and y coordinates.
  The aircraft will be plotted on the basemap based on x and y coordinates with
  Points and also with airplane icon image. Why both point and image are used to plot
  the aircraft? Image will give a better visualization by using an airplane
  image and it can be rotated with the respective track angle. But unfortunately it
  can't&nbsp; high light a selected object and display more information with
  hover tool. To overcome this issue we use both image and point in circle
  object to get nice a visualization and enable selection and hovering tool.
  &nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>
  The following is the code until this step. If it is
  executed we will get a result as in figure 4.&nbsp; <br>

White Langshans were admitted to the quality ten years later in 1893. There are three sorts of Langshans that are accepted to the US standard – Black, White, and Blue. The latter wasn’t accepted to the quality until 1987.</p><p>In 1879 the breed was delivered to Germany. The German Langshans were derived from these and shortly replaced them. After the Second war Croad Langshans were reintroduced to Germany from the USA.</p><h3>Overall impression ;</h3><p>The original Croad Langshans were black with an excellent green sheen which remains the most colour kept today.</p><p>Croad Langshans are tall birds, known for the U-shape created between their heads and tall tails.</p><ul><li>males 4.5 kg;</li><li>hens 3-3.5 kg.</li></ul><p>The hens lay 140-150 eggs a year and are good winter layers; the eggs are dark brown</p><p>Brown shelled eggs were a rarity in England until the Croad Langshan was introduced, because it was the primary Asiatic breed during this country to supply them. there’s a <a href="https://funpoultry.com/chicken-breed/bantams/croad-langshan-bantam/"><strong>bantam version</strong></a>.</p><h3>Similar breeds;</h3><ul><li><a href="https://funpoultry.com/chicken-breed/large-fowl/australian-langshan/"><strong>Australian langshan</strong></a></li><li>Modern Langshan</li><li><a href="https://funpoultry.com/chicken-breed/large-fowl/german-langschan/"><strong>German Langshan</strong></a></li></ul><h3>Colour Varieties langshans ;</h3><ul><li>The original version has black feathers with green beetling</li><li>White Langshan</li><li>Blue Langshans</li></ul><p>Many other breeds were created using Langshan blood within the foundation matings.

<p>Water flows downhill. We all know this, and we all (implicitly) understand the idea. Water is flexible and subject to the forces of gravity. Terrain has high points and low points. Water follows the path of least resistance to reach its destination.</p>



<p>Water isn’t the only thing that behaves in this way. I think people behave in an identical fashion. Once the <a href="https://garybasin.com/no-motivation-without-vision/">destination</a> is determined and “terrain” is clearly visible, the path of least resistance becomes obvious. Unlike water, though, humans have to define the final resting point as precisely as possible. <strong>If you don’t define <em>it</em>, it may define <em>you</em></strong>: you will find yourself moving towards a destination you didn’t expect, and may not want.</p>



<p>You <em>will</em> flow along a path of least resistance. The key question is where do you want to end up? <a href="https://twitter.com/garybasin/status/1300428590530600963">If multiple paths seem equally appealing</a>, you may have not defined the destination with enough clarity.</p>

          <p><h2><span>Overall Thoughts</span></h2></p> <p><span>48 Laws of Power is a collection of tactics for attaining power in various domains in life. It may come off as amoral, and some of the tricks outlined in the book are shady to say the least. It is a tough pill to swallow. But it is an informative and engaging book, if you read it without value judgement. Less of a wholesome guide on how to live life, more of a disappassionate analysis of ways to obtain power. And here's the way the author Robert Greene himself puts it: "I'm not evil. I'm a realist."</span></p>  <p><h2><span>Summary</span></h2></p> <p><span>Below is the the list of the 48 laws detailed in the book, along with any important notes.</span></p> <p><h3><span>Law 1: Never outshine the master</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are</strong> <span> and you will attain the heights of power.</span></p> <p><span>As you try to impress your masters, do not go too far in displaying your talents. Otherwise, you will inspire fear and insecurity.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 2: Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies</span></h3></p> <p><span>Be wary of friends. </span> <strong>You have more to fear from friends than from enemies</strong> <span>. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them.</span></p> <p><span>Friends will betray you more quickly, as envy makes things tricky. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 3: Conceal your intentions</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Keep people off-balance and in the dark.</strong> <span> Never reveal the purpose behind your actions. </span></p> <p><span>Hide your intentions not by closing up but&nbsp;</span> <strong>by talking endlessly about your desires and goals (just not your real ones)</strong> <span>. These are smoke screens that can disguise your actions.</span></p> <p><span>If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 4: Always say less than necessary</span></h3></p> <p><strong>The more you say, the more common you appear</strong> <span>, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike.</span></p> <p><span>You can't take back words once they are out. Keep them under control. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 5: So much depends on reputation. Guard it with your life</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Through reputation alone you can intimidate and win</strong> <span>. It is the foundation of power.</span></p> <p><span>Always be alert to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, </span> <strong>learn to destroy your enemies by opening holes in their own reputations</strong> <span>. Then stand aside and let public opinion hang them. Doubt is a powerful weapon.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 6: Court attention at all cost</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Stand out. Be conspicuous, at all cost</strong> <span>. It is better to be attacked than be ignored, for what is unseen counts for nothing. Never let yourself get lost in the crowd or buried in oblivion. Attach your name and reputation to an image larger, more colorful, and mysterious than other people.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 7: Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Use other people to further your own cause</strong> <span>. It saves you valuable time and resources. Never do yourself what others can do for you. Your helpers wil lbe forgotten, and you will be remembered. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 8: Make other people come to you. Use bait if necessary</span></h3></p> <p><span>It is always wise to </span> <strong>make your opponent come to you</strong> <span>, and have them abandon their own plans in the process. Fight the battle on your turf. When you force the other person to act, you are the one in control. Lure them into your territory with a potential victory, then attack. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 9: Win through your actions, never through an argument</span></h3></p> <p><span>Any short-lived victory you think you gain through argument is an illusion, as resentment builds up. It is more powerful to get other people to agree with you through your actions, instead of your words. </span></p> <p><span>Show, don't tell. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 10: Infection: Avoid the unhappy and unlucky</span></h3></p> <p><strong>The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on themselves.</strong> <span> They will also draw it on you. Don't try to help an infector, or you will pay the price. Helping the drowning man only sets you up for a disaster. You can die from someone else’s misery.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 11: Learn to keep people dependent on you</span></h3></p> <p><span>Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity. Teach a man how to&nbsp;fish&nbsp;and you feed him for his life time. Don't. To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 12: Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim</span></h3></p> <p><strong>One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones</strong> <span>. Even the most suspicious people can be disarmed with gestures of generosity and honesty. Once they let their guard down, you can manipulate them at will.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 13: When asking for help, appeal to people’s self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 14: Pose as a friend, work as a spy</span></h3></p> <p><span>Know your enemies. Learn to probe for other people's weaknesses and intentions. Every occasion is an opoprtunity to spy. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 15: Crush your enemy totally</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 16: Use absence to increase respect and honor</span></h3></p> <p><strong>The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear</strong> <span>. You must learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 17: Keep others in suspended terror: Cultivate an air of unpredictability</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Be deliberately unpredictable</strong> <span>. Patterns are powerful, and you can keep others off-balance by disrupting the predictability. They will wear themselves out trying to explain your moves. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 18: Do not build fortresses to protect yourself. Isolation is dangerous</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 19: Know who you’re dealing with. Do not offend the wrong person</span></h3></p> <p><span>Not everyone will react to your actions the same way. There are so many different kinds of people after all. Pick your battles, choose your rivals carefully.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 20: Do not commit to anyone</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 21: Play a sucker to catch a sucker. Seem dumber than your mark</span></h3></p> <p><span>Make your victims feel smart. Make them feel smarter than you are. Once they believe this is true, they will not be able to detect your ulterior motives.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 22: Use the surrender tactic: transform weakness into power</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Surrender first</strong> <span>. Turn the other cheek.  Resist the temptation to fight back for honor's sake. That will throw off the aggressor.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 23: Concentrate your forces</span></h3></p> <p><span>Focus. Intensity is the name of the game. Don't spread your energy too thin.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 24: Play the perfect courtier
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Practice flattery and nonchalance. Yield to those who are more powerful. Assert power over others in the most graceful manner. Master your emotions. Never be the bearer of bad news.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 25: Recreate yourself
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Take control over your own image, or others will. Forge a new identity that commands attention. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 26: Keep your hands clean
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Hide your mistakes, or use a scapegoat to conceal your involvement. You must maintain a flawless appearance.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 27: Play on people’s need to believe to create a cultlike following
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Keep it vague, but full of promise. Promote passion over rationality. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 28: Enter action with boldness
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Timidity is dangerous</strong> <span>. People admire the bold.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 29: Plan all the way to the end
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 30: Make your accomplishments seem effortless
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Act effortlessly, as if you could do much more</strong> <span>. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 31: Control the options. Get others to play with the cards you deal
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Rig the game. Change the playing field in your favour. Your opponents will get a false sense of control, but you will come out on top regardless of which option they choose.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 32: Play to people’s fantasies
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Life is tough. People want to believe there is something or someone to blame. Give them what they want.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 33: Discover each man’s thumbscrew
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall</strong> <span>. Once you find it, you can turn it to your advantage. What other people can't control, you control for them.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 34: Be royal in your own fashion: Act like a king to be treated like one
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 35: Master the art of timing
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Always appear patient and in control. You never want to be seen to be in a hurry. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 36: Disdain things you cannot have: Ignoring them is the best revenge
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 37: Create compelling spectacles
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Create spectacles for the people around you. This creates the aura of power around you.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 38: Think as you like but behave like others
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 39: Stir up waters to catch fish
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Never be angry or emotionally stirred, for they are counter-productive. However, if you can make your rivals angry while remaining calm yourself, it is a huge advantage. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 40: Despise the free lunch
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Pay the full price, as there is no cutting corners with excellence.</strong></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 41: Avoid stepping into a great man’s shoes
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Getting lost in a great man's shadow is a dangerous trap. Build a name for yourself, on your terms. Tread your own path.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 42: Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Trouble can usually be traced to a single source. If you let them be, they will infect the group with their ill will. Get rid of them before giving them the chance to do so.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 43: Work on the hearts and minds of others
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Play on what people fear, and dropping their guards by playing on what they hold dear. Don't coerce. Go along with what others' emotions.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 44: Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect
</span></h3></p> <p><span>The mirror effect: </span> <strong>By holding up a mirror to their psyches, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their values</strong> <span>. This is powerful, and few can resist it.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 45: Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 46: Never appear too perfect
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Envy is dangerous. One way to to eliminate envy is to </span> <strong>appear human and relatable</strong> <span>. It is wise to appear vulnerable and admit to defects occasionally.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 47: Do not go past the mark you aimed for. In victory, learn when to stop
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Leave on a high note. Don't let hubris blind you and trap you into pushing past what you had aimed for. When you reach a goal, stop. "Stop gain" is just as important as "stop loss".</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 48: Assume formlessness
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>By taking a shape, you open yourself to attack</strong> <span>. Instead, remain adaptable, remain on your toes. Accept that change is the only constant. Be like water. </span></p>

<div>
<p>Imagine a natural road spontaneously forms between point A and point B, and that as a consequence of this road, individuals suddenly wake up to the importance of point B, and of traveling there. Companies had first ignored point B altogether, but because the overwhelming majority of individuals now travel this road, these companies must now begin meeting individuals where they are: at point B. If they donâ€™t, they will perish.</p>

<p>But then comes along a wonderful invention: a road between point A and point B, but built on Conveyer Belt technology by the iCompany. Anyone traveling on the iRoad will arrive to B in 1/10th the time of the natural road. At first, the toll for individuals is far too pricey, so they disregard the iRoad; individuals are ok with the time cost of taking the natural road. But as time passes, more and more people begin taking the iRoad due to its undeniable benefits. Time turned out to be just one factor. Journeyers on the iRoad experience benefits like reduced health risk, less wear and tear, and an all around more comfortable experience. At some point, <em>not</em> taking the iRoad becomes of great consequence to individuals. Taking the natural road becomes no longer an option.</p>

<p>The benevolent iCompany has done a great service for humankind building this road that has completely changed the way people get to point B. And because the iCompany knows that other companies would love to travel this road just the same to cater to all its journey-goers, it charges them a hefty toll for access. It says, â€œanything you sell to people on this road, we will take a meaningful percent of, in perpetuity, forever and ever.â€�</p>

<p>Sellers on the iRoad grimace once at the terms of the deal, but sign nonetheless, knowing that not being able to sell to journeyers on the iRoad means their business will cease to exist. They can go and sell to riders of the natural road, but it isnâ€™t enough to guarantee a meaningful existence.</p>

<p>Over the days, months, and years, sellers go through a whirlwind of survival challenges all to put on a smile of a face to its customers on the iRoad, whom they can only meet through frosted glass. Throughout all the changes, mutations, and evolutions, one thing remains beautifully constant: the iRoad commission. It is the axiom of existence on the iRoad.</p>

<p>Merchants on the iRoad have for years felt the commission too high, and an impediment to their survival. But what can they do? Fight the iRoad, and risk being barred. Avoid the iRoad altogether, and immediately perish. Build your own iRoad, and fail.</p>

<p>Building an iRoad is of course no easy feat. In fact, only two companies in the history of the world have succeeded in doing so. The other such road, the gRoad, exists parallel to the iRoad, and funnily enough, charges the exact same toll. </p>

<p>Itâ€™s almost as if these two roads have a <em>monopoly</em> over access to passengers traveling to point B. We can say this because:</p>

<ul>
<li>Individuals can ignore point B at their own peril</li>
<li>Companies can ignore point B at their own peril</li>
<li>The only way to get to point B is via one of two roads</li>
<li>Building your own road is historically impossible and impractical</li>
<li>Both roads charge the same commission and are unwilling to negotiate</li>
<li>This commission is often seen as egregiously excessive</li>
</ul>

<p>In non-monopolistic cases, there would be many, many more roads to point B. And because individuals can choose which roads to travel, these roads compete to a point where commissions and tolls are reduced to their lowest natural level.</p>

<p>In cases of monopolies, there is no competition. And thus no real reason to lower prices, especially for a good as important as access to point B.</p>

<p>There are two common arguments one sees over this epic battle:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Textbook Libertarian: <em>"If youâ€™re not happy with the fee donâ€™t use the road."</em> As mentioned, one cannot simply ignore this road. This response is equivalent to <em>"Donâ€™t exist"</em>, but I think things that exist want to stay in existence. So this is ultimately too nihilistic a response.</li>
<li>The Textbook Retailer: "<em>All roads charge tolls."</em> Sure, almost all roads will levy a toll. The difference is that traveling most roads is optional. Point B however is special. Very, very special. So special that if you ignore it you will perish. And there are only two roads you can travel to get to point B. These two roads appear to act in unison to maintain what sellers deem unreasonably high tolls.</li>
</ol>

<p>Itâ€™s extremely important to understand what differentiates this case from any other case where you can successfully apply The Textbook Libertarian and The Textbook Retailer:</p>

<p><em>Monopoly.</em></p>

<p>The constricting of competition.</p>

<p>The complete suffocation of choice.</p>

W</span><span>e investigate this question across hundreds of transit projects from around the world. We have created a database that spans more than 50 countries and totals more than 11,000 km of urban rail built since the late 1990s. We will also examine this question in greater detail by carrying out six in-depth case studies that take a closer look at unique considerations and variables that aren’t easily quantified, like project management, governance, and site conditions.</span></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to figure out how to deliver more high-capacity transit projects for a fraction of the cost in countries like the United States. Additionally, we hope that our site will be a useful resource for elected officials, planners, researchers, journalists, advocates, and others interested in contextualizing transit-infrastructure costs and fighting for better projects.</p>

September 1, 2020 | https://www.paepper.com/blog/posts/javascript-bitwise-operations/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.paepper.com/blog/posts/javascript-bitwise-operations/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h2 id="a-note-on-bit-wise-operations">A note on bit-wise operations</h2>
<p>Today I read some JavaScript source code and stumbled on a line like
<code>var delta = ~~time;</code>
and I was unsure what that purpose of using <code>~~</code> was.</p>
<p>So I started to research and digging a bit deeper.
It turns out that the binary not operator (<code>~</code>) when applied twice on a floating number (e.g. <code>4.12</code>) returns an integer (<code>~~4.12 = 4</code>).</p>
<p>Why not simply use <code>Math.floor(4.12)</code>?
It turns out that the bit-wise not operator applied twice is quite a bit faster than using the <code>Math.floor</code> method (see <a href="http://rocha.la/JavaScript-bitwise-operators-in-practice">Link</a>).</p>
<p>Let’s wind back a little bit and dig deeper into the workings here, because I’m sure you might be confused by how this works and what this actually does.</p>
<h3 id="the--operator">The ~ Operator</h3>
<p>First of all, the binary not operator (<code>~</code>) basically switches all 1s to 0s and vice versa.
Thus, if you have a binary representation of <code>0111011001</code> and apply <code>~</code> to it, it will be <code>1000100110</code>.</p>
<p>I got a bit more interested in the exact workings, because it turned out, that <code>~4 = -5</code> and <code>~6 = -7</code>, so a positive number becomes its negative number minus one.
Why is this and why does it make sense?</p>
<p>Let’s start with a binary representation of 5:
<code>0101</code></p>
<p><code>~5 = 1010</code></p>
<p>So in this case, <code>1010</code> is supposed to be a representation of <code>-6</code>?</p>
<p>Let’s think about this. So we have 4 bits in the case above, i.e. 4 positions of 0s or 1s.
$2^4$ possibilities to encode with 4 bits, which is 16 different encodings (<code>0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, ..., 1111</code>).</p>
<h3 id="number-representation-in-bits">Number representation in bits</h3>
<p>When we want to represent positive and negative numbers using these 4 bits, we have to split these by 2, so we have 8 possibilities for positive numbers and 8 possibilities for negative numbers.
But we also have the 0, so we either need to have one less positive or negative number (usually one less positive).</p>
<p>Alright, let’s build our construct and take the first 8 possibilities for 0 (<code>0000</code>) and the positive numbers 1 (<code>0001</code>) through 7 (<code>0111</code>).</p>
<p>Now the question is how to represent the negative ones.</p>
<h4 id="option-1-negative-flag">Option 1: Negative Flag</h4>
<p>One “natural” option would be to just use the highest bit to switch between positive and negative numbers like a flag.
Thus, <code>1001 -&gt; -1</code>, <code>1010 -&gt; -2</code> and so forth.
But then, what is <code>1000</code>? Is it another representation of 0? And is <code>1000 == 0000</code> ??? Seems ugly, right?</p>
<p>Another problem here is the mathematical operations. Let’s add some numbers in this representation, say add 1 and -1:</p>
<p><code>0001 + 1001 = 1010</code></p>
<p><code>-1 + 1 = -2</code> ? Not so great, right?
Thus, in this represenation we would have to differentiate between positive and negative numbers when doing mathematical operations. Bummer.</p>
<h4 id="option-2-twos-complement">Option 2: Two’s Complement</h4>
<p>Typically, in modern architectures what is thus used is called <strong>two’s complement</strong>.</p>
<p>It is the natural evolution to have most mathematical operations in a consistent style.</p>
<p>How? Well, just like using the bits so far, we simply have the highest bit represent a negative value like this:</p>
<p>Let <code>$b_3, b_2, b_1, b_0$</code> be our bit values, then our number simply is:</p>
<p>$num_{10} = -1 * b_3 * 2^3 + b_2 * 2^2 + b_1 * 2^1 + b_0 * 2^0$</p>
<p>leading to</p>
<p><code>$1001 = -1 * 2^3 + 2^0 = -8 + 1 = -7$</code></p>
<p>Let’s add this:</p>
<p><code>0001 + 1001 = 1010</code></p>
<p><code>$1010 = -1 * 2^3 + 2^1$ = -8 + 2 = -6.</code></p>
<p>So <code>1 + (-7) = -6</code> Hooray!</p>
<p>One side effect of the two’s complement representation is that <code>x * -1 = ~x + 1</code> which is <code>~x = -x - 1</code>
or in binary:</p>
<p><code>0001 * -1 = ~0001 + 0001 = 1110 + 0001 = 1111 =</code></p>
<p><code>$-1 * 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0$ = -8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = -1</code></p>
<h3 id="intermediate-summary">Intermediate summary</h3>
<p>Phew, that was quite a bit of work, but so far you learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computers represent integer numbers in the two’s complement representation to have a single value for 0 and convenient ways to perform mathematical operations without having special rules for negative numbers.</li>
<li>The ~ operator on an integer number converts the number from a positive one to a negative one which is one lower than the initial number (<code>~5 = -6</code>).</li>
<li>When you want to get the negative number of a positive one you can thus use ~ and add one (<code>-5 = ~5 + 1</code>)</li>
<li>Using <code>~~</code> on a float cuts off the floating part and returns the integer (<code>~~-3.42 = -3</code>, <code>~~5.23 = 5</code>) and can be faster than Math.floor()</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-about-">What about ~~?</h3>
<p>About that last part - what is the representation of a float and how does that <code>~~</code> part work.
In fact, it was hard to get much information on this, but it turns out that the way this works is that the bitwise operators convert the float to an int before doing the bitwise flip, thus <code>~~5.23 = ~~5 = ~-6 = 5</code>.</p>
<p>More exactly: numbers in JavaScript are stored as 64 bits floating point numbers, but the bitwise operations are performed on 32 bits signed integers, so a conversion occurs before and after the bitwise operation.</p>
<p>The performance part thus seems more related to the overhead the function call is providing.</p>
<p>Be aware though, that for negative numbers <code>~~-3.42 = -3 != Math.floor(-3.42) = -4</code></p>
<p>So, when handling positive numbers, you can use <code>~~</code> instead of <code>Math.floor</code> to gain some performance.</p>
<p>The same holds in PHP: <code>~~</code> is faster than <code>floor()</code> by a matter of about <strong>200%</strong>. However, <code>~~</code> is as fast as is a cast to int: <code>(int)</code></p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Today, we learned that:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>~</code> is the bitwise not operator which flips all 0s to 1s and vice versa.</li>
<li>Signed numbers are represented with the two’s complement which yields <code>~5 = -6</code></li>
<li><code>~~</code> is a performance trick to truncate a floating point number to an integer.</li>
<li><code>~~</code> is like <code>Math.floor()</code> for positive numbers, but not for negative ones as <code>~~-5.93 = -5</code> while <code>Math.floor(-5.93) = -6</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bonus-all-bitwise-operators-in-javascript">BONUS: All bitwise operators in JavaScript</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>x &lt;&lt; y</code>: Returns x with the bits shifted to the left by y places (new bits on the right-hand-side are zeros). This is the same as multiplying x by <code>Math.pow(2, y)</code>.</li>
<li><code>x &gt;&gt; y</code>: Returns x with the bits shifted to the right by y places. This is the same as dividing x by <code>Math.pow(2, y)</code>.</li>
<li><code>x &amp; y</code>: Does a “bitwise and”. Each bit of the output is 1 if the corresponding bit of x AND of y is 1, otherwise it’s 0.</li>
<li><code>x | y</code>: Does a “bitwise or”. Each bit of the output is 0 if the corresponding bit of x AND of y is 0, otherwise it’s 1.</li>
<li><code>~ x</code>: Returns the complement of x - the number you get by switching each 1 for a 0 and each 0 for a 1. This is the same as -x - 1 as explained above.</li>
<li><code>x ^ y</code>: Does a “bitwise exclusive or”. Each bit of the output is the same as the corresponding bit in x if that bit is 0 in y, and it’s the complement of the bit in x if that bit is 1 in y.</li>
</ul>

              <p>Maintainable and readable test code is crucial to establish a good test coverage which in turn enables implementing new features and performing refactorings without the fear of breaking something. This post contains many best practices that I collected over the years of writing unit tests and integration tests in Java. It involves modern technologies like JUnit5, AssertJ, Testcontainers, and Kotlin. Some recommendations might be obvious to you, but some might conflict with what you’ve read in books about software development and testing.</p>

              </p>
              

              
              

<ul>
<li><strong>Write small and specific tests</strong> by heavily using helper functions, parameterized tests, AssertJ’s powerful assertions, not overusing variables, asserting only what’s relevant and avoiding one test for all corner cases.</li>
<li><strong>Write self-contained tests</strong> by revealing all relevant parameters, insert data right in the test and prefer composition over inheritance.</li>
<li><strong>Write dumb tests</strong> by avoiding the reuse of production code and focusing on comparing output values with hard-coded values.</li>
<li><strong>KISS &gt; DRY</strong></li>
<li><strong>Test close to production</strong> by focusing on testing a complete vertical slide and avoiding in-memory databases.</li>
<li>JUnit5 and AssertJ are a very good choice.</li>
<li>Invest in a testable implementation by avoiding static access, using constructor injection, using <code>Clocks</code> and separating business logic from asynchronous execution.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="given-when-then">Given, When, Then</h2>
<p>A test should contain three blocks which are separated by one empty line. Each block of code should be as short as possible. Use subfunctions to shorten these blocks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Given (Input): Test preparation like creating data or configure mocks</li>
<li>When (Action): Call the method or action that you like to test</li>
<li>Then (Output): Execute assertions to verify the correct output or behavior of the action.</li>

<li>Use helper functions for creating data (objects) (<code>createProductWithCategory()</code>) and complex assertions. Only pass those parameters to the helper functions that are relevant for your tests. Use reasonable defaults for the other values. In Kotlin, this is easy by using default arguments. In Java, you have to use method chaining and overloading to simulate default arguments.</li>
<li>varargs can make your test code even more concise (<code>ìnsertIntoDatabase()</code>).</li>
<li>Helper functions can also be used to create simple values more easily. This is even nicer in Kotlin where you can use extension functions for this.</li>

The design is not as long as an Airbus A350, but it has the same wing span. This allows the Flying-V to use the present infrastructure at airports, such as gates and runways. The Flying-V carries about the same number of passengers -&nbsp; 314 in the standard configuration – and the same amount of cargo, 160 m<sup>3</sup>. Project leader at TU Delft, Dr. Roelof Vos: “The Flying-V is smaller than the A350 and has less inflow surface area compared to the available amount of volume. The result is less resistance. That means the Flying-V needs less fuel for the same distance.”</p></div><div id="c463506"><div data-namespace-typo3-fluid="true">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h6><b>You might have recently heard that</b><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ebay-port-scans-visitors-computers-for-remote-access-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <b>eBay is performing port scanning</b></a><b>, while online shoppers are visiting their website. At first glance, it will probably sound a bit strange, as port scanning is an internal network action. As such, it is designed to detect services and should not be related to the regular user browsing experience.</b></h6>
<h6><b>eBay is not alone. According to</b><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/list-of-well-known-web-sites-that-port-scan-their-visitors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <b>Bleeping Computer</b></a><b> a high number of well-established websites are conducting port-scanning. These include top websites like TD Bank, Lloyds Bank, Walmart, Target, Halifax and lots more.&nbsp;</b></h6>
<p>From a technological point of view, the issue of port-scanning has raised an interesting question: how does an external website have access and the ability to conduct internal network scanning and what are their limitations.</p>
<p>This article will shed more light about port-scanning activities. We will explain the technical aspects of it from a website perspective and then we will explore different ways of using it.</p>

<h3><b></b><b>Port Scanning: Technical background&nbsp;</b></h3>
<h6><b>Client &amp; Server</b></h6>
<p><span>When you, as an end-user, are browsing a website, you load the HTML content from the web server which provides most of the</span></p>
<p><span>data you request. While visiting eBay, for example, you get products, pictures, your cart and endless inventory of data about goods. The same loaded HTML also includes a high number of JavaScript codes, that are actually running on your own browser. This is commonly referred to as client-side code.</span></p>
<h6><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Client-Server-300x140.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="312" srcset="https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Client-Server-300x140.jpg 300w, https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Client-Server-768x360.jpg 768w, https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Client-Server.jpg 867w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px"></h6>
<h6><b>The Client-Side Code</b></h6>
<p><i><span>Gartner’s “</span></i><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3986880" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span>Market Guide for Online Fraud Detection</span></i></a><i><span>” indicates that&nbsp; “Contemporary websites have become completely reliant on JavaScript to fulfill their functions”, ranging from collecting usage metrics to serving up ads. According to the guide, many of these JavaScript snippets are provided by third parties.</span></i></p>
<p><span>JavaScript codes can do anything, as if they are the original website code, from user engagement to advanced analytics. For example, in order to improve the user experience, the JavaScript code can load banners, suggesting that you buy a product that is currently on sale. It can also enable customer support and engagement tools, like live chats. This is the code that enables us, as users, to engage and get feedback from a website that actually reacts to our actions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Javascript has the ability to do almost anything today. This is even more true since the introduction of HTML5, that enables the creation of web based applications that can both behave and feel like native mobile apps.You can use JS to open the camera or access the microphone, you can read what your visitors are typing or, you check if they have opened Bluetooth. Practically, everything and yes, you can also use it for port scanning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, let’s talk about web-sockets.</span></p>
<h6><b>What are WebSockets?</b></h6>
<p><i><span>According to Wikipedia: “WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.”</span></i></p>
<p><span>Put simply, we are all familiar with the fact that website’s communication is done through HTTP requests. These are asynchronous requests, meaning that when you are visiting a webpage, the user’s browser is sending an HTTP request to the server, including additional headers, that add some user data and some request guidelines. In response, the server returns an HTTP response with the webpage’s content.</span></p>
<p><span>As it is an asynchronous request, there is no active channel between the user and server. If it wants to share extra details, like updating a user’s actions, or just requesting additional content, the client will be required to send a new request, with all the header data again, over and over. In many cases this creates an inefficient method of communication, increases the traffic load and affects the user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For that reason, Web-sockets were introduced, presenting the ability to run a regular TCP request from your own browser. The concept is similar to TCP: a server opens a port, listening to the incoming traffic and in this case, the client, our browser, can create a socket between the client and the server. The socket always requires the external server IP and a listening port. <em>To know more about TCP and sockets visit this recommended<a href="http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/tcpip-ports-sockets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> article</a> explaining it on Steve’s Internet Guide.&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>Since the user is the one who creates the requests, the user needs to use JavaScript for it. In this case the JavaScript obtains objects that can create and manage web-socket connections to the server. &nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><b>Port-Scanning and JavaScript</b></h3>
<p><span>So how can you run a port scanning with these sets of “tools”? Simple.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The JavaScript code can initiate a websocket request to any location around the world and try to open a socket to it. For example, the selected address can be ‘127.0.0.1’, the loopback address, which is your localhost.</span></p>
<p><span>If you “translate” it to a simple code, you just need to run a list of ports you want, and then try to open a socket for each of them. Once the port is opened, you will know about it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<pre><i><span>var ports = [80, 443, 445];</span></i>
<i><span>for (var i = 0; i &lt; ports.length; i++) </span></i>
<i><span>{</span></i>
<i><span>var s = new WebSocket("wss://127.0.0.1:" + ports[i]);</span></i>
<i><span>s.port = ports[i];</span></i>
<i><span>}</span></i></pre>
<p><i><span>A basic port-scanning code</span></i></p>
<p><span>The most common way to find out if the port is open is to measure the time until getting a response. Active listening ports will answer immediately. Inactive ports will only be resolved when a timeout threshold happens. These are the indications that are helping us to distinguish whois doing what.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the most common ports are blocked by browsers to reduce the risk level. Because of this, scanners aren’t able to analyze ports like DNS, SSH, 21. To view the full list, by browser type, go to the following links: </span><a href="https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/list-of-restricted-ports-in-browsers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Chrome</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/portbanning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Firefox</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now that we have discussed how to operate a port-scanning, we can jump on to the next question: WHY?</span></p>

<h3><b>Compromised Hosts Detection</b></h3>
<p><span>Well, there are different reasons to run port scanning. The most essential technique is trying to detect if the client’s host is compromised. The idea in this case is testing several known ports that are commonly used by remotely controlled applications, or by known trojans. This lets you understand which services are currently running on the client host and creates a risk score. Once you realize that, you can decide if you want to allow the user to login to your application or website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most of these web port scanners are doing it to protect login pages or checkout pages, which are usually targeted by client-side attacks, third-party skimming and, man in the browser attacks. Port scanning is just an additional method of understanding who is performing as the host: a regular user or a malicious entity.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em>Watch out, is port-scanning allowed?</em></p>
<h6><b>Is Port-Scanning Allowed? </b></h6>
<p><span>The first question we should ask ourselves in this case should be – is this behavior illegal? According to the Wikipedia article “Port-Scanning”: </span><i><span>“Because of the inherently open and decentralized architecture of the Internet, lawmakers have struggled since its creation to define legal boundaries that permit effective prosecution of</span></i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i><span>cyber-criminals</span></i></a><i><span>. Cases involving port scanning activities are an example of the difficulties encountered in judging violations. Although these cases are rare, most of the time the legal process involves proving that an intent to commit a break-in or unauthorized access existed, rather than just the performance of a port scan”</span></i></p>
<p><span>Web port scanning doesn’t necessarily fall under the category of illegal, as the action is conducted to detect breaches and increase the protection level of websites.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But, for many users this action would be perceived as highly intrusive, one that is being done without their consent. In such cases, the obvious option should be to alert users before the action is done, or at least, update the website’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>eBay, and other sites mentioned above, are using port-canning capabilities to enhance the security level of the website and to protect their users. </span><span><br>
</span><span>But this same technique can also be used for malicious purposes. For example, an attacker can scan the open services you currently run on the host to detect vulnerabilities that can be exploited, either through the website or, by other means. No matter how you look at it, we mustn’t forget that port scanning is considered as one of the basic steps of accumulating information before conducting an attack.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><b>As a website owner, am I in danger?</b></h3>
<p><span>The answer is yes, and no. In the cases mentioned here we saw how eBay is running the port scanning, probably relying that their user will consider it essential and therefore consent. Now let’s go back to the beginning of this article and remember what JavaScripts can do, and that port scanning is conducted by JavaScript. It means that every third-party application, or a 4</span><span>th</span><span>-party, that is running on your website can carry out the same actions. It also means that once one of your third or fourth party apps are breached, or even just releasing a new version that is trying to access some local resources, you, as the website owner, won’t be able to know about it, or block it.</span></p>
<p><span>The consequences include reputation damages, privacy issues, as well as an indication of a breach.</span></p>
<p><span>How can you detect port-scanning? A dynamic browser security solution (like Reflectiz) can easily detect any type of port scanning from the site origins or iFrames.&nbsp;</span></p>

                            <p>Unless we’ve been hiding under a rock, there’s a very good chance we’ve heard of the latest excitement in Ethereum Layer 2 scaling — Rollups.</p><p>Ethereum gas prices hit an all-time high (ATH) of more than 477 Gwei this week, perhaps foretelling the arrival of Twei’s (szabo’s) sometime soon.</p><p>The network hasn’t been this congested since the ICO days of 2017 — it’s arguably much worse now. The block gas limit is at an ATH of 12.5 million. The transaction count hit levels of 2017 peak and the block size is also at an ATH.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/B1DnOduU0M-NHMIz-sE9iocvYTSkU7p2QcORPbsPi7hLFyDEuqKBxgY_cjUJipGRXbW17saW19kkhlJ0Cg2kf955qPobIGaI26wtUcMuoahtKcGMVW055Cnr3WMKFeeDLrA9sd-f" alt=""></figure><p>While this is encouraging news for the increased utility of the Ethereum network (at least by these metrics), one can argue that the current scalability (or lack thereof) of the base layer is considerably limiting applications and significantly hindering user experience. But, this is not a new realization. The Ethereum community foresaw this problem years ago and has been exploring numerous solutions ever since.</p><p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/">Ethereum 2.0</a> with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and sharding in Layer 1 is the biggest ongoing effort and we will soon start seeing rollout of its phase 0 in coming months. However, computational scaling (i.e. state execution in shards with smart contracts) in Eth2 will only happen in phase 2, which is currently anticipated in 2021+.</p><blockquote><em>All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection - </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wheeler_(computer_scientist)#Quotes"><em>David Wheeler</em></a></blockquote><p>Layer 2 solutions effectively introduce a level of indirection by resolving transactions at their layer while going to Layer 1 <em>only</em> when necessary. Several <a href="https://medium.com/l4-media/making-sense-of-ethereums-layer-2-scaling-solutions-state-channels-plasma-and-truebit-22cb40dcc2f4">categories</a> of such solutions — State Channels, Sidechains, Plasma — have been explored by multiple projects for many years now and have seen considerable progress and evolution. </p><p>Most recently, Bitfinex’s Tether — that powers USDt, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization and consistently in the <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/">top</a> Ethereum gas consumers — <a href="https://tether.to/tether-usdt-integration-live-on-omg-network/">switched</a> to <a href="https://omg.network/">OMG Network</a>’s More Viable Plasma Layer 2 solution.</p><p>Reddit’s “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/">The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off</a>” contest to help scale its Ethereum-based “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/community-points">Community Points</a>” program (currently implemented only on two subreddits) to all its users has seen 22 submissions across these various Layer 2 solutions.</p><p>However, note that Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling solutions are not mutually exclusive — they’re <em>multiplicative</em>. </p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6pCInKJtXhcNPMTb9ATwBkIoFvjmXo-rdFlclCpORjKN3mi1N2_TPCay-TVNMDq60oaEyT_WMUbQCTwRlVYNUAV7k2PEMLUKelNoRRSx25CdDDDQVj__5-ApRgV55F1exNkg1tOx" alt=""></figure><p>So while Ethereum 2.0 rolls out in phases over the next couple of years, Layer 2 solutions hope to provide the much needed scalability until then and even beyond.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/I3zvOWSr65Qff2_8YSLra9CMXl45Y4R17KPz8V8WC6IkkAriT6vtUhIOFARSqRd4DO6FJQVhV3PJu0ZGi8lhd_P6t7k__MWmkd9kLLip4RJNNagyVDgpvHly_eR4QluKMe9nZiqr" alt=""></figure><p>State Channels and Plasma projects dominated Layer 2 explorations in the last couple of years but the category of Rollups is lately seeing considerable excitement and gaining real traction.</p><p>So in this article, we dive into Rollups and summarize the <em>why</em>, <em>what</em> and <em>who</em> aspects. We review conceptual ideas of the two broad categories of Rollups — ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups — and then reference some of their leading implementations. Finally, we touch upon the various initiatives at Status Network that could benefit from Layer 2 scaling and project where we may be headed in the near future.</p><h2 id="rollups-why">Rollups: Why?</h2><p><strong>Basics</strong>: Scaling solutions that are built <em>on top</em> of Ethereum without requiring any changes to the underlying base Layer 1 protocols are known as <em>Layer 2 solutions</em>. They resolve transactions without always requiring interactions with the Ethereum network. They anchor their security guarantees to the base layer of Ethereum via smart contracts. </p><p>Layer 2 solutions are appealing because there can be multiple such solutions running on Ethereum <em>only</em> for specific applications that are Layer 2 aware and enabled without requiring <em>everyone</em> to upgrade the base layer infrastructure (which is a significant effort involving a lot of risk). While they don’t always offer the same level of security and finality guarantees as Layer 1, they could be sufficient enough for certain applications that require increased throughput, decreased costs and a better overall user experience than what Layer 1 offers currently.</p><p>The most promising Layer 2 solutions until recently were State Channels and Plasma.</p><p><strong>State Channels</strong> are typically best suited for applications where the number of participants is well defined, need to exchange many state updates over time and have strong availability guarantees to account for challenge periods. <a href="https://connext.network/">Connext Network</a> is a representative example of a project that is currently using State Channels to help scale DApps.</p><p><strong>Plasma</strong> was <a href="http://plasma.io/plasma.pdf">introduced</a> in August 2017 by Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Poon. It is a <a href="https://www.learnplasma.org/">framework</a> for scaling where assets are transferred into/out-of child chain(s) via a smart contract on the root chain, all transaction execution happens on child chain(s) with state commitments (via Merkle root created from all state updates in the block) posted to the root chain which may later be used in fraud proofs during exits to the root chain. There have been many variants of Plasma proposed including Minimum Viable Plasma, More Viable Plasma, Cash, Debit and Prime. OMG Network’s More Viable Plasma is a recent example of a Plasma project that has seen market adoption.</p><p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> The biggest drawback of State Channels is its <em>liveness assumption</em> — users or their representatives need to be constantly monitoring Layer 1 to be available for any challenges. And Plasma not only inherits this liveness assumption but also has a <em>data availability <em>assumption — </em></em>users need to trust the operators to make available all the transaction data required to verify correctness if/when required. In the absence of that, they could exit the Plasma chain but that could lead to a mass exit problem in the worst-case scenario. Also, both State Channels and Plasma do not support smart contracts, in general, which severely limits applications that require EVM compatibility<em>.</em></p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/iFK6VIk2xTwYWkPRM4MeoRJqFQXfTBp2q98vcKxWhsuZCg5UJRax_hi0x7mebn0CdoOFKoiHe5nSq4Q3gj9_hzNzewFOcduT5Ivtq7feZd5ZZkpLRstIKYYMKMoUavENfySbQ16_" alt=""></figure><p>Looking at the comparative <a href="https://medium.com/matter-labs/evaluating-ethereum-l2-scaling-solutions-a-comparison-framework-b6b2f410f955">illustration</a> above, Rollups do not need to make the two described limiting assumptions that could be a deal breaker in many scenarios. This makes Rollups more promising than State Channels and Plasma for a wide variety of applications.</p><p>So let’s look at what Rollups are and why they do not have the limiting assumptions of State Channels and Plasma.</p><h2 id="rollups-what">Rollups: What?</h2><p>Rollups are very similar to Plasma with one big difference to avoid its data availability assumption — all Layer 2 transactions are “rolled up” into a block which is committed to Layer 1 in one transaction’s calldata (calldata is the read-only area where data parameters of an Ethereum transaction are held).</p><p>Given that calldata is much cheaper than Layer 1 storage, this approach allows Layer 2 transaction data — unlike only the Merkle root in Plasma — to be available on Layer 1 anytime someone needs it for validating a state transition. So Layer 2 data once committed is always available on Layer 1. This property removes the requirements of both liveness and data availability assumptions giving Rollups the edge over both State Channels and Plasma.</p><p>Depending on the approach to validating state transitions, there are two types of Rollups: ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups.</p><p><strong>ZK Rollups (ZkR)</strong>: In ZkR, operator(s) must generate a <a href="https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/">zk-SNARK</a> validity proof for every state transition on Layer 2 and submit these to the Rollup contract on Layer 1 which verifies that there are valid proofs for state transitions to go from the old Merkle root to the new one. The guarantees here are cryptographic in nature, albeit using novel primitives.</p><p><strong>Optimistic Rollups (OR)</strong>: In OR, operator(s) submit the new Merkle root along with transaction data to the Rollup contract on Layer 1 and everyone optimistically moves forward with the assumption that this is a valid transition (without verifying like in ZkR) but if not, one of the participants will challenge it with a fraud proof. The guarantees here are cryptoeconomic in nature because operators are incentivized to be honest with token rewards along with staking and slashing.</p><p>To summarize from a <a href="https://medium.com/matter-labs/optimistic-vs-zk-rollup-deep-dive-ea141e71e075">deep-dive</a> comparative analysis, ZkRs today are best suited for token transfers with faster time-to-finality (~1-20 minutes) but do not support EVM-compatible smart contracts for generalized applications. In contrast, ORs today are best suited for applications requiring EVM-compatible smart contract support but with the downside of slower time-to-finality (~1-2 weeks) by default to account for the fraud proof challenge window. (There are however techniques to provide economic guarantees for achieving faster finality or withdrawal times with ORs.)</p><h2 id="rollups-who">Rollups: Who?</h2><p>There are multiple projects working on ZkR and OR implementations with different assumptions and properties suitable for different scenarios.</p><p><strong>ZkR</strong>: <a href="https://zksync.io/">zkSync</a> from Matter Labs is live on Ethereum mainnet. Loopring has <a href="https://blogs.loopring.org/loopring-pay-is-live-zkrollup-transfers-on-ethereum/">launched</a> a DEX and payments using ZkR. <a href="https://medium.com/starkware/with-starkex-ethereum-is-ready-for-reddit-3b2966d5203b">StarkEx</a> from StarkWare is a ZkR technology that uses <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-starks/">zk-STARK</a> (instead of zk-SNARK) and therefore is not dependent on a trusted setup, more scalable and currently quantum resistant.</p><p><strong>OR</strong>: There are at least nine projects working on different variations of OR as shown in the below comparison table from this <a href="https://medium.com/molochdao/the-state-of-optimistic-rollup-8ade537a2d0f">article</a>. The biggest differentiators are support for EVM compatibility and the interactivity requirements of challenges with fraud proofs. For example, <a href="https://blog.celer.network/2020/07/20/introducing-the-celer-hybrid-rollup-testnet/">Celer</a>, <a href="https://nutberry.github.io/">Nutberry</a> and <a href="https://optimism.io/">Optimism</a> support EVM-compatible smart contracts with single-round fraud proofs.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/bHAtV-TfsdLmZO5xfcXeViZLo0sd8TWlKUsx82qmkYuUF6RC0D8ezzViIav2Re1XoSJqWKCXKf5jtK5BQDxThOrkRjPU8SglEr_BpPonOv-b0asmcRMwiypiR_oVVeaVFpWlp1nH" alt=""></figure><h2 id="status-network">Status Network</h2><p>A big part of the vision at Status is being the “Window onto Ethereum.” While <a href="https://status.im/">Status Messenger</a> does not interface directly with the Ethereum blockchain, the app bundles a secure crypto wallet and web3 browser which interact with Ethereum and therefore are directly affected by the soaring gas prices due to the aforementioned scalability challenges. </p><p>The <a href="https://keycard.tech/">Keycard</a> product which is part of <a href="https://statusnetwork.com/">Status Network</a> is exploring a <a href="https://discuss.status.im/t/keycard-for-payments-proof-of-concept-and-a-demo/1590">payments network</a> whose design requirements of credit-card level scalability and near-instant finality are not fulfilled by the Ethereum network today.</p><p>Additionally, there are numerous other initiatives within Status Network such as <a href="https://discuss.status.im/t/kudos-rewards-building-the-status-meritocracy/1019">Kudos rewards</a>, <a href="https://github.com/status-im/tribute-to-talk/blob/master/docs/TributeToTalk.md">Tribu…</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

September 1, 2020 | https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/01/typescript/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/01/typescript/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In recent months, I've noticed a dramatic increase in TypeScript packages on GitHub. I usually come across them when checking repositories of the people I follow like. Or, when I'm looking for dependencies to solve a problem in my projects. And the more TypeScript packages I'm encountering, the more often I get reminded of this little annoyance towards the project.</p>
<p>My context is that I've not looked into TypeScript yet. That means I have no idea how it works. Unfortunately, this is now starting to become kind of a problem when searching for dependencies. It does, when I either willingly or accidentally include a TypeScript package into my projects. Mainly because my package-choosing criteria include:</p>
<ul>
<li>picking packages that I potentially can contribute to (e.g., a lesser-known package that contains well-written code); or</li>
<li>picking packages that are well-maintained by a large community but may include code that I'd not be able to easily contribute to (e.g., a popular package using a C library internally)</li>
</ul>
<p>I've put these criteria in place willingly to achieve a certain quality standard when building applications. Either because I can fix bugs myself quickly, or because I'm able to rely on a strong community to fix them. However, with TypeScript packages in npm, there's now this opaque problem of not knowing the language or quickly telling a package's language and its community size. Also, TypeScript could be just another CoffeeScript.</p>
<p>So essentially, the problem is that TypeScript authors publish their packages on npm, the package manager for Node.js. And to me, that's what is weakening the JavaScript ecosystem. Since its inception, and throughout trends like Coffeescript, npm has mostly held the promise of only hosting JavaScript packages. However, this promise is <code>rejected()</code> (lol) by many authors publishing their TypeScript-to-JavaScript transpiled packages.</p>
<p>Indeed, it makes sense considering that Microsoft markets TypeScript as a "superset of JavaScript" and since it "compiles" to JavaScript, why not publish packages to npm? But in terms of equality and identity, TypeScript is not JavaScript. After all, you'd not consider C and Objective-C the same either, or would you? In both examples, the languages are subsets/supersets but were conceived with different goals in mind to solve other problems.</p>
<p>Therefore, TypeScript authors should, in my opinion, do something along the following lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>namespacing their TypeScript packages; or</li>
<li>build and publish their packages to their package manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, continuing to publish TypeScript packages to npm is, in my opinion weakening the JavaScript ecosystem as it's splitting its community and polluting the npm namespace.</p>
<h2 id="controversy">Controversy</h2>
<ul>
<li>For a short time, there was an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24344506" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intense conversation</a> on Hacker News. But for unknown reasons, my post got marked as <code>[flagged]</code>. I've written an email to the operators.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Team Health is the most important KPI for dev leads. Monitor these vital signs during your iteration to identify problems early and prevent developer burnout.</strong></p>







<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-DevTeamHeatlh-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-DevTeamHeatlh-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-DevTeamHeatlh-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-DevTeamHeatlh-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-DevTeamHeatlh.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>Many of us in software are working longer and harder than ever before. Being at home all day, every day, is blurring the lines between work and home life. On one hand, this work from home experience is wholesome and humanizing. Seeing your boss holding a newborn or wrestling with a curious five year old during product strategy meetings adds a new perception and understanding to the workplace. Something that was often not found in the workplace. Unfortunately the same coin has another side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As family life blends into worklife, the opposite is happening as well. It’s all too easy to get pinged on slack after dinner and say “I’ll just send that over real quick.” No one wants to be the blocker afterall. This type of always-on mentality is something that many companies are learning to combat because it is unhealthy and a leading indicator of bigger issues down the road.</p>



<p>Keeping the teams pulse at your fingertips is one of the necessary challenges of the team lead.</p>



<p>In a lot of ways the team’s pulse is something that is felt, an intuition if you will. In other ways it is something that can be measured, like work output changes. Great leaders work hard to combine their intuition with quantitative data, providing them with powerful insights into their teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m not sure I can help you feel the pulse of your team, but I can share the quantitative data I watch at a team and individual level that helps me identify unhealthy behaviors before they become larger issues.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>Top Development Team Health Indicators to Watch:&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Consecutive Days Worked</li><li>Number of Open Tasks per Team Member&nbsp;</li><li>Unfocused Work&nbsp;</li><li>High levels of Rework</li><li>Number of bugs/fire drills per Iteration&nbsp;</li><li>Team Members Acting Out of Character</li></ul>







<h3><strong>Consecutive Days Works</strong></h3>



<p>At LinearB we run 2 week sprint cycles, meaning my team has 10 good working days to accomplish our sprint goals. At larger companies with hundreds of developers, seeing developers log on 11 out of the 14 days might be the norm. This includes being on-call during a sunday night merge or answering a quick slack message on a Saturday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At smaller companies who employ only a handful of developers, all of which are all at home all day, it’s much more regular to see 12, 13, 14 days logged in per sprint. This is okay during some sprints, big launch weeks for example, but when my lead developer is working at least some of every day for multiple sprints, that is unhealthy.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><a href="https://linearb.io/demo/"><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-01-at-8.21.23-AM-1024x387.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-01-at-8.21.23-AM-1024x387.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-01-at-8.21.23-AM-300x113.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-01-at-8.21.23-AM-768x291.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-01-at-8.21.23-AM-1536x581.png 1536w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-01-at-8.21.23-AM.png 1602w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>LinearB Retrospective View</figcaption></figure>







<p>Consecutive days worked is a leading indicator of team member health. It is the job of the team lead to step in and be the responsible people manager. It’s like putting a 7 year old to bed, they are tired, you know they are tired, but they fight it anyways. If tomorrow is going to be a good day, we need to disconnect, mentally and physically. If you see your people working consecutively, if you find yourself working consecutively, start enforcing mandatory downtime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Number of Open Tasks Per Team Member</strong></h3>



<p>Work balance across development teams has gotten much better over the years. As a team lead myself, I take an active role in knowing what everyone is working on and making sure our more experienced developers aren’t taking on more than they should be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the LinearB development team we flag anyone who has more than six tasks open at any one time. What does the flag mean? It means I need to take some time to listen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There may be a good reason why Oriel has 6 active branches right now, or it might mean that I haven’t provided Miki with the right priorities. Either way, knowing the number of open tasks everyone is working on allows me to open a dialogue and keep my team balanced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To keep your team members healthy, stop using individual velocity as a KPI, focus instead on providing the right priorities and keeping the work balanced across your whole team.</p>







<h3><strong>Unfocused Work</strong></h3>



<p>Similar to having too many open tasks, team members who aren’t focusing their efforts on solving one problem before another is a leading indicator of developer burnout. If we take Oriel as the example again, we can see that he is spread across 4 different open tasks and 4 completely different areas of focus. It’s going to be hard for him to immerse himself in any of those problems if he is constantly switching contexts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another way to identify unfocused inefficient work is to look at the type of output coming from developers who are spread thin. If someone like Oriel, who is often providing several PR reviews a week, hasn’t participated in any reviews during this sprint, I can infer that his time is being taken up in other areas – meetings, support tickets, bugs, etc. While day-to-day operations like these are important, it’s also crucial to make sure your team members have enough time to block out the business and zone in on solving a single problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identifying people on your team who are spread across several focus areas is an excellent way to prevent developer burnout. Help your people by communicating their priorities and asking what they need so they can focus without switching context.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>High Levels of Rework</strong></h3>



<p>Frustration is a keen emotion felt by everyone. It often reminds me of fire. It can build up and explode. Or it can be so subtle you don’t even recognize it until it’s a bigger issue. And the best antidote for both is to identify it early and snuff it out. High levels of rework during your sprint is a leading indicator of team frustration. Frustration within your team is scary, because like fire, it can spread very quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A high level of rework during your sprint is often a symptom of misalignment between product and development. It’s an age old story, product says A, development starts working, and three days later, product makes changes to the requirements. Rework due to vague or changing requirements causes frustration for whoever is trying to build the feature.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><a href="https://linearb.io/demo/"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uz-hvE8LkEzs8dyOoaZMQwWtgQPmsH-kwqI29m7hDzsUGhYzVB9yj7Q160E7kY6qDPwF04wPHo9pF-9HQmvzVsgvB-e2We53gxgk71q96QZN8sEiyBu6L2KjPP2_B4mDZJYjvgJi" alt=""></a><figcaption>LinearB’s Work Breakdown Per Iteration</figcaption></figure>







<p>Another way to check for misalignment between product and your dev team is to look at the time between when requirements are finished and the first commit. If that is a short time span, you can infer that your team members trust the product team because the product team has provided enough context for developers to understand why something is being built.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Healthy development teams have a transparent relationship with their product manager.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Number of Bugs/fire drills per Iteration</strong></h3>



<p>Working on new stuff is fun. You get to explore, discover, and accomplish something different. Working on bugs, fire drills, and support tickets might be seen as less exciting, especially by younger developers. Teams who are working on bugs and support more than 80% of the time tend to get bored and envious of other teams, leading again to our fiery friend frustration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s good to keep an eye on the amount of new work vs refactoring vs bugs during your team’s iteration, and at an individual level. Too much of the latter can be a symptom of much larger code quality issues or headaches that cause stress among the team. Team health is optimized when refactor, bug, and new work is balanced throughout the team.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><a href="https://linearb.io/demo/"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Yg29YSHot-tg4OQLWixNK6tdf2RCqKKatWB6OdKK3DMq5R2yKYS9WbuO2upk5jQwr4DYaLsR8yogXFw2Qjjxwrk3Y-lInekgvAxrTRJextN4ViJBVkrnlLsXUF0LJNKkVGQ0wxXX" alt=""></a><figcaption>LinearB Time Investment Profile</figcaption></figure>







<p>Another way to combat a high amount of bug work is to ask your developers what else they are interested in and try to give them time throughout the sprint to explore the idea. People produce their best work when they are interested in what they are doing.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Acting Out of Character</strong></h3>



<p>Our final top dev team health indicator to watch is more subjective. People management is hard, and only harder now with everyone distributed. Our 2d world leaves out a lot of the context we as humans have become accustomed to when interacting with each other. But as a team leader, I have to try.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Acting out of character can take a lot of different forms, and it’s the job of the team lead to identify when it’s happening. If someone who normally speaks a lot is all of a sudden quiet during stand up, or the type of work someone usually does has changed significantly, are a couple examples I’ve seen. If you can identify a behavior change, my best advice is to engage that person directly and ask what’s up. Maybe it’s frustration, or home life, or conflict within the team. Whatever the reason, it is the team leader’s responsibility to listen, understand, and lend your resources where you can.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Tips for Mitigating Dev Team Health Risks</strong></h3>







<h4>1. Give People Tactical Time To Explore</h4>



<p>I like to ask my team members directly what they are interested in working on. What has been triggered in their brain lately. So other teams I know give an 8 hour allotment per sprint to each dev to work on something they are interested in. However you go about doing it, giving people some freedom to explore and discover on their own will almost assuredly make your team happier.&nbsp;</p>







<h4>2. Use Tools That Track Team Vital Signs&nbsp;</h4>



<p>While team leaders most assuredly keep track of their team’s health, it is always helpful to apply tools, automation, and data to provide early identifiers. LinearB plugs into your Project Management tool and Git repository to provide visibility into your overall sprint as well as individual team health. Free tools like LinearB.io give team leads the early indicators they need to run a healthy team.&nbsp;</p>

	<p><img width="2048" height="1536" src="https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0947.jpeg" alt="CERN DIY electron detector and connected laptop" loading="lazy" srcset="https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0947.jpeg 2048w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0947-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0947-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0947-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"></p><p>What do you do when you’re stuck at home with a 16-year-old son during a pandemic lockdown? Well, the first answer is that you build a gaming PC. That was a good project with a lot of incentives to complete, but that also meant it was soon over.  So, what next? I spotted a post about an outreach project from CERN to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/ozel/DIY_particle_detector" target="_blank">build your own particle detector</a> for under £30. Sounded like fun, so here’s how we got on.</p>



<p>Firstly, a bit about ourselves: I’ve just retired from an IT architecture role at a major UK bank, a brave decision when you still have a child at secondary school and there’s a global pandemic looming. My son, Sam, has just completed his GCSEs and is about to enter the sixth form.  I have a degree in Physics and Sam has a keen interest in scientific things. We both suffer from hypermobility of the finger joints, meaning that we have limited fine motor skills (translation: we are both klutzes. Even klutzes can successfully build this detector.) I haven’t picked up a soldering iron in anger for a long time and Sam has only done two or three connections for a school project so we are effectively total noobs to this sort of project.</p>



<p>Anyway, here is a write-up of our experience and lessons learned rfom building the electron detector. If you’re planning on building one yourself then you may find this useful</p>



<h2>Buying the components</h2>



<p>The great thing about the CERN kit is that you can order most of the parts easily using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kitspace.org/boards/github.com/ozel/diy_particle_detector/electron-detector/" target="_blank">kitspace</a>. Can you really build it for under €30 (about £27) as claimed? Well, yes and no. The exchange rates have all moved, which doesn’t help. The individual components certainly cost less than €30 but you cannot just buy individual components. You have to buy 10 resistors at a time but they are dirt cheap and you’ll just end up spending 30p instead of 3p for the parts you need. The biggest surprise was that you have to buy a minimum of three circuit boards, but this turned out to be a blessing in disguise. It’s handy to have a spare board if your soldering skills are questionable, plus the alpha detector variant uses the same board so you have an incentive to build that model too. All-in-all, the cost of all the electronic components same to just under £40. If you were buying for a class project – a dozen or so boards – I think the bulk  price would be closer to £33/€37 per board.</p>



<p>There are some optional costs too that you may want to take into account. We bought a BNC to audio jack cable for about £8 on Amazon as this was quicker, easier and ultimately cheaper than building one from scratch. We also had to buy some tools that we needed but didn’t have in our existing toolbox. You may prefer to buy a metal case or project box for around £6, however I would recommend using an old sweet tin or similar. We used a presentation case off a Fossil watch that my wife received one Christmas.  To mount the board in the case, you’ll need some sort of metal standoff. We bought a box of M3 brass standoffs of assorted lengths with all the necessary screws and bolts for about £11 on Amazon. (120 components when you need only one!) You’ll also need some small lengths of connecting wire – about 30cm in total. (Tip: Amazon Prime is well worth the cost if you need to order all these things as you go along.)</p>



<p>Finally, you are going to need some sort of radioactive source to try out the detector. We bought 100g of analytical quality <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium-40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potassium chloride</a> (KCl) on Amazon for under £5. This is a better price than that of the potassium-rich salt substitutes that are also on Amazon and has a higher proportion of potassium to boot.</p>



<h2>Tools that you’ll need</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1536" src="https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0949.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0949.jpeg 2048w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0949-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0949-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0949-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"></figure>



<p>Before you start, make sure that you have all the tools that you’re going to need, Here’s a list of what we found necessary:</p>



<ul><li>A soldering iron with a small tip suitable for the components and board</li><li>A de-soldering pump and braid for when you mess things up</li><li>Small cutting pliers for tidying up excess wires when you’ve soldered a component</li><li>Wire strippers for the ends of the connecting wires</li><li>A small multi-meter for testing joints and checking the board</li><li>A nail punch to make holes in your old tin box</li><li>A file to file down the sharp edges on the holes that you’ve just punched</li><li>Some things to hold the board and components in position while you solder them. We used an old wall tile and a hexagonal pencil.</li></ul>



<h2>Constructing the detector</h2>



<p>We spent about three elapsed hours over about 3 weeks building the board and maybe another hour building the case and mounting the board into it. Why so long? Well, this project didn’t have the same appeal to a 16 year old as does building a gaming PC. Plus, use of said gaming PC frequently took priority over this project. We decided to solder the components in groups, doing the resistors first, then the capacitors then the semiconductors. The build instructions in the wiki are pretty good and easy to follow. </p>



<p>We tested every joint as we soldered it, making sure to test from another point on the circuit board so as to prove the connection was good. My son did all the soldering on one of the PCBs. I started work on a second board partly as a backup and partly to have something that could form the basis of the alpha detector. (I discovered the hard way that the two variants begin to differ at the third component, R3!)</p>



<p>Here are some shots of the board at different stages of construction:</p>

<h2>Testing the detector</h2>



<p>The first thing to do when testing the detector was to make sure that there were no shorts by measuring resistance across the power connectors. (Tick! A satisfactory 9.8 kilo-ohms) and make sure that power was reaching the board. Then we plugged it into a PC and switched it on. We were using the pulse detector JavaScript to check that it was working. I flicked the switch and…nothing. So, we examined the board. We knew we were novice constructors and some of the joints looked potentially to be dry and on one or two others we could not be 100% sure that we had an air gap between adjacent joints so we de-soldered and remade about 3 joints. Again we connected to the PC and we saw the satisfying pulses when the device was turned on and off. We also saw quite a bit of microphony being picked up when the tin was moved or when one of us spoke near it.</p>



<p>Ok, so next step was to try it with a radiation source. I weighed out roughly 10g of KCl into a plastic lid and positioned it under the diodes in the detector. We hadn’t made a radiation window in the lid of the tin and the diodes were about 1.5cm above the surface of the KCl. I switched on the detector and…nothing, not even the on/off pulses. The detector seemed dead.  I took the device apart and retested very connection with the multi-meter and made sure all the case connections were good and that the case was properly wired to earth. I checked that power from the battery was reaching all the necessary parts and that the battery power was good. I could find nothing wrong. </p>



<p>It quickly became apparent that there was an intermittent problem. Sometimes, the JavaScript detector would see a pulse when the device was switched on or off and sometimes – usually – there was nothing. Sometimes you would see noise on the web oscilloscope and sometimes not. I was scratching my head as to what the problem was. Eventually, it occurred to me to try actually listening to the audio output, a trivial thing to do under Windows. BINGO! I could hear white noise when the device was switched on and, just audible over the noise, a soft click every 20-30 seconds. Clearly the detector was working and therefore what I was facing was a software problem.</p>



<h2>The importance of sound cards, and repurposing yet again an ancient laptop</h2>



<p>I have to say that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/ozel" target="_blank">Oliver Keller</a> was an enormous help while I was trying to get the detector working and I cannot stress enough how important it is to listen to his advice about audio connections and sound cards. The problem seems to be that sound cards (or chips) in modern PCs are too clever for their own good. They are designed to optimise microphone input for Skype and Zoom and that means removing the noise and extraneous clicks that are exactly the signal that the detector puts out. </p>



<p>Modern technology was assuming the detector signal was unwanted noise so I needed some primitive technology. I have an old notebook laptop, an Asus EeePC 901. I bought this about 10 years ago and it has been the subject of several hobbyist projects over the years. I upgraded it’s memory to 2GB. I replaced it’s laughably small 4GB SSD with a 32GB one.  I upgraded it from Windows XP Home, via several versions of Ubuntu, to Windows 10 Home. You may be surprised that such a machine can run Windows 10 and MS Office but it can do so, just not well. I backed it up (virtualized it for VMWare) and installed a fresh copy of Lubuntu. I fired up the web oscilloscope under FireFox and now I have a working detector:</p>

<p>You can quite clearly see a detector pulse in the screenshot. The noise sometimes peaks and can give a false reading but these are fairly easy to spot. The false pulses are one sided and lack the rebound peak of a true pulse. From around 25g of KCl, I’m seeing two or three pulses per minute in the detector</p>



<h2>So what comes next?</h2>



<p>OK, now that the detector is working, what comes next? Our first plan is to try out the python script to make sure that we can see and correctly analyze the energy spectrum from the KCl.  Step three will be to try various things to reduce the electrical noise. I have a suspicion that the tin leaks a little light into its interior but that can be remedied with black tape. Step three will be trying out various samples from my small mineral collection in the …</p></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>The world of training big AI models is no longer the realm of a desktop or a few servers. Big AI research organizations are using thousands of accelerators to train huge models. Google, a major force in AI training, designs its own accelerators and systems to use both for internal purposes, as well as to rent via the Google Cloud platform. At Hot Chips 32 (2020) we had the chance to learn a bit more about the Google TPUv3 and the improvements over <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-enables-tpu-v2-pod-training-gcp/">TPUv2 pods</a>.<span id="more-46464"></span></p>
<h2>Google TPUv3 at Hot Chips 32</h2>
<p>Starting with the basic building block, the chips under the cold plates in the cover image above, this is the basic block diagram for the TPUv3. One can see the two cores, their vector, scalar, matrix multiply, and transpose/ permute units. There is HBM memory as well. One can see PCIe connectivity to a host as well as a high-speed interconnect.</p>
<figure id="attachment_46470" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46470"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-tpuv3-discussed-at-hot-chips-32/hc32-google-tpuv3-overview-diagram/" rel="attachment wp-att-46470"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram.jpg" alt="HC32 Google TPUv3 Overview Diagram" width="1370" height="747" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram.jpg 1370w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-400x218.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-800x436.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-696x379.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-1068x582.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-770x420.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1370px) 100vw, 1370px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46470">HC32 Google TPUv3 Overview Diagram</figcaption></figure>
<p>A big change with TPUv3 is that the matrix multiply units are doubled, just like the HBM capacity. This is an ugly image as we took it from the PDF version of Google’s talk. The presented version did not have the diagram over the text. It is somewhat amazing that Google can make massive AI training systems and index the world, but Google Slides gives this kind of export to PDF experience in 2020.</p>
<figure id="attachment_46469" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46469"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-tpuv3-discussed-at-hot-chips-32/hc32-google-tpuv3-architecture/" rel="attachment wp-att-46469"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture.jpg" alt="HC32 Google TPUv3 Architecture" width="1458" height="580" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture.jpg 1458w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-400x159.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-800x318.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-696x277.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-1068x425.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-1056x420.jpg 1056w" sizes="(max-width: 1458px) 100vw, 1458px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46469">HC32 Google TPUv3 Architecture</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a number of other improvements beyond the MMU and HBM capacity doubling. The core frequencies, memory bandwidth, and interconnect link bandwidth all went up by 30% as well. When you see “4x nodes” in this diagram below, that is referring to the number of nodes per pod is scaling to 4x the previous generation (1024 up from 256.)</p>

<p>The TPUs are connected via a 2D Torus network for high-speed accelerator communication. There is also a PCIe link to host machines that provide the link to storage.</p>

<p>Taking a step back here, there are quite a few people who think that this is completely different from what NVIDIA is doing. As we showed in our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/inspur-nf5488m5-review-a-unique-8x-nvidia-tesla-v100-server/">Inspur NF5488M5 review</a> as well as our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-dgx-a100-leapfrogs-previous-gen/">NVIDIA DGX A100</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-dgx-a100-superpod-detailed-look/">NVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPod look</a>, NVIDIA is doing something similar. We can even look back to our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/a-quick-hardware-overview-of-deeplearning12/">DeepLearning12</a> Tesla P100 build and see a similar theme. The NVIDIA A100 (and V100’s) have an interconnect on a HGX-2/ HGX A100 board. That scales from 4x A100 GPUs <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-tesla-a100-4x-gpu-hgx-redstone-platform/">HGX Redstone Platform</a> up to 8 or 16 GPUs per platform with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-nvswitch-details-at-hot-chips-30/">NVSwitch</a>. Interconnect is NVIDIA-Mellanox Infiniband that with GPUDirect RDMA and effectively bypass going to the host to get on the training fabric. For storage, one goes back to the host system and storage is via another NIC.</p>

<p>There are a few differences and some significant ones, but we just wanted to point out that there are, indeed, a lot of similarities in how the solutions are built at a high-level. From this high-level, we are comparing a BMW to a Tesla (car) rather than a BMW automobile to a bullet train.</p>
<p>The TPUv2 Google showed using large air coolers. With the TPUv3 we get liquid cooling which means a lower server height. As a result, the standard rack seems to have gone from the TPUv2’s 4×8 four across and eight high of TPUv2 boards to 2×16 of TPUv3 boards.</p>

<p>There are other changes, however, at the system level, we have 4x the number of accelerator chips but 9-10x the petaflops and 8x the memory. We can also see a big change to the cabling connectors on the left side of these nodes.</p>

<p>NVIDIA also saw the need to build a large internal-use cluster to aid in software development as we saw in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/0-to-supercomputer-nvidia-selene-deployment/">0 to Supercomputer NVIDIA Selene Deployment</a>.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>The TPUv3 was announced in 2018 so hearing talk on it with a lot of obfuscated details in 2020 seems strange. This is especially so given the relatively open manner NVIDIA offerings are discussed. That may be due to NVIDIA having partners and a stack that is scaling from low-power to high-power chips and software across multiple domains. Still, we wish Google had used its multiple talks at Hot Chips 32 to go into more detail about the systems themselves especially since we are around two years after TPUv3 announcement. Google tends to be relatively opaque on its hardware (e.g. there is very little public information on the company’s Arm CPU usage.) Facebook and Microsoft tend to be much more open, AWS is somewhere in the middle. At this point, given Google’s scale, they are hard to imitate except for the other hyper-scale outfits. While it is great to see more, we wish Google would let its engineers show off their engineering prowess a bit more.</p>

<p>The Secondary Memory Interface (SMI) is a parallel I/O interface that is included in all the Raspberry Pi versions. It is rarely used due to the acute lack of publicly-available documentation; the only information I can find is in the source code to an external memory device driver <a href="https://github.com/Ysurac/raspberry_kernel_mptcp/blob/master/include/linux/broadcom/bcm2835_smi.h">here</a>, and an experimental IDE interface <a href="https://github.com/fenlogic/IDE_trial">here</a>.</p>



<p>However, it is a very useful general-purpose high-speed parallel interface, that deserves wider usage; in this post I’m testing it with digital-to-analogue and analogue-to-digital converters (DAC and ADC) but there are many other parallel-bus devices that would be suitable.</p>

<p>To take advantage of the high data rates, I’ll be using the C language, and Direct Memory Access (DMA); if you are unfamiliar with DMA on the RPi, I suggest you read my previous 2 posts on the subject, <a href="https://iosoft.blog/raspberry-pi-dma-programming/">here</a> and <a href="https://iosoft.blog/fast-data-capture-raspberry-pi/">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Parallel interface</h2>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1941" data-permalink="https://iosoft.blog/2020/07/16/raspberry-pi-smi/smi2/" data-orig-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png" data-orig-size="447,123" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="smi2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=447" src="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=447" alt="" srcset="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png 447w, https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=150 150w, https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 85vw, 447px"><figcaption>Raspberry Pi SMI signals</figcaption></figure>



<p>The SMI interface has up to 18 bits of data, 6 address lines, read &amp; write select lines. Transfers can be initiated internally, or externally via read &amp; write request lines, which can take over the uppermost 2 bits of the data bus. Transfer data widths are 8, 9, 16 or 18 bits, and are fully supported by First In First Out (FIFO) buffers, and DMA; this makes for efficient memory usage when driving an 8-bit peripheral, since a single 32-bit DMA transfer can automatically be converted into four 8-bit accesses.</p>



<p>If you have ever worked with the classic bus-interfaces of the original microprocessors, you’ll feel quite at home with SMI, but no need to worry about timing problems, because the setup, strobe &amp; hold times are fully programmable with 4 nanosecond resolution; what luxury!</p>



<p>The SMI functions are assigned to specific GPIO pins:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1947" data-permalink="https://iosoft.blog/2020/07/16/raspberry-pi-smi/rpi_smi_pins-2/" data-orig-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png" data-orig-size="611,631" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="rpi_smi_pins" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png?w=290" data-large-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png?w=611" src="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png?w=611" alt="" srcset="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png 611w, https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png?w=145 145w, https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png?w=290 290w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px"></figure>



<p>The GPIO pins to be included in the parallel interface are selected by setting their mode to ALT1; there is no requirement to set all the SMI pins in this way, so the I2C, SPI and PWM interfaces are still quite usable.</p>

<h4>Hardware</h4>



<p>The simplest device to drive from the parallel bus is a digital-to-analogue converter (DAC), using resistors from each data line to a common output. This arrangement is commonly known as an R-2R ladder, due to the resistor values needed.</p>



<p>I’ve used a pre-built device from Digilent (details <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/r2r-module-retired/">here</a>, or newer version <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-r2r-resistor-ladder-d-a-converter/">here</a>) but it is easy to make your own using discrete resistors; the least-significant is connected to GPIO8 (SD0), and the most-significant to GPIO15 (SD7).</p>



<h4>Software</h4>



<p>I’ll be making extensive use of the dma_utils functions that were created for my previous DMA projects, but before diving into the complication of SMI, it is helpful to test the hardware using simpler GPIO commands:</p>


<pre title="">#define DAC_D0_PIN      8
#define DAC_NPINS       8

extern MEM_MAP gpio_regs;
map_periph(&amp;gpio_regs, (void *)GPIO_BASE, PAGE_SIZE);

// Output value to resistor DAC (without SMI)
void dac_ladder_write(int val)
{
    *REG32(gpio_regs, GPIO_SET0) = (val &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; DAC_D0_PIN;
    *REG32(gpio_regs, GPIO_CLR0) = (~val &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; DAC_D0_PIN;
}

// Initialise resistor DAC
void dac_ladder_init(void)
{
    int i;
    
    for (i=0; i&lt;DAC_NPINS; i++)
        gpio_mode(DAC_D0_PIN+i, GPIO_OUT);
}

// Output sawtooth waveform
dac_ladder_init();
while (1)
{
    i = (i + 1) % 256;
    dac_ladder_write(i);
    usleep(10);
}
</pre>


<p>This is less-than-ideal because we have to use one command to set some I/O pins to 1, and another command to clear the rest to 0, so in the gap between them the I/O state will be incorrect; also we won’t get accurate timing with the usleep command.</p>



<p>To my surprise, when I ran this code on a Pi Zero, and viewed the output on an oscilloscope, it didn’t look too bad; however, as soon as I moved the mouse, there were very significant gaps in the output, so clearly we need to do better.</p>



<h4>SMI register definitions</h4>



<p>To use SMI, we first need to define the control registers, and the bit-values within them. The primary reference is bcm2835_smi.h from the Broadcom external memory driver, but I found this difficult to use in my code, so converted the definitions into C bitfields; this makes the code a bit less portable, but a lot simpler and easier to read.</p>



<p>Also, when learning about a new peripheral, it is helpful if the bitfield values can be printed on the console. This normally requires the tedious copying of register field names into string constants, but with a small amount of macro processing, this can be done with a single definition, for example the SMI CS register:</p>


<pre title="">#define REG_DEF(name, fields) typedef union {struct {volatile uint32_t fields;}; volatile uint32_t value;} name

#define SMI_CS_FIELDS \
    enable:1, done:1, active:1, start:1, clear:1, write:1, _x1:2,\
    teen:1, intd:1, intt:1, intr:1, pvmode:1, seterr:1, pxldat:1, edreq:1,\
    _x2:8, _x3:1, aferr:1, txw:1, rxr:1, txd:1, rxd:1, txe:1, rxf:1  
REG_DEF(SMI_CS_REG, SMI_CS_FIELDS);

volatile SMI_CS_REG  *smi_cs;

smi_cs  = (SMI_CS_REG *) REG32(smi_regs, SMI_CS);
</pre>


<p>The last bit of code is needed so that smi_cs points to the register in virtual memory; if you don’t understand why, I suggest you read my post on RPi DMA programming <a href="https://iosoft.blog/raspberry-pi-dma-programming/">here</a>. Anyway, the upshot of all this code is that we can access the whole 32-bit value of the register as smi_cs-&gt;value, and also individual bits such as smi_cs-&gt;enable, smi_cs-&gt;done, etc.</p>



<p>To print out the bit values, we use macros to convert the register definition to a string, then have a simple C parser:</p>


<pre title="">#define STRS(x)     STRS_(x) ","
#define STRS_(...)  #__VA_ARGS__

char *smi_cs_regstrs = STRS(SMI_CS_FIELDS);

// Display bit values in register
void disp_reg_fields(char *regstrs, char *name, uint32_t val)
{
    char *p=regstrs, *q, *r=regstrs;
    uint32_t nbits, v;
    
    printf("%s %08X", name, val);
    while ((q = strchr(p, ':')) != 0)
    {
        p = q + 1;
        nbits = 0;
        while (*p&gt;='0' &amp;&amp; *p&lt;='9')
            nbits = nbits * 10 + *p++ - '0';
        v = val &amp; ((1 &lt;&lt; nbits) - 1);
        val &gt;&gt;= nbits;
        if (v &amp;&amp; *r!='_')
            printf(" %.*s=%X", q-r, r, v);
        while (*p==',' || *p==' ')
            p = r = p + 1;
    }
    printf("\n");
}
</pre>


<p>Now we can display all the non-zero bit values using:</p>


<pre title="">disp_reg_fields(smi_cs_regstrs, "CS", *REG32(smi_regs, SMI_CS));
</pre>


<p>..which produces a display like..</p>


<pre title="">CS 54000025 enable=1 active=1 write=1 txw=1 txd=1 txe=1
</pre>


<h4>SMI registers</h4>



<p>The SMI registers are:</p>


<pre title="">CS:  control and status
L:   data length (number of transfers)
A:   address and device number
D:   data FIFO
DMC: DMA control
DSR: device settings for read
DSW: device settings for write
DCS: direct control and status
DCA: direct control address and device number
DCD: direct control data
</pre>


<p>You can specify up to 4 unique timing settings for read &amp; write, making 8 settings in total. The settings are specified by giving a 2-bit device number for each transaction; this selects 1 of the 4 descriptors for read or write. I’ve only used one pair of settings, and the ADC &amp; DAC don’t have address lines, so the address &amp; device register remains at zero.</p>



<p>Direct mode is a simple way of doing accesses using the appropriate timings, but without DMA; it has separate address, data and control registers.</p>



<p>Some notable fields in the control &amp; status register are:</p>



<p><strong>Enable</strong>: it is obvious that this bit must be set for SMI to work, but it is less obvious when that should be done. Initially, I assumed it was necessary to enable the interface before any other initialisation, but then it responded with the ‘settings error’ bit set. So now I do most of the configuration with the device disabled, then enable it before clearing the FIFOs and enabling DMA, otherwise the transfers go through immediately.</p>



<p><strong>Start</strong>: set this bit to start the transfer; the SMI controller will perform the number of transfers in the length register, using the timing parameters specified in DSR (for read) or DSW (for write). If there is a backlog of data (FIFO is full) the transaction may stall.</p>



<p><strong>Pxldat</strong>: when this ‘pixel data’ bit is set, the 8- or 16-bit data is packed into 32-bit words.</p>



<p><strong>Pvmode</strong>: I have no idea what this ‘pixel valve’ mode should do; any information would be gratefully received.</p>



<h4>Direct Mode</h4>



<p>As the name implies, SMI Direct Mode allows you to perform a single I/O transfer without DMA. However, it is still necessary to specify the timing parameters of the transfer, specifically:</p>



<ul><li>The clock period, that will be used for the following timing:<ul><li>The setup time, that is used by the peripheral to decode the address value</li><li>The width of the strobe pulse, that triggers the transfer</li><li>The hold time, that keeps the signals stable after the transfer</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>To add to the complication, the SMI controller can drive 4 peripheral devices, each with its own individual read &amp; write settings, so there are a total of 8 timing registers. I’m keeping this simple by always using the first register pair (for device zero) but it is worth remembering that you can define more than one set of timings, and quickly switch between them by setting the device number.</p>



<p>Likewise, I’m ignoring the address field since it is also redundant for my DAC; for safety, I clear all the SMI registers on startup, in case there are any residual unwanted values.</p>



<p>As it happens, this setup/strobe/hold timing is largely redundant for our simple resistor DAC (since it doesn’t latch the data) but we still need to specify something, for example if we want the overall cycle time to be 1 microsecond, this can be achieved with a clock period of 10 nanoseconds, setup 25, strobe 50, and hold 25, since (25 + 50 + 25) * 10 = 1000 nanoseconds. This is the code I use to set the timing:</p>


<pre title="">// Width values
#define SMI_8_BITS  0
#define SMI_16_BITS 1
#define SMI_18_BITS 2
#define SMI_9_BITS  3

// Initialise SMI interface, given time step, and setup/hold/strobe counts
// Clock period is in nanoseconds: even numbers, 2 to 30
void …</pre></div></article></div>

          <article>
            <p>I've met some hugely successful people. Some of them are happy. Some of them... aren't. I've noticed some things about the ones who aren't:</p>

<ul>
<li>They're obsessed with their careers</li>
<li>They spend a lot of time at work</li>
<li>They aren't fulfilled by the work they do</li>
<li>They aren't content with what they have</li>
</ul>

<p>In many circles, these people are way more successful than most of us. They probably have better networks. They might have fancier job titles. They certainly make more money.</p>

<p>The Silicon Valley meme goes, "start a company and sell it for so much money that you can say 'f*ck you' to anyone in the world." Or maybe an alternate career path is to climb the corporate ladder at Google until you've banked that privilege.</p>

<p><strong>So much toxic bullshit stems from that line of thinking.</strong></p>

<p>I'd rather have f*ck-that money—e.g., a moderate amount of money that empowers you to live a meaningful life. F*ck-that money isn't about being a pretentious asshole; it's about keeping your priorities straight. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Miss your kid's soccer practice to catch up on emails? F*ck that!</li>
<li>Power through lunch? F*ck that!</li>
<li>Skip the gym? F*ck that!</li>
<li>Work over the weekend? F*ck that!</li>
<li>Save that side project for when you have more free time? F*ck that!</li>
<li>You get the idea...</li>
</ul>

<p>At Honeybadger, this mindset has led us to turn down acquisition offers and investors—to stay small and grow naturally. We're not in this business to be rich; we're in it to be free.</p>

<p>Regret the best years of our lives?</p>

<p><strong>Fuck that.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong><em>Giving organizations and security engineers total control over their data</em></strong></p><p><strong>By: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rrleighton">Russell Leighton</a></strong></p><div><p>At its core, <a href="https://github.com/panther-labs/panther">Panther</a> is a data-driven platform that needs to store, manipulate, and query huge amounts of data to help answer important security questions.</p><p>In this blog, I’ll explain how we chose our datastore and why we took the bold step of <strong>fully</strong> opening it to customers. I’ll also share how Panther's open data infrastructure integrates with third-party applications and services. You’ll discover how this leads to improved security and transparency, and why we believe that data should never be trapped in a security platform.</p></div><h2 id="how-panther-processes-data">How Panther Processes Data</h2><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qFWoR_ckqNeDGC4aTvkJGLfqT7y_4cTzrXGYKLtuWMOs5Mk-MztbVXbHDqCPcDiwrtOsQTkOIjua2yqzRMWqRmCJkeHeOn87C9IHiKCRquouC-jXBiAB79WGNLI5NDEpErf7Xitt" alt=""></figure><p>One of Panther's core components is a log processing sub-system which takes raw logs and converts them into structured events that can be analyzed with <a href="https://docs.runpanther.io/log-analysis/rules">Python rules</a>. This system parses, normalizes, and extracts indicators (like IP addresses) from a <a href="https://docs.runpanther.io/log-analysis/supported-logs">variety of security data sources</a> like CloudTrail, Osquery, Okta, Suricata, and more. When rules are triggered by suspicious activity, alerts are generated and dispatched to destinations like Slack or PagerDuty. </p><p>The processed log data and all events related to an alert are stored and made searchable via SQL in a serverless Data Lake. This Data Lake is fully open and available to users of our system to enable post-processing, visualizations, training machine learning models, or anything else desired.</p><h2 id="a-modern-database-architecture">A Modern Database Architecture</h2><p>To keep up with cloud-scale data demands, small security teams need to scale very quickly. <a href="https://runpanther.io/">Panther</a> is built on a fully serverless architecture, that enables higher scale, more flexibility, and quicker time-to-value than traditional on-premises applications. The choice of database should be consistent with this architecture.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SNAA5Y78k_5086xMXptPQja60Fq_ThGxm8LOiM7RIojSNsu5ia6pj32QsTz2tvjBZQhwfyKPmh2Y3f1TvJOGTQF5c4k7xt2tZgKmwe42Wd9uzDjzYyg_JH84vQlkDM5jouTLczHM" alt=""></figure><h3 id="database-as-a-service">Database as a Service</h3><p>We designed Panther to be fundamentally serverless to offer customers automatic scaling, lower operational load, lower cost, better security, and easier deployment. Being serverless also impacted our database decision because <strong>we do not want to manage any database servers</strong>! Therefore, our database must be exposed as a managed service.</p><h3 id="storage-decoupled-from-compute">Storage Decoupled from Compute</h3><p>Panther is a security data processing platform, which means huge volumes of data are expected to be processed and retained for long periods of time. For example, it’s not uncommon to consume 2-5TB of data per day and store that data for up to 3 years. To handle this heavy workload, Panther’s database must be extremely scalable. </p><p><strong>Decoupling storage from computation</strong> is the only way to achieve the scale needed to operate in a cloud-first world where data volumes continue to grow. This means data storage is not local to the compute nodes, but remote on the network. Remote storage adds latency to queries, but it allows the storage size to grow independently of the compute nodes which is incredibly important for security applications that need to retain petabytes of data that span years.</p><p>In contrast, if your database storage is local to your compute nodes, then to add storage capacity, more compute nodes must be added. This is expensive and wasteful when the usage is primarily historical data because compute nodes must be added simply to increase storage capacity when they are not needed for query speed. In addition, the more compute nodes that are added, the more operational burden it is to maintain patching and to replace failing nodes.</p><p>One way organizations work around this pain is by limiting the volume of security data they ingest, either in the form of low retention or filtering for only the most valuable data. These difficult tradeoffs significantly hinder the security team’s ability to effectively detect, investigate, and remediate security incidents.</p><p>You might ask: “You already decided that you want to use a database as a service. If the vendor manages the database, why do you care if storage is decoupled from compute?” The reason is that while the operational burden is removed by using the service, the underlying problems have <em>not</em> been resolved. The users of the service still suffer from excessive costs and data capacity issues--just ask anyone who’s had to resize a big Redshift cluster. Once storage is decoupled from compute, these issues simply disappear. In addition, new capabilities are now possible like running multiple query clusters concurrently and having other tools access the storage.</p><h3 id="support-for-complex-objects">Support for Complex Objects</h3><p>Security data is complex. The days of simple rows and columns with scalar values are gone. Today’s security data often originates as complex objects that express rich relationships necessary for answering critical security questions. <strong>Our database must</strong> <strong>support complex objects such as arrays, maps, and structs</strong>. A well-known example is AWS CloudTrail data which is composed of many complex elements, for example:</p><pre><code>{
  "Records": [
    {
      "eventVersion": "1.0",
      "userIdentity": {
        "type": "IAMUser",
        "principalId": "EX_PRINCIPAL_ID",
        "arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Alice",
        "accessKeyId": "EXAMPLE_KEY_ID",
        "accountId": "123456789012",
        "userName": "Alice"
      },
      "eventTime": "2014-03-06T21:22:54Z",
      "eventSource": "ec2.amazonaws.com",
      "eventName": "StartInstances",
      "awsRegion": "us-east-2",
      "sourceIPAddress": "205.251.233.176",
      "userAgent": "ec2-api-tools 1.6.12.2"
    }
  ]
}</code></pre><p>In particular, take note of the complex <em>userIdentity</em> attribute which is very useful for answering security questions concerning “who” was responsible for an activity. <strong>A security application database needs to be able to represent such data and allow efficient searching and element extraction</strong>.</p><h2 id="making-a-decision">Making a Decision</h2><p>Given the important qualities we require for a database, Panther chose to initially support two options which may be used interchangeably in the backend: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html">AWS Athena</a> and <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a>. </p><p><strong>Security products commonly keep their choice of database engine proprietary and hidden from users</strong> (but if you ask, most use Elasticsearch which is neither serverless, nor does it separate storage from compute). Customer interaction with data only happens using the product’s UI or APIs, which allows vendors to:</p><ul><li>Change datastores and internal representations without impacting customers.</li><li>Abstract the underlying technology which might be proprietary and offer competitive advantages.</li></ul><p><strong>Panther decided not to follow this path.</strong></p><p>As an open security product, it was important to us that customers always had the ability to customize our platform to fit their needs and integrate with other systems. Let’s dig deeper into why opening up our data infrastructure has such a valuable impact on the usability of our system.</p><h3 id="enriching-security-data-with-business-context">Enriching Security Data with Business Context</h3><p>Allowing customer access to Panther’s database improves overall security. </p><p>Providing relevant context for security analytics is the key to successfully utilizing security data. For example, the normal behavior of a salesperson is very different from a system administrator. Distinguishing the activity of a salesperson from a system administrator could be important if the activity involved the salesperson logging into production servers (very suspicious!). </p><p>A customer typically has internal mappings (e.g., Active Directory data) to label a user id as a salesperson or a system administrator for business reasons. By exposing the core database, customers can join their internal data (which has the user’s job role) to the security data (which likely only has &nbsp;the user’s id) to provide the needed context to disposition events.</p><p>While contextualizing security data with customer business data makes the data more relevant, the compliment is also true. Processed security data can add value to core business analytics by supplying information about user activity and cloud infrastructure to improve efficiency and reduce costs.</p><h3 id="open-integrations-and-partner-ecosystems">Open Integrations and Partner Ecosystems</h3><p>Panther has a beautiful user interface that makes it easy for security teams to customize detections, triage alerts, baseline behaviors, and investigate incidents. However, our customers often need to answer very particular questions about their security posture and infrastructure that is outside the scope of what we offer in our UI today. Exposing the datastore allows customers to use their existing business intelligence (BI) tools without any special integrations.This allows customers to create their own rich graphs, metrics, and reports to communicate to stakeholders the state of the organization’s security posture. </p><p>In addition, some teams also have significant investments in existing data processing technologies. Rather than forcing them to replace a datastore, using a shared datastore enables easy integration. Notebooks are particularly popular for Security Engineers to implement customized threat hunting. For example, see: <a href="https://posts.specterops.io/threat-hunting-with-jupyter-notebooks-part-1-your-first-notebook-9a99a781fde7">“Threat Hunting with Jupyter Notebooks— Part 1: Your First Notebook”</a>. Customers can integrate <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter </a>and <a href="https://zeppelin.apache.org/">Zeppelin</a> notebooks as well as <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark </a>systems with Panther data by using the AWS Glue catalog, and there are ways to easily <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/quickstart-guide-for-sagemaker-snowflake-part-one/">connect Snowflake as well</a>. </p><p>It is also very common to have in-house security workflows that are very particular to the customer’s business and data. These must (by definition) be implemented <em>by the customer</em>. Having easy access to the common datastore allows these workflows to query back into the database to retrieve critical data. An example of this is a mitigation workflow that is triggered by a Panther alert of suspicious activity. The workflow reaches back into the datastore to collect data identifying the employee and circumstances from <strong>both </strong>the processed security data and the business-related data. Using this information, the mitigation then restricts access accordingly (e.g., using the SSO API to revoke an access token) and notifies the employee’s manager and the security organization.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this post, which can be read as a follow up to our <a href="https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-without-getting-blocked">ultimate web scraping guide</a>, we will cover almost all the tools Python offers you to web scrape. We will go from the more basic to the most advanced one and will cover the pros and cons of each. Of course, we won't be able to cover all aspect of every tool we discuss, but this post should be enough to have a good idea of which tools does what, and when to use which.</p>
<p><em>Note: when I talk about Python in this blog post you should assume that I talk about Python3.</em></p>
<h2 id="0-web-fundamentals">0. Web Fundamentals</h2>
<p>The internet is <strong>really complex</strong>: there are many underlying technologies and concepts involved to view a simple web page in your browser. I don’t have the pretension to explain everything, but I will show you the most important things you have to understand in order to extract data from the web.</p>
<h3 id="hypertext-transfer-protocol">HyperText Transfer Protocol</h3>
<p>HTTP uses a <strong>client/server</strong> model, where an HTTP client (A browser, your Python program, curl, Requests…) opens a connection and sends a message (“I want to see that page : /product”)to an HTTP server (Nginx, Apache…).</p>
<p>Then the server answers with a response (The HTML code for example) and closes the connection. HTTP is called a stateless protocol, because each transaction (request/response) is independent. FTP for example, is stateful.</p>
<p>Basically, when you type a website address in your browser, the HTTP request looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">GET /product/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q<span>=</span>0.9,image/web<span>\
</span><span></span>p,*/*;q<span>=</span>0.8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch, br
Connection: keep-alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 <span>(</span>Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6<span>)</span> AppleWebKit<span>\
</span><span></span>/537.36 <span>(</span>KHTML, like Gecko<span>)</span> Chrome/56.0.2924.87 Safari/537.36
</code></pre></div><p>In the first line of this request, you can see multiples things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the GET verb or method being used, meaning we request data from the specific path: <code>/product/</code>.There are other HTTP verbs, you can see the full list <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp">here</a>.</li>
<li>The version of the HTTP protocol, in this tutorial we will focus on HTTP 1.</li>
<li>Multiple headers fields</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the most important header fields :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Host:</strong> The domain name of the server, if no port number is given, is assumed to be <strong>80</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>User-Agent:</strong> Contains information about the client originating the request, including the OS information. In this case, it is my web-browser (Chrome), on OSX. This header is important because it is either used for statistics (How many users visit my website on Mobile vs Desktop) or to prevent any violations by bots. Because these headers are sent by the clients, it can be modified (it is called “Header Spoofing”), and that is exactly what we will do with our scrapers, to make our scrapers look like a normal web browser.</li>
<li><strong>Accept:</strong> The content types that are acceptable as a response. There are lots of different content types and sub-types: <strong>text/plain, text/html, image/jpeg, application/json</strong> …</li>
<li><strong>Cookie</strong> : name1=value1;name2=value2… This header field contains a list of name-value pairs. It is called session cookies, these are used to store data. Cookies are what websites use to authenticate users, and/or store data in your browser. For example, when you fill a login form, the server will check if the credentials you entered are correct, if so, it will redirect you and inject a session cookie in your browser. Your browser will then send this cookie with every subsequent request to that server.</li>
<li><strong>Referrer</strong>: The Referrer header contains the URL from which the actual URL has been requested. This header is important because websites use this header to change their behavior based on where the user came from. For example, lots of news websites have a paying subscription and let you view only 10% of a post, but if the user came from a news aggregator like Reddit, they let you view the full content. They use the referrer to check this. Sometimes we will have to spoof this header to get to the content we want to extract.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the list goes on…you can find the full header list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">here</a>.</p>
<p>A server will respond with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu) Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt; ...[HTML CODE]
</code></pre><p>On the first line, we have a new piece of information, the HTTP code <code>200 OK</code>. It means the request has succeeded. As for the request headers, there are lots of HTTP codes, split into four common classes, 2XX for successful requests, 3XX for redirects, 4XX for bad requests (the most famous being 404 Not found), and 5XX for server errors.</p>
<p>Then, in case you are sending this HTTP request with your web browser, the browser will parse the HTML code, fetch all the eventual assets (Javascript files, CSS files, images…) and it will render the result into the main window.</p>
<p>In the next parts we will see the different ways to perform HTTP requests with Python and extract the data we want from the responses.</p>
<h2 id="1-manually-opening-a-socket-and-sending-the-http-request">1. Manually opening a socket and sending the HTTP request</h2>
<h3 id="socket">Socket</h3>
<p>The most basic way to perform an HTTP request in Python is to open a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html">socket</a> and manually send the HTTP request.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> socket

HOST <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>www.google.com</span><span>'</span>  <span># Server hostname or IP address</span>
PORT <span>=</span> <span>80</span>        <span># Port</span>

client_socket <span>=</span> socket<span>.</span>socket(socket<span>.</span>AF_INET, socket<span>.</span>SOCK_STREAM)
server_address <span>=</span> (HOST, PORT)
client_socket<span>.</span>connect(server_address)

request_header <span>=</span> <span>b</span><span>'</span><span>GET / HTTP/1.0</span><span>\r</span><span>\n</span><span>Host: www.google.com</span><span>\r</span><span>\n</span><span>\r</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>
client_socket<span>.</span>sendall(request_header)

response <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>'</span>
<span>while</span> True:
    recv <span>=</span> client_socket<span>.</span>recv(<span>1024</span>)
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> recv:
        <span>break</span>
    response <span>+</span><span>=</span> str(recv)

<span>print</span>(response)
client_socket<span>.</span>close()  
</code></pre></div><p>Now that we have the HTTP response, the most basic way to extract data from it is to use regular expressions.</p>
<h3 id="regular-expressions">Regular Expressions</h3>
<p>A regular expression (RE, or Regex) is a search pattern for strings. With regex, you can search for a particular character/word inside a bigger body of text.</p>
<p>For example, you could identify all phone numbers inside a web page. You can also replace items, for example, you could replace all uppercase tag in a poorly formatted HTML by lowercase ones. You can also validate some inputs …</p>
<p>The pattern used by the regex is applied from left to right. Each source character is only used once. You may be wondering why it is important to know about regular expressions when doing web scraping?</p>
<p>After all, there is all kind of different Python module to parse HTML, with XPath, CSS selectors.</p>
<p>In an ideal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic world,</a> data is easily machine-readable, the information is embedded inside relevant HTML element, with meaningful attributes.</p>
<p>But the real world is messy, you will often find huge amounts of text inside a p element. When you want to extract a specific data inside this huge text, for example, a price, a date, a name… you will have to use regular expressions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Here is a great website to test your regex: <a href="https://regex101.com/"></a><a href="https://regex101.com/">https://regex101.com/</a> and <a href="https://www.rexegg.com/">one awesome blog</a> to learn more about them, this post will only cover a small fraction of what you can do with regexp.</p>
<p>Regular expressions can be useful when you have this kind of data:</p>
<p>We could select this text node with an Xpath expression, and then use this kind of regex to extract the price :</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">    <span>^</span>Price\s:\s(\d<span>+</span>\<span>.</span>\d{<span>2</span>})\<span>$</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To extract the text inside an HTML tag, it is annoying to use a regex, but doable:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> re

html_content <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;p&gt;Price : 19.99$&lt;/p&gt;</span><span>'</span>

m <span>=</span> re<span>.</span>match(<span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;p&gt;(.+)&lt;</span><span>\</span><span>/p&gt;</span><span>'</span>, html_content)
<span>if</span> m:
	<span>print</span>(m<span>.</span>group(<span>1</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, manually sending the HTTP request with a socket, and parsing the response with regular expression can be done, but it's complicated and there are higher-level API that can make this task easier.</p>
<h2 id="2-urllib3--lxml">2. urllib3 &amp; LXML</h2>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: It is easy to get lost in the urllib universe in Python. You have urllib and urllib2 that are parts of the standard lib. You can also find urllib3. urllib2 was split in multiple modules in Python 3, and urllib3 should not be a part of the standard lib anytime soon. This whole confusing thing will be the subject of a blog post by itself. In this part, I've made the choice to only talk about urllib3 as it is used widely in the Python world, by Pip and requests to name only them.</p>
<p>Urllib3 is a high-level package that allows you to do pretty much whatever you want with an HTTP request. It allows doing what we did above with socket with way fewer lines of code.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> urllib3
http <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>PoolManager()
r <span>=</span> http<span>.</span>request(<span></span><span>'</span><span>GET</span><span>'</span>, <span></span><span>'</span><span>http://www.google.com</span><span>'</span>)
<span>print</span>(r<span>.</span>data)
</code></pre></div><p>Much more concise than the socket version. Not only that, but the API is straightforward and you can do many things easily, like adding HTTP headers, using a proxy, POSTing forms …</p>
<p>For example, had we decide to set some headers and to use a proxy,
we would only have to do this (you can learn more about proxy servers at <a href="https://www.bestproxyreviews.com/proxy-server/">bestproxyreviews.com</a>)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> urllib3
user_agent_header <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>make_headers(user_agent<span>=</span><span></span><span>"</span><span>&lt;USER AGENT&gt;</span><span>"</span>)
pool <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>ProxyManager(f<span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;PROXY IP&gt;</span><span>'</span>, headers<span>=</span>user_agent_header)
r <span>=</span> pool<span>.</span>request(<span></span><span>'</span><span>GET</span><span>'</span>, <span></span><span>'</span><span>https://www.google.com/</span><span>'</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>See? Exactly the same number of line, however, there are some things that urllib3 does not handle very easily, for example, if we want to add a cookie, we have to manually create the corresponding headers and add it to the request.</p>
<p>There are also things that urllib3 can do that requsts can't, creation and management of pool and proxy pool, control of retry strategy for example.</p>
<p>To put in simply, urllib3 is between requests and socket in terms of abstraction, although way closer to requests than socket.</p>
<p>This time, to parse the response, we are going to use the lxml package and XPath expressions.</p>
<h3 id="xpath">XPath</h3>
<p>Xpath is a technology that uses path expressions to select nodes or node- sets in an XML document (or HTML document). As with the Document Object Model, Xpath is a W3C standard since 1999. Even if Xpath is not a programming language in itself, it allows you to write expression that can access directly to a specific node, or a specific node-set, without having to go through the entire HTML tree (or XML tree).</p>
<p>Think of XPath as …</p></div></div>

</p>
<section>
<div><p>A great many file sharing solutions have come and gone over the years. While they may differ in technology or branding, the reasons for their downfall are generally consistent. Hosting user content is challenging for three primary reasons:</p><figure><img src="https://thoughts.willcipriano.com/content/images/2020/08/dead_filesharing_services.gif" alt="The graveyard of file sharing."><figcaption>The graveyard of file sharing.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="1useruploadedcontentandthelongtailofpopularity">1. User-uploaded content and the long tail of popularity</h2>
<p>My guess is the median number of views for a given image uploaded to the average image host is less than two, and one of those is the original uploader. This low engagement makes storage expensive; for every image that goes viral and produces a net return (say, via advertising), thousands are stored and never retrieved.</p>
<h2 id="2usersuploadcontentthattheyshouldnt">2. Users upload content that they shouldn't</h2>
<p>User content can be a ticking timebomb of legal liability. Identifying the misuse of copyrights and trademarks requires human moderators who are experts in illegal content, if not a full legal team. Responding to DMCA takedown requests can be a full-time job.</p>
<h2 id="3peertopeersolutionsmagnifythelongtailproblem">3. Peer-to-peer solutions magnify the long tail problem</h2>
<p>While peer-to-peer mostly solves the illegal content liability problem, the long tail problem is compounded by peer-to-peer solutions. If nobody is interested in the content, nobody bothers to download it and serve it to other peers.</p>
<h2 id="ahumbleattemptatasolution">A humble attempt at a solution</h2>
<p>I’ve thought about these flaws for some time, and finally decided to test the waters with a new solution. <a href="https://podje.li/">Podjeli</a> is a file-sharing service that isn't peer-to-peer and doesn't host any files. How can you share files that haven't been stored? When someone shares a file with Podjeli, the file is compressed, chunked into small bits, and stored as query strings in a series of URLs that are then prepared as markdown, HTML, or simply made ready to be copied and pasted.</p>
<h2 id="techstack">Tech Stack</h2>
<p>Podjeli is a JavaScript application, and all the work, from URL generation to recombination, happens in the browser. It uses <a href="https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string">lz-string</a> for compression and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/javascript/">Bootstrap</a> as the UI framework. File parts are sent as query strings appended to the URLs that are generated. Cloudflare ignores these query strings—they simply serve the same page over and over for each part, and the JavaScript does the work of loading the file parts into local storage until they can be reassembled later. Due to the limitations of local storage, only files that are 5 megabytes or smaller can be reassembled, but a file that large would result in tens of thousands of URLs, so that is an unlikely scenario.</p>

<h2 id="storefilesanywhereyoucanstoreurls">Store files anywhere you can store URLs</h2>
<p>Podjeli opens up some brand-new doors. For example, you can store one or more URLs anywhere, and you can also store an arbitrary file. Social media sites, forums, and comment sections are an obvious choice, but you should also consider things like firewall access logs or your browser’s history.</p>
<p>Similarly, the browser favorites menu offers some amusing possibilities for InfoSec red teams attempting to exfiltrate information. By favoriting a list of Podjeli URLs and allowing them to sync via Chrome favorites, those files could be copied offsite relatively undetected.</p>
<h2 id="urlshortenerspodjelismallerfiles">URL Shorteners + Podjeli = Smaller Files</h2>
<p>The consequences of Podjeli used in conjunction with URL shorteners are interesting. For example, when I took Lorem Ipsum and put it in a plain text file, it weighed in at 445 bytes. I ran that through Podjeli and created two URLs, shortened with <a href="https://tinyurl.com/">TinyURL</a>. Then I took those two shortened URLs and placed them in a file. The new file was 58 bytes for a savings of 86.96%. That is in line with the <a href="https://www.maximumcompression.com/data/text.php">best English text compression available</a>.</p>
<p>The difference is even more significant with larger files. I took the same Lorem Ipsum and copied it 25 times in a text file, uploaded it to Podjeli, and created 27 URLs. From there, I ran each URL through TinyURL and saved those to a file. In this test, I went from 10900 bytes to 808. That brings the compression ratio up to 92.59%. I knew I could do a little better—I took the file containing the TinyURL URLs and ran that through Podjeli, chose the “save as text file” option, and enabled compression. The resulting zip file is 758 bytes for an effectively lossless compression ratio of 93.05%.</p>
<h2 id="athoughtexperiment">A thought experiment</h2>
<p>Podjeli hosts no user files, but in a philosophical sense, it hosts all possible files. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation">According to some interpretations of Multiverse theory</a>, versions of myself have created Podjeli a infinite number of times. In theory, many of those implantations would be compatible with one another, so that a URL generated in another universe would be able to be decoded in our current one.</p>
<figure><img src="https://thoughts.willcipriano.com/content/images/2020/08/will_cipriano_podjeli_multiverse.jpg"><figcaption>Podjeli across the multiverse.</figcaption></figure><p>It has also been postulated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch">David Deutsch</a> that quantum computation is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Nothing less than a distinctly new way of harnessing nature, it will be the first technology that allows useful tasks to be performed in collaboration between parallel universes, and then sharing the results.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming Deutsch is correct, if someone in an alternate universe creates a file containing the cure for cancer or zero-point energy and we had access to a <a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Earth">planet-sized supercomputer in the vein of Doug Adams</a> we could brute force Podjeli URLs until we discover these files. Of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">this is nothing new</a>, however I find the concept of sharing files over some sort of multiverse internet intriguing.</p>
<h2 id="finalthoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, Podjeli was a project that I wanted to create in order to scratch an itch of mine. I used Bootstrap and jQuery because I am familiar with those tools and they have excellent backwards compatibility. However, going forward, I will probably use something like React and Typescript. In a way, this was my goodbye to the web development tools I cut my teeth on. Bootstrap, it’s been real—see you around.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>I made a mistake: I bought an electric car. EV articles I have read on Hacker News and Reddit didn’t prepare me for a dozen EV infrastructure problems in my part of the EU. Anecdotes below explain lessons I learned the hard way.</em></p><p>When I see a cool new gadget, my rationality goes away. I tell myself, “Don’t buy another device that will somehow be discharged when you need it,” but to no avail. The siren call would sing, “It has USB-C!” until my wallet opens wider than the Spielberg’s “Jaws”.</p><p>This time, the siren call was a government incentive of 10,600 EUR ($12,100) for a new electric vehicle purchase. “Great,” I thought, “I need to replace my old car.” My experience of driving electric car-shares in Oxford and Berlin was great. So, I purchased a 1.5-ton gadget, with no USB-C ports included, called <a href="https://ev-database.org/car/1204/Hyundai-Kona-Electric-64-kWh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyundai Kona EV</a>:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small.jpg"><img title="Hyundai Kona EV, Credits: https://ev-database.org/car/1204/Hyundai-Kona-Electric-64-kWh" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-1024x540.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="308" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-1024x540.jpg 1024w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-300x158.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-768x405.jpg 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-500x264.jpg 500w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small.jpg 1179w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></a></p><p>Why not a Tesla Model 3, you ask? Fun fact: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nikola Tesla</a> was a naming inspiration for both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tesla cars</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Corporation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nikola trucks</a>. Tesla was an ethnic Serbian born in present-day Croatia, but you can’t officially buy a Tesla or Nikola vehicle in Croatia (where I live) or Serbia. Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1176190550854127616?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted his hope to open sales in the region early in 2020</a>, but as of August 2020 that didn’t happen.</p><p>First, the good parts: as soon as I picked up my car in Zagreb, Croatia, I was impressed. EVs are so quiet that EU law requires they produce a buzzing sound when going slower than 30 km/h. Acceleration is instant; torque is strong enough, even in Eco mode, to make tires scream if I pushed the “gas” pedal too fast. There are no vibrations and no jerking when the car shifts gears. EVs use regenerative breaking, again completely silent. EV charging is currently free in Croatia, and depending on rainfall, <a href="http://mecometer.com/whats/croatia/electricity-production-by-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44% of that electricity is carbon-free</a>. I was in love with the car.</p><p>The first weekend I drove with a group of friends to a <a href="https://www.toastmasters.org/leadership-central/speech-contests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toastmaster’s competition</a> in Ljubljana, Slovenia, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/A1tH92uEFXTUHuu96" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">143 km from Zagreb</a> (83 mi). Kona EV with 64 kWh battery has a declared range of 450 km (280 mi), so even with 90% battery, I had enough for a round trip. So I thought. I soon learned the first lesson:</p><p><em>#1: EVs have <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a31898441/study-ev-winter-range-loss-averages-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20% shorter range</a> in cold weather.</em></p><p>It was November. But still, 450 x 90% x 0.8 = 324 km, round trip is 286 km, we were good. While driving 130 km/h on a highway (80mph, a legal limit), I noticed my range dropping significantly. The car specs sheet lied in the worst possible way: they were technically correct. High torque: true. Range of 450 km: true. But:</p><p><em>#2: EVs can’t deliver both performance and declared range at the same time, you need to choose one.</em></p><p>I had the wrong intuition that cars have a longer range on the highway than in the city. That is true for gas cars because gas cars are extremely inefficient in cities. All cylinders are running, swallowing gas when accelerating, and that kinetic energy is lost when braking. As EVs use only the energy needed and recuperate that energy when breaking, they really have a declared range when driving in the city. When driving fast, EV range shortens because <a href="https://www.softschools.com/formulas/physics/air_resistance_formula/85/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">air resistance is proportional to the square of speed</a>. Gas engines are more efficient when all cylinders are firing at constant, high RPMs. As a result, gas cars have a <a href="https://www.mpgforspeed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximum range at speeds of 89-97 km/h (55-60 mph)</a>. EVs have a maximum range at <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2018/07/15/tesla-range-plotted-relative-to-speed-temperature-graphs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around 55 km/h (35 mph)</a>, and range falls linearly as you drive faster. For example, this is the range decrease for Tesla Model S, depending on speed and temperature:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande.png"><img title="Tesla Model S100 range vs speed vs temperature, Credits: https://cleantechnica.com/2018/07/15/tesla-range-plotted-relative-to-speed-temperature-graphs/" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande.png" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande.png 600w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande-300x225.png 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande-400x300.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p>As I slowed down, the estimated range increased. Unfortunately, part of the highway was closed for construction, and we needed to take a detour. The round trip just got longer, so I decided to park at the EV charging place. But, it was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_connector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Type 2 AC charger</a>, meaning another lesson was coming:</p><p><em>#3: To charge at Type 2 AC plugs in the EU, you need to bring your cable.</em></p><p>Of course, I had none. Fast chargers I used before had attached cables, and I was wondering what was the point of <a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kona-EV-Charging-Auto-Lock.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the cable lock button on Hyundai Kona</a>? It is there because:</p><p><em>#4: Lock your <a href="https://www.evexpert.eu/p/338/duosida-charging-cable-type2-type2-32a-3phase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">230 EUR Type 2 cable</a> if you don’t want it stolen.</em></p><p>Between event sessions, I was Googling “fast EV chargers in Slovenia.” Highway stops by “Petrol” had them, great. Around 11 PM, we left Ljubljana in high spirits. We arrived at the Petrol station and found a fast charger, with cables. Guess what happened next:</p><p><em>#5: EU fast chargers are activated via a proprietary chip card or smartphone app. Each company in each country uses a different card / app.</em></p><p>Of course, I only had a smartphone charging app for Croatia. Lessons were coming fast:</p><p><em>#5A: Petrol gas stations clerks can’t sell you a Petrol charging card, and they can’t activate an EV charging even when you want to pay for it.</em></p><p>“Download and register in the Petrol app,” the night clerk said. Yes, but:</p><p><em>#5B: Petrol Android app is 50 MB, so if a station is covered by a <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/glossary.php3?term=edge#:~:text=EDGE%20(also%20known%20as%20Enhanced,order%20to%20conserve%20spectrum%20resources." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slow EDGE signal</a>, you can’t download the app.</em></p><p>We got back to the highway, where my friend caught H+ signal and downloaded the app. At the next Petrol station, we discovered:</p><p><em>#5C: When you hit the “Start charging” button in the Petrol app, it redirects you to a registration form to enter payment and address.</em></p><p>No problem, I can fill the form, even on EDGE signal. But then:</p><p><em>#5D: To register in the Petrol app, needed for charging, you need a valid address in Slovenia.</em></p><p>It is good the EV charging station was 20 meters away from the gas station because I was cursing Petrol so loud a clerk would have had all rights to call the police. I should have read <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=si.petrol.onecharge&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Petrol app comments</a> beforehand:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1.png"><img title="Petrol app comments" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-1024x732.png" alt="" width="584" height="417" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-1024x732.png 1024w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-300x214.png 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-768x549.png 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-420x300.png 420w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1.png 1105w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></a>It was past midnight when we got back on the highway. To extend the range, I slowed down to 75 km/h (46 mph). The limit was 130km/h, so a trailer truck started taking over us. Then I remembered a Tour de France strategy I saw on TV:</p><p><em>#6: In an emergency, you can extend the range of your EV by tailgating a&nbsp; trailer truck, a strategy called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drafting_(aerodynamics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aerodynamic drafting</a>.</em></p><p>Don’t hold me responsible for traffic tickets or beating by an angry trucker. There I was, hidden behind a trailer truck, to save electricity while driving 90 km/h. The car showed it was using less power, and the range extended. When we entered Zagreb, there was 19 km left:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small.jpg"><img title="Kona EV low battery warning, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small-300x233.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="233" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small-300x233.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small-387x300.jpg 387w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><p>I went to a fast-charging station I could actually activate, and I fell asleep in the car.</p><p>I made fun of Petrol for their unfriendliness towards tourists, but at least the EV chargers at Petrol stations are working. In Croatia, you can’t always count on that. In my modest opinion, that stems from the fact that charging is free. Why is free electricity a problem, you ask? There is no commercial incentive to build and maintain charging stations. Instead, most chargers are built when the EU donates money or when the government is pressed to improve EV infrastructure. Local politicians come when a charging station is finished to deliver speeches: “This is an example of Croatia using EU funds wisely, for a green and sustainable future.” After the journalists leave, there is no economic interest in sustaining chargers in the future.</p><p>For example, this city-provided Type 2 charger has been broken for three months:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Garage-broken-charger-2-small.jpg"><img title="Broken charger 1, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Garage-broken-charger-2-small.jpg" alt="" width="641" height="873" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Garage-broken-charger-2-small.jpg 641w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Garage-broken-charger-2-small-220x300.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px"></a></p><p>In front of the Zagreb city hall, one charging station displays an error:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1.jpg"><img title="Broken charger 2, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1.jpg" alt="" width="704" height="455" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1.jpg 704w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1-300x194.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1-464x300.jpg 464w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"></a></p><p>While other just states it is out of order:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2.jpg"><img title="Broken charger 3, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2.jpg" alt="" width="535" height="145" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2.jpg 535w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2-300x81.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2-500x136.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px"></a></p><p>What I learned is:</p><p><em>#7: Free chargers are often unmaintained, and you are better with a commercial provider you can hold accountable.</em></p><p>“But, there is nothing to break on a charging station!” I thought. Boy, I was wrong. EV charging stations use internal computer for authorization, and for controlling the display and the charging protocol. Before charging starts, a car locks the cable with the mechanical pin and signals that back to the charger. When a car is unlocked, it signals a charger to drop the voltage to zero, so the mechanical pin holding cable can be released. Guess what?</p><p><em>#8: Some chargers are not compatible with some EVs and refuse to stop charging, resulting in the “Hotel California effect.” You can check out in the app, but you can never leave.</em></p><p>For example, Croatian Telecom chargers. The first time their cable got stuck in my car I panicked. Their app was not working, the charger was not responding to car signals, and their charging stations don’t have the stop button:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked.jpg"><img title="HT charger cable locked, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked.jpg" alt="" width="899" height="585" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked.jpg 899w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked-300x195.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked-768x500.jpg 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked-461x300.jpg 461w" sizes="(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 899px"></a></p><p>They have the contact phone, but it was Sunday afternoon. I called them, expecting three levels of menus and “we are not working on weekends” message. To my great surprise, a female voice answered after two rings. “I have a big problem with your EV charging station: I can’t get my car out because…” My explanation was stopped by “What is the serial number written on the station?” As I dictated the serial, I could hear fast typing. A few seconds later charging station stopped buzzing, display went blank for a moment, and I could unplug my car. “Wow, that was fast, thank you very much!” I said. Although they currently don’t charge for electricity, Croatian Telekom is a commercial operation. They have a direct 24/7 support line where a representative can reset any charging station in Croatia, provided the serial number. It seems that such a solution was easier than fixing charging stations or the charging app. I now just call them and say, “Can you reset the station with serial X?” If you work there, let me know, I would like to buy a box of chocolates for the team.</p><p>Unfortunately, EV charges are not the only thing broken here. Our driving culture is also broken:</p><p><em>#9: It is common to find a gas car parked at the EV charging spot, the practice called <a href="https://twitter.com/ivebeeniced?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICEing</a> (internal combustion engine-ing).</em></p><p>One time I urgently needed to charge, and this was the charging spot:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-parking.jpg"><img title="Blocking EV parking, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-parking.jpg" alt="" width="717" height="785" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-parking.jpg 717w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-parking-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px"></a></p><p>ICEing is common around the world.

    <h3>Fully embracing the dumb terminal laptop</h3>
    <p>August 29, 2020</p>
    <img src="https://zainamro.com/assets/img/chromebook.png">
    <p>A few days ago, I picked up a <a href="https://www.google.com/chromebook/device/samsung-chromebook-4/">$229 Chromebook</a> with minimum specs and have decided to replace all my existing Macbook Pros and Airs and use it as my main machine for development work (and everything else). This isn’t because it’s a great laptop; in fact, it’s a far-below-average laptop when you consider the current hardware options on the market. But, that’s precisely why I picked it — it leaves nothing more to be desired, because I redefined what I expect out of a laptop and instead optimized on price and having the minimum feature set to connect to a remote machine. It might sound a bit defeatist, but once you treat your client machine as a dumb terminal and nothing more, you actually end up with a more robust and reliable setup.</p>
    <p>After being constantly disappointed with common Macbook quality issues (keyboard problems, display gasket peeling off, etc.) and looking at the available options on the market, I realized my seemingly basic desire to have an easy to use, robust laptop that has software and hardware that just works is becoming more of a pipe dream. So, I did something that seems like a regression — buy a low-end, dumb laptop that I just use to ssh into a remote linux server where I do all my work. I chose a Chromebook because it’s portable, has good battery life, and has an operating system that is decent for non-dev work. When in terminal, I use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">Screen</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> to work and save my sessions for later. And, I use <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> which allows me to magically create a private mesh network between my machines in a couple minutes; this is what makes it easy to access remote services on my server like a locally-hosted web server for instance. When I'm working outside without access to wifi, I simply connect to my phone's hotspot which provides me enough speed to work on my remote server. This no-frills setup is simple but works well enough.</p>
    <img src="https://zainamro.com/assets/img/chromebook_screenshot.png">
    <p>With a distributed setup, the client machine is just the control device to a much larger system. I couldn’t care less how fancy or powerful my laptop is as long as it has a display, keyboard, and internet that works. And if this laptop is stolen or breaks, I wouldn't be affected. I would just buy another cheap laptop and pick up where I left off. This was perhaps the wisdom behind the vision for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs">Plan 9</a> distributed operating system which took this core idea to a whole new level during the 80’s beyond dumb terminals.</p>
    <p>This setup may obviously not work for everyone since terminal/ssh is limited when it comes to non-textual work or work requiring more visual interfaces. Of course, you could setup X11 forwarding or some other remote GUI software, but I've always found the latency too unbearable to work with. I think in 2020, it might be worthwhile to take a step back and ask ourselves whether this should still be the case. When you think of all the amazing things you can do with distributed computing and what Plan 9 managed to do over 30 years ago, it makes one wonder why we’re still stuck with basic tools like terminal/ssh; with the right abstractions and local caching, we could provide a more integrated relationship between software, network computing, and the visual representation of that on the client machine. Additionally, the rise of 5G brings us even closer to "always online" laptops with fast internet, opening the door to more interesting architectures centered around network computing. I’d imagine a true modern successor to Plan 9 (I don't mean ChromeOS) would be a delightful experience where laptops instead focus on providing beautiful, well-functioning interfaces to remote computing systems with theoretically infinite computing power, memory, and storage. Assuming the network and security/privacy challenges can be figured out, this seems to me like it would be a far superior approach to how we use computers today.</p>

<![CDATA[The Problem with C]]>

September 1, 2020 | https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/fight.jpeg" alt="Fish"></p>
<p>In the early 70s, C was created at Bell Labs as a byproduct of the development of UNIX.
It quickly became one of the most popular programming languages.
But it was not expressive enough for Bjarne Stroustrup.
And so, in 1983, as a byproduct of his Ph.D. thesis, he extended C.</p>
<p>C with classes was born.</p>
<p>At the time, Bjarne Stroustrup understood that a programming language has many components,
not only the language, its compiler, but also a linker and libraries.
Offering a familiar tool also makes adoption easier.
In this historical context, it makes sense that C++ would be based on C.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 40 years later.</p>
<p>Both C and C++ are widely used in the industry.
But go 5 minutes on the Internet and C developers will tell you that C++ is the most horrific man-made creation,
while many C++ developers wait for the day when C finally burns in the hot flames of hell.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h2>
<p>On the surface, C and C++ cater to the same use cases: high performance, deterministic, native but portable code for the widest range of hardware and applications.</p>
<p>But C is proudly a low-level language. A nicer assembly.</p>
<p>From day one, C++ had magic. Dark witchcraft: destructors. Suddenly the compiler was doing things on its own.
It also had type inference very early on, but the developers of the mid-80s were not quite ready for that and Bjarne Stroustrup
was pressured into removing <code>auto</code>, until it was added back to C++11.</p>
<p>From then, C++ got more and more tools to build abstractions.
I don’t think it would be fair to say that C++ is a low-level or high-level language. It’s both, by design.
But building high-level abstractions while not sacrificing performance is hard.
C++ then needed tools to achieve that: <code>constexpr</code>, move semantics, templates, and an ever-growing standard library.</p>
<p>Fundamentally I think C trusts developers while C++ trusts compilers.
This is a massive difference that sharing the same native types or syntax for while loop cannot hide.</p>
<p>C++ developers blame C for all their lost limbs, while C developers probably think C++ is batshit crazy.
I imagine that is a fair perspective if you look at C++ through a C lense. C++ is pretty wild <em>as a superset of C</em>.
A seasoned C person looking at C++ expecting familiarity in C++ will not find it. C++ is not C.
This is enough to feed flamewars for generations.</p>
<p>But as much as I dislike C, I don’t have any legitimacy to make fun of it. See, I have some experience with C++ but I
wrote very little C. It was probably bad C.
A language is also its good practices, patterns, idioms, and these take years to learn. If you try to write C code like it’s C++ or C++ like it is C, you will have a bad time.
Knowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk">C doesn’t teach you C++</a>. Knowing C++ does not teach you C.</p>
<p>So can we all stop saying C/C++, regret the unfortunate naming, and sing kumbaya in harmony?
Not so fast.</p>
<p>See, despite being philosophically different from C, C++ is still somewhat a superset of C.
That is to say, you can include a C header in a C++ translation unit and that should compile.
And this is where it gets messy.</p>
<p>C++ is not an extension of C.
It is designed as a separate standard, by a different committee, different people.
Logically, people who like C++'s philosophy will get involved in the C++ community and the C++ standardization process
while other people might try to get involved with C.
Committees, whether its C’s or C++'s, only manifest intent and direction through their respective end-product: the standards; standards which are the fruits of numerous voting.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is difficult for a compiler to know that it is dealing with a C header or a C++ header.</p>
<p><code>extern "C"</code> is not used consistently and only affects mangling, but neither grammar nor semantics.
And headers only exists in the eyes of the preprocessor, for a C++ compiler, everything is a C++ translation unit, and therefore C++.
And yet, people include C headers in C++ and expect it to “just work” ™️.
Which it mostly does.</p>
<p>We can wonder then,</p>
<h2 id="how-c-maintains-c-compatibility-while-being-developed-by-different-people-in-different-places">How C++ maintains C compatibility while being developed by different people in different places?</h2>
<p>Badly, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>A coworker recently reminded me of Conway’s law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that logic, it would stand to reason that if the two committees don’t interoperate,
neither would the languages they produce.</p>
<p>C++ maintains a list of <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.iso">incompatibilities with C</a> and <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.library">its standard library</a>.
This list does not seem to reflect the many features that were added to C11 and C18 but are not valid C++ constructs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a> draws a clearer picture.</p>
<p>Listing incompatibilities isn’t sufficient to get a measure of incompatibilities between both languages.</p>
<p>Functions that exist in the C++ standard library but whose primary declaration is expected to come from C are difficult to make <code>constexpr</code>, and more difficult still to make <code>noexcept</code>.
C compatibility translates to performance costs and C functions are optimization barriers.</p>
<p>Many C constructs are valid C++ but should never pass a code review (<code>NULL</code>, <code>longjmp</code>, <code>malloc</code>, create/destroy functions, <code>free</code>, C  casts), etc.</p>
<p>These might not be bad C idioms, but they are bad C++. C++ has a stronger type system,
and unfortunately using C idioms punch a giant hole in that type system, and so C compatibility has a cost in terms of safety.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, C++ still care about C compatibility. Somewhat.
And interestingly C cares about C++. Somewhat.
Truth be told, C might care about C++ more than C++ cares about C.
So each committee cares somewhat about what the other does.
We care reluctantly.</p>
<p>See, C++ is aware of the many foundational libraries written in C, not only the <code>libc</code> but also <code>zip</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>openssl</code> (!), and countless others, which are used in many, many C++ projects.
We can’t break that.</p>
<p>But recently, especially over the past decade, C++ has become much bigger than C.
C++ has more users - and a much more active community: <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/">There Are No C Conferences</a>.
Maybe that’s why the C++ committee is now over 10 times the size of the C committee.</p>
<p>C++ then is a force to be reckoned with and the C committee has to consider not breaking C++.
To the point that if a standard would track another, these days, C++ leads and C follow.</p>
<p>C++ is now on a steady three years cycle come rain or shine, or deadly pandemics.
Meanwhile, C has a major release every decade or so.
This makes sense. As a lower-level language, C doesn’t need to evolve as fast.</p>
<p>The C landscape is also rather different from the C++ landscape.
C caters to more platforms and a lot more compilers.
Everybody and their dog is writing C compilers because the language has a surface area small enough to make that possible, whereas the C++ committee will only really consider 4 implementations, all of which are represented at every meeting.
As a result, many features in C are implementation-defined or optionally supported so that the variety of compilers that exist can claim conformance without doing much work, which I’m told pleases regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>C++ these days is more interested in portability than implementation freedom. Yet another difference of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="so-your-proposal-breaks-c-compatibility">So, your proposal breaks C compatibility</h2>
<p>Parts of my <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2178r1.pdf">P2178</a> paper theoretically affects C compatibility.
In such cases, none of the options seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>You could be told that you have to first get your feature into C. Which means more meetings.
Meetings you might not be able to attend because C has strict <a href="https://thephd.github.io/follow-the-river-wg14-ithaca-2019">attendance rules</a> - Excluding individuals not willing to put down thousands of dollars to become ISO members.
This is because the C committee is forced to adhere strictly to ISO rules.</p>
<p>It might also take a decade if the standard just shipped.
And most importantly, it might go nowhere if the C committee doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about the particular problem you are trying to solve.
And they probably don’t have the bandwidth to deal with it.
And you may not have the bandwidth to deal with C. After all, you joined C++ to improve C++.
In fact, if the room invites you to “talk to the C committee”, it is likely your proposal is dead, even in the unlikely event that no one in the room was against it.</p>
<p>Another likely scenario is that the C committee accepts a version of a proposal that is slightly different from what exists in C++.
<code>true</code>? Let’s make that a macro. <code>char16_t</code> ? Let’s make that a typedef. <code>char32_t</code>? Not necessarily UTF-32. <code>static_assert</code> ? <code>_Static_assert</code>.</p>
<p>The list goes on. Should we blame C? Probably not. Their committee does what they think is best for their language.
The opposite is true too. In C++20 designated initializers were inspired by C’s but are slightly different because they would otherwise not fit with the C++ initialization rules.</p>
<p>I am part of the problem. C has VLAs. I would vote against a proposal to adopt that in standard C++, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Kills-The-VLA">too many security issues</a>. A proposal to add <code>_Generic</code> to C++ would be over-my-dead-body. I am not sure if <code>_Generic</code> attempts to palliate to the lack of template or the lack of overloads, but C++ has both these features - from my point of view <code>_Generic</code> doesn’t fit into the big picture of what I imagine C++ to be.</p>
<p>Both committees seem also inconsistent in how much they care about the other language.
Sometimes we go to great lenghts (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex">std::complex</a>), sometimes we don’t care at all (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array">static array parameters</a>).</p>
<p>There is no way around this. Don’t forget that each committee is a bunch of people
voting at different times in different rooms and trying to control the outcome would defeat the purpose
of having a vote.
Putting people in the same room is not realistic either. ISO might object and the participation inbalance
would put C people at an enormous disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="c-compatibility-doesnt-matter-kinda">C compatibility doesn’t matter, kinda</h2>
<p>If you are a C developer, I imagine you see C as a neat programming language.
But for the rest of us, C is something else.</p>
<p>C is the universal, cross-language glue that ties it all together.</p>
<p>For C++ users, C is …</p></div></div>

<p>“Xpra is a tool which allows you to run X programs — usually on a remote host — and then direct their display to your local machine, disconnect from these programs, and reconnect from<br>
the same or another machine, all without losing any state. It differs from standard X forwarding in that it allows disconnection and reconnection without disrupting the forwarded<br>
application; it differs from VNC and similar remote display technologies in that xpra is rootless: i.e., applications forwarded by xpra appear on your desktop as normal windows managed<br>
by your window manager, rather than being all “trapped in a box together”. Xpra also uses a custom protocol that is self-tuning and relatively latency-insensitive, and thus is usable<br>
over network connections that are too slow or unreliable for standard X forwarding. Xpra can also be used to shadow an existing X11 display.”</p>

      </div>
  
  <div>
    <p>A few years ago, I first stumbled over some recordings of number stations and started reading up on their history. For most of them, we have pretty good guesses who ran them and for what purpose. One example is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxlrnAC7Y7Q">Gongs and Chimes Station</a>, known for its melody that got increasingly creepy over the years, the more worn down the tape got. What always seemed mysterious to me is the kinds of devices used to actually generate the spoken messages. Were they similar to electromechanical devices used for time announcements over the telephone, <a href="https://youtu.be/4aMqKr0D-7o?t=47">with multiple play heads</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lESMfh72RJg">complicated tape mechanisms</a>?</p>
<p>Then, I stumbled over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4buFLqjvTjA">this video</a>. And... It's <em>the actual voice</em> used by the <em>Gongs and Chimes</em> Station? What surprised me was how rather small, polished and complex the machine seemed. There definitely was a microcontroller in there, it had an LED display, and just in general seemed like a rather fancy device.</p>

</div>

<div>
    
    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/sprach-morse-generator.jpg" alt="Grey box-shaped machine with a tilted front panel. There are a paper punch tape reader, LED display and numeric keyboard with some extra buttons on the front."> 
    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    <p>The most important thing however was, I finally knew what to look for. Searching for "Sprach-Morse-Generator" (Speech-Morse-Generator) quickly got me to <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/32620/index.htm">a page about it at the crypto museum</a> which also mentions its official name: "Gerät 32620" (Device 32620). The page also has some great information about the history of the device and the voice behind it.</p>
<p>What exited me the most was... There are actually links to technical documentation about the Speech generator and its companion device, Gerät 32621, which could be used for digitizing voice recordings and writing them to EPROM cartridges to use with Gerät 32620.</p>

</div>

<div>
    <h3><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/32620/files/MfS_OTS_4061.pdf">The 32620 Guide</a></h3>
<p>I don't want to go over everything mentioned in these guides; if you speak German I'd recommend giving it a read yourself; but I do want to mention some things I found notable.</p>
<p>As input, either paper punch tapes, the keyboard, or a serial interface (RS-232) can be used. The last one is a bit unclear, it is mentioned in the beginning, but later parts of the document mention it as a possible future addition. Either way, the messages are transferred to RAM, from where they can later be transmitted. It can hold up to 3791 characters.</p>
<p>The language samples are loaded from an exchangeable cartridge which can hold up to 96 kByte, where they are stored as uncompressed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation">PCM</a> . They proudly mention the cartridges can be swapped in 10 seconds.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The number of words per minute and pitch of the voice can be varied, which explains why some recordings of number stations with the same voice sound a bit different.</p>

    </p>
    
</div>

<p>What I find quite surprising: The keyboard and output of the device mostly uses English words. A bit unexpected for a device developed in eastern Germany for use in the Soviet Union; I would rather have expected Russian there.</p>

    <p>There are some pretty charming charts in the documentation showing some interactions with the device.</p>

    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/backside.png" alt="Technical drawing of the back of the device, with power and data inputs and line output."> 
    </p>
    <p>On the back are a speaker, output to the transmitter and some status outputs and remote control inputs. These were probably used so the chimes and speech wouldn't overlap.</p>
</div>

<p>There are also pretty detailed schematic drawings and lists of component at the end of the document.</p>

<div>
    <h3><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/32620/files/MfS_OTS_4062b.pdf">The 32621 Guide</a></h3>
<p>This is the companion device used for digitizing voices and writing them to cartridges for the 32620. It's quite astounding how complicated this device really is: It can either record words separately or all of them in one go, it automatically recognizes the beginning and end of the words, it can duplicate cartridges and it even has a UV chamber for clearing the EEPROMS on a cartridge to reuse it.</p>
<p>What's interesting: There are no photos of this device. It's unclear how many were produced, there may just have been one or two. The only things we know about it are from this document.</p>
<p>In its architecture, it is quite similar to the 32620, it has a very similar keyboard and probably the same display.</p>

</div>

<div>
    <p>One interesting difference: It uses German labels on the keyboard. Also, all of the text it shows on the display is in German.</p>
    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/tastatur2.png" alt=""> 
    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    <p>The documentation mentions recording up to 20 words. This also came up in the 32620's documentation, although only 13 words were ever used: digits 0-9, "Achtung" (Attention), "Trennung" (Seperation) and "Ende" (End).</p>
<p>It has controls for adjusting the 0-level of the recordings and amplification. LEDs show whether it senses an audio signal and whether it's clipping. The amplification for single words can also be adjusted later, from a value of 0 to 7. It seems like this doesn't actually change the recorded samples but controls the amplification level in the digital to analogue converter. This feature is intended for making all the digits similar in volume.</p>
<p>I find this a bit surprising, all of this is something that could be done with other equipment, especially since only two different voices for these machines are known: German and Spanish.</p>
<p>In order to check the recording, either all recorded digits or just combinations of them can be played back.</p>
<p>When programming to an EPROM, it transfers the start address and amplification for each word and the samples from RAM to the ROM and checks whether the values it reads back after programming are as expected.</p>

</div>

<p>There is a separate mode for deleting cartridges where the time to expose them to UV can be typed in via the keyboard. If the rom cartridge is double sided, the cartridge has to be turned around to delete the chips on the other side.</p>

<div>
    <p>For all of the different modes of the 32621, flow charts for the interface are provided.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The front also features various other indicators, e.g. for the different voltages in the device.</p>
</div>

<p>This manual also includes schematics for the device.</p>

<div>
    <h3>The EPROMS</h3>
<p>The crypto museum also provides dumps of the EPROMS for both the German and Spanish cartridges.</p>
<p>Having read the manuals, decoding them is actually not that hard: The data is stored as PCM, and the 32621 Guide mentions the time between samples is 125μs, which adds up to a sample rate of 8000Hz.
Loading the roms into Audacity with File&gt;Import&gt;Raw Data, you can actually already listen to them!</p>
<p>[Edit: Here are the dumps as WAVs, if you're interested: <a href="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/2620_ger.wav">german</a>, <a href="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/2620_span.wav">spanish</a>]</p>
<h4>The Header</h4>
<p>In the very beginning of the first EPROM, there are 64 byte of header information, containing the start address for each word and its amplification factor. For 20 words, that leaves just over 3 bytes per word, although they seem to just stick to 3.</p>
<p>Decoding the rest of the header took a lot longer than anticipated. I found the 3 bits for the amplification value pretty quickly in the last byte for each word. The rest somehow had to be the start address or some offset, and possibly the length. For accessing the values in each of the 8K chips, 13 Bits for the address are needed. To select one of the up to 12 EPROMs, another 4 Bit are required. This adds up to 17 Bits, so one more than in two bytes.</p>
<p>To get around this, there are two obvious solutions: Stuff the one extra bit into the byte which holds the amplification level, or throw away the least significant bit for the start address, so just every other sample can be used as the start sample.</p>
<p>Two things made this really hard to pin down: The z80 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">little endian machine</a>, meaning for 16 bit values, the less significant byte is stored before the more significant byte, but this doesn't mean they would <em>have</em> to store the values in this order. Also, the binary chip select value for the first EPROM isn't 0, but 2. I only stumbled upon that when looking at the schematic for the EPROM cartridge (p. 38 in the 32620 manual). There's also a really cute demultiplexer built from discrete AND and NAND gates for translating the chip address to the actual chip select lines!</p>

</div>

<div>
    <p>Isn't it gorgeous! Note how it only <em>suggests</em> the presence of the fourth address line for the chip select with that not connected NAND.</p>
    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/demux.png" alt="The schematic for the demultiplexer built out of discreet components."> 
    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    <p>My best guess to why is the case is the chip select address values 0 and 1 are already used to select some other components. But, at last, I think I found out how it works:</p>
<p>For each word, the second byte contains the 3 least significant bits for the chip select and 5 of the address bits. The first byte contains the remaining 8 address bits. The end of each word is the beginning address for the next word. That's why there are two extra bytes after the last word. This would have worked for up to twenty words, as there would still be 4 spare bytes to contain the end address of the last word. The third byte contains the remaining chip select bit, some mysterious bits, and 3 bits for the amplification level.</p>
<p>The remaining chip select bit is still a bit confusing to me: The German recordings don't use it, since they fit on just 6 EPROMs. The Spanish one has to use it for the last two words, but there's something odd happening with the values in the one before the last two words.</p>
<p>Another thing worth noting: The German words all use the default amplification level of 3, whereas the Spanish ones use lower and higher values for some words. To be <em>really</em> authentic, you'd have to take that into account when playing the samples.</p>
<p>One last thing I was interested in: The Spanish voice uses the same word for "Trennung" and "Ende"&amp;em;"final", and they sure <em>sound</em> the same. So, is …</p></div></div></div></div>

September 1, 2020 | https://www.jvt.me/posts/2020/09/01/against-online-tooling/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.jvt.me/posts/2020/09/01/against-online-tooling/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Something my colleagues know well is how little I trust online tools like <a href="https://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a>, online JSON validators or online tooling in general, but it also bleeds into <a href="https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2020/08/zebqf/">comments I make online</a> and in my blog posts, too, and I thought I'd share a little bit of a reason as to why.</p><p>Instead of using an online service, I will reach for a way to run it locally, using whichever programming language toolchain I have available. But why? Why wouldn't I recommend something like jwt.io? Or an online JSON validator, especially if they boast client-side functionality, and mean I don't need things installed?</p><p>Let's start with a bit of background. Firstly, I'd just like to caveat this all with the note that <strong>I have no access to Production data, customer or otherwise</strong>. All of these examples are referencing Non-Production examples.</p><p>I also want to caveat this with the fact that this is <strong>not a personal attack</strong> on jwt.io. I am using them as an example as they're a well-known and well-used service, and I've seen issues with it before. Auth0 run it, and are probably one of the few companies we'd want to be running it. It's also <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io">Open Source</a> <em>but</em> one of the great difficulties of Web-hosted services are that we have no idea if the source code that we're told is being used is actually being used!</p><p>I'm currently working on the Open Banking platform for Capital One. We're fortunate to have very restricted access to Production, which makes things safer for everyone. One thing we strive to do is to treat Non-Production secrets like Production ones where possible - where we shouldn't have access to them at all, and shouldn't be sharing them with external services. Some of these Non-Production secrets may be usable outside of Capital One, for instance Open Banking Sandbox signing certificates.</p><p>We perform a fair bit of testing in our Non-Production environments and sometimes need to debug things, such as what's inside a JWT (as Open Banking introduces several places they're used). I've been burned a number of times by folks putting a Non-Production JWT or an Open Banking Sandbox certificate into jwt.io. Although Non-Production, these are sensitive in of themselves, as they have implementation details for our services, and as mentioned, certain things could be used outside of Capital One.</p><p>The biggest reason I hear from folks using online tooling is that it's easier, and that they'd rather do that than find out how to run it locally. I disagree with this, but am quite biased, as I often have a blog post for many of these common issues. I love sharing my blog with others and having a handy solution, or if I don't have an answer to a problem, I'll find out how and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/tags/blogumentation/">blogument it for later</a>. So I see that reaching for online tooling is more just because we've got folks who aren't aware of how they could do otherwise.</p><p>One great thing about removing the need for an online tool is that you can self-serve it once you have the tools locally. You can run it locally when you've got no internet (which isn't as much of an issue in these Coronavirus times) but also regardless of whether the upstream service is broken. You can use it with other i.e. command-line tooling, for instance how I've set up <a href="https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/dotfiles-arch/-/blob/master/terminal/home/bin/unpack">this command-line script</a> to handle a lot of common data formats I deal with and unpack them to a human-readable format.</p><p>But most importantly, by telling people to put sensitive data (such as credentials, configuration files, etc) it's a really dangerous lesson for our teams. We're teaching people to blindly trust arbitrary websites that they don't have any relationship with, nor have fully audited the source code, when posting potentially sensitive data.</p><p>I realise this may not be something you do when running it locally, but it's less likely for a well-known library running locally to need to reach outbound.</p><p>jwt.io is an interesting example, because although it boasts that it runs as a client-side solution, you may not have been aware that <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io/commit/b362ab19a9f37e337b5f8ea38987aa680aa6e0a9">until last September</a>, there were metrics being determined which although may have seemed innocent, show that it's easy for other functionality to be hidden in a seemingly client-side-only website. Unless you audit everything, every time, you're in a risky position where you may be leaking data you're not expecting to.</p><p>I feel that we can do something to help services that handle potentially sensitive data with helping educate the user that they should be more careful, because jwt.io's warning definitely doesn't help with folks who don't fully appreciate what the risk is if jwt.io isn't actually as trustworthy as the user thinks:</p><blockquote><p>Warning: JWTs are credentials, which can grant access to resources. Be careful where you paste them! We do not record tokens, all validation and debugging is done on the client side.</p></blockquote><p>What do you think? Am I maybe being a little too sensitive? Am I not being sensitive enough?</p><p>Edit: Based on some conversations being had in response to the post, I thought it'd mention I've written about how to <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/06/13/pretty-printing-jwt-openssl/">pretty-print a JWT locally with OpenSSL</a> and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2018/08/31/pretty-printing-jwt-ruby/">a Ruby alternative</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

September 1, 2020 | https://kitze.io/posts/launching-fungarzione-with-blitz | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kitze.io/posts/launching-fungarzione-with-blitz">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>You already know that I'm pretty frustrated with the way we do things on the web. In order to fetch a list of things and display them as rectangles on a webpage, we need to jump through 1938137 hoops. What is this, Circus Charlie? Anyone? Remember that game??? I'm old 😭</p>&nbsp;<h2>The problem with our current stack</h2><p>The process of making a web app is so unnecessarily complex and so many people are going for a SPA even when it's not needed. GraphQL makes working with an API easy, but it still involves building that API, and writing a lot of boilerplate. You might not mind all of that until someone removes the layer for you. And that's <a href="https://blitzjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blitz</a>.</p>&nbsp;<p>"Damn, I just want to fetch some data directly from the database and display it!" - You, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"You can do that with PHP and raw SQL..." - Someone on HN, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"LMAO" - You</p>&nbsp;<p>"Well, why don't you use Rails?" - Someone on Reddit, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"I only know JavaScript and I want to use React" - You, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"Welp, too bad there's nothing similar to Rails in the React world..." - Someone on Twitter, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"Hey, what if there was a Fullstack React framework, similar to Ruby on Rails?" - Blitz, if it could talk, probably</p>&nbsp;<p><em>Meteor crying in the corner, probably</em></p>&nbsp;<h2>What is Blitz?</h2><p>Blitz "removes" the API layer in a very clever way so you can directly call functions from your backend, which completely changes the game. Actually, this is not the best way to describe what it does, so you better <a href="https://blitzjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read the docs</a>. TL;DR: it's magic.</p>&nbsp;<p>What I like about Blitz is that it builds on top of already solid solutions like <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a>, <a href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-query</a>, and <a href="https://prisma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a>. I already used them in other projects, but I love the way Blitz glues all of them together and it magically works. </p>&nbsp;<p>The ability to get whatever you want directly from the database, with the nicely typed API from Prisma, and then just display it, is a pretty wonderful experience. It makes me feel that for years we had no frickin' clue why we did things the way we did them, until finally someone realized that we don't have to do them that way.</p>&nbsp;<p>When generating a new Blitz app you get all the authentication boilerplate generated for you and I all I have to say is <em>fucking finally</em>.  It's 2020, I don't want to build the authentication layer again, and again, and again, and again. Hey frameworks, just let me get me the current user with <code>const user = useCurrentUser()</code> and don't bother me with anything else.</p>&nbsp;<p>I can't even describe how fast you can ship a product when there is no API layer and boilerplate involved. </p>&nbsp;<p>There are similar frameworks to Blitz which go in a completely different direction by rebuilding most of the stack. Personally, I'm tired of the React community constantly reinventing things that don't need reinventing. Next.js is already amazing, so just imagine how much code we'd be able to reuse if we all agree on using it by default. More reusing, less reinventing, please.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Launching a production app in a few days</h2><p>I already did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiLYvLNDeKA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr-7Z9Grvfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streams</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/flybayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandon</a>, the creator of Blitz, and I couldn't wait to actually try Blitz on a real project. The problem is, I needed a real project because I didn't want to waste my time on some demo gibberish which is never going to see the light of day.</p>&nbsp;<p>I got frustrated by the app that I was using for writing changelogs for <a href="https://sizzy.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sizzy</a>, so I decided to sit down and write <a href="https://fungarzione.com/sizzy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my own tool</a> with some more advanced features that will make the process easier. </p>&nbsp;<p>I <a href="https://twitch.tv/thekitze" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">livestreamed the entire process</a> from "hello world" to deployment and I couldn't believe that it only took me only 5 days. </p>&nbsp;<p>Actually, the majority of the work was done in only 2 days, which is crazy. Someone commented "my boss shouldn't see this" on the stream and the credit for that goes to Blitz. You can definitely ship faster than a team of people who would argue about the modeling of the API, raw SQL queries, and whether to use redux-saga or RxJS for fetching the data.</p>&nbsp;<p>Hey Kitze, if you finished most of the things in 2 days, why did it take you 5 days?</p>&nbsp;<p>Great question, reader.</p>&nbsp;<ul><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 3: Polishing the design and adding extra features</li><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 4: Deployment. I deployed the database to DigitalOcean without a problem, but I had a problem with deploying the Blitz app to Vercel. Turns out, the problem wasn't with Blitz or Vercel and it was ... TypeScript. Yup, I couldn't deploy the app because TS was being a pain in the ass, and the Vercel logs didn't show that. I had to dive deep, find the problematic files, and fix everything, so that took most of the day.</li><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 5: CSS. Of course. You can put as many layers as you want on top of CSS, it's still CSS at the end of the day. I literally lost an entire day on centering things and making sure the fixed header and sticky footer layouts work in Safari on iOS. Oh, by the way, fuck Safari. We finally got rid of the pain that's IE pain, but Safari is here to replace it.</li></ul><h2>Why another changelog app?</h2><p>I would never make an app if there wasn't an actual need for it. There are tons of Saas products for making changelogs, but I had something different in mind.</p>&nbsp;<p>I was using a popular solution for writing the Sizzy changelogs for 1.5 years. However, the changelog was a huge markdown document, so we had to use Notion boards to plan the work as individual cards, and then collaborate on them with the Sizzy team. When we were done, we'd export markdown from all the cards and merge them in a giant markdown document. In the past 3 months, I'm working on the changelog alone, so I decided to directly write the giant markdown document. Aside from being an overwhelming experience, I also lost my 3 hours of progress by accidentally closing the tab.</p>&nbsp;<p>So I said: fuck it, I'd rather build a proper changelog app instead of writing this changelog again.</p>&nbsp;<p>I wanted to improve the process of collaborating and publishing a changelog, and in the process, I came up with a bunch of ideas that will hopefully change the changelog game. Wait... was there ever a <em>changelog game</em>? If not, there is now. Boom 🎤</p>&nbsp;<p>Wait, the mic should actually drop.</p>&nbsp;<p>🎤  </p>&nbsp;<p>There.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Introducing <a href="https://fungarzione.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fungarzione</a> - The Changelog Of The Future</h2><p>Instead of publishing a giant markdown document, a team of collaborators would start working on individual entries. The editor supports Markdown, but also MDX, with a set of custom components that would make the changelogs way better. </p>&nbsp;<p>Creating a changelog entry is super simple, and it's not as overwhelming as starting a giant markdown document.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Individual entries can then progress from Draft to Ready For Review, to Published. Team collaboration features like assigning people and commenting on the entries will be available when registration is open to everyone.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>After creating a bunch of entries, a changelog is created by combininig individual entries, as well as adding a list of small bug fixes and improvements, which will appear grouped at the end of the document.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Then, the draft changelog is moved to "Ready for Review" and it cannot be published, unless all of the entries in that changelog area already published.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Users can leave feedback individually for each changelog, as well as subscribe to get an email when a new changelog is published.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<h2>Fungarzione is live</h2><p>I already ported <a href="http://fungarzione.com/sizzy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the last 10 changelogs for Sizzy</a> to Fungarzione and I'm already in love with the publishing experience. It's not that overwhelming and I can work on the changelog in chunks.</p>&nbsp;<p><em>self high-five</em></p>&nbsp;<p>Also, to be honest, even with my mediocre design skills, it already looks better than some of the popular changelog apps out there 🙈 </p>&nbsp;<p><em>taps myself on the back a bit more</em> </p>&nbsp;<p>If you're interested in signing up you can <a href="https://fungarzione.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leave your email here</a> and you'll get a notification when public access is available (hopefully soon).</p>&nbsp;<p>I'm also looking for people who'd like to port their changelog <em>now</em>, so I can get some feedback on the editor experience. You just need to have a production app with an established user base, as well as an existing changelog. Just <a href="mailto:kristijan.mkd@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoot me an email</a> and we can discuss.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Conclusion on Blitz</h2><p>I still have to explore Blitz a bit more to figure out all the downsides, but I think that I'd definitely pick Blitz for most of my future apps, unless I have a really specific reason not to. Brandon said there will be a way to reuse the same Blitz client in React Native apps, so you won't miss the actual API layer.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Fungarzione</h2><p>I know what you're thinking right now.</p>&nbsp;<p>Fungarzione?!</p>&nbsp;<p>FUNGARZIONE?!?! What the hell does the name mean, Kitze?</p>&nbsp;<p>Fungarzione comes from the word Fungangarzione. And the origin of Fungangarzione is really a long story, so I guess you'll have to <a href="https://twitch.tv/thekitze" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hang out in my stream</a> to find out 😜 I'm planning to live stream the rest of the work on this app, and trust me, there are too way too many things that I'd like to do. If you have any ideas or suggestions you're more welcome to join my stream! 🙌</p>&nbsp;<p>I want to give another shout-out to all the people on Twitch who helped me while I was building this app (even though they're credited in the footer of the page).</p>&nbsp;<p>There's no way I would've shipped it in such a short time without your help 💜</p>&nbsp;</div></div></div></div>]]>

          <p><strong>Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) expert Lattice Semiconductor has embraced the ethos of the open hardware community, creating a portal which lists what the company describes as “community sourced” open hardware development boards and reference designs.</strong></p>
<p>“In addition to proprietary boards developed by Lattice and other partners there is a broad array of boards developed by the open source community,” Lattice notes on its freshly-launched portal. “In some cases just the designs are available and in other cases there are sources available for purchasing assembled boards.</p>
<p>“For your convenience we list some of the more popular and interesting Community Sourced boards on the Lattice website. Lattice does not evaluate or certify community sourced boards so you will want to make your own assessment as to fitness for your application.”</p>
<p>The initial list of boards, all naturally built around Lattice FPGAs, is split into two. The first half showcases development kits and boards, uncluding the recently-launched ECP5-based OrangeCrab, the popular TinyFPGA Bx, iCEBreaker, Fomu, and Alhambra II. The second half looks at reference designs, including an ECP5 board from Matthew Venn, the myStorm BlackIce-II, Dadamachines Doppler, and the unusual earring form-factor iCE Bling from Electronut Labs.</p>
<p>Each board in the list receives a dedicated showcase page which highlights key features, provides imagery, and links out to external homepages, source code and design file repositories, and provides links to where finished boards can be purchased for immediate use.</p>
<p>The full list of boards and reference designs can be found on the <a href="https://www.latticesemi.com/en/Solutions/Solutions/SolutionsDetails01/CommunitySourced">Lattice Semiconductor website</a>; the company has also indicated that it is accepting suggestions for other boards not currently included via a <a href="http://ww3.latticesemi.com/Community_Sourced.html">contact form</a>.</p>

      <p><img src="https://www.subtask.co/uploads/subtask-effort-value-priority-matrix.png" alt=""></p>

<section data-level="1" id="-steps-to-use-an-effort-value-matrix-and-work-more-effectively-with-your-team-">
<p>Software teams today are working hard on a wide variety of interesting, complex, and challenging problems.  Being successful is as much about figuring out the right work to do as it is about doing that work right.  One of the tools that can help your team do this effectively is the effort/value matrix.  An effort/value matrix is simply an adaptation of the urgent/important matrix known as the <a href="https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/">Eisenhower matrix</a>, which is widely used in decision-making. Whether you’re tasked with developing new features in an app, deciding on your business strategy, trying to hit a goal or KPI, or planning a social media campaign, this method makes it easy to hone in on the right things to spend your time on. </p>
<p>Our team refers to effort/value grids constantly as we improve our suite of products (<a href="https://www.subtask.co/">Subtask</a>, <a href="https://team.video/">Team.Video</a>, and <a href="https://www.plectica.com/">Plectica</a>).  Here is a guide for how to use an effort/value matrix so you can work more effectively with your team on your biggest challenges.</p>

<section data-level="2" id="-get-all-ideas-on-the-table"><h2>1. Get all ideas on the table</h2>
<p>The first thing to do is gather and expose all your available options.  This might be the result of a brainstorming session, it might be a list of requests from various customers or stakeholders, it might just be a to-do list you made.  The important thing is to put it all into a place where  everyone can think explicitly about each of them.  Great ideas can come from anywhere—engineers, CEOs, designers, customers, product managers, customer service representatives, sales associates, etc.  Bring together whoever has input on the specific problem you’re focused on.  You can do this exercise with post-it notes on a whiteboard, or using online software such as <a href="https://www.subtask.co/">Subtask</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.subtask.co/uploads/subtask-example-task-board.png" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section data-level="2" id="-get-different-perspectives-and-discuss-tradeoffs"><h2>2. Get different perspectives and discuss tradeoffs</h2>
<p>Next, it’s time to build the effort/value matrix by discussing the costs and tradeoffs associated with each idea.  This is another part of the process where it’s important to have a variety of different perspectives in the discussion.  </p>
<p>If you’re developing a product roadmap, have an engineer there to speak to the feasibility of an idea, and a product owner to speak to the idea’s value.  Other perspectives can help too, depending on the phase you’re in: sales and marketing, business viability, customer usability, legal or financial constraints, etc.  </p>
<p>The purpose of bringing these perspectives together is to boil it down to a relative measure of Effort and Value.  </p>
<p><strong>Effort</strong> may be defined as the estimated time it might take, the relative complexity, or the number of unknowns.  <strong>Value</strong> may be a combination of market size, expected impact on customer usage, or the capacity for it to enable further work on other ideas.</p>
<p>In the course of the team’s discussion, a customer success manager might note that one item was requested frequently from users and an engineer might estimate that it’s a fairly low amount of work to implement.  As you have these discussions you can begin positioning each item in the effort value matrix.  </p>
<p><img src="https://www.subtask.co/uploads/subtask-effort-value-matrix-in-progress.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It’s ok that estimates are rarely precise.  It’s impossible to know whether a new feature will bring in revenue until customers can actually use it; and it’s impossible to know exactly how long it will take to build that feature until your engineers have dug into the code. But by bringing a number of perspectives together for this exercise, your team can greatly reduce the risk that they’re off target on one particular estimate, or over-indexing on a particular piece of the puzzle.   This helps to ensure that the effort and value measures you’ve assigned are in the right ballpark relative to each other.</p>

</section>
<section data-level="2" id="-recheck-your-assumptions"><h2>3. Recheck your assumptions</h2>
<p>Once you’ve placed each item in the matrix, take stock of how it all looks.  Do all the estimates for effort and value feel honest?  Often we end up with a matrix where it seems like everything was placed in the easy and valuable quadrant (we all like to be hopeful when we’re estimating).  </p>
<p>By doing this exercise in an effort/value matrix, you’re able to easily see this and guard against it.  If you only went through a list of tasks one by one to assigned estimates, and never related them spatially on the effort-value matrix, you’d probably never be aware of the bias your team brings to your planning.  </p>
<p>It’s important as a team to recheck and question assumptions.  Some of those assumptions might be backed by data that’s readily available, other assumptions might be based on experience, and others might just be guesswork.  With the effort/value grid in front of you, these important discussions will happen much more readily.  Is Feature A really less effort than Feature B?  Is Feature C really demanded by users as much as we think?  Is there a lot of uncertainty about how to build Feature D?</p>

</section>
<section data-level="2" id="-decide-what-to-focus-on-"><h2>4. Decide what to focus on.</h2>
<p>Once your team has reached a rough consensus on where each item belongs in the effort/value grid, you’ll want to turn that into a plan of action.  </p>
<p>Effort/value scores are just one signal you use to decide what to work on.  The team’s project leader may decide that it’s beneficial to do a batch of low-effort high-value work, while also exploring one or two high-effort/high-value ideas.  Some teams may choose to make this more of a group decision, and do an exercise like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-voting">dot-voting</a> to see where most of the team believes their effort should go.  In other cases, there might be dependencies to suss out that will determine which pieces of work need to come first.</p>
<p>Using your effort/value scores for guidance, you can begin to schedule and allocate the work to be done.  If your team uses an Agile Scrum approach, that might mean flagging a batch of work for a sprint, which the team will commit to.  As you complete this work, the team can return to the effort/value matrix and reassess whether the remaining work is still positioned appropriately, and decide what to allocate next.</p>
<p>Defining when a project or feature is “done” can often be a challenge.  Some teams and leaders may feel obligated to complete every requirement in the list, and sometimes it seems like there’s always more work to do.  When you have your work laid out in an effort/value grid it’s easier to draw a line where the costs outweigh the benefits.  Helping your team work more efficiently is as much about deciding what the team should not work on as it is about deciding what they should work on. </p>

<p>Using Subtask’s effort/value matrix, you’ll have these valuable signals at your fingertips so you can decide on the right work and achieve your goals faster, with less wasted time and effort.</p>
<p>In Subtask you can collaborate with your team in real-time, or asynchronously on their own time.  This means everyone can quickly and easily get into a board and start adding cards for their ideas.  You can either do this together in one room, with everyone looking at one screen, or remotely with everyone signed into the same Subtask board.  In both cases you’ll see everything that’s added as it happens.</p>
<p>You can configure your priority matrix to have the labels and colors that fit your current needs.  For example, you can change your axes and quadrants to urgent vs important, and change the color of each quadrant to highlight what to focus on or avoid.</p>
<p>After you’ve placed your ideas in the effort/value matrix, you can go back to the main list view and sort each column by effort and value so everyone can easily see what to do first.  This will place low-effort/high-value items at the top of your list, and high-effort/low-value items at the bottom (with high-value/high-effort, and low-value/low-effort mixed in between)</p>

<p>Minutes before Nitthin Chandran was set to present his startup to a powerful group of foreign investors, the power went out in his apartment in Bangalore. The timing couldn’t have been worse: power outages are par for the course in the city, where Chandran was presenting remotely via Zoom, but there was life-changing money on the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chandran, the founder of <a href="https://www.medpiper.com/">MedPiper Technologies</a>, was pitching his Indian hospital-staffing startup for this year’s Demo Day. The two-day event is the culmination of Silicon Valley’s most well-known startup accelerator program, Y Combinator; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/these-are-the-top-y-combinator-companies-of-all-time-based-on-valuation/">notable program graduates</a> include Airbnb, Stripe, and DoorDash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stakes were high, so Chandran came prepared: his Y Combinator–appointed mentor had advised him to upgrade his internet speed and<strong> </strong>make ready multiple backup options for situations just like this one. Saved by a spare dongle he’d bought on sale at his local market, Chandran delivered his one-minute pitch to an unseen audience of high-powered investors and thousands of viewers, all from his apartment in Bangalore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In spite of the blackout, Chandran kept his cool: “We practiced maybe 100 times before Demo Day.”</p>



<p>For the first time in its 15-year history, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/">Y Combinator went fully remote</a> with its famed startup accelerator program. With the coronavirus pandemic making travel and in-person meetings nearly impossible, everything from workshops to the all-important Demo Day went online. The remote experience may have flattened the in-person interactions that drive some of the tech industry’s biggest deals. But founders from non-Western markets say that attending Y Combinator remotely didn’t hinder their success — in fact, it helped. Internet connectivity issues aside, foreign founders say the first fully remote Y Combinator has put these companies on a more equal footing with their American counterparts.</p>

<p>In pre-pandemic times, founders accepted to Y Combinator were flown to San Francisco, where they spent three months developing their startups <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/02/12/y-combinator-demo-days-2019-san-francisco.html">before presenting to funders at Demo Day</a>. For non-American founders with operations outside the United States, this often meant spending a full financial quarter away from their teams and home markets to attend workshops and networking events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You talk to other international founders, and they’re like, Oh yeah, I spent most of YC on a plane,” said Iain Usiri, a Tanzanian founder whose startup <a href="https://www.ramani.io/">Ramani</a> presented at last week’s Demo Day. By going remote, “The biggest logistical problem is solved,” he said. “You’re on par with a U.S. founder who is in his home market.”</p>



<p>Under normal circumstances, Usiri might’ve fretted over his outfit choice or physical gestures on Demo Day. “Personally, I do well on a stage,” he said. But this time, he and other founders in his class invested in backup internet, high-quality microphones, and new lighting, to ensure their Zoom presentations go as smoothly as possible. A remote presentation has its own anxieties: Usiri said he was so paranoid about power outages in his home in Tanzania, he had nightmares about it leading up to Demo Day. Nicolás López, co-founder of Justo, <a href="https://www.getjusto.com/">a Chilean food-delivery startup</a>, said he worried about competing with social media notifications and emails that might be popping up on investors’ screens during their demo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But logging onto Y Combinator from the comfort of their home markets meant founders could maintain their startups while benefiting from Y Combinator’s coveted mentorships. “Between when we applied for Y Combinator in March and today, we grew our team from 10 to 95,” said López. “I don’t think we would have been able to do that if we had been in Palo Alto for the past three months.”</p>



<p>In Bangalore, MedPiper’s Chandran, who is building a database of verified doctors and nurses in India, was able to take in-person meetings during the period. He said he signed up to 40,000 medical professionals during his time with Y Combinator. “We don’t think we would have done even 60 to 70% of the sales which we were able to close [had we been away],” Chandran told <em>Rest of World.</em> “All these sales were done in person, walking into hospitals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paradoxically, the remote nature of this year’s Y Combinator meant more face time between founders and partners. “I was asking for office hours all the time, sometimes three meetings a week with partners,” Arthur Alvarenga, founder of Brazilian startup <a href="https://chatpay.com.br/">ChatPay</a> said. “Everyone was very available, and with Zoom, things moved faster. You could get on a call faster than going to campus to meet with them if we were in person.”</p>

<p>Crucially, the pandemic has forced investors to consider any and all investments remotely; it’s leveled the playing field. Alvarenga, based in Brazil, might’ve missed out on chances for in-person meetings. But on Zoom, he’s just as remote as a founder in Boston. Both current and former non-Western Y Combinator participants said that funders are now more willing to take meetings and close deals over Zoom, where they once might have required an in-person meeting. Foreign founders in this batch of Demo Day presenters said they walked away from the event with more than 100 interested investors — far more than they could muster in their local markets.</p>



<p>Thomas Hellman, professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at Oxford’s Saïd Business School, said that the remote nature of today’s business environment has changed investor behavior, perhaps to the benefit of non-American founders.<strong> </strong>“Investors who said they would never invest unless they met a person have now written checks to entrepreneurs without meeting them,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a willingness to close deals over Zoom hasn’t changed some of the inherent challenges in raising money as a foreign startup. U.S.-based companies still constitute the majority of the Y Combinator batch: 39 of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/">197 startups participated</a> from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Hellman said that, in lieu of organic meetings and face-to-face interactions, venture capital firms are likely to rely on their own referral networks, which he said are essentially frozen during the pandemic. “The biggest thing to look out for is how networks are going to retrench,” he said. “That could lead to more privileged entrepreneurs having access to capital.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a more remote-friendly environment, Hellmann said foreign startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/22/foreign-startup-founders-face-unique-struggles-to-break-funding-barrier/">still face higher barriers to raising funds</a>. Local companies may still have an advantage, even if it’s a smaller one. “Just because Zoom is making this more democratized, it doesn’t change the fact that some investors are just not going to understand your market or want to invest outside the United States,” said Alvarenga. “And that’s a root problem.”</p>



<p>But for the half a dozen founders from this summer’s batch of presenters who spoke with <em>Rest of World, </em>internet outages and Zoom presentations were minor inconveniences compared to their otherwise positive Y Combinator experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The real value of YC is the network,” said Alvarenga. “The more quality people you put in, the better the network becomes.”</p>

<p><em>If you want to get a competitive edge, building a culture of experimentation is critical. It can result in cost savings, higher revenue, and improved user experience.&nbsp;</em></p>


<p>People have been building scientific and technological innovations through testing and experimentation for centuries.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Eratosthenes measured the circumference of Earth 2,000 years ago.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Newton's prism experiment proved color is an inherent property of light itself.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Marie Curie, using an instrument called electrometer, found that radioactivity is an inherent property of individual atoms that emanates from their internal structure.</p>


<p>These experiments have paved the way for modern medicine, geography, energy, communication, physics, etc.&nbsp;</p>


<p>In today's technological world, experimentation holds the same power when it comes to innovation.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Some of the biggest companies, like Amazon, Netflix, and Google, use this scientific method to challenge the status quo. In return, they innovate, grow, and improve.</p>


<p>Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, has said: “Our success at Amazon is a function of how many experiments we do per year, per month, per week, per day.”</p>


<p>Mark Zuckerberg has reported that the company conducts thousands of experiments at any given time.</p>


<p>As far back as 2008, Google was already leveraging its search engine users to simultaneously conduct 50–200 experiments.</p>


<p>The end goal of this "test everything" mentality? To roll out new products, get past the competition, improve customer experience, and try new business models.&nbsp;</p>





<h2 id="why-an-experimentation-culture-is-valuable">Why an Experimentation Culture is Valuable</h2>


<p>Only a decade ago, Yahoo was on a par with Google. The two tech giants were competing fiercely to conquer the territory of the World Wide Web. But Google's ferocious experimentation led the company on a path of continuous improvement. Today, Google has a market share of 92.17%, Bing has 2.78%, and Yahoo has 1.6%.</p>


<p>But not all experiments yield successful innovations.&nbsp;</p>


<p>At Google and Bing, about <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/the-surprising-power-of-online-experiments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10% to 20% of controlled experiments</a> have positive results. One-third of experiments at Microsoft prove effective, one-third have neutral results, and one-third have negative results.</p>


<p>But that capability to test out everything to see what works and what doesn't has given these companies a competitive edge.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Experimentation has helped Bing make dozens of monthly improvements, which collectively have boosted revenue per search by 10% to 25% a year.&nbsp;</p>


<p>When Facebook tested a secondary "Explore" Feed to its primary News Feed in six countries that let users discover content that they haven't explored yet, it resulted in a 60-80% engagement rate.</p>


<p>To sum up: although experimentation may scare you with its tiny success rate, the benefits can help a company iterate quickly, fail fast, and pivot.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 id="how-to-build-an-experimentation-culture">How to Build an Experimentation Culture</h2>


<p>Successful innovation requires building a culture of experimentation at a company-level. A culture of experimentation involves nurturing employees' curiosity, listening to data, allowing everyone to conduct or commission a test, and managers accepting a new model of leadership.&nbsp;</p>


<h3 id="a-culture-of-experimentation-starts-with-accepting-failure">A Culture of Experimentation Starts With Accepting Failure</h3>


<p>"Failure and invention are inseparable twins." It's what Jeff Bezos says. And he's a smart man.</p>


<p>Building a culture of experimentation starts with the engineering manager accepting that failure will happen, but that shouldn't be an obstacle to continue experimenting.</p>


<p>Instead, failure should be viewed as an inherent and integral part of the learning process.&nbsp;</p>


<p>When leaders accept it as such, it will send a message to the entire company that failure isn't something to be dreaded or scared of. It means the company is learning, growing, and with each experiment, it's closer to achieving its goals.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Everyone involved will feel more comfortable giving feedback, sharing ideas, and brainstorming. Creative minds at the company will be unleashed to try big, new, unproven ideas, and at the same time, business executives will get guaranteed results fast.</p>


<h3 id="small-changes-can-generate-huge-benefits">Small Changes Can Generate Huge Benefits</h3>


<p>We'll use one of Microsoft's real-life stories as an example.&nbsp;</p>


<p>In 2008, an employee suggested having a new tab automatically open when a user clicks on the Hotmail link, instead of opening in the same tab.&nbsp;</p>


<p>A seemingly small change, but when it was tested on 900,000 users in the UK, the engagement of users who opened Hotmail increased by a whopping 8.9%. In 2010, the company introduced the change to 2.7 million users in the US, and it yielded the same results.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Amazon did a similar thing when it moved its credit card offers from the home page to the shopping cart page. The result? Profits increased by tens of millions of dollars annually.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The lesson in these stories is that there's value in introducing a small change quickly, to a small set of users, in order for your engineers to learn whether you're building the right thing.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Starting small is a better option than polishing a large feature, introducing it to a large user base, only to hear a few weeks or months later that the business goals have not been achieved or that the key metric hasn't changed.&nbsp;</p>


<h3 id="more-experiments-are-better-than-few">More Experiments Are Better Than Few</h3>


<p>Many companies today run tens of thousands of online experiments every year. Out of those tens of thousands of experiments, only a few will be successful.</p>


<p>Although it sounds expensive, it's actually riskier to run only a few experiments per year than a thousand.&nbsp;</p>


<p>When you conduct a large number of experiments, a few will be successful. The success of those few experiments will make the financial costs of a string of failed experiments irrelevant.&nbsp;</p>


<p>On the other hand, if you run only a few experiments annually and none of them prove successful, you'll be left dealing with a substantial financial loss.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Failing is useful because it allows <a href="https://adevait.com/software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">software developers</a> to eliminate unfavorable ideas and focus their attention on more-promising solutions.</p>


<div><figure><img src="https://content.adevait.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Experiments-1024x517.png" alt="culture of experimentation"></figure></div>


<h3 id="rely-on-data-not-on-strong-opinions">Rely on Data, Not on Strong Opinions</h3>


<p>Every company has people working there, and people have strong opinions. When results from an experiment clash with strong opinions by a team or employee, make sure the empirical results of your online experiments prevail.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The tale of Ron Johnson when he became the CEO of JC Penney is another great story that carries a lesson.</p>


<p>When Johnson joined the company in 2011, he had a bold new plan in mind: he would use technology to eliminate the need for cashiers, get rid of coupons and clearance racks, and fill the stores with branded pieces.</p>


<p>Almost 17 months later, sales had decreased, significant losses were experienced, and ultimately, Johnson had lost his job.&nbsp;</p>


<p>What happened?</p>


<p>Unfortunately, many managers in the business realm lack sufficient data or relevant experience to lead their business decisions. Many managers also rely more on their intuition than on numbers.</p>


<p>If the experiment tells you that you should remove the green button, you remove the green button.&nbsp;</p>


<p>This doesn't mean that managers shouldn't be listened to on all occasions. When it comes to making strategic decisions that can't be tested, managers' input holds value.</p>


<p>But all things that can be tested in a company should be tested. Experiments can guide managers' decisions and fuel healthy debates. Even if those debates end up in overruling the data, at least the company is conscious of the experiments' results and is making a move that's in the company's best interest.&nbsp;</p>


<div><figure><img src="https://content.adevait.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/A-B-testing-1024x676.png" alt="A/B testing culture of experimentation"></figure></div>


<h3 id="keep-the-feedback-coming">Keep the Feedback Coming</h3>


<p><a href="https://adevait.com/software/feedback-for-software-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Giving feedback to your software developers</a> can inspire them to do future tasks even better and with higher motivation. It can engage an underperforming individual to improve his/her performance to a higher level.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Feedback is also the only way to ensure an employee doesn't continue making the same mistakes.</p>


<p>The majority of employees are interested in hearing feedback from their managers; however, what they crave for is specific feedback.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Specific feedback is telling your engineer what they're doing right and where there's room for improvement.&nbsp;</p>


<p>For example, instead of saying to your <a href="https://adevait.com/javascript-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JavaScript developer</a>, "You could be more proactive," say, "You said you would come up with some ideas for overcoming the issue with <a href="https://adevait.com/software/technical-debt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical debt</a>, but I still haven’t received anything. Is there some problem?"</p>


<p>One great way of giving feedback is the SBI (Situational, Behavior, Impact) Framework.</p>


<p>The SBI framework outlines a simple structure that you can use to give feedback:</p>


<ol><li><strong>Situation</strong>: define the where and the when of the situation you're referring to.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Behavior</strong>: describe the specific behavior of the employee in the situation you're referring to.</li><li><strong>Impact</strong>: say how the person's behavior has impacted you or others.</li></ol>


<p>In the long run, this can lead to higher performance, unlike less specific feedback that just informs employees of whether they are performing well.</p>


<h3 id="finally-celebrate-your-wins-and-learn-from-your-failures">Finally, Celebrate Your Wins and Learn From Your Failures</h3>


<p>When an experiment yields a successful innovation, celebrate! Celebrating your successes and giving credit where it is due will motivate others to become a part of the culture of experimentation at your company.&nbsp;</p>


<p>And when you fail, learn from it! Even if it's a failed experiment, failures can steer you in the right direction when you lack answers or people have conflicting opinions about an idea.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Within the last decades web technologies have evolved in a very rapid way. Nowadays, with things like WebAssembly, PWA, constantly progressing browser API and other surrounding technologies, web has a great potential to become a universal platform for a wide range of tasks and applications.</p><p>With web app’s area of responsibility expanding, more attention is paid to app performance. User experience became an important thing to care about, especially when you develop an app that runs on multiple devices.</p><p>To be able to manage performance appropriately, one need to know how the rendering pipeline of the browser works and where potential bottlenecks can be found.</p><h2 id="page-rendering">Page Rendering</h2><p>Web page load simply starts from entering the URL in the address bar. In fact, a bunch of things happen right after that and even before HTML request is done. Some of them can influence the performance, but we’ll leave this part for another dedicated article. Now we are interested in things happening when the HTML file has been loaded:</p><ol><li><strong>Parse HTML</strong>
HTML document parsed and the DOM tree as we know it has been built.</li><li><strong>Recalculate Styles</strong>
All kind of stylesheets are parsed. <em>Render tree</em> is built. <em>Render tree</em> contains DOM tree nodes that are going to be displayed. Thus, <code>head</code> tag is excluded as well as <code>style</code> and <code>script</code>. Elements with CSS <code>display</code> property set to <code>none</code> are also ignored. On the other hand, pseudo elements, such as <code>:after</code> and <code>:before</code>, are included. Moreover, every text line becomes a single block.</li><li><strong>Layout</strong> (also called <em>reflow</em>)
A collection of blocks generated from the render tree. All the block dimensions, that are dependent on each other, are calculated.</li><li><strong>Paint</strong>
Rasterization of the blocks and texts. Images decoding and resize if necessary also happen here.</li><li><strong>Layer Composition</strong>
Composition of the visual layers that can be processed and painted independently.</li></ol><p>All the phases can be found in the Chrome DevTools’ Performance tab. In reality some of the steps above happen in parallel, e.g. CSS and HTML parsing since HTML document contains styles and stylesheet links in it, so it makes sense to perform DOM and CSSOM processing in parallel. </p><p>Any time you want to change a view on the page using javascript (or CSS animation) this pipeline gets fired. Although it is not necessary to parse HTML file and rebuild the whole render tree (usually only part of it), a proper processing for the visual update is required. Depending on requested changes, browser skips some of the steps, but in general, the pipeline would look like this:</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/dc48e4bd5b41dac0b0e8cb64a8e603c9/6dbf2/frame.jpg" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/dc48e4bd5b41dac0b0e8cb64a8e603c9/6dbf2/frame.jpg 1093w" sizes="(max-width: 1093px) 100vw, 1093px" alt="Image of Frame Pipeline"></p><h2 id="problem">Problem</h2><p>You might not need to know all of this when you’re just adding a couple of paragraphs, or modifying background color once every blue moon. Everything changes when it comes to a complex animation and continuous DOM updates. Normally contemporary screens have frequency 60Hz, which means that new frame ought to be rendered 60 times per second (60 FPS). Therefore, browser have <code>1000/60 ≈ 16ms</code> for doing his job on every frame. If it takes more time, the FPS decreases, animation might become jerky and user gets disappointed.</p><p>In the old browsers animation was usually implemented with <code>setTimeout</code> (or <code>setInterval</code>) function, which wasn’t initially designed for this purpose. <code>setTimeout</code> (or <code>setInterval</code>) function knows nothing about the browser reflow, thus visual changes might be requested at the middle of the pipeline, cancelling the last steps of the work on a previous frame and causing recalculations. Therefore we have missing frames and possible worthless work done, which might be critical in the scale of 16 ms and leads to janky animations.</p><h2 id="solution">Solution</h2><p>Fortunately, modern browsers have a proper method to deal with it. <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> is the browser API that provides a sufficient way to perform animations. The call for this function (with a callback as a first argument) asks the browser to call it right before the next styles calculation, so it won’t get interrupted in the middle of the next frame processing. </p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    </span><span>changeTheDOM</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span></p></pre></div><p>There is a common way to implement continuous javascript animation:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>let</span><span> prevAnimationTime</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>handleFrame</span><span>(</span><span>currentAnimationTime</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>prevAnimationTime</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>    prevAnimationTime </span><span>=</span><span> currentAnimationTime</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> diffTime </span><span>=</span><span> currentAnimationTime </span><span>-</span><span> prevAnimationTime</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>    </span><span>changeDOM</span><span>(</span><span>diffTime</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    </span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>handleFrame</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>handleFrame</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>The first argument that is passed to the callback is the time in milliseconds passed from the navigation start (from the <a href="https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp#The_time_origin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">time origin</a>). We can use it to know the time difference with the last frame and adapt our animation properly. We can use <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> return value to stop an animation with <code>cancelAnimationFrame</code>:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>let</span><span> requestID</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>handleFrame</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    </span><span>changeDOM</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>    requestID </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>handleFrame</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>startAnimation</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    requestID </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>handleFrame</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>stopAnimation</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>    </span><span>cancelAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>requestID</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="forced-reflow-layout">Forced Reflow (Layout)</h2><p>However, there are underwater rocks. There is a set of methods and attributes that require browser to know a layout state, e.g. <code>offsetWidth</code>, <code>getComputedStyle()</code> and others. In other words, if you do changes to the layout and then request such a property a few lines after, browser will have to recalculate all the size relations and perform layout step twice. Which, again, on the scale of 16 ms has consequences on performance.</p><p>You can find the full list of methods and properties that trigger forced layout <a href="https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5d52fb081b3570c81e3a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. </p><p>Also I would recommend this <a href="https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/course-notes/browser-rendering-optimization.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">course</a> from Paul Lewis and Cameron Pittman which talks in details about rendering pipeline and optimizations. </p><h2 id="frontend-monitoring">Frontend Monitoring</h2><p>Asayer is a frontend monitoring tool that replays everything your users do and shows how your web app behaves for every issue.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><code>requestAnimationFrame</code> (rAF) is a browser API that allows the execution of code before the next available frame on the device display.</p><pre><pre><p><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>timestamp</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>All modern JavaScript animation libraries, like <a href="https://framer.com/motion">Framer Motion</a>, use this API to increment the visual properties of DOM elements, 3D models, or canvas contexts to create motion on the web.</p><p>However, it isn't a guarentee that this method <em>will</em> run before every frame. A browser might choose to run <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> at lower intervals, and this leads to jerky animations.</p><p>Look at these two boxes:</p><p>If your browser <em>doesn't</em> fall into one of the situations we'll explore in this post, the top box will be animating smoothly at 60fps. The second box is artificially running at half the framerate of the top box. You can see how apparent the effect of halving the framerate is for the smoothness of animations.</p><p>Because the situations in which a browser might choose to throttle <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> aren't always obvious or consistent, debugging these animations can be a mind-bending experience.</p><p>If you're on this page, you might well have arrived via Google, trying to understand why your JavaScript animation is janky. I imagine you sat there, as I once was, with two identical iPhones side by side, running the same JavaScript animation, one at the expected 60fps and one at a jerky 30fps.</p><p>You're not going crazy. Your browser is. Let's take a look at when and why browsers throttle <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>.</p><h2 id="ios-throttles raf in low-power mode">iOS throttles rAF in low-power mode</h2><p>Discovering this was a real test of sanity. Debugging animations on an old website, I noticed all the animations were janky on my phone.</p><p>Suspecting garbage collection or other source of low-performing animations, I tried to debug on my MacBook. Nothing unusual about memory consumption. I set CPU throttling to maxium. Still 60fps.</p><p>I put my phone next to my partner's, same OS, same make and model. 60fps on hers, unmistakably 30 on mine.</p><p>I started to suspect the paint job. But then I spotted this on my screen:</p><img src="https://mattperry.is/photos/code/low-power-mode.png"><p>Toggling low-power mode on and off had an immediate effect on the smoothness of the animations. I found <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=168837">a Webkit issue</a> that confirmed iOS throttles <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> in low-power mode, along with <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169138">all CSS animations</a>.</p><p>It's a clever battery-saving trick, and one of an infinite array of examples why developing against mobile browsers is such a dreadful, soul-crushing experience.</p><p>iOS app developers are <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/EnergyGuide-iOS/LowPowerMode.html">given the ability and responsibility</a> to respond to low-power mode. Yet Webkit's characteristic obstinence is the reason why Battery Status API is now <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Battery_Status_API">deprecated</a>.</p><h2 id="safari-throttles raf in cross-origin iframes">Safari throttles rAF in cross-origin iframes</h2><p>The example at the top of the frame is running in a cross-origin iframe. "Cross origin" essentially means that iframe is serving content from a different domain from that of this site.</p><p>If you're using Safari, you may have noticed that not even the first box was running very smoothly. Go back and click inside the iframe. The animation should start running as expected.</p><p>The <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170534">Webkit ticket</a> doesn't provide a reason for this behaviour. To speculate, iframes are commonly used for advertising. Adverts are liberal with your CPU cycles, often using quite overt attention-stealing animations.</p><p>So the throttling is an attempt to prevent adverts from draining your battery. The framerate is uncapped on interaction because that's considered a sign of intent that the content is acceptable by the user.</p><p>In an age of ad-blockers this solution feels like the wrong approach. Preferably, iOS would take a more aggressive stance against adverts by default, then revert this change.</p><p>Make the web less shit, not more shit.</p><h2 id="firefox-obliterates javascript time accuracy for privacy features">Firefox obliterates JavaScript time accuracy for privacy features</h2><p>I was first made aware of this via a ticket about <a href="https://github.com/framer/motion/issues/441">laggy animations in Firefox</a>. Firefox users across browsers and devices were all reporting the same issue, but I couldn't replicate it myself on any operating system.</p><p>It turns out that Firefox has an anti-tracking privacy setting called <code>resistFingerprinting</code> that, if enabled, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1394735#c1">reduces JavaScript time accuracy to 100ms</a>.</p><p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1440863">This Bugzilla ticket</a> details the ramifications of Mozilla lowering the accuracy of <code>performance.now()</code> to just 2ms(!). That's considered low enough to cause havoc in game calculations, so 100ms is certainly low enough to wreck animations.</p><p>The previous cases of throttling we've seen only halved framerate. 100ms is enough to swallow six whole frames of animation! Callbacks provided to <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> receive the timestamp of the latest frame, and in animation libraries this is used to calculate the correct visual output. If the timestamp isn't accurate, the animations will be a visual manifestation of that.</p><p>Luckily there is a potential fix. The MDN (RIP) page for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now#Reduced_time_precision">performance.now()</a> says that serving content with the following headers will allow your page to access high resolution timers:</p><pre><pre><p><span>Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin</span></p><p><span>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp</span></p></pre></pre><p>High resolution timers === smooth animation.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p><code>requestAnimationFrame</code> is just that - a request. It's to the browser's discretion whether that request is granted, and as we've seen, there are a variety of situations where it might not.</p><p>It's a trade off. By degrading the quality of the experience for users, browsers can improve their battery life, or hide them from advertising companies.</p><p>The quality of the web experience is currently at an all-time low, so in my opinion it's a shame to see anything making it even worse.</p><p>For the sanity of the developers having to work with these browsers, the very least I could ask is that, when enforced, these throttling techniques were flagged in the Performance tab. It would give us sharable and repeatable reproduction steps for ourselves and users to follow when they encounter this bizarre behaviour, as the next optimisation is always around the corner...</p><blockquote><p>Discovered more throttling madness? Hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/mattgperry">Twitter</a>!</p></blockquote></article></div>]]>

                        <p><strong>This summer, a team of researchers, engineers and a drone pilot of TU Delft travelled to an airbase in Germany for the first real test flight of the scaled flight model of the energy-efficient aircraft design called the Flying-V. The project was announced last year together with KLM. After a period of extensive wind tunnel testing and a series of ground tests in the Netherlands, it was time to perform the first flight and obtain an impression of the flight characteristics. The aircraft had a very successful maiden flight.</strong></p><p>Project leader Dr Roelof Vos and his team of researchers and engineers took the 22.5 kg and 3 m wide scale model of the Flying-V for flight tests to a well-guarded airbase in Germany, where they could work together with a team from Airbus. The pilot’s task was to take-off, fly a number of test manoeuvres and approaches until the batteries were nearly empty and land. And he succeeded. Vos: “One of our worries was that the aircraft might have some difficulty lifting-off, since previous calculations had shown that ‘rotation’ could be an issue. The team optimized the scaled flight model to prevent the issue but the proof of the pudding is in the eating. You need to fly to know for sure.” Rotation on take-off was performed easily and occurred at a speed of 80 km/h. The plane’s thrust was good and flight speeds and angles were as predicted.</p><p>But testing new technology is never straightforward. The team had a challenging week in which they had to change the centre of gravity of the aircraft and fix the antenna to improve telemetry. The flight has now also confirmed that the current design still shows too much ‘Dutch roll’, causing a slightly rough landing. A next step for the team is to use the data collected during the flight for an aerodynamic (software) model of the aircraft. This will make it possible to programme it in a flight simulator to be used in future research , while further improving the flight characteristics. The team will also prepare the scale model for future flight tests.&nbsp;</p><div id="c651315">

</div><div id="c650988"><p>The Flying-V is a design for a highly energy-efficient long-distance aeroplane. The aircraft’s design integrates the passenger cabin, the cargo hold and the fuel tanks in the wings, creating a spectacular V-shape. Computer calculations have predicted that the aircraft’s improved aerodynamic shape and reduced weight will reduce fuel consumption by 20% compared to today’s most advanced aircraft. KLM has been a partner in the project since 2019. Also due to their support, the project team has been able to build this scale model. It was first presented at the 100th anniversary of KLM in October 2019. Various business partners are now involved in the project, including Airbus. Airbus is also an explicit supporter for the first flight. The partners are working together on a research plan to fine-tune the concept. Next step: providing the Flying-V with sustainable propulsion, taking into account that the design seems highly suitable to carry liquid hydrogen instead of kerosene. </p></div><div id="c650998"><p><em>Webcast</em>: On 1 September Dr. Roelof Vos and Prof. Henri Werij showed and explained what happened during the test week.

<p><span>I</span>n February 2019, Amos Dov Silver, a slight man in his mid-30s who often wears his shoulder-length hair in a bun, received a Telegram message inviting him to a wedding in Ukraine. The sender had worked with Silver for more than two years and wanted him to stand in for his father at the altar. “As you know, I don’t have a family,” he wrote. Silver agreed, and the following month, he flew from Arizona to Kyiv. Less than 48 hours later, he awoke to find five Israeli police officers standing in his hotel room.</p>



<p>Silver, an American-Israeli from a Hasidic background, started using his Facebook page as a marketplace to connect marijuana dealers with buyers in 2015, after years of loudly advocating for the drug’s legalization in Israel. This was four years after the emergence of <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-drugs-murder">Silk Road</a>, which quickly became the gold standard for decentralized, anonymous marketplaces operating on the darknet. Founded by the American Ross Ulbricht (whose online <em>nom de guerre </em>was<em> </em>“Dread Pirate Roberts”), Silk Road was estimated to be worth over $1 billion within two years of its founding, selling everything from pot to AK-47s. As the website grew in notoriety, Ulbricht became a model for a new generation of digital drug kingpins — and, with his arrest in 2013, a harbinger of what might await successors like Silver.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Israel decriminalized recreational marijuana use in 2017, Silver and a team of coders and managers transferred their service to the Russian messaging platform Telegram. The app is popular with activists and journalists around the world because of its end-to-end encryption, which means that the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt a message are stored with only the sender and receiver. This makes it essentially impossible for anyone, even the app maker, to decode an intercepted message. Thanks to this built-in anonymity, buying drugs through Telegrass became as easy as ordering a pizza. Unlike traditional drug cartels, Telegrass leadership doesn’t profit from individual deals; instead, to advertise their wares, dealers pay 420 shekels ($122.25) for access to the platform. Unscrupulous sellers are kicked off and get their names posted on a “wall of shame.”</p>



<p>When Telegrass arrived in Ukraine in 2017, its operators found conditions perfectly suited to running a black-market business. A permissive legal landscape and weak rule of law — as well as the large number of visiting Israelis — made it a natural candidate for Telegrass’ expansion. Additionally, while most countries mandate some form of identity verification to purchase a SIM card and register a phone number, Ukraine — along with Israel and the United States — does not, making it impossible for law enforcement to trace Telegram accounts registered under a phone number.</p>



<p>Soon after Telegrass launched in Ukraine, thousands of competing channels emerged, with the most popular attracting tens of thousands of subscribers. The old style of drug dealing, based on face-to-face interactions between consumers and dealers, disappeared. Viacheslav Markov, dean of the Faculty of Cyber Police at the Kharkiv National University of Internal Affairs, has said that 90% of drug sales in Ukraine now occur via Telegram. Viacheslav Safonov, the deputy head of Ukraine’s Department for Combating Drug Crimes, concurs. In addition to being better for advertising, the new system is safer for dealers. When buyers knew who they had purchased drugs from, there was an inclination to “share” that information with law enforcement when pressed. Now, that’s no longer possible.</p>



<p>In prosecuting Silver, Israeli authorities claimed that “Telegrass changed the face of crime.” Less than two years after his arrest, it’s unclear whether Silver was personally responsible for transforming the drug market or if he was simply an early and influential adopter of technology that would become the status quo. Whichever is true, it’s clear that, in many parts of the world, the system that Telegrass perfected has become the dominant model for buying and selling illegal drugs.</p>

<p><strong>In Kyiv, graffiti</strong> advertising Telegram drug channels is visible on nearly every city block, with tags directing buyers to @go420, @Kushcrew, or @kyivweeds. David Plaster, who runs the Kyiv-based nonprofit Anomaly, said his organization painted over more than 15,000 tags over the last 18 months, half in the capital alone. But as soon as the graffiti is eliminated, more appears. And removing it has little impact on business. Marijuana, which is grown in outlying cities near Kyiv, accounts for an estimated 13 billion hryvnias ($500,000,000) in sales per month across Ukraine. The operations are decentralized, so employees often have no idea who they’re working with, or for. That means that even if low-level dealers get busted, suppliers and distributors remain hidden from law enforcement. “Even with a sting operation, faking a channel, you can only get the buyer; it doesn’t help with the supply chain,” Plaster explained. “You can’t crack that closed loop.”</p>

<p>Once a customer joins a drug channel on Telegram, a bot will typically respond with a menu of items available for purchase. On a typical day, offerings might include a popular strain called Gagarin, named for the Soviet cosmonaut, which is advertised as a hybrid with “aromas of mint and blueberry,” or a strain called White Russian, which is earthy and spicy with “cheese flavor.” When a customer makes a selection, an anonymous operator will send a link asking for payment via cryptocurrency or through an encrypted payment platform, which in Ukraine is usually EasyPay, a Belarusian e-payment platform that allows money transfers to be made via a phone number rather than a bank account. After the money is received, the seller will send an image that includes an address or GPS coordinates signaling where the drugs are hidden.</p>



<p>That day, March 12, law enforcement agents from Israel, the U.S., Ukraine, and Germany arrested 42 people in those countries in connection with Telegrass, the encrypted drug marketplace that Silver co-founded and ran. Directed by the Israel National Cyber Directorate, the bust marked the final stage of an international operation to take down the enterprise, which, by 2018, grossed an estimated $17 million a month in sales. Telegrass was one of the world’s biggest app-based drug markets, and, from Israel, it migrated to Germany, Ukraine, and other countries in Europe, spawning countless copycats.</p>



<p>The main downside of a fully anonymous marketplace is that it lends itself easily to fraud. Common scams include sellers accepting money before deleting a Telegram conversation or simply giving buyers phony drop-off locations. “[The channels are] often operated by men in prison who send these messages on their phones,” an anonymous buyer told <em>Rest of World</em>, adding that he would frequently have to try four or five different services before finding one that worked. Safonov, of the country’s anti-drug office, confirms that this kind of fraud makes up “one of the main types of ‘earnings’ for prisoners,” who will offer products at lower price points to target “novice consumers and those trying to save money.”</p>



<p>High levels of police mistrust have also contributed to theories that police are not only protecting the drug trade but actively participating in it. Telegram user @glodov, who advocates for marijuana legalization in Ukraine, claims that certain drug delivery channels are operated by police as avenues for extortion. He cited an instance in which a buyer went to pick up a package and encountered two officers waiting for him. “They tell you that you need to pay $100 or $200, and then they will leave you alone,” he says. “They want you to pay not to go to jail.”</p>



<p>(This kind of institutionalized corruption hearkens back to an earlier era: In the post-Soviet 1990s, the country saw a boom in criminal gangs, with police often functioning as their enforcers. While Ukrainian officials initiated a massive police overhaul in 2015 to address structural problems in the force, only 7.7% of officers lost their jobs. Most appealed their dismissals and <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/where-is-ukraines-new-police-force/">were eventually reinstated</a>.</p>



<p>Safonov also acknowledges that there has been illegal collaboration between authorities and dealers, even recently. In one <a href="https://hromadske.ua/posts/kolishni-policejski-organizuvali-narkolaboratoriyu-na-kiyivshini">notable instance earlier this year</a>, former police officers were found operating a methadone and amphetamine lab in an industrial building on the outskirts of Kyiv. But, he insists, this was an exception for an otherwise by-the-book force: “Bad grass grows in every garden.”</p>

<p><strong>Regardless of who</strong> is selling, Telegram is, by design, extremely difficult to police. “With an end-to-end encrypted app, users can reasonably expect that investigators won’t be able to access their chats,” said Riana Pfefferkorn, Associate Director of Surveillance and Cybersecurity at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. While not all Telegram data is end-to-end encrypted, the company stores data in multiple centers controlled by different jurisdictions, to ensure that no government can access its systems. According to Pfefferkorn, “Companies such as Telegram and Signal intentionally minimize the amount of user metadata they store, precisely so that there is less that can be handed over to law enforcement if investigators come knocking.” (According to Telegram, while it will not interfere with private chats, it will block public channels it deems illegal, such as those belonging to terrorists and narcotraffickers.)</p>



<p>Even on an individual level, built-in accountability features can be easily circumvented. For instance, while each Telegram account must be …</p></div></div>

<p>

The Danish military intelligence service (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Defence_Intelligence_Service" target="_blank"><i>Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste</i></a> or FE), which is also responsible for signals intelligence, has been accused of unlawful activities and deliberately misleading the intelligence oversight board. </p><p>

After the oversight board (<a href="https://www.tet.dk/om-tilsynet/?lang=en" target="_blank"><i>Tilsynet med Efterretningstjenesterne</i></a> or TET) received information from a whistleblower, the head of the FE, Lars Findsen, and three other senior officials of the intelligence service were suspended.</p><p>

Here, I will provide a translation of the <a href="#press"><b>press release</b></a> of the oversight board, as well as details from its <a href="#reports"><b>earlier reports</b></a>, showing that there were problems at the FE for years. An overview of the <a href="#cooperation"><b>international cooperation</b></a> between the FE and foreign partner agencies provides a context for what likely went wrong at the Danish service.</p><p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MT_suhuKqVM/X0oAXcD0CnI/AAAAAAAAEuM/8_Rz2rYn7xMZZVLrSsktEVmwcYXpNVi1QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/fe-header.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MT_suhuKqVM/X0oAXcD0CnI/AAAAAAAAEuM/8_Rz2rYn7xMZZVLrSsktEVmwcYXpNVi1QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/fe-header.jpg" width="550"></a><br>

<p><span size="+2">Press release of the Oversight Board</span></p><p>

The affair came to light when on August 24, the Danish Ministry of Defense issued a short <a href="https://fmn.dk/nyheder/Pages/Ledende-medarbejdere-i-Forsvarets-Efterretningstjeneste-fritaget-fra-tjeneste-indtil-videre.aspx" target="_blank">statement</a> saying that the head of the FE and two other officials were suspended  from duty until further notice. Svend Larsen, the chief of Central and West Zealand Police, was appointed as acting chief of the FE. Later, a third official was also suspended.</p><p>

The same day, the Danish Intelligence Oversight Board published a <a href="https://www.tet.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PRESSEMEDDELELSE.pdf" target="_blank">press release</a> with the unclassified results of its investigation into the issues that led to Findsen's suspension.

PRESS RELEASE<p>

<b>The Intelligence Oversight Board completed a special investigation into the
Defense Intelligence Service (FE) on the basis of material submitted by
one or more whistleblowers.</b></p><p>

<i>In November 2019, one or more whistleblowers provided the Intelligence Oversight Board with a significant amount of material relating to the FE,
which the Board has not hitherto been aware of or able to acquire.
The material is of such a nature that the Board decided to focus its oversight
of the FE in order to carry out an in-depth investigation of the
present situation. With this announcement, the Board publishes the
unclassified results of the investigation.</i></p><p>


On the basis of the Board's investigation of the submitted material, the Board sent
an analysis in four volumes to the Minister of Defense containing
the Board's conclusions and recommendations on 21 August 2020.</p><p>

Throughout the process of the special investigation of the FE, the Board has held the
Minister of Defense informed. The Minister of Defense has regularly expressed support for
the Board's in-depth examination of the material.</p><p>

The Board's assessments and recommendations deal with matters that are fully or partially within its legal supervision authority according to  the FE Act and the rules and conditions based on it, which the Minister, in the opinion of the Board, should have
knowledge of, cf. § 16, stk. 2. of the FE Act.</p><p>

Based on a source-critical examination of the submitted material, the Board assesses, among other things, the following:</p><blockquote>
- That since the establishment of the Board in 2014 and until the summer of 2020, the FE has, among other things, on several occasions during the Board's inspections and meetings with the head of the FE, withheld key and crucial information and provided the Board with incorrect information regarding the service's collection and disclosure of information.<p>

The Board is of the opinion that the statutory duty to provide information is absolutely necessary for functional oversight and that it is based on trust by the legislator that the FE complies with this obligation in all respects. The result of these repeated breaches of the statutory duty to provide information is that the legality check that the Board is required to carry out under the FE Act, and which contributes to the legitimacy of the FE's work, does not work out as intended.</p><p>

- That at central parts of the FE's collection capabilities there are risks that can lead to unlawful collection against Danish citizens.</p><p>

- That the submitted material indicates that the FE's management has failed to follow up on, or further investigate indications of espionage within the Ministry of Defense.</p><p>

- That there is a culture of insufficient legal awareness within the FE's management and parts of the service, which results in unlawful activities or inappropriate situations within the service to be shelved, including not informing the Oversight Board about matters relevant to its supervision.</p><p>

- That the submitted material indicates that the FE, prior to the establishment of the Board in 2014, initiated operational activities in violation of the Danish law, including obtaining and passing on a significant amount of information about Danish citizens.</p><p>

- That the FE has unlawfully processed information about an employee of the Oversight Board.</p></blockquote>
<br>
Against this background, the Board recommends that a political position be taken on the following:<br>
<blockquote>
- Whether there should be an investigation into whether the FE has carried out and is carrying out its task as a national security authority within ​​the Ministry of Defense in accordance with § 1, stk. 2 of the FE Act.<p>

- The need to uncover whether the FE has adequately informed policy makers about all relevant issues concerning key parts of the service's collection capabilities.</p></blockquote>
<br>
Given the options of the FE Control Act, the Board does not have the possibilities to further uncover specific matters that emerge from the submitted material. Therefore, the Board generally recommends the following:<br>
<blockquote>
- That an early evaluation of the FE Act will be carried out to determine whether the Board has the necessary legal authorities and resources to carry out an effective legal oversight of the FE, including whether the Board must have the authority to conduct interrogations of the FE's employees as witnesses.<p>

- That, based on of the circumstances of the Board's receipt of the submitted material, an external whistleblower scheme for the FE is established, which can best be placed under the auspices of the Board.</p><p>

Such a scheme should improve the ability of current and former FE employees to comment on controversial issues without fear of retaliation, including employment or criminal consequences. Furthermore, such a scheme would allow classified information to be passed on in a secure environment. The scheme must also ensure that an external whistleblower body has the necessary resources and instruments to protect the persons who submit information according to this scheme.</p></blockquote>
<br>
The Board had thorough considerations regarding the publication of the conclusions and recommendations of the investigation. It is crucial for the oversight that the public has as much insight as possible. However, in the view of the extremely sensitive circumstances surrounding the submission of the material to the Board and its classified content, the Board may not provide further information to the public.<p>

<i><b>Facts about the Intelligence Oversight Board</b></i></p><p>

The Intelligence Oversight Board is a special independent monitoring body that supervises that the PET processes information about natural and legal persons in accordance with the law, and that the FE processes information about natural and legal persons domiciled in Denmark in accordance with the law. The Board was established by the Act on the Police Intelligence Service (PET), which, like the Act on the Defense Intelligence Service (FE), entered into force on 1 January 2014.</p><p>

Following the entry into force on 1 July 2014 of the Center for Cyber ​​Security (CFCS) Act, the Board has also monitored that CFCS processes information about natural persons in accordance with the legislation.</p><p>

The Board consists of five members appointed by the Minister of Justice after consultation with the Minister of Defense. The chairman, who has to be a High Court judge, is appointed on the recommendation of the Presidents of the Danish Eastern and Western High Courts, while the other members are appointed after consultation with the Parliamentary Committee for the Intelligence Services.</p><p>

The members are:</p><p>

- Michael Kistrup, High Court Judge, High Court of Eastern Denmark (Chairman)<br>
- Erik Jacobsen, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Roskilde University<br>
- Pernille Christensen, Legal Chief, National Association of Local Authorities<br>
- Professor Henrik Udsen, University of Copenhagen<br>
- Professor Rebecca Adler-Nissen, University of Copenhagen</p><p>

<p><span size="+2">Problems in earlier reports</span></p><p>

The FE's unauthorized and illegal activities described in the press release of the Oversight Board may actually not have come as a complete surprise.</p><p>

 Already in several earlier reports, the Oversight Board noticed that the FE conducted quite a large number of unlawful "raw data searches", which is the term used for untargeted interception. This method enables the FE to "obtain very large amounts of information (several hundred million communications per year)" - according the <a href="https://www.tet.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FE_UK_19.pdf" target="_blank">Annual Report 2018</a>.</p><p>

In the English version of its <a href="https://www.tet.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FE2018_uk_180219.pdf" target="_blank">Annual Report 2017</a>, in which the FE is mentioned as the Danish Defense Intelligence Service or DDIS, the oversight board says:</p><blockquote>
"the checks showed that in four instances DDIS engaged in unlawful targeted procurement
of information about persons resident in Denmark for a total of 20 days in 2014, eight months
in 2014-2015, four days in 2016 and 17 months in 2016-2017. The checks further showed that in
20 percent of the samples drawn DDIS made unlawful searches in raw data.<br>
 In the Oversight
Board’s opinion, the unlawful instances of procurement, including searches in raw data, were
in the nature of negligent actions in all cases. Similarly, the Oversight Board …</blockquote></div></div>

                <p><small>September 1st</small></p>
<p>I do a lot of work with web build systems and performance, but I got into
writing software because I like making products. With all the free time that the
pandemic has brought, I’ve been spending my off-hours teaching myself to write
Swift instead of screaming into the void. I missed writing product code and I
missed writing a compiled language with a nice IDE and a type system. I also
missed the speed and responsiveness that comes with native code that you only
get in the browser if you are extremely careful. So, I decided to try and build
an iOS app in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a>. This post is the first of a handful where I try to
digest what I’m working on. Think of this more as a journal than any sort of
tutorial.</p>
<h2>What are you making then?</h2>
<p>My goal is to make an app that will show me where I’ve been in New York on a
block-by-block basis. New York is big and I’ve only lived here for 5 years, so
an app that shows me where I’ve been might also show me what I’m missing.</p>

        </figure>
<p>From a technical perspective, I want to try and use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> to build
my app and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata">Core Data</a> to persist its data. I also want to avoid 3rd
party libraries if possible. If, like me, you’re new to a lot of this, SwiftUI
is Apple’s new view framework, and Core Data is Apple’s built-in data
persistence layer. I won’t go into a ton of detail on these libraries in this
post, but a little context seems important. I figure these constraints will
force me to get experience with the core pieces of iOS development, which is
most of why I’m writing this app in the first place.</p>
<h2>Getting New York’s road data</h2>
<p>To start, I need to think about how I want this app to work. Ideally, I want to
break streets up into segments by block. I’m defining a block here as <strong>the
chunk of a street between any two adjacent intersections</strong>. For example,
Division Avenue between Berry Street and Bedford Avenue is a block, as is Berry
Street between Division Avenue and S 11th Street. To do this, I’ll need a way to
represent a road segment so that I can store metadata about it. I’ll also need
to know every possible road segment in New York so that I know what I have and
have not visited. Getting at this data turns out to be not so straightforward.</p>
<h3>Apple Maps</h3>
<p>I started by looking at what Apple would give me. When you want to render a map,
Apple provides you with a view. They also provide you with a way to search for
locations and a way to get directions between two locations.</p>
<p>However, there’s no way to get at any of the data directly. If I want the names
of roads nearby, or even the name of the road that’s closest to my location, I’m
out of luck. I needed to be able to get a catalog of road segments and identify
the closest one from wherever I am. This data takes a while to collect, and
anyone who’s collected enough of it isn’t willing to give it away, with the
except the beautiful people who maintain OpenStreetMap.</p>

<h3>OpenStreetMap</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> is like Wikipedia for street data. It seemed like a natural
place to look since its data is free to use and is constantly being updated. The
reality is that map data is really, really big, and getting at the data for just
New York City is gross. OpenStreetMap lets you <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=13/40.7192/-73.9564&amp;layers=C">export</a> regions of
map data, but exporting an area bigger than that a square mile or so ends up
being too big a request for them to process. My options were either to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download a lot of smaller regions and stitch them together.</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://planet.openstreetmap.org/">all of OpenStreetMap’s data</a> in one big ol’ file and
extract the data I needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeing as I didn’t know much about how to use this data, neither option seemed
especially great. On the bright side, there are a few third parties that <a href="https://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/NewYork/">will
extract data</a> from OpenStreetMap for popular regions like cities. I
ended up finding and downloading some of the data for New York City, which ended
up being extremely detailed. The data included road segments, neighborhood
names, building shapes, and everything else you might imagine needs to be
represented on a map. It was also about a gig and a half of JSON, and while this
level of detail is great, I only really needed data on roads.</p>
<h3>New York’s Centerline Data</h3>
<p>Around this time, I learned about New York City’s Open Data initiative. They
host a project called <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b">The NYC Street Centerline</a>, which holds data
about New York’s roadbeds. It’s a fantastic start, but it’s not as polished as
OpenStreetMap’s data. For example, take a look at this screenshot of NYC’s data
on top of Google Maps. The blue lines are roads rendered from Centerline data.
Note the discrepancies, especially around driveways, walking paths, and parking
lots.</p>

<p>It also appears to be missing a lot of data about roads through some parks and
cemeteries, which would be nice to know about. Here’s what Woodlawn Cemetery
looks like, for example:</p>

<p>I’m betting OpenStreetMap’s data is more accurate than NYC’s here, but NYC’s
data is a solid start. It’s exclusively road data, so the actual file size is
about ten times smaller than the OpenStreetMap data for New York. Plus, it comes
with a bunch of fun attributes, like how wide the road is, the street numbers on
each side, and even what priority the street gets when snow needs to be plowed.
I’m betting I’ll want to end up using OpenStreetMap at some point, but for now
this seems like a good way to get started.</p>
<h2>Making sense of a 134.5MB JSON file</h2>
<p>Centerline hosts their data in a bunch of different types of formats, but most
of them looked like they’d require extra parsing to make sense of, as though
they were all just created from dumps of a <a href="https://postgis.net/">geospatial database</a>. For
example, JSON-formatted data was a list of un-keyed data, with the road’s
coordinates encoded as a <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/geodatabase/10.0/sdk/arcsde/concepts/geometry/shapes/types.htm">Multilinestring</a> that would need
to be parsed:</p>

<p>However, they did offer their data hosted as <a href="https://geojson.org/">geoJson</a>, which is a
specification for encoding geodata as json (surprise). It’s a bit more verbose,
so the filesize is a bit bigger, but filesize is a bit less of a concern when
your data is already a hundred megabytes. In geoJson, that same road segment
above instead looks like this (sorry in advance for all the scrolling you are

<p>I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to open and explore this file. Getting
an understanding of its shape is a requirement if I wanted to parse it into any
sort of app, and to do that I needed to poke around. Opening the file in Xcode
caused it to crash pretty reliably. VSCode similarly hung for a while, and when
it finally responded a bunch of navigation features seemed to be disabled. To
help explore all of this data, I ended up using an app called
<a href="https://viewer.dadroit.com/">Dadroit</a>, a JSON viewer specifically made for viewing large files

					<div><p>Transcript:</p><p>Hello, and welcome to the software engineering unlocked podcast. I’m your host, Dr. McKayla. And today is a special episode. Yeah, the software engineering unlocked podcast turned one. And to celebrate the one year anniversary – and can you imagine it’s already one year – I thought I will tell you a little bit about myself.</p><p>I will very inline with the theme of the show, I will tell you a little bit about how I came into tech, a little bit about my experiences with different companies. And also I will tell you about my favorite topic code review. So yeah, let’s see how that goes. I’m a little bit nervous because it’s first not interview-style podcast episode. So it means that I don’t have another person interviewing me and asking me questions. So it will be all me talking. And I hope that this goes well, I don’t know. So yeah, about me. Well, where should I start? Maybe really from the beginning, like I do with my guests. So how did I actually come into tech?</p><p>You know, that’s&nbsp; quite a strange story, because I went to a high school, that was all about art. And while it’s way back then a computer were already a thing. I’m not that old, but, uh, at my school, we didn’t have laptops in our class. We didn’t write on a word for example, or some, um, word processor or something.</p><p>We rode really still with pencil on paper. And especially when I graduated the time were already advanced. So in other school, people were using computers and programs to type, and our school was an art school. And so we were not very progressed. Uh, our teachers also thought, you know, it’s, it’s not a good thing.</p><p>You know, writers write on paper. So even though when I graduated, I was still writing most of my stuff. Oh, really with pen and paper. And I had little to no exposure to computers. We had a computer at home, but because it’s, um, it was something expensive and it was something, you know, that also my parents were maybe a little bit afraid of, we were not allowed to just go and play with the computer or try things out.</p><p>So I really have to say my exposure to computers were really, it was really, really limited. Never ever would I have starting this year that I will study computer science, but I’m in the lab last year before graduating and before starting a university, I actually attended a few lectures at the university and I attended lectures in different areas.</p><p>So I was in one lecture about psychology. I was in an, um, lecture about physics and I was in the left. Sure. About algorithms. And somehow I was really hooked. I never, I actually thought I will study math. This is what I thought that I will go on. But then when, when I was in this lecture and this professor talked about distributed systems and threading problems, and he also were talking about cash machines.</p><p>And so I really could see the application of what very much looked like math to me and logic. But I could see really the impact that it has on the real world. Yeah. And so I think I was hooked. So I got a first book about it. And during the summer break, before starting university, I read this book, it was about really fundamentals.</p><p>What is an algorithm and what is computer science still? I didn’t touch any computers. Right. It was really theoretical knowledge about, you know, what computer science is all about. And there was really, really fascinating. I thought, this is what I want to do. And so when I made the decision and I said, I’m going to apply, my parents were not thrilled.</p><p>They were like, this is not for girls. And this is not for you. And you’re coming from an art background, which was very true. Right. I was mainly painting pictures. I drew, I had paintings and things like that, architecture, but, um, I was always good at math and. I decided, even though they weren’t happy and actually even said, they’re not going to really support me doing that.</p><p>I went ahead, add end. I’m enrolled. And the enrollment was actually online and yeah, mr. We failed to be honest. Yeah. I really failed to create an account. You know, dad. This was the current state that I was in. Right. So I got a little bit worried about, um, if I’m not even able to in role, because I had so little exposure to computers and internet and things like that.</p><p>We didn’t have internet at home. Um, How I’m gonna deal with that. But yeah, there was an it department, so they helped me actually enroll when I told them that I, they, I need some assistance with that and that I actually want to study computer science. They were also not super thrilled and I laughed a little bit about me, uh, but I managed to get the thing done with a little bit of help.</p><p>And, and then it was. It was really intense. I would say her first year, especially the first half year, really intense. Most of my, um, classmates, my colleagues at university had a lot of knowledge already became, um, most of them actually came from high schools that had like, uh, Focused on computers, even new houses program.</p><p>And for me, everything was new and I didn’t have really a computer and I didn’t have so much money. So I bought really a crappy computer and, um, it wasn’t good enough for, for example, the job compilers really run. So if I wanted to combine my hello world, the first program that I a road, it took several minutes, like 15 minutes.</p><p>It can you imagine? So. Um, I knew I had to do something else, so I try to collect a little bit more money and make more money. I worked on the side. And so, um, within the first two, three months I was able to buy a better computer. And, um, it wasn’t the best computer. Yeah. It was really nice. A nice laptop that, uh, got the job done.</p><p>Let’s put it that way. And also, I have to say that in my computer science education, especially at the beginning, we did again, a lot things on, um, Paper. I mean, we wrote Java programs on paper. Um, not always URI. I needed a computer and you were doing it at home, right? Well then transferring. Yeah. What you learned in class?</p><p>Um, To the computer. Uh, but yeah, so this is how I got started. And, um, I did the primer in programming that really helped a lot. It was very, very intense, but I, I studied a lot. Um, this is pure reality is that I really studied a lot and I really, you know, deep dive into that, I found it really also very, very fascinating.</p><p>So it wasn’t, wasn’t hard for me. And by the, by the end of the first year, I was one of the best in class. And, um, this was very encouraging as well. So I, I didn’t start really well. Uh, but yeah, based on learning a lot and really having an open mind and being so curious, I was able to, to level up. So is, it was really how I started.</p><p>Maybe I rambled a little bit too long, but hopefully found it interesting. And yeah, well I did then back then, actually, when I did my, my, my. Bachelor. There were no bachelor and masters in Austria. I did my, my, uh, university in Austria, but this was one five year program. And so in the middle of when I started, they actually changed the thing to master and bachelor, but because I already took master classes, um, in my bachelor’s, I then actually.</p><p>Uh, pursued the whole thing and did a bachelor in the master and the master. I did partly in London, in the vestments there university, and this was really one of my best times. It was the first time that I went away from home. And, uh, somehow I got a little bit hooked. I really left being away and learning about new cultures.</p><p>Um, having a complete different perspective on life, uh, through those travels through those months abroad. And so when I finished my masters, I knew that I’m not gonna stay. So I started actually as a lecturer, the university, and I teach the system security and complexity theory. Hmm. The algorithms. So something like that, introduction to algorithms.</p><p>Um, so, but I knew that I wanted something else. So I looked around and I found a PhD program. And I applied and it was actually in the Netherlands. And I also have to say that when I graduated, this was 2008, it was a regression. Right. So, uh, it wasn’t the best job market. And, uh, maybe, um, I don’t know if I would have done a PhD, if there would be a better job market I wanted to go into.</p><p>What I always wanted to do is industrial research. Right? So I wanted to be in industry and do the research side, but that bind, I think it was just not possible. There was no money and especially companies didn’t hire a lot of people into research, which somehow is not the most necessary thing. I think that if times are, you know, difficult, um, a lot of resources go away from, from research.</p><p>Anyway. So I went actually to the Netherlands and I did my PhD program there. Um, I was mainly looking at how people software system, so software comprehension, can we build models around. Large software systems, so that it’s easier to really know what’s happening here to get an overview. And I was also diving into testing.</p><p>So especially test systems when we are testing something, how do we know, how do we know what we should test? Which integrations for example, should we test? And I’m experimenting with things that help people really to understand their. Test suites, but another aspect of dad was God, more than more into qualitative studies.</p><p>So what I really enjoyed was doing this quantitative things. So like you’re looking at data you’re analyzing. Software repositories data that you’re getting from, uh, from what they, what the engineers produce. Right. So you’re looking at commits, you’re looking at the source code. You’re looking at, um, maybe interactions that engineers are having.</p><p>Right. But there’s in a, in a very quantitative way. Um, so you’re doing a lot of data mining there and, um, maybe. I have some algorithms around to extract entrance, interesting patterns, but then compliment that with a qualitative research. So instead of saying, well, we extracted, you know, let’s say to get history and then we saw, and we have some way to detect, let’s say …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-0690890445953831c024"><div><p><em>Trigger warning: authoritarianism, state surveillance, the Holocaust. If you want to avoid these topics, please jump to the last paragraph of this introduction, starting with ‘Enough about the depressing stuff.’</em></p><p>Before we start, I feel like I need to give a bit of background on why I care so deeply about privacy. It’s partly historical. Being Ashkenazi, I learnt from a very young age about the importance of sensitive information, and who you give that information to. My grandfather broke the law by not going to the police station to register himself as a Jew. The Holocaust saw 76,000 Jews deported to death camps from France alone - around 1/4th of the country’s Jewish population at the time. There’s a chance that not being part of the Jewish census saved his life. Lesson: be careful who you give sensitive information to.</p><p>That grandfather and two of his brothers left Paris in the middle of the war, and took a train south with no plan, no luggage, no contact, and no destination other than, well, heading south. They were helped by strangers and survived. Their mother however, along with two other siblings, had a plan. They had a deal with a smuggler to reach unoccupied France. The smuggler informed the Nazis, and all 3 of them died in deportation. Lesson: each person who has information on you represents an additional chance for it to be leaked.</p><p>And yes, we can raise the irony of mentioning my Jewish grandpa to warn you against sharing sensitive information online. There, I just did.&nbsp;</p><p>While this happened in the 1940’s, a data point’s lifespan is drastically different today. It’s possible that you posted something online 10 years ago, and it was fine back then, but 20 years from now you will hope that no one finds it. My message is: the Internet never forgets, cultures change, and retroactive laws exist. People can get screwed over digital data. Let’s take the obvious example: China’s state surveillance has an eye on literally each and every move of its inhabitants, whether physical or digital. The state uses extensive data to allocate social scores, which can have a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-18/china-social-credit-a-model-citizen-in-a-digital-dictatorship/10200278?nw=0" target="_blank">drastic impact</a> on Chinese people’s life, including banning them from purchasing train or plane tickets, providing them with lower Internet speed, and denying them visas and loans. China also makes use of this surveillance system <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/02/asia/xinjiang-china-karakax-document-intl-hnk/" target="_blank">against its Uyghur population</a>, detaining between 1 and 2 million people - the estimates vary - in concentration camps, where prisoners suffer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_re-education_camps#Testimonies_of_treatment" target="_blank">extensively reported torture, brainwashing and forced labour</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from governmental issues, there’s also the topic of pervasive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFTWM7HV2UI" target="_blank">tracking and ads</a>, championed by Facebook and Google. I’m yet to see the difference between today’s digital advertising and individually-customised mass manipulation. Maybe because there is none. Please try and change my mind if you have any conclusive elements.</p><p>Enough about the depressing stuff. I’ve explained why your privacy matters, and we’re now about to dive into a few security concepts. I wrote this article with <a href="https://twitter.com/lp1eu" target="_blank">lp1</a>, as he knows much more about these concepts than I do. So here’s my first pro tip for you, unrelated to privacy or security: date people you admire. Now, let’s get into the technical aspects.</p><h2>CIA</h2><p>The CIA ‘triad’ is a summary of the main concepts of information security. There are 3 aspects regarding information which are targeted by infosec:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>:<strong> </strong>the assurance that a piece of information can only be observed by authorised third parties.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integrity</strong>:<strong> </strong>the assurance that a piece of information is and stays accurate over time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Availability</strong>: the assurance that a piece of information can be accessed by an authorised user when they need it.</p></li></ul><h2>Encryption: Server-side vs. Client-side</h2><p>Encryption secures data and aims to maintain its confidentiality and integrity.</p><p>We differentiate server-side from client-side encryption. Server-side means that only information stored on said server is encrypted. This means that the company has the encryption key, and therefore can access your communication (yes, including your nudes). However, server-side encryption doesn’t apply to the <strong>transmission </strong>of your communication. The data you share is not necessarily encrypted, only the storage is, which is why you should favour platforms that use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS" target="_blank">https</a>.</p><p>Client-side – or end-to-end – encryption means that the transmission of your information is encrypted, and that <strong>only your device</strong> has the key. If you log in from a different device, you won’t be able to see the exchanges. Since the company <strong>does not have the key</strong>,<strong> </strong>they cannot access your messages. As a result, even if they were to store your exchanges, said exchanges would automatically be encrypted. However, this also means that you won’t be able to recover your messages, should you lose the key.</p><p>In the case of a communication service, this means that the nudes you're sending to <strong>someone you trust</strong> are encrypted from your device to the company's server, as well as from their server to your trusted partner's device. Without encryption however, anyone on your network can see and tamper with all your communications. By 'tamper with', we mean any kind of modification by an unauthorised third-party. Examples include someone changing your password and email address on a platform to take over your account, deleting your private files on a cloud file storage service, replacing software in your online backups with malware, etc.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598877921511_5282"><div><p>A recent example is the July Twitter hack, during which <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1286088135525318656" target="_blank">hackers managed to read users' messages from Twitter's admin control panel</a>. &nbsp;With end-to-end encrypted DMs, no one at Twitter would have been able to access them.</p><h2>Encryption vs. Hashing</h2><p>A distinction has to be made between two important notions: encryption and hashing. Encrypting information means that you turn it into scrambled text which can be decoded with a key. For instance, it's useful to make sure a communication between two peers cannot be read by an unauthorised person.&nbsp;</p><p>Hashing a piece of data on the other hand means that you turn it into a <strong>unique signature</strong> which <strong>cannot be reversed</strong> into its original readable state. The only way for someone to obtain the original input based on the hashing output, is to try inputs themselves until their output matches. Hashing is not intended as a cypher to decrypt, which is why encryption and hashing serve different purposes and are used in different cases. Hashing is noticeably useful to store passwords, because you avoid storing the actual easy-to-steal-and-reuse passwords. Instead, you compare the hashing output that you store to the hashing output of what a user entered while trying to log in. If you get the same hash that you’ve stored, then the password is correct.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598877921511_7990"><div><h2>100% secure does not exist</h2><p>Flaws and vulnerabilities can always be found. However, the sturdier your tools, the safer you'll be. And contrary to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djV11Xbc914" target="_blank">what A-ha used to sing</a>, it is better to be safe than sorry.</p><h2>Free vs. Open source</h2><p>Free and open source software are specific philosophies, based on specific values. Free software specifically refers to the notion of users' freedom, which isn't the case in open-source software. As <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" target="_blank">the GNU website</a> puts it: 'To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”'.</p><p>There are 4 criteria for software to be free:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Freedom 0: The freedom to run the programme as you wish, for any purpose.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the programme works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. This entails having access to the source code.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 3: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.</p></li></ul><p>On the other hand, open-source software has a <a href="https://opensource.org/osd" target="_blank">less strict definition</a>, and a different philosophy. You can also see the source code, amongst other things.</p><p>If you want to get into the political aspect of these terminologies, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html" target="_blank">here</a>’s a good explanation.</p><h2>Credential stuffing attack</h2><p>Credential stuffing is a popular attack whose goal is to automatically test a user’s known credentials on multiple platforms on a large scale. Nowadays, it is widely used by malicious intruders because of the online accessibility of billions of credentials gathered from data leaks (<a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/dating-the-ginormous-myspace-breach/" target="_blank">MySpace</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dailymotion-allegedly-hacked-85-million-user-accounts-stolen/" target="_blank">Dailymotion</a>, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-dropbox-hack-is-real/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> to name some of the biggest).</p><p>And there you have it, a roundup of the main security concepts. Feel free to reach out to <a href="https://twitter.com/lp1eu" target="_blank">lp1</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/this2shallgrow" target="_blank">me</a> on Twitter. Part 2 will be available next week, with a list of the privacy and security tools we frequently use and recommend.</p><p>If you’re looking for a UX researcher or UX designer to work in the privacy and security sphere, I’d love to have a chat with you! </p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s bloody hard to find a good example of a large production-grade, open-source React app.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>No one</b> writes amazing code the first time they write it</p>
<ul>
<li>Experienced product engineers know there’s a trade-off between quality and getting features in the hands of customers. You’re more likely to find ugly tech debt with a <code>//TODO: Improve this later!</code> comment than best practices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most companies keep their apps in private repos</p>
<ul>
<li>Trade secrets and all that jazz.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There’s a <em>lot</em> of beginner-grade repos out there</p>
<ul>
<li>Without a ton of experience, it’s hard to tell the good from the bad</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On that note, I’ve reviewed the following well-known open-source React apps, and reckon they’re worth checking out.</p>
<p>I’ve split this article into two parts:</p>

<p>Project link: <a href="https://github.com/oldboyxx/jira_clone">Jira Clone</a></p>
<p>Jira Clone is… a Jira clone built in modern React, entirely out of functional components with Hooks. It’s noteworthy because its stack is more or less what I’d use on my own side-projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>TypeScript with TypeORM on the backend, communicating with a Postgres database</li>
<li>React on the frontend with a custom webpack config</li>
<li>Relies on Cypress for end-to-end testing</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that, the author has done an amazing job making it look very similar to Jira (when the clone was built), using a mix of <a href="https://styled-components.com/">styled-components</a> and global styles.</p>
<p>This repo also highlights the benefits of just working on a project by yourself with a clear understanding of what you’re trying to build. You’ll see the contrast when you check out the other projects in this article.</p>

<p>RealWorld by Thinkster re-implements the same app (a Medium.com clone called Conduit) in over 24 different languages and frameworks. In this case, we’re reviewing the React/Redux version.</p>
<p>It uses create-react-app, with react-router for routing, Redux for state management, classNames for styling, superagent for data fetching, with no testing, or type-checking.</p>
<p>It seems like a decent way to understand the syntactical differences between dozens of language and framework combinations, but isn’t exactly a beacon of best practices.</p>

<p>Real World App is a great example of best-practices to use for end-to-end testing an application with Cypress, with example data in the repo, so both tests and the app run out-of-the-box without the need for a database.</p>
<p>It’s built with create-react-app, written in TypeScript with an Express backend, using Material UI as a UI/component library, Formik for forms, and react-router for routing.</p>
<p>It looks like a pretty solid example of an application you would see in the real world, (especially since it uses forms), though data-fetching and form submission are optimised for ease of testing/portability rather than best practices.</p>

<p>Simorgh is the BBC’s React SPA, currently serving millions of users in production around the world. It is being progressively rolled out to each BBC World Service News website, and you can track the progress <a href="https://github.com/bbc/simorgh/blob/latest/docs/Simorgh-Release-Info.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>It uses PropTypes for type-checking, Jest and Enzyme for unit testing, Cypress for end-to-end testing, styled-components for styling (with most components living in <code>@bbc/psammead</code>, which is an awesome component library to check out too), react-router for routing, with Express handling server-side rendering.</p>
<p>It’s extremely well-tested (98% coverage) and well-documented, with READMEs throughout the project to explain large directories.</p>

<p>Project link: <a href="https://github.com/fkling/astexplorer">AST explorer</a></p>
<p>AST Explorer is a tool for exploring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Trees</a>.</p>
<p>It’s worth checking out as a React project because it’s a good example of a project under continuous development for several years. It’s a classic React project that uses PropTypes for type-checking, and Redux for state management while still using local state where possible.</p>
<p>While you won’t find anything fancy like TypeScript/Flow here, the code is well commented, with hacks and workarounds clearly pointed out.</p>
<p>Some might say there’s some “tech debt”, as the authors have chosen to stick with class components, and not immediately rewrite to functional components + Hooks. Instead, they’ve maintained class components in older files, with functional components + Hooks in newer files.</p>
<p>Also worth noting, that like many real life, open-source projects, AST Explorer was started with the intention of adding tests later, but only one contributor in four years mentioned wanting to add tests in the GitHub Issues.</p>

<p>Excalidraw is a tool for drawing flow-charts, and various other diagrams with a hand-drawn style. I actually use it quite a bit for my own projects.</p>
<p>It’s worth checking out because it’s one of the most popular (in terms of daily users) examples of an un-ejected <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">create-react-app</a> application I’ve seen in production.</p>
<p>It’s written in relatively modern React (mostly functional components with Hooks) with TypeScript, uses SCSS for styles, there are tests, and rather than using Redux, they’ve <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html">lifted state up</a> and persisted it in localStorage.</p>

<p>Spectrum is a community site, seeking to combine the features of a real-time chat app with the features of forums. It’s been under active development since early 2017, and was acquired by GitHub at the end of 2018.</p>
<p>Spectrum was very interesting to follow during its early years, as it used RethinkDB for (almost) live updates on queries, server-side rendering and GraphQL (very cutting edge at the time).</p>
<p>The codebase uses Flow for type-checking, Apollo (GraphQL) for data-fetching, Redux for state management, an <a href="https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum/blob/alpha/hyperion/index.js">Express server</a> for server-side rendering, and uses functional components + Hooks, with custom hooks <a href="https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum/tree/alpha/src/hooks">here</a>. Naturally, as one of the founders is <a href="https://mxstbr.com/">Max Stoiber</a> (creator of styled-components), the app is styled with styled-components.</p>
<p>Since the acquistion, Max has written a post called <a href="https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/tech-choice-regrets-at-spectrum">Tech Choices I Regret at Spectrum</a> that’s also worth checking out.</p>

<p>Sentry is a service that allows you to report on errors in your web app.</p>
<p>It runs on a Django backend, with a React frontend written in TypeScript (with PropTypes too), uses <a href="http://emotion.sh/">Emotion</a> for styling, react-router for routing, Redux for state management, and is a great example of trade-offs and <code>//TODO</code> comments in a SaaS app with users that pay for it.</p>
<p>One peculiar thing to check out is that the app is internationalized, using a translation service to convert strings <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/src/sentry/static/sentry/app/locale.tsx">here</a>.</p>

<p>I almost didn’t add Grafana as an example here, since it’s an AngularJS project in the process of migrating to React.</p>
<p>It’s an AngularJS app being progressively rewritten into a modern React app, written in TypeScript. It uses Redux for state management, an internal design system that uses emotion for styling (<code>@grafana/ui</code>).</p>
<p>It’s kind of a nightmare to navigate as a codebase, mainly due to mixing folders only used by AngularJS with folders only used by React, and that’s exactly why it’s in this article, as an example of what you’ll see in the real world.</p>

<p>GoAlert is an open source on-call scheduler and notifier (simlar to PagerDuty or Opsgenie).</p>
<p>It runs on a Go backend, using Apollo (GraphQL) for data-fetching, react-router for routing, Redux for state management, Cypress for end-to-end testing, Material UI for some components, and plain old CSS for styling.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it’s a pretty good example of Cypress testing in a real application, using <code>data-cy</code> for selecting elements (for example).</p></div></div>]]>

<div> <p>In any organization, there will be people who behave inappropriately, sometimes grievously so. Here’s the paradox: the more senior the role you’re in, and the more power you have to help coworkers who are facing awful behavior like harassment or bullying, the less likely you are to see those things.</p>
<p>Simply put, if you’re in a position of power at work, you’re unlikely to see workplace harassment in front of you. That’s because harassment and bullying are attempts to exert power over people with less of it. People who behave improperly don’t tend to do so with people they perceive as having power already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was younger and in more junior roles, I dealt with harassment all the time. It was a defining characteristic of several jobs I had. What stands out in my memory from those roles isn’t what I learned or how I grew, but how hard I worked to avoid the men (it was always men) who made me feel meek and small. But over time, as I’ve moved up in my career, harassment has become steadily less prevalent in my work life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few years ago, when I was on the executive team of an org that employed around 250 people, nearly all of whom seemed very lovely to me, I wondered if perhaps I had found a group of people that simply didn’t include any bad apples. Spoiler alert: I had not.</p>
<p>Some months into the job, somebody made an offhand comment in front of me about a mid-level designer – a man in his 30s who was, apparently, well known for making young women in the organization feel uncomfortable. Let’s call this man Peter. Peter was also the first person to invite me out for coffee on my first day on the job. I had thought it a little curious at the time, since our work wasn’t going to overlap much. But he had been very friendly, sharing almost too much information about past problems at the org. I hadn’t thought too much of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It wasn’t until months later that I heard Peter described by a junior employee in a tone of voice that suggested everyone knew he was a problem. It was as if I’d stepped out of the Matrix and could now see reality. Suddenly, I understood why he had sought to establish a relationship with me early on. I was going to have power in the org, and he wanted that power to view him favorably. I also realized that most or all of the other people at my level – the very people who could do the most to address Peter’s behavior – likely didn’t know what everyone else thought was common knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine it: a majority of people at the company know or have a feeling that something is wrong. Everyone they talk to regularly knows it, too. Nobody among them thinks to discuss it with the most senior people, because as far as they can tell, everyone knows. And if the senior team isn’t doing anything, they must not care. Indeed, it probably isn’t safe to raise the issue with them because they all seem friendly with Peter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that point in my career, I had spent a lot of time working on diversity, equity and inclusion. I had an undergrad degree in gender studies, and I was quite aware of organizational dynamics and structural oppression; I was on the path that I remain on to understand and use my advantages as a White person to change the workplace. And yet, I was stunned to realize that I had passively become a reinforcing part of the very type of harassment that I had struggled with for years. That was not the last surprise.</p>
<p>In my current job, I recently posted about this dynamic in a public Slack channel. Two of my colleagues – cis, White, middle-aged men who manage managers – reached out to me individually to say that they were glad I was talking about this, because they didn’t know what harassment looked like, and they wanted to learn so they could watch out for it. One of them said simply, ‘I’ve been a straight white guy my whole life. Nobody harasses me.’</p>
<p>I was pushed through the Matrix again. Not only was it possible that people in senior leadership positions at work had never been harassed, it was also possible that they didn’t even know what it looked or felt like.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>So what does harassment look and feel like?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Harassment is, unfortunately, a big category (and some of this discussion might be triggering). You are probably aware of the legal guidelines here, which prohibit quid pro quo (e.g. ‘I’ll give you a raise if you sleep with me’) and create a hostile environment (e.g. bullying people or teasing them in a demeaning way). Often, though, harassment and bullying fall somewhere in between these things. To people experiencing these things, they might look like, among many other things:</p>
<ul><li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Unwanted invitations.</strong>&nbsp;Asking a coworker to join you for drinks, dinner, or even lunch, especially after they’ve already said no.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Unwanted attention.</strong>&nbsp;Commenting on a coworker’s appearance i.e., clothing, hair, makeup, or body.&nbsp;</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Unwanted touching.&nbsp;</strong>Slightly prolonged taps, feeling somebody’s hair, hugging. Even a few years ago, hugging at work was common in some workplaces. That’s less the case now, both because it can shade into harassment and also because it’s more widely understood that some neurotypes find any kind of touching uncomfortable.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Unwanted online interactions.</strong>&nbsp;Sliding into somebody’s DMs with suggestive emojis or sending flirtatious emails.&nbsp;</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><a data-gc-link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression#:~:text=Microaggression%20is%20a%20term%20used,group%2C%20particularly%20culturally%20marginalized%20groups." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression#:~:text=Microaggression%20is%20a%20term%20used,group%2C%20particularly%20culturally%20marginalized%20groups."><strong>Microaggressions of all types</strong></a><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Although I’m using it broadly here, the term was originally coined in 1970 to describe racist comments, specifically. Notably, in his recent book,&nbsp;<em>How to Be an Antiracist</em>, Ibram X. Kendi rejects the term, in part because, ‘A persistent daily hum of racist abuse is not minor…I use the term “abuse” because that describes the action and its effects on people.’</li>
</ul><p>Again, it’s critical to understand that harassment and bullying are expressions of power, so the perpetrator has status over the person they’re targeting: either from the org chart or from social systems like patriarchy and White supremacy. In other words, a White peer can abuse a Black coworker, an able-bodied peer can harass a disabled coworker, and so forth. It doesn’t require a senior title, though that almost always increases the impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That impact is significant. If you’re in a position of societal or organizational power, these behaviors may seem small; if you’re lower in power, they can be devastating, causing people to question their own actions and worth. People who have to field these behaviors in a workplace are, at a very minimum, distracted and drained. Depression is common, and even suicide is a possible result. The fact that the patterns may be hidden from you does not make them less significant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having shared that glimpse of what harassment is, I’m going to talk about what we – the leaders in our organizations – can do to become aware of it, and how we can tell if our actions are effective. Because we can’t take action if we don’t realize bad behavior surrounds us, I’m going to focus on creating the conditions for awareness, not on actually addressing harassment or bullying. Once you become aware, you can work with other leaders to address it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are five things I’ve done to make it easier for people to talk with me about behavior that’s hidden from me.&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">A few times a year, I post a public message in Slack about how I used to experience harassment all the time, but now I rarely see it at all because of my title. So even though I’m more likely in a position to help, I need other people’s help to understand what’s happening. I post infrequently enough that people pay attention, but often enough that new people get the message.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">I’m unsurprised when I hear that somebody with social power who is very friendly to me has been causing problems for other people. In other words, I believe the stories of marginalized and underrepresented people over my own experience. (This is hard!)</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">I hold skip-level meetings at least quarterly, so that everyone who reports up to me knows who I am and that my door is open.&nbsp;</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">I welcome and cultivate professional 1:1 relationships with younger people who don’t report to me. They’re often aware of problems in the organization and need support outside their reporting chain to figure out how to speak up.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">I talk often about inequity. Being vocal about it is a signal to people throughout the organization about the values I hold and the culture I’m aiming to help create.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><h2>How do you know if any of this is working?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>There are a few signs I look for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are junior people in the organization seeking me out to talk about uncomfortable things? For example, are they coming to me because they think they’re being underpaid but don’t know how to ask their manager for a raise? Are they coming to me because they’re worried that their work is suffering due to a recent breakup and they don’t know if they should tell their team lead? When these conversations come up, it’s likely that I’ve built some trust with people who don’t report directly to me or aren’t in my reporting chain at all.</p>
<p>Are junior people in the organization coming to me because they’ve heard I’m good to talk with? That’s often a sign that I’m developing a reputation for having perspective beyond my own experience. (It’s worth noting that I’m not universally helpful. None of us can be good for everyone to talk with.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are the people who report to me bringing up power dynamics on their teams so that we can talk through potential issues? That suggests they know that I care about power dynamics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, we have to ask ourselves: are people talking to me about harassment or bullying they see or experience? And we have to understand that if they are not, that doesn’t mean it isn’t happening. Instead, it means you don’t know about something very vital that is almost certainly happening around you all the time. If you aren’t hearing about it, it’s time to take action to ensure that you do.</p>

September 1, 2020 | https://brunosays.com/docker-images-intro-for-beginners | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://brunosays.com/docker-images-intro-for-beginners">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Yet another blog about docker that could be found in documentations, you might think. Legit opinion. But this is <strong>for those who don't want to be pointed to the bunch of documentation</strong>. And for those who would like to have some real use case in front of them when learning new concepts.</p>
<p>It's for beginners. So for those who heard about docker but never tried them. For those who heard their colleagues talking about it, but felt insecure to even ask how does it work. I might turn this into series of articles, we will see.</p>
<h2 id="real-life-dev-scenario-postgresql-on-your-next-project">Real life dev scenario - PostgreSQL on your next project</h2>
<p>Let's make a scene. Not the drama scene, but just to relax our mind a bit. This is not a post where you are presented a bunch of commands that's it. This should have a soul 😊.</p>
<p>You found out that your next project will involve, say, PostgreSQL. You never worked with it, you want to see how it looks like, and to prepare yourself for that project. Also, you already have a local machine set up for the current project. with totally different technologies. You don’t want to make more "mess". </p>
<h2 id="docker-hub">Docker Hub</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a> will be your starting point in many cases, so let’s write a few words about it. We will use it also in this workshop to find images we need. It’s also a place where images are documented, so you’ll probably come back here many times.</p>
<p>Also, a tip for the future, start asking yourself <em>"Does XYZ have a docker image I can use?"</em>. Open it now and try searching some images, for example, <code>mysql, wordpress, ghost, elasticsearch, php, java, maven, gradle, python</code>. You see my point? You can find almost anything as a docker image.</p>
<p>You may notice this <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_images/">OFFICIAL IMAGE</a> mark. That means the people who developed that technology, are most likely involved in developing and maintaining the docker image. There are other advantages, of course, check the documentation.</p>
<p>But it’s ok to use unofficial ones, too. Especially if you are experimenting with something. For example, my colleagues were developing an app in <code>React Native</code>. I didn’t have anything setup for compiling React Native project. All I wanted was to build an <code>APK</code> file and use it on my mobile phone. So I’ve just pulled the unofficial image that has everything installed there. Built my APK file and that’s it.</p>
<p>Ok, that’s enough for Docker Hub. Lets' move on.</p>
<h2 id="images">Images</h2>
<p>The first step is to check out <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/search/?q=postgres&amp;type=image">Postgres image on Docker Hub</a>. This is the link, but feel free to go there and search it directly. </p>
<p>If you take a look at the description, you’ll see the supported tags and respective <code>Dockerfile</code> links. Consider tag as a version for the moment. There is also a whole tab dedicated to TAGS where you can find all the tags of this image. But the ones in the Description tab are supported ones. At the moment, supported tags go back down to version <code>9.5.22</code>. Also, versions in the tag are very likely to represent the version of the technology in the image. For example, <code>Python</code> image tagged as <code>3.6.8- stretch</code> will have <code>Python v3.6.8</code> in it. I’ll explain this <code>stretch</code> later.</p>
<p>OK, now we want to get a <code>Postgres</code> image. As this blog is static, we will stick with the version <code>11.8</code>. Postgres meanwhile released another tags, but for the sake of the blog we will use the <code>version 11</code>. The blog was tested with the version <code>11.2</code>, so we should stick with the major version 11.</p>
<p>There are two groups of tags, you may notice</p>
<pre><code># <span>output</span>
11<span>.8</span>, 11
11<span>.8-alpine</span>, 11<span>-alpine</span>
</code></pre><p>You may wonder what’s the difference.</p>
<p>Let’s pull both of them with commands below, and I’ll explain a bit while you wait for them to download. Yes, actually stop reading the blog and execute these two commands, one after another.</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull <span>postgres:</span><span>11.8</span>
$ docker pull <span>postgres:</span><span>11.8</span>-alpine
</code></pre>
<p>OK, as you might see in browser (on the Ducker Hub page), each tag in one line links to the same <code>Dockerfile</code>. So it doesn’t matter if you are using <code>11.8</code> or <code>11</code>. At the moment of writing the initial blog article, in this line there was also a <code>latest</code> tag. The <code>latest</code> version back at the time was <code>11</code>. Now the latest is moved to the <code>version 12</code>. There are also beta versions 13 which will eventually become stable and thus <code>latest</code>. You get the point. Be careful with tag latest, as it will switch to the newer version in some time. I would suggest you to use specific tags instead of the <code>latest</code>. As you would do with any other dependencies and libraries.</p>
<p>But what about this <code>alpine</code> group of tags? At this moment your images may be ready, if not wait till they are, and execute</p>
<pre><code>$ docker images
</code></pre><p>You may see something like this, (your results may vary slightly):</p>
<pre><code># <span>output</span>
<span>postgres</span>           11<span>.8</span>             ...          312<span>MB</span>
<span>postgres</span>           11<span>.8-alpine</span>.     ...         70<span>.8MB</span>
</code></pre><h2 id="its-all-about-sizes">It's all about sizes</h2>
<p>Notice the difference in the size of those docker images. Docker is all about minimising resources you need to run something. It would be way heavier, for example, to run a complete virtual machine. Docker is not a virtual machine but that’s beyond the scope of this material. With Docker, you can have running <code>Postgres</code> server in <code>70 MB</code>. Consider Docker containers as an isolated process that runs on your machine.</p>
<p>If you open each of the Postgres <code>Dockerfiles</code> (find the links on the Docker Hub, I mean it, go and click it) you will see they are built on top of different Docker base images. I’m talking about <code>Dockerfiles</code> in <code>Postgres</code> image documentation. There will be something like <code>FROM debian:stretch-slim</code> and <code>FROM alpine:3.11</code>. You don’t have to understand anything about <code>Dockerfile</code> for now. Let’s just say that our <code>Postgres</code> images have to run on some architecture, and in this case, it’s Debian or Alpine. You may see different tag suffixes, such as <code>stretch</code>, <code>slim</code>, <code>jessie</code> and they refer to the base image they are built on. The size of an image, <strong>and also a set of available tools</strong> will depend on that, as well. In the end, they throw out all unnecessary things to achieve the small size. Consider that later when you get familiar with Docker. We’ll use <code>alpine</code> images for now. If you check <a target="_blank" href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine distribution</a> site you’ll notice this motto:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small. Simple. Secure.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Think about what you've read. It may be all confusing. That's ok. Feel free to read it again. Docker is a complex thing. Many will try to grasp as much as possible about Docker and it will just cause a mess in their head. Especially if you're new into this. That's why I provided only fraction here. But this fraction will be enough for your next steps.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. </p>

  <p>I meet regularly with early-career software developers. A few recurring meetings, 1x/week, plus ad-hoc calls as needed with others.</p>

<p>A question came up recently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My three-month internship is close to wrapping up. The Co-founder/CEO/lead developer of the consulting company I’m at likes me, said he wishes he could hire me but cannot, because they don’t have enough work in the pipeline.</p>

  <p>He said he’d write me a letter of recommendation, and asked me to draft it for him.</p>

  <p>How do I write my own letter of recommendation, for my first real software development job?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Feels like a trap, huh?</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/office-hours-tufts.jpeg" alt="who are you?"></p>

<p><a href="https://admissions.tufts.edu/blogs/jumbo-talk/post/the-office-hours/"><em>source</em></a></p>

<p>Or, maybe they know you. They know you <em>too well</em></p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/recommendation-warning.jpg" alt="untrustworthy"></p>

<p><a href="https://blacklawyermagic.wordpress.com/"><em>source</em></a></p>

<p>I explained a few concepts that we wanted to “speak to” in the letter. I’ll explain.</p>

<p>The software developer that I meet with mentioned that the CEO’s advice on the next job included “be able to speak to low liability”.</p>

<p>I wanted to dig into this “liability” piece.</p>
      <h2 id="how-much-does-a-bad-hire-cost">
        
        
          How much does a bad hire cost? <a href="#how-much-does-a-bad-hire-cost">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>What’s the biggest risk in hiring?</p>

<p>It’s <em>the risk of a bad hire</em>.</p>

<p>How much does it cost to make a bad hire?</p>

<p>I would conservatively estimate that it costs $100,000 and nine months of your life. Here’s how the math works from a hiring manager’s point of view:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Spend a month and 25 hours of labor dev team manager labor to find/interview the candidate(s) and winnow the applicants down to someone to make an offer.  (the hiring manager would prefer to be doing <em>literally anything else but hiring</em>.)</li>
  <li>Extend an offer, wait 2-6 more weeks before the new candidate starts. It can be painful to wait another six weeks, because the team is currently short-staffed, and has been for a long time. That’s why they’re hiring!</li>
  <li>Start date! Start paying $150,000/yr or $3000/week for your shiny new employee.</li>
  <li>Pay $12,000 for the first month of them working, figuring out your dev environment, ticket management, who knows what parts of the codebase, and a few easy bug fixes.</li>
  <li>Start getting nervous. Employee not batting it out of the park like you’d hoped. Maybe still onboarding, give it another month (and $12,000 in payroll expense).</li>
  <li>OK. Three months in and another $36,000 in payroll later, you’re pretty sure there’s a problem.</li>
  <li>Start the pre-Performance Improvement Plan work. Talk to their team, their manager, them. Why is it not working? Why is the team <em>working slower</em> with this new team member, instead of working faster? <em>Not only are you wasting five figures of payroll, the rest of your expensive dev team is producing less as well!</em></li>
  <li>Pre-PIP work is over. Another $5k in payroll gone forever. Now it’s time to give the formal PIP, which everyone knows is “beginning the firing process”</li>
  <li>Two more months and $24,000 in payroll later, you fire the employee.</li>
  <li>You feel relief with having gotten rid of the bad employee. You’re thrilled that you can get back to normal work.</li>
  <li>Check the clock and balance sheet. It took you nine months and $100k to get to where you were at step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>Add up the time/expense:</p>

<ol>
  <li>1-2 months to to find/hire a candidate.</li>
  <li>7-8 months (and $84K-$96k) to hire, trial them, try to help them be successful, give up on that plan, and fire them.</li>
  <li>Many hours spent thinking about this specific problem, talking with others about it.</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s nine months of your life. That’s 9 months of time, sure, but it’s also 9 months of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a>. What if you’d hired a great candidate? They’d be rapidly approaching their first year on the job, and everyone would be happy about it, instead of this disaster you’ve had to deal with.</p>

<p>Here’s the really scary part: To large organizations (1000+ employees), <em>wasting $100k is meaningless compared to the wasted time and mis-directed effort</em>. The entire organization is more annoyed at having <em>lost the time of a productive software developer</em>. They don’t care that they lit a giant pile of money on fire, <em>they’re annoyed that their competitor is getting new features out the door and gaining marketshare and the future of their $x,000,000 company hangs in the balance</em>.</p>

<p>Oh, and the good managers, not only do they want to be wise with money and build features/gain market-share…</p>

<p>They want to see their team flourish.</p>

<p>Being fired is a life-defining moment. (I speak from experience)</p>

<p>If you’re a kind and empathetic person, <em>it’s particularly unpleasent to fire someone and it feels like a personal failure</em>.</p>

<p>You want to work for a kind and empathetic manager. (They’re not common, but they’re not impossible to find.)</p>

<p>So, tailor your letter to speak to the concerns of a kind and empathetic manager. This manager would:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Want to see you do well</li>
  <li>Want to see you develop your skills and competencies</li>
  <li>Want you to make meaningful contributions to the product</li>
  <li>Want a healthy team dynamic</li>
  <li>Want you to voice concerns and observations as relevant</li>
</ul>

<p>And much more</p>

          A Primary-goal for an early-career software developer: Telegraph Low Liability <a href="#a-primary-goal-for-an-early-career-software-developer-telegraph-low-liability">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>First, when I say <code>telegraph low liability</code> I mean it in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphing_(sports)">sports definition</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In sporting terminology, to <strong>telegraph</strong> is to unintentionally alert an opponent to one’s immediate situation or intentions. The sporting use of the term <em>telegraph</em> draws a direct comparison with the communication device of the same name. “Telegraphing” always refers to a reflexive physical action rather than a protracted or intellectual give-away. For example, a boxer rotating his shoulders to throw a hook would be telegraphing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should aim to “telegraph” that you’re a low-liability hire <em>without ever saying it so explicitely</em>. It’s a subtle thing, best communicated incidentally, not directly.</p>

<p>Five years ago, I wrote <a href="https://josh.works/so-you-want-to-work-remotely">So you want to work remotely…</a></p>

<p>Quoting myself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, there’s the matter of framing how you go about working remotely. Obviously you want to work remotely, but put yourself in the shoes of a prospective employer. They don’t care if you work remotely or not - they want you to do great work for them and make them an effective, profitable organization.</p>

  <p>Companies that hire remotely tend to be younger, agile-er, and smaller. So every employee matters. Making a bad hire can be catastrophic in terms of money and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a>. Your job is to make it very, very obvious that hiring YOU is a great decision. In fact, you want to be so good at what you do that passing up on you is a terrible decision.</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <p>When you can walk someone down the path from “Hire me” to “I’ll help you make <code>$x00,000/year</code> more than you would otherwise”, <em>you’re talking their language</em>. You’re <em>telegraphing</em> that you understand their concerns without ever stating their concern explicitly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To bring it full circle, here’s how I would go about <em>drafting</em> a CEO’s Letter of Recommendation <em>for me</em>. If you find this idea uncomfortable, don’t worry about it. That’s a sign of psychological health, that you don’t love putting flattering words <em>about yourself</em> into other people’s mouths.</p>
      
    

<p>Normally, that’s a good aversion to have. For this particular situation, you’ll have to bite the bullet and move on. I’m not going to give you the actual words (how could I?) but I’ll explain my process. I’ll include comments throughout:</p>
      <h3 id="1-draft-the-openingclosing">
        
        
          1. Draft the opening/closing <a href="#1-draft-the-openingclosing">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,         
# I find it easier to strike a natural tone when thinking relatively
# informally. So, I draft documents, even if they'll end up being 
# formal, informally. 
             
             
Sincerely, 
- Boss's name, Title, Company
# Yes, I write the closing right after the opening.
</code></pre></div></div>
      <h3 id="2-provide-1-general-introductioncontext-sentence">
        
        
          2. Provide 1 general introduction/context sentence <a href="#2-provide-1-general-introductioncontext-sentence">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,

# Establish the relationship. This helps readers contextualize 
# what comes next
I met {person I am recommending} {n months ago} because

</code></pre></div></div>
      <h3 id="3-say-a-complementary-thing-about-yourself">
        
        
          3. Say a complementary thing about yourself <a href="#3-say-a-complementary-thing-about-yourself">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>This is the first uncomfortable sentence you’ll have to write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,

I met {Zaniyah} {a few months ago} because {she and I crossed paths
at a local Ruby meetup}.

# No gushing required. A claim of "I would hire this 
# person if I could" is plenty strong social signaling. 
I wish I could hire them myself, but don't have the budget and work
lined up to utilize them to their full potential. 

Sincerely,
- Boss's name, Title, Company
</code></pre></div></div>
      
    

<p>This can be hard to think of an anecdote. It might take a few attempts to feel good about the one you’ve chosen and how you speak of it. Just write something down, see how you feel, delete it, write something else down, etc.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,

When she started at {company}, one of the first things she did was

It was rather out-of-date, and the team hadn't had new hires in a

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><code>API</code> is the acronym for Application Programming Interface which defines interactions between multiple software architecture layers. Programmers carry out complex tasks easily using APIs in software development. Without APIs, a programmer's life would have been miserable with no proper(security, for example) access to data,  knowing unnecessary low level details etc.</p>
<p>When it comes to Web APIs, there are extremely useful  objects, properties and functions available to perform tasks as minor as accessing DOM to as complex as managing audios, videos, graphics, etc. </p>

<p>If you are from the web development background, you are using many of them already. Here is the list of very well known web APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API">History</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API">Geolocation</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console_API">Console</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API">Drag &amp; Drop API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I am going to talk about 10 more web APIs that are not so popular. Lesser popular doesn't mean, they are not useful. You can use them in various use-cases of your project. Please have a look.</p>

<p>If you would like to jump into the source code or see the demonstration immediately, here are the quick links to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/atapas/demolab/tree/master/code/src/demos/web-apis">Link to the Source Code @GitHub</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://demo.greenroots.info/categories/web-apis/">Link to the Web API DemoLab</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Web APIs are nothing but the interfaces, functions, objects, properties written and exposed using vanilla JavaScript. However the usage of the web APIs is not limited to the vanilla JavaScript based application alone. It is very straightforward to use them with an Angular, React or Vue based applications as well.</p>
<p>All the examples I have used to demonstrate the web apis in this article are written using reactjs. You can find them in the github link mentioned above. Please feel free to fork, change and use!</p>

<p>A big (pain) point about  using a web API is, most of them are not standardized yet. It means, the support for a web API  may differ from one browser vendor to another. For example, You may find an API working with the Chrome browser but, not supported by Firefox or Edge browsers yet.</p>
<p>I would suggest a couple of ways to have a check on this,</p>


<p>Alright, time to get started knowing them. Hope you also find these useful.</p>
<h2 id="1-fullscreen-api">1. 📺 Fullscreen API</h2>
<p>Do you have the need to show any of the DOM elements in full-screen mode? The full-screen use-case is very demanding for gaming applications, online video platforms(like, youtube) etc. </p>
<p>The <code>Fullscreen API</code> provides methods to present a specific Element (and its children) in a full-screen mode. There is a method available to exit full-screen mode once it is no longer needed. Not only that, this API can also help to perform any actions when a DOM element transition into a full-screen mode or comes out of it.</p>
<p>In the example below, my favorite Santa Claus can get into the full-screen mode and come out of it with ease.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598715764074/fR7trCfsA.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="full_screen.gif"></p>
<p>In the code below, the <code>manageFullScreen()</code> function uses  the <code>requestFullscreen()</code> API on an element which is having an id called, <code>fs_id</code>. </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> manageFullscreen = () =&gt; {
   <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'fs_id'</span>).requestFullscreen();
}
</code></pre>
<p>This element with id, <code>fs_id</code> is a <code>DIV</code> with a child element, i.e, the Santa Clause image.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div className=<span>"column"</span>&gt;
  <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"fs_id"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Img</span> <span>fixed</span>=<span>{imageData.image.childImageSharp.fixed}</span> <span>alt</span>=<span>"santa"</span> /&gt;</span>
   <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;<span>StyledButton</span> 
         <span>onClick</span>=<span>{manageFullscreen}</span>&gt;</span>
            Enter Fullscreen with Santa
    <span>&lt;/<span>StyledButton</span>&gt;</span>
 <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can check if the <code>Fullscreen API</code> is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (<span>document</span>.fullscreenEnabled) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Also watch out for the useful handlers like,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>onfullscreenchange</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenchange event.</li>
<li><code>onfullscreenerror</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenerror event.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-clipboard-async-api">2. 📋 Clipboard Async API</h2>
<p>What is a clipboard in comuping?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The clipboard is a buffer that some operating systems provide for short-term storage and transfer within and between application programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are mainly three operations you can perform with the clipboard. They are, <code>copy</code>, <code>cut</code> and <code>paste</code>. The Clipboard API provides the ability to respond to these three operations. </p>
<p>Interestingly, copying content to the clipboard is open as in, there is no need of a user permission. However, for pasting the content from the clipboard to the user application, the user needs to grant permission for it. It is achieved using another web API called, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API">Permission API</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716493747/PwPwDDK8Y.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Here is a simple example of the copy-paste operation,</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716547383/PoXUNZmnr.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="clip_board.gif"></p>
<p>This is how to check if the feature is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (navigator.clipboard 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.read 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.write) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the async API function for writing the content to the clipboard,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performCopy</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
      <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.writeText(copyText);
      <span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${copyText}</span> copied to clipboard`</span>);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to copy: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Async API function to read the content from the clipboard and do something with it,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performPaste</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
       <span>const</span> text = <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.readText();
       setPastetext(text);
       <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Pasted content: '</span>, text);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to read clipboard contents: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note: With the inclusion of the <code>Clipboard Async API</code>, you can get rid of the usage of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand">document.execCommad()</a> function as it is obsolete now.</p>

<h2 id="3-resize-observer-api">3. 🧐 Resize Observer API</h2>
<p>Do you want to take some actions based on the changes to the content or border box of a DOM element? Are you thinking of writing a handler by yourself? What if I tell you, there is already one provided by the web API implementation?</p>
<p>Here is a story about a dumb button. We use a range slider to resize the button. While the button gets resized, we also want to control the text color, without letting the button know much about it. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717277220/dITL6Nog2.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="resizer.gif"></p>
<p>First, create a button and specify an id so that, we can access the button later using the id.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;StyledButton id=<span>"dumbBtnId"</span>&gt;
   I am a Dumb Button
&lt;<span>/StyledButton&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now we create a slider using the <code>range</code> input type from HTML5. A <code>resize()</code> function is invoked when the slider value changes.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
   <span><span>&lt;<span>input</span> 
         <span>onChange</span>=<span>{(event)</span> =&gt;</span> resize(event)} 
         type="range" 
         min={minRange} 
         max={maxRange} 
         defaultValue={rangeValue} /&gt;
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>resize()</code> function simply sets the width of the button as the slider range value so that, it can be resized dynamically.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> resize = event =&gt; {
   <span>const</span> value = event.target.valueAsNumber;
   setRangeValue(value);
   <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
   dumbBtn.style.width = <span>`<span>${value}</span>px`</span>;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>So far, so good? Now for every range value change, the button gets resized. We have a <code>ResizeObserver</code> observing this change and change the color of the button text.</p>
<pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {
   <span>try</span> {
            <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
            <span>var</span> resizeObserver = <span>new</span> ResizeObserver(entries =&gt; {
                <span>for</span>(<span>const</span> entry <span>of</span> entries) {
                    
                    
                   entry.target.style.color = <span>'green`;
                }
      });
      resizeObserver.observe(dumbBtn);
   } catch(e) {
            setSupported(false);
            console.log(e);      
   }
}, [rangeValue]);</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="4-image-capture-api">4. 📷 Image Capture API</h2>
<p>There are some cool and useful APIs around user media like, audio, video etc. I love the <code>Image Capture API</code> which helps us to capture an image or grab a frame from the video devices(like webcam). Not only that, you can also perform actions on capturing an image or grabbing a frame.</p>
<p>First, get the user media access. In this case we are getting the webcam access.</p>
<pre><code>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: <span>true</span>})
  .then(mediaStream =&gt; {
     <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'video'</span>).srcObject = mediaStream;
     <span>const</span> track = mediaStream.getVideoTracks()[<span>0</span>];
     setTrack(track);
  }).catch(error =&gt; {
     <span>console</span>.error(<span>` <span>${error}</span> is not yet supported`</span>);
     setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Just like the clipboard paste operation, a webcam media access permission has to be granted by the user.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717565379/MCRNY49Tl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Now Grab a frame and do something. In this example, I am just drawing the frame on a Canvas.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.grabFrame()
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#grabFrameCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>I can also take a picture and do the similar thing.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.takePhoto().then(blob =&gt; createImageBitmap(blob))
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#takePhotoCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>To stop the video streaming from the webcam, just call he method <code>stop()</code> on the running video track.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> videoOff = () =&gt; {
   track.stop();
 }
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717833234/MPOxVZ92M.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="chrome_Umvi16wUlu.png"></p>
<p>Also watch out for the methods,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getPhotoCapabilities()</code>: To get the ranges of available configuration options.</li>
<li><code>getPhotoSettings()</code>: To get the current photo configuration settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-broadcast-channel-api">5. 📡 Broadcast Channel API</h2>
<p>The <code>Broadcast Channel API</code> allows communication between browsing contexts (windows, tabs, iframes) and workers on the <strong>same origin</strong>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>8 months ago, but it feels like years ago, somebody shared a link to broot <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21998638">on Hacker News</a>. There was some very kind messages and broot gained a few users. But I had more in my TODO list.</p>
<p>A lot was done since.</p>
<p>At first sight, <a href="https://dystroy.org/broot">broot</a> didn't change much:
It looks the same and what could be done then can still be done the same way, 500 commits and 60 releases later.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-still-explore-the-same-way">You can still explore the same way</h2>
<p>Broot still shows you an overview of directories, even huge ones, and lets you navigate and understand the structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/old_broot-overview.png" alt="old_broot-overview"></p>
<h2 id="you-can-search-and-open-the-same-way">You can search and open the same way</h2>
<p>You search with a few keystrokes, navigate, hit <kbd>enter</kbd> on a directory to focus it, or <kbd>alt</kbd><kbd>enter</kbd> to <code>cd</code> to it.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/old_broot-search.png" alt="old_broot-search"></p>
<p>You hit <kbd>enter</kbd> on a file to ask the system to open it, or a <kbd>space</kbd>, a <kbd>e</kbd> then <kbd>enter</kbd> to edit it in your favorite editor.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-manipulate-files-the-same-way">You can manipulate files the same way</h2>
<p>You do the standard manipulations like <code>rm</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>cp</code>, <code>chmod</code>, etc. with just a space or a colon followed by the name of the verb and some arguments if necessary.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/old_broot-cp.png" alt="old_broot-cp"></p>
<p>(here, after having selected my <code>deploy.sh</code> file with <code>sh</code>, I copy it into <code>preview.sh</code>)</p>

<h2 id="exploration-got-buffed">Exploration got buffed</h2>
<p>New data are available, for example the last modified dates and sizes which are deeply computed on directories (in background) and can be used for sorting.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/new_broot-explore.png" alt="new_broot-explore"></p>
<p>And there's a preview now.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/preview-text.png" alt="preview-text"></p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/preview-image.png" alt="preview-image"></p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/preview-binary.png" alt="preview-binary"></p>
<h2 id="searching-and-opening-got-buffed-too">Searching and opening got buffed too</h2>
<p>You can search on paths (not just filenames); or on file contents by prefixing your pattern with <code>c/</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/content-search.png" alt="content-search"></p>
<p>If you hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>→</kbd>, which opens the preview, you see the matches in the file:</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/content-search-with-preview.png" alt="content-search-with-preview"></p>
<p>And from here you can navigate to the selected match, and maybe open the file on that line in your editor. A typical search process is described <a href="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-c-search/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Just like for filtering on file names, content search results are updated while you type. And the search syntax lets you <a href="https://dystroy.org/broot/input/#the-filtering-pattern">combine searches</a>, for example you may find files containing both "foo" and "bar", but not the txt files, with <code>c/foo&amp;c/bar&amp;!/txt$/</code>.</p>
<p>Regarding file opening, the most requested feature was the ability to be back in broot when quitting vi or another terminal editor. This is now available.</p>
<h2 id="operations-on-files-got-buffed-too">Operations on files got buffed too</h2>
<p>The most visible change is the ability to open several panels, for example for operations involving two locations, like a move or copy:</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/cpp.png" alt="cpp"></p>
<p>Now I have to confess something: I expected probably too much from this feature. While it works and doesn't seem to have problems it turns out I don't use it much. It was probably less important for easier file operations than less visible features like tab completion. I don't know yet if I was blinded by my fond remembrance of Norton Commander (back in the days of Windows 3.1) or if there's something that should be improved. I'll probably have to think about this more and I'm curious of the opinion of experienced broot users.</p>
<p>Customization of verbs and their keyboard shortcuts was also improved, allowing richer actions, like opening sub terminals or launching non trivial external applications.</p>

<p>Most of the initial technical choices were probably right.</p>
<p>My enthusiam for Rust only grew during this time and I'm not sure I could have as easily done so many big refactorings with another language, especially as broot being a "side project" I didn't have it fully in head 100% of the time.
Having whole categories of bugs prevented by the language is a huge relief.</p>
<p>The biggest internal change was the replacement of <a href="https://github.com/redox-os/termion">Termion</a> with <a href="https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm">Crossterm</a>.</p>
<p>Termion is obvious, concise, simple to use. It's still a good solution for a small linux utility. But it's limited and binding; its design makes features like skinning an application very difficult. And, at the time of the switch at least, it wasn't maintained and major bugs weren't handled.
Crossterm on the other hand, while intrinsically more complex, was more powerful.
Its main maintainers tackled the hard work of building a real cross-platform terminal IO library, which involves dealing with an incredible number of small discrepancies.
This choice allowed me to distribute broot on Mac and Windows and not just Linux.</p>
<p>I also introduced more concurrency, to make computations parallel and not block the interface.</p>
<p>Rust makes concurrency harder. You have to go to some length to do that properly, you can't just share a pointer and hope everything will be fine. It also makes it safer.
"Fearless concurrency" means you won't spend hours trying to guess all the ways your parallel computation could get unlucky. I found <a href="https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam">Crossbeam</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">rayon</a> very useful basic bricks for building parallelims in broot.</p>

<p>In the last 8 months, I probably didn't spend one hour on a computer without using broot, I'm convinced it's a very useful tool which has no equivalent.</p>
<p>Using broot all the time made my TODO list grow to more than 600 lines (down to about 400 lines now). But there's nothing major anymore on it, nothing I feel essential, broot feels complete for me.</p>
<p>Right now what I'd like for broot is to find users, and with some luck some of those users will tell me how they use it which would fuel my reflection.</p>

<p>The Rust programming language has become a popular choice amongst software engineers since its release in 2010. Besides being something new and interesting, Rust promised to offer exceptional performance and reliability. In particular, Rust achieves memory-safety and thread-safety through its ownership model. Instead of runtime checks, this safety is assured at compile time by Rust's borrow checker. This prevents undefined behaviour such as dangling pointers!</p>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>I first encountered Rust sometime around 2015 when I was updating my teaching materials on memory management in C. A year later in 2016, I implemented a simple multi-objective evolutionary algorithm in Rust as an academic exercise (available: <a href="https://github.com/shahinrostami/simple_ea">https://github.com/shahinrostami/simple_ea</a>). I didn't have any formal training with Rust, nor did I complete any tutorial series, I just figured things out using the documentation as I progressed through my project.</p>
<p>Some example code from this project takes ZDT1 from its mathematical expression in Equation 1</p><p>
$$
\begin{aligned}
f_1(x_1) &amp;= x_1 \tag{1} \\
f_2(x) &amp;= g \cdot h \\
g(x_2,\ldots,x_{\mathrm{D}}) &amp;= 1 + 9 \cdot \sum_{d=2}^{\mathrm{D}} \frac{x_d}{(D-1)}\\
h(f_1,g) &amp;= 1 - \sqrt{f1/g}
\end{aligned}
$$</p><p>to the Rust implementation below.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>It was interesting to see that since writing this code in 2016, some of my dependencies have been deprecated and replaced.</p>
<p>My greatest challenge was breaking away from what I already knew. Until this point, I was familiar with languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, Python, MATLAB, etc., with the majority of my time spent working with memory managed languages. I found myself resisting Rust's intended usage, and it is still something I'm working on.</p>
<p>Now that I am about to commence my sabbatical from my University post, I've decided to try Rust again. This time, I'm going to write a book which focusses on using Rust and Jupyter Notebooks to implemented algorithms and conducted experiments, most likely in the fields of search, optimisation, and machine learning. Can we write and execute all our code in a Jupyter Notebook? Yes! <em>Should</em> we? Probably not. However, I enjoy the workflow, and making this an enjoyable process is important to me.</p>

        <p id="article-description">How to avoid buying your bike again every 6-12
        months and tips for how to apply the same reasoning to other things, like
        computers</p>
        <hr>
        <figure>
            <img src="http://calpaterson.com/assets/solitary-wheel.jpeg" alt="a solitary wheel left behind after the rest of the bike was nicked">
            <figcaption>
                Rucksack Rupert strikes again
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Some very commonly repeated advice on preventing someone from nicking your
        bike:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Buy a good [~10% of bicycle value] lock, ideally one with a high
            "SoldSecure" rating and lock your bicycle somewhere inside the rear
            triangle and the rear wheel.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I've seen this advice repeated in cycling magazines, in quality newspapers,
        sometimes even by the police and of course on internet forums.</p>
        <p>The above would imply that if you own a £400 bicycle (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/395884/bicycle-average-prices-in-the-european-union-eu-by-country/">a
        typical price in the UK</a>) you'd buy a £40 lock and put it in the right
        place.</p>
        <p>However, it is a cold fact that a cordless angle grinder can defeat any
        bicycle lock, no matter how expensive (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pywN558dJaU&amp;t=198">see this video for a
        demonstration</a>). You can buy a used cordless angle grinder on eBay for less
        than £100. Even U-locks - traditionally thought to be the strongest type of
        lock - are opened in seconds with a sub-£100 angle grinder.</p>
        <p>There is other advice floating around of doubtful value, for example:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Add your bicycle to a national register</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>But cases where BikeRadar manage to reunite bicycles with their owners seem
        to be the exception rather than the rule. Probably this is because, as with
        cars, the first thing you do with a stolen bicycle is take it across a border
        to somewhere different.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Lock your bicycle inside a secure building or place, away from sight</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This prevents opportunistic theft but if this space is shared with others
        (apartment blocks and offices) it in fact serves to increase the economies of
        scale for prepared thieves who break into your storage area late at night with
        a van. It's not uncommon for office bicycle stores (with many fancy, expensive
        bikes inside) to be emptied out completely overnight by professional
        thieves.</p>
        <h2>A threat model, by user persona</h2>
        <p>I think the advice above is poor because it doesn't come from a systematic
        consideration of the problem <em>from the point of view of thieves</em>.</p>
        <p>To come up with better advice requires a threat model, which is a piece of
        jargon for taking a holistic view of the danger posed by attackers. I think one
        of the simplest and most straightforward ways to do threat modelling is by
        <em>user persona</em>, whereby you consider each kind of attacker in turn,
        making some reasonable assumptions about their level of motivation and
        methods.</p>
        <p>As far as bicycle theft is concerned there are three basic types of
        thief.</p>
        <h3>"No-tools Nigel", the rank opportunist</h3>
        <p>Nigel has just his two hands and is simply looking for a ride home or maybe
        something he can sell to a friend for some quick cash.</p>
        <p>Nigel will steal any unlocked bicycle.</p>
        <p>Nigel is also able to take any bicycle parts that can be removed without
        tools. That means any quick-release wheels or thumbscrew saddles. In an urban
        area your parked bicycle may be passed by a Nigel as often as a few times an
        hour so anything that is not bolted down won't last very long.</p>
        <h3>"Rucksack Rupert", the thief with a few hand tools</h3>
        <p>Rupert has a small pair of shears; 4, 5 and 6mm Allen keys and a 15mm
        spanner for wheel nuts.</p>
        <p>Rupert will make his way through cable locks with his shears. If there is a
        valuable part that can be removed with hand tools he will take it. He is
        particularly keen on premium saddles and name brand wheels.</p>
        <h3>"Powertool Percy", the professional with a complete set of tools</h3>
        <p>Percy has a small collection of electric and air tools including an angle
        grinder as well as bolt-cutters and an air-jack. He has access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fence_(criminal)">criminal fences</a> which he
        can use to sell stolen bicycles quickly. Percy often arrives in his van and
        this allows him to steal multiple bikes at once.</p>
        <p>No bicycle is safe from Percy. No lock can hold against his angle grinder.
        Often he finds if he's wearing a hi-vis jacket he can even get away with using
        his power tools in broad daylight. He's willing to chance that if the bicycle
        seems valuable enough.</p>
        <h2>Coming up with better advice based on Nigel, Rupert and Percy</h2>
        <p>In order to keep your bicycle safe you need to take steps against all three
        levels of imaginary thieves.</p>
        <p>"No-tools Nigel" will be warded off simply by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Locking your bicycle whenever you leave it - even if just for a
            minute</li>
            <li>Ensuring you leave nothing on your bicycle that can be removed without
            tools
                <ul>
                    <li>replace quick-release wheel skewers with bolts</li>
                    <li>take your lights with you when you park in public</li>
                    <li>make sure your saddle is not on a thumbscrew</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Rucksack Rupert" will be deterred by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not using a cable lock!</li>
            <li>Making sure that nothing good can be removed from your bicycle with
            hand tools
                <ul>
                    <li>Lock both wheels <em>and the frame</em> to the bike stand -
                    don't rely on bolts</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Powertool Percy" will be kept at bay by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nothing, save ensuring that your bicycle doesn't look valuable enough
            to be worth his time
                <ul>
                    <li>this probably means keeping its value down below a few hundred
                    pounds</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The virtue of the "bicycle shaped object"</h2>
        <p>Valuable bicycles (&gt;£1000) have an extremely short half-life in urban
        areas. The sad truth is that the Percys of the world are common enough and
        resourceful enough that a bicycle worth over a thousand pounds isn't really
        safe anywhere in a large town. <strong>This includes most e-bikes.</strong> You
        might notice that cycle couriers who have e-bikes tend to eat lunch while
        looking directly at their locked e-bike, so that it never goes out of their
        sight. Few people in other lines of work can do the same.</p>
        <p>If the tyres are inflated, my own commuter bicycle is probably worth £30 to
        the right buyer. My bicycle is so low-end that cycling snobs refer to it as a
        mere "bicycle shaped object". Rather selfishly I am glad that such snobs exist
        as having a lot of more valuable bicycles around provides me with good ambient
        security. No thief is going to bother cutting my locks when there is a
        Campagnolo on the next rack.</p>
        <p>One father I know had his primary-school-age daughter "decorate" his
        commuting bicycle with girly stickers and pink glitter. If anyone examines his
        bicycle closely he looks like a complete loon but I think his motivation is
        right: it's going to be much less appealing to steal when it's covered in Miffy
        stickers.</p>
        <h3>Insurance - not usually worth it</h3>
        <p>What about bicycle insurance? It's fairly expensive here in the UK, usually
        10-15% of the bicycle's value annually and insurers typically only pay out when
        the whole bicycle is taken (so if if your front wheel is nicked, you're on your
        own) and when you can demonstrate that it was locked to their standards. Often
        these standards require that it is locked up indoors which means you're
        chancing it whenever you park away from your home or office.</p>
        <h2>Lists of "best practices" vs having your own threat model</h2>
        <p>The same thing goes for securing your bicycle as for securing other things:
        pat, concrete pieces of security advice are something to treat with a bit of
        doubt.</p>
        <p>In bicycles the common mantra is "spend 10% on a lock" but in computing the
        mantras are slogans such as "use a strong password", "back up your important
        data" or "use encryption" but these can all be just as vapid.</p>
        <p>"Strong passwords!" as a slogan fails to address the fact that the average
        internet user has hundreds of logins for various sites (my own password manager
        has over 700 sites recorded). The majority of internet users decide on a single
        "strong password" and then use it everywhere. They are only a single bad
        sysadmin or javascript injection away from losing access to every account on
        every website they have.</p>
        <p>Backing up your important data is only an aid to your security if the backup
        is stored as securely as the original. Much user data is stolen or exposed
        through poorly secured backups on shared fileservers. A huge number of people
        have passport and utility bill scans in their Dropbox - again, behind the same
        email and password they use everywhere. Companies can be surprisingly sloppy
        with backups too: often dumped into cloud storage somewhere once before the Big
        Migration and never removed.</p>
        <p>Encryption is troublesome as it can give undue confidence that can backfire
        spectacularly: a quarter of a million American diplomatic cables were
        inadvertantly published in unredacted form when a Guardian journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks:_Inside_Julian_Assange%27s_War_on_Secrecy">
        included the password for an widely-distributed encrypted file in his book</a>.
        Apparently he thought the file's password was somehow temporary. It wasn't.</p>
        <p>Instead of following such "best practices" it's much more intellectually
        robust to <strong>come up with your own threat model</strong> - then you can
        decide your own concrete steps instead of just following the security steps of
        others which might be inapplicable or even wrong.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
	"Want to hear the joke about insulin?" goes the bleak gag about America's drug prices. "You have to go to Canada to get it."</p>
<p>
	But even that's not an option anymore.</p>
<p>
	Pandemic travel restrictions have made Americans prisoners of their country. Even within North America, Mexico and Canada have closed thousands of kilometres of border to all but essential travel, roiling plans for vacation, work, and school. For cash-strapped Americans, it has also cut off access to medicines and health-care services that they can't afford at home -- at a time when money is tighter than ever.</p>
<p>
	Stephanie Boland's nine-year-old son was diagnosed with diabetes in December. Travelling to Canada to fill his insulin prescription took a half-day's drive from where they live in Brainerd, Minnesota, but it was worth it -- the purchase was a simple, over-the-counter affair. One pack of injection pens, which would last several months, cost less than a hundred dollars, she says, compared to <a href="https://www.lillypricinginfo.com/humalog" target="_blank">a list price of $530 at home. </a></p>
<p>
	As their son's disease began to rewrite the routines of daily life, the Bolands planned to cross into Canada again to restock. Then the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>
	Boland, a masseuse, was forced to stop working. Her husband, a self-employed financial adviser, found his income hit by pandemic-related turbulence in the markets, too. Then their source for affordable insulin vanished behind <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/19/opinions/canada-us-border-coronavirus-bociurkiw/index.html" target="_blank">a border that had never been closed before</a> in the history of <a href="https://theconversation.com/shuttered-canada-us-border-highlights-different-approaches-to-the-pandemic-and-differences-between-the-2-countries-137848" target="_blank">U.S.-Canada relations</a>.</p>
<p>
	"We were going to make a trip north, one more trip in March, but then they closed the border," she said.</p>
<h3>
	BUYING INSULIN ABROAD</h3>
<p>
	Only 1.5% of American adults who take prescription medications buy their drugs abroad, according to a June analysis by researchers at the University of Florida Gainesville, based on a 2015-2017 National Health Interview Survey.</p>
<p>
	But that's still <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2767592?resultClick=3" target="_blank">an estimated 2.3 million people</a>.</p>
<p>
	Many medicines and medical services are cheaper in neighbouring Canada and Mexico, thanks to price controls and <a href="https://www.oecd.org/mexico/38097348.pdf" target="_blank">the power of the U.S. dollar</a>. The difference is great enough that U.S. insurer PEHP, which covers Utah's state employees, offers partially paid trips to Vancouver and Tijuana "<a href="https://www.pehp.org/pharmacy/tourism" target="_blank">to help you save money on your prescriptions</a>."</p>
<p>
	In popular Mexican resort towns like Cabo San Lucas on the West Coast, or Tulum on the East Coast, pharmacies, doctors and dentists targeting U.S. clientele dot the main drag, their prices on bright display. And the difference between those prices and the costs of the same drugs at U.S. pharmacies can mean life or death.</p>
<p>
	No drug is a better-known example of that calculus than insulin, a vital hormone in the body's metabolism. Seven million American diabetics don't produce it naturally -- or not enough of it -- and need to inject it throughout the day. Without it, dangerous levels of glucose build up in the blood, damaging organs and producing a painful stupor. In a worst case scenario, lack of insulin can kill within three days.</p>
<p>
	Americans have been going to Canada for insulin since scientists learned how to produce it in labs at the University of Toronto in 1921. One of the first patients to try it was an American: Elizabeth Hughes, the teenage daughter of then-U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes.</p>
<p>
	"I'm so happy and elated," <a href="https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AL10111" target="_blank">she wrote</a> in a letter to her mother from Canada, describing her first self-injection and the "enormous" meal she enjoyed afterward. Before crossing the border, the 15-year-old had managed her condition by starving herself -- the only life-prolonging trick available to diabetics before insulin. Five feet tall, she weighed only <a href="https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AW10006" target="_blank">45 pounds.</a></p>
<p>
	A hundred years later, and after <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/08/us/states-passing-bills-insulin-insurance-copay-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">national soul-searching</a> over the soaring cost of insulin, some Americans are still starving themselves. Daniel Carlisle, a Type 1 diabetic in Texas, has sometimes tried not to eat for days at a time, in an attempt to ration insulin. When he was 18 and short on cash, he even contemplated robbing a pharmacy, he says.</p>
<p>
	"I always do the math about how many days' supply of insulin I have in the refrigerator," the 60-year-old Texan says.</p>
<p>
	"That's how I know my lifespan at that point. My lifespan is measured in exactly how many days' worth of insulin I have in hand -- plus three days."</p>
<h3>
	NUEVO PROGRESO</h3>
<p>
	For the past three years, buying insulin in Mexico has brought Carlisle security.</p>
<p>
	His trips started with a split tooth in 2017. "I went to a dentist near where I live, and he said he could repair it for like $10,000," says Carlisle, who is uninsured. "So I told him, 'Look I can't afford to send my kids to Harvard. Sure can't afford to send yours."</p>
<p>
	He tried to ignore his aching tooth, but at the urging of his family, eventually drove several hundred kilometres south from his home in Houston to the busy Mexican town of Nuevo Progreso.</p>
<p>
	"As soon as you come across the bridges, hawkers are saying "Need a dentist? Need a pharmacy? It's just constant," he says. First he got his tooth fixed -- a root canal, bridge and crown altogether would end up costing him just $750. "The dentists aren't marble palaces, but they're clean," he says.</p>
<p>
	Then he dipped into a pharmacy to ask the price of a vial of Humalog insulin, one of two kinds he takes. The answer: US$70. He checked the expiration date on the box, and then offered $20.</p>
<p>
	"You've got to negotiate!" he says. "I just tell them I'll die without it and then they'll lose a customer. They don't put up a fuss."</p>
<p>
	A vial of the same insulin in the U.S. has a list price of $274.70.</p>
<p>
	Since then, that's the only place where he buys insulin, Carlisle says, and he's never had a problem with its quality. But with the borders closed, he doesn't expect be back any time soon.</p>
<h3>
	A VAST GREY AREA</h3>
<p>
	Pharmacy staff in several drugstores in border towns in both Canada and Mexico tell CNN that they've seen significant drops in foot traffic since their countries' borders with the U.S. closed. Though American scofflaws have been accused of crossing into Mexico for nonessential errands, overall border crossings <a href="https://explore.dot.gov/views/BorderCrossingData/Monthly?:embed=y&amp;:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:showVizHome=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link" target="_blank">have plummeted</a>.</p>
<p>
	One young man working at a pharmacy near Tijuana told CNN that business had fallen about 40% since the border closed. He asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak about the business.</p>
<p>
	Technically, bringing prescription drugs into the U.S. is illegal. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has created <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.fda.gov_industry_import-2Dbasics_personal-2Dimportation&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=tq9bLrSQ8zIr87VusnUS9yAL0Jw_xnDiPuZjNR4EDIQ&amp;r=rCHQaNbjPpivEAmu6NC2SN5wUrEBtRzWRu-4Q4NII98&amp;m=WQfC6uO0pwOxMMVHYr1M2sV1Imudp8inpPiV52_rqCQ&amp;s=rhQ5OrNJsHfUWt-LO0TyUzEZRLTw60VpuTji1hJpH7k&amp;e=" target="_blank">a grey area</a> for small amounts: Importation "might" be allowed, according to the agency's website, if the medicine doesn't exceed a three month supply.</p>
<p>
	Staff at Mark's Marine Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada, less than an hour's drive from the U.S. border, typically fill hundreds of orders for U.S. customers each day, general manager Jordan Rosenblatt says, and rarely have any problem shipping it. With the borders closed, online ordering has spiked, he adds.</p>
<p>
	Reviews over the years on their Facebook page compare prices of all kinds of prescription drugs to those in the U.S., with commenters from as far as New Jersey and Texas. "They sell and send me my asthma inhalers at a price that is non-predatory, unlike here in the U.S. Happiest gal today! Thank you!" reads one.</p>
<p>
	But ordering online isn't for everyone -- there is always a risk that the medicine will be confiscated or that temperature-sensitive drugs like insulin could go bad waiting at customs or in U.S. Postal Service delays.</p>
<p>
	And as the frustrations of border closures highlight, foreign health systems make a poor fallback no matter how you access them.</p>
<p>
	"For any given individual in the short run, going to Canada is a decent solution, but it's not a systemic solution," says Dr. Vikas Saini, a Harvard-trained cardiologist and president of the<a href="https://lowninstitute.org/" target="_blank"> Lown Institute</a>, a nonpartisan health-care think tank.</p>
<p>
	U.S. President Donald Trump has called to allow larger scale importation from Canada, among <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/22/politics/trump-drug-prices-fact-check/index.html" target="_blank">a raft of recent proposals</a> to reduce the prices of certain U.S. drugs. But that's unlikely to make a dent in the U.S. market, Saini says: "Canada is a country of about 30 million people. It doesn't have enough medication to provide all those prescriptions for the U.S. -- a nation 10 times the size."</p>
<p>
	Some <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/drug-exports-us-1.5236532" target="_blank">Canadian health industry groups</a> and patients agree. Since 2019, they've warned that Trump's importation plan could lead to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/american-demand-canada-drug-supply-1.5226871" target="_blank">drug shortages</a> for Canadians -- a fear likely sharpened after witnessing global shortages of vital medical equipment in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<h3>
	A CRUMBLING ECONOMY</h3>
<p>
	As the pandemic wears on, the options are dwindling for Americans who can't afford to be sick in the United States -- especially after the cratering economy erased<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/07/economy/july-2020-jobs-report/index.html" target="_blank"> nearly 13 million</a> jobs, taking health insurance options with them.</p>
<p>
	Even <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/u-s-canada-drug-prices-1.5552463" target="_blank">at Canadian prices</a>, some are struggling to pay for their prescriptions. "Recently, we're hearing about all the financial issues of people laid off," says Rosenblatt, the Vancouver pharmacy manager. "We have American customers that have been working with us for years, and under these circumstances, we've sent what they needed and we tell them, 'Pay us when you can.'"</p>
<p>
	To make insulin more accessible, some U.S. states have pushed for price caps on copays. The three companies which <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=BasicSearch.process" target="_blank">control the U.S. insulin market</a> offer discount plans, including <a href="https://www.novonordisk-us.com/media/news-releases.html?122988" target="_blank">new programs</a> to which Americans who were financially impacted by the pandemic can apply for temporary access to cheaper or free insulin. And Walmart offers cheap insulin over the counter (though this is an older formulation that can make blood sugar management more complicated than newer, prescription versions.)</p>
<p>
	Yet many are still struggling -- and not just the <a href="https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/" target="_blank">nearly 28 million Americans</a> who don't have health insurance, a number estimated by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Even Americans with health insurance, who benefit from negotiated prices that are lower than the list prices, sometimes <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/04/29/go-there-insulin-high-cost.cnn" target="_blank">still can't afford</a> all the costs of living with diabetes.</p>

<p>In this post, we discuss the risks of the AWS Instance Metadata service in AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters. In particular, we demonstrate that compromising a pod in the cluster can have disastrous consequences on resources in the AWS account if access to the Instance Metadata service is not explicitly blocked.</p>



<hr>




<h2><span id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>



<p>For the purposes of this post, we’ll use an EKS cluster running Kubernetes v1.17.9 and created with <a href="https://eksctl.io/">eksctl</a>. We could also have created the cluster using Terraform or CloudFormation.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">eksctl create cluster \ 
  --nodes 1 \ 
  --name christophe-cluster \ 
  --node-type t3.large</pre>



<p>Once we created the cluster, we can use the AWS CLI to update our kubectl configuration file for us and start interacting with the Kubernetes API right away.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ aws eks update-kubeconfig --name christophe-cluster
Added new context arn:aws:eks:eu-central-1:account-id:cluster/christophe-cluster to /home/christophetd/.kube/config</pre>



<h2><span id="It_all_starts_with_a_compromised_Pod8230">It all starts with a compromised Pod…</span></h2>



<p>Let’s assume an attacker compromised a pod in the cluster, for instance by exploiting a vulnerability in the web application it was running. We simulate this scenario by running a pod and attaching to a shell inside it.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ kubectl run --rm -i --tty mypod --image=alpine --restart=Never -- sh

(pod)$ hostname
mypod</pre>



<p>Good! As an attacker, we’re now interested to enumerate resources in the cluster and in the associated AWS account. For completeness, we can have a look at the ATT&amp;CK-like threat matrix for Kubernetes by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/02/attack-matrix-kubernetes/">Microsoft</a>:</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/k8s-matrix.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>In the rest of this post, we’ll take a look at how the AWS Instance Metadata API (circled in green) <a href="https://blog.christophetd.fr/abusing-aws-metadata-service-using-ssrf-vulnerabilities/">strikes again</a> and allows us to do interesting things.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html">Instance Metadata service</a> is an AWS API listening on a link-local IP address, 169.254.169.254. It is only accessible from EC2 instances and allows to retrieve various information about them. </p>



<p>It is particularly useful when you need your instances to access AWS resources. Instead of hard-coding credentials, you first assign an IAM role to your instance. From the instance, you can then retrieve temporary credentials for the role. This is 100 % transparent if you use the AWS CLI.</p>



<h2><span id="Accessing_the_Instance_Metadata_service_from_a_compromised_pod">Accessing the Instance Metadata service from a compromised pod</span></h2>



<p>At first sight, it’s unclear what would happen if we were to query the Instance Metadata service from a compromised pod – so let’s give it a try.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">(pod)$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/                                                                                                                                             
ami-id                                                                                                                                                                                        
ami-launch-index
...
security-groups</pre>



<p>Good. What’s the context of the data returned?</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">(pod)$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/info

  "InstanceProfileId" : "AIPA..."
}</pre>



<p>Interestingly enough, we see that we can access the Instance Metadata service and that we’re able to retrieve temporary credentials for the IAM role <em>christophe-cluster-nodegroup-ng-15050c0b-<strong>NodeInstanceProfile</strong>-1AS40JWHFGXJ2</em>. </p>

<p>This is the IAM role assigned to the EC2 instances acting as Kubernetes worker nodes! What can we do with it?</p>



<h2><span id="Least_privilege_you_say">Least privilege, you say?</span></h2>



<p>This role is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/worker_node_IAM_role.html">documented</a> by AWS, and we can see it’s attached to the following AWS managed policies:</p>



<figure><img src="https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.png 749w, https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-300x102.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></figure>



<p>I’ve seen <a href="https://twitter.com/0xdabbad00/status/998978082466758661?lang=en">Scott Piper</a> regularly rant about AWS managed policies, arguing they are too privileged. Are they?</p>

<p>Outch. Does that look bad? It’s because it is. Let’s see what these permissions allow us to do.</p>



<p>We can install the AWS CLI locally and set the credentials we retrieved earlier from the Instance Metadata service.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ASIA...
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=Xm/..
$ export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=IQo...
$ aws sts get-caller-identity
{
    "UserId": "A...Q:i-02f...",
    "Account": "account-id",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::account-id:assumed-role/eksctl-christophe-cluster-nodegro-NodeInstanceRole-1XY9GXQ417J7H/i-02..."
}</pre>



<p>Then, here are some examples of bad things we can do.</p>



<ul><li>Map the network, by <strong>listing and describing VPCs, subnets, and security groups</strong>. Not only the VPC associated to the EKS cluster, but <em>across the whole AWS account.</em><br></li><li><strong>Describe <em>any EC2 instance</em></strong><em> in the AWS account.</em> This includes information such as the AMI used, private IP, disks attached…<br></li><li><strong>Nuke <em>all network interfaces</em></strong><em> of every EC2 instan</em>ce with successive calls to <em>ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces</em>, <em>ec2:DetachNetworkInterface</em>, and <em>ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface</em>. This will bring offline all your instances and dependent AWS managed services. Your fancy EKS cluster? Gone. Your highly-available, auto-scalable web application spanning in 3 AZs? Offline. Great attack vector for a denial of service.<br></li><li><strong>Enumerate and pull any Docker image</strong> (“<em>ECR repository</em>“) in the account. As a bonus, you can even query the image vulnerability scan results by calling <em>ecr:DescribeImageScanFindings</em>. This will give you a nice list of the vulnerabilities <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-scanning.html">identified</a> by AWS in these images. This can be very helpful for further exploitation of pods inside the EKS cluster. Who needs Nessus anyway?</li></ul>



<p>Again, all this is <strong>AWS account-wide</strong>, comes by default when spinning up an EKS cluster, and is accessible by only having compromised a single, underprivileged pod in the cluster.</p>



<h2><span id="Remediation">Remediation</span></h2>



<p>This flaw is actually not new – it’s even <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/restrict-ec2-credential-access.html">documented</a> by AWS, who suggests to block the Instance Metadata service by creating an iptables rule on every EKS worker node. This is rather impractical if your EKS nodes are managed by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html">node groups</a>, dynamically spinning up EC2 instances to act as EKS worker nodes. You’d need to create a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-launch-template-and-custom-ami-support-in-amazon-eks-managed-node-groups/">custom node group launch template</a> or custom AMI.</p>



<p>Another option is to <strong>use Kubernetes network policies to block access to the Instance Metadata service</strong>. Unfortunately, the <a href="https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s">Kubernetes network plugin</a> that EKS uses does not natively support network policies. The recommended workaround is to add the Calico Network Policy provider, which will be able to pick up your network policy objects and apply them. Note that this is <span>not</span> a full new <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/">CNI plugin</a> for your cluster, just a “network policy enforcer” (<a href="https://www.projectcalico.org/calico-network-policy-comes-to-kubernetes/">Calico supports both modes.</a>)</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/calico.html">AWS documentation</a>, we can install the Calico Network Policy provider on our cluster:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/release-1.6/config/v1.6/calico.yaml
# Wait for a few seconds...
$ kubectl get daemonset calico-node --namespace kube-system
NAME          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR                 AGE
calico-node   1         1         1       1            1           beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux   17m</pre>



<p>Calico runs as a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/">DaemonSet</a>, making sure that each worker node has its own Calico pod, picking up network policy objects and applying them locally on the nodes with iptables.</p>



<p>We can now write our network policy filtering egress traffic. In its simplest form, we will allow any outbound traffic not directed to the Instance Metadata IP.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="yaml" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3

<p><strong>Please Note: </strong><br></p>
<p>This boilerplate is a working game but it does require some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if you want to customize it, or a willingness to learn these technologies. If you need help learning there is an extended option you can select when you buy which includes <strong>one hour of video coaching</strong> to help you get started. There is also the YouTube screencast series (currently filming!) which you can follow along with.<br></p>
<p>Web app templates are often priced in the  $20 - $1000 range, but I wanted to make this accessible to roguelike game developers like myself at a reasonable price. <strong>If you're not completely satisfied with your purchase please make contact and you will get a full refund</strong>.<br></p>

<p>Hey I’m Ahmed, a self taught software engineer. In my path of self learning, I tried multiple languages and frameworks; and one of them was Ruby on Rails.</p>



<p>That was at least 5 years ago, and I hated it. I didn’t know why, but it just felt different in a bad way at that time.</p>



<p>A few years after, exactly 3 months ago, I started learning Ruby on Rails again. But this time I was shocked! Why didn’t I learn it before? Look at how things are easier here? Why are we spending so much time in other frameworks while this is working out of the box?…</p>



<h2>The hobby phase</h2>



<p>As a developer, you start your coding journey as a hobby. You discovered code and how you can turn your ideas to life. Now, you’re hooked. You spend a lot of time coding and working with technology! In fact, according to this <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#developer-profile-_-coding-as-a-hobby">StackOverflow survey</a>, 80% of developers code as a hobby.</p>



<p>Before the technology boom, people used to hate their day job. It was a source of income so they can do other things on the side. But for code, it’s different. It’s a hobby <strong>and</strong> a daily job.</p>



<p>It’s a no brainer that, we as developers, tend to over-architect things, build things from scratch, re-invent the wheel, etc… It’s a hobby and we want to experience the most out of it. And as a fresh software engineer discovering this new hobby, you want languages and frameworks giving you more flexibility to create, architect, and play with technology.</p>



<p>You can spend hours trying to make two frameworks play nicely together. Create the perfect build process. Architect your todo app. Deploy your simple app to a multi-region cloud provider, etc. And in the end, you feel happy. You don’t feel like you wasted time, because it’s your hobby! And we don’t waste time on hobbies. They are a source of happiness.</p>



<p>You’re in the <strong>hobby phase</strong>. </p>



<hr>



<h2>The get-things-done phase</h2>



<p>As you get more experience in the field, you’re more likely move out of the hobby phase. This is due to different causes, and some of them are: </p>



<ul><li>You don’t have enough time outside work to play with code (family, children, other new hobbies…)</li><li>Your past experiences show it’s not worth it to spend so much time early on trying to optimize</li><li>You’re now happier to see a product launch more than the technology behind it</li><li>You have a broad knowledge about the product inside your organization</li><li>And others…</li></ul>



<p>As you reach this new phase, you do not care about frameworks and languages anymore. You want what gets the job done as your objectives are greater than the technology. You want a set of frameworks that plays nicely together and get the job done as quickly as possible. And that’s when you’ll find something like Ruby on Rails.</p>



<p>Ruby on Rails is a set of tools and frameworks that plays nicely together as long as you use what’s given to you. You don’t have the freedom to use new frameworks or build things the way you want. But if you abide by the Ruby on Rails rules, you’ll move faster.</p>



<p>You’re in the <strong>get-things-done phase</strong>. Being on the get-things-done phase <strong>is a prerequisite</strong> to liking Ruby on Rails. No one likes something that limits their “creativity” if they are still in the hobby phase. </p>



<p>According to the same <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#experience">StackOverflow survey</a>, 67% of developers have less than 9 years of experience (40% have less than 5 years). That means, 67% are likely to be in the hobby phase. And this is one of the reasons why a lot of developers hate Ruby on Rails.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Skipping the hobby phase</h2>



<p>Being on the hobby phase isn’t bad. In your journey as a developer, you’ll start in the hobby phase. And with time, you’ll move slowly out of it. The timing it takes depends on each individual however.</p>



<p>But can you avoid it altogether? Yes, there are some exceptions. These are people coming from other disciplines. They are marketers, sales, and other non-technical people who discovered they can do more with code. <strong>Their primary objective isn’t to code. It’s to get help from code</strong>.</p>



<p>They are less likely to pick up new technologies or frameworks. They just want something that works and helps them in their job. They are more likely to pick something like Ruby on Rails. Or better, <strong>no-code tools</strong>.</p>

                    <p><strong><strong>The Defective Chessboard problem, </strong></strong>also known as the <strong><strong>Tiling Problem</strong></strong> is an interesting problem. It is typically solved with a “divide and conquer” approach. The algorithm has a time complexity of <strong><strong><em><em>O(n²)</em></em></strong></strong><em><em>.</em></em></p><h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2><p>Given a <em><em>n </em></em>by <em><em>n</em></em> board where <em><em>n</em></em> is of form 2^k where k &gt;= 1 (Basically, n is a power of 2 with minimum value as 2). The board has one missing square). Fill the board using trionimos. A trionimo is an L-shaped tile is a 2 × 2 block with one cell of size 1×1 missing.</p><p>Solving the problem efficiently isn’t the goal of this post. Visualizing the board as the algorithm runs is much more interesting in my opinion, though. Lets discuss the algorithm first.</p><figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/660/0*adonlEHar0FeZ3XM.png" alt="Image for post"><figcaption>The board with no defects added</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-algorithm">The Algorithm</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, a divide-and-conquer (DAC) technique is used to solve the problem. DAC entails splitting a larger problem into sub-problems, ensuring that each sub-problem is an exact copy of the larger one, albeit smaller. You may see where we are going with this, but lets do it explicitly.</p><p>The question we must ask before writing the algorithm is: is this even possible? Well, yes. The total number of squares on our board is <em><em>n</em></em>², or 4^<em><em>k</em></em>. Removing the defect, we would have 4^<em><em>k</em></em> — 1, which is always a multiple of three. This can be proved with mathematical induction pretty easily, so I won’t be discussing it.</p><figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/659/0*zOyl7BWBT9R4Csjd.png" alt="Image for post"></figure><h2 id="the-base-case">The base case</h2><p>Every recursive algorithm must have a base case, to ensure that it terminates. For us, lets consider the case when <em><em>n</em></em>, 2^<em><em>k</em></em> is 2. We thus have a 2×2 block with a single defect. Solving this is trivial: the remaining 3 squares naturally form a trionimo.</p><h2 id="the-recursive-step">The recursive step</h2><p>To make every sub-problem a smaller version of our original problem, all we have to do is add our own defects, but in a very specific way. If you take a closer look, adding a “defect” trionimo at the center, with one square in each of the four quadrants of our board, except for the one with our original defect would allow use to make four proper sub-problems, at the same time ensuring that we can solve the complete problem by adding a last trionimo to cover up the three pseudo-defective squares we added.</p><p>Once we are done adding the “defects”, recursively solving each of the four sub-problems takes us to our last step, which was already discussed in the previous paragraph.</p><h2 id="the-combine-step">The combine step</h2><p>After solving each of the four sub-problems and putting them together to form a complete board, we have 4 defects in our board: the original one will lie in one of the quadrants, while the other three were those we had intentionally added to solved the problem using <strong><strong>DAC</strong></strong>. All we have to do is add a final trionimo to cover up those three ‘defects’ and we are done.</p><p>Thus, the recursive equation for time complexity becomes:</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>T(n) = 4T(n/2)+c</em></em></strong></strong></p><p>The <strong><strong>4 </strong></strong>comes from the fact that to solve each problem of input n, we divide it into 4 sub-problems of input size <em><em>n/2 </em></em>(half the length of the original board). Once we are done solving those sub-problems, all that’s left to be done is to combine them: this is done by adding the last trionimo to cover up the pseudo-defects we added. This, of course, is done in constant time.</p><p>If you are interested in finding the asymptotic time complexity of the recurrence relation, you could try the <strong><strong>recursion tree method </strong></strong>or the <strong><strong>substitution method</strong></strong>. For now, lets just use the <strong><strong>Master theorem</strong></strong>.</p><p>The master theorem says that for a recurrence relation of the form:</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)</em></em></strong></strong></p><p>the complexity depends on the complexities of<em><em> f(n) </em></em>and <em><em>n ^ log_b(a)</em></em> (the log is to the base <em><em>b</em></em>).</p><p>The cases in the image below tell us which case we need to use here.</p><figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1470/1*fPnVzEh00aTSG3PCX2MnXQ.png" alt="Image for post"><figcaption>The Master Theorem. From <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/master-theorem/" rel="noopener nofollow">brilliant.org</a></figcaption></figure><p>Since the value of n ^ log(a) base b is <em><em>n</em></em>², while the term <em><em>f(n) </em></em>is of constant complexity, we use <strong><strong>Case 1, </strong></strong>which ultimately tells us that our algorithm has an order of <strong><strong><em><em>n</em></em>²</strong></strong>. In other words, the time complexity of our algorithm is <strong><strong>O(<em><em>n</em></em>²).</strong></strong></p><h2 id="the-code">The Code</h2><p>Initially, each square is represented by a 0. A ‘-1’ represents a defective square, and would appear black in the plots. Each trionimo would be displayed with a unique number, which would be incremented as more trionimos are added.</p><p>Again, the goal of the code is not optimization — its to do as much from scratch (in plain python) as possible.</p><p>I have commented the code below, so it should be pretty straight-forward.</p><h3 id="importing-required-libraries">Importing required libraries</h3><pre><code>from random import randint

<p><a href="https://devchat.tv/elixir-mix/emx-102-nerves-powered-mechanical-keyboards-with-chris-dose/">
        Chris Dosé was interviewed</a> by us on Elixir Mix. When he spoke about his work on a Nerves-powered keyboard I knew this was a
    project I wanted to try out. So I dropped into their dev channel, acquired the hardware (thanks for the help) and have done some playing
    around with it.
</p>
<p>
    So what is the draw of a Nerves keyboard? Well, you can program it in Elixir. That's a big one for me personally.
    It also means that compared to a lot of high-level languages driving hardware you have pretty strong performance
    characteristics, resilience and specifically with Nerves a lot of best practices for running embedded hardware.
    It makes managing firmware updates easier, it mitigates corruption on SD cards and lots more. As an Elixir
    developer the pure convenience of customizing the keyboard in my favored language is of course delightful.
</p>
<p>
    This post should help you try it out if you have/get the required hardware. The project is currently using the Keybow
    keypad as a prototyping platform to figure out how things should work while they work on the details of a full
    keyboard and it is a neat little gadget, whatever you want to do with it.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Requirements to try this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Keybow kit, with Pi Zero (<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4144">Adafruit</a>)</li>
<li>Micro USB Cable</li>
<li>Micro SD Card</li>
</ul>
<p>To get up and running you should:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/installation.html">Set up Nerves according to these instructions</a></li>
<li>Follow the <a href="https://github.com/ElixirSeattle/xebow">instructions at the xebow repo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    The installation guide might not tell you to go into <code>assets</code> and run <code>npm install</code> but I think
    you have to. I'm not going to tell you how to install Node and NPM because it varies. But you can probably find it <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">around the Node site</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If you reach the point of having burned the firmware to your SD Card, congratulations. We are ready to play.
</p>
<h2>First firmware on the device</h2>
<p>So plug the SD card with your pristine Xebow firmware into the Keybow contraption and plug the Keybow into your
    computer
    with the Micro USB cable. Startup can take a little bit but it should settle into cycling through rainbow colors
    after a
    bit. It should also produce numbers when you poke it (the default keymap is a numpad plus some extras).</p>
<h2>Making changes</h2>
<p>I don't need a single numpad and now I have two of them. Let's make this more useful. Open
    <code>lib/xebow/keyboard.ex</code>
    in your preferred editor.</p>
<p>Replace the default keymap with:</p>
<pre data-file="lib/xebow/keyboard.ex"><span></span>    <span>@keymap</span> <span>[</span>
    <span># THE NAVIGATOR!</span>
    <span>%{</span>

</pre>
<p>And then:</p>
<pre data-file="/">export MIX_TARGET=keybow
mix firmware
mix firmware.gen.script
./upload.sh xebow.local
</pre>
<p>Sometimes the upload process can be finicky. You can always re-burn the firmware to the SD card instead using
    <code>mix firmware.burn</code> instead of the <code>gen.script</code>.</p>
<h2>The navigator</h2>
<p>So with the Keybow on its side, four wide. You'll have this fantastic navigation machine at your disposal.
    Top row are arrows, middle row is VIM navigation or GMail or wherever else the don't-move-your-fingers approach is
    used.
    Bottom row are the extremes of the first row.</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Left</td><td>Down</td><td>Up</td><td>Right</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>H</td><td>J</td><td>K</td><td>L</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Home</td><td>PgDn</td><td>PgUp</td><td>End</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2>Layers?</h2>
<p>So my plan for the keyboard just filled the entire keypad. But the xebow application supports layers, so you can do
    some
    interesting stuff there. I considered doing a chorded keyboard but I'm terrible at them and decided on this as
    something
    I might actually use. There are plenty of cool things you can do with Layers if you want.</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>The folks in #nerves-keyboard (on the <a href="https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/">Elixir Slack</a>) are hard at work figuring out a real mechanical keyboard
    schematic
    that should be a very cool thing to own and play with. Most of the conversation in there right now is about PCB's, CAD and hardware layout. They are a welcoming bunch. So enjoy :)</p>

August 31, 2020 | https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/blog/2020/08/first-impressions-github-codespaces.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/blog/2020/08/first-impressions-github-codespaces.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                <p>Github recently launched their new <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">Github codespaces</a> service - an online, in-browser Integrated Development Environment powered by <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. This environment allows someone to quickly load a virtual machine and a complete code editing interface, that is all accessible within the browser without having to install anything on the users machine. If you are familiar with products like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">Amazon Web Services’s Cloud 9 IDE</a> or its predecessor C9.io this will probably feel very familiar.</p>

<p>As one of the lucky few who were given access to the GitHub Codespaces beta program I had the opportunity to test it out and offer my thoughts on behalf of the Aristotle team below.</p>

<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2>
<p>There were a few small changes that needed to be done to the <a href="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/">Aristotle Metadata home page</a>, (including making this blogpost) and it was easy opening a Codespace to start working. Opening a code space for a project is literally as easy as GitHub says - click “Open in Codespace” on a repository and it does the rest - no need to configuring or decommission a server, its all handled for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-opening-project.png" alt="How to open Codespaces" title="How to open Codespaces"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/">Our website</a> is a basic <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> static site, and offers a great basic test of whats available in Codespaces already. Loading a fresh Codespace took less than 2 minutes, which is comparable to AWS Cloud9. As someone who used Cloud9 when it was still C9.io, Codespaces reminded me a lot of that - its a simple way to open an editor and a virtual machine for a GitHub project.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/about-codespaces">documentation for Codespaces</a> is also great. What I didn’t know is that GitHub can also <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account">load your dotfiles directly into each new Codespace</a>, so your preferences (<code>.bashrc</code> and similar files) will follow you across Codespaces.</p>

<h2 id="editing-files">Editing files</h2>
<p>Being based on Visual Studio Code, <strong>Yes, Codespaces has a Dark Mode</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-dark-editor.png" alt="Default Codespaces Editor" title="Default Codespaces Editor"></p>

<p>Although if you are using different browsers to open your workspace (which I had to do for reasons below), your colour scheme preferences won’t follow you across browsers. I’m not a regular user of Visual Studio Code, but it seems to includes all the standard features you expect from a browser, such as syntax highlighting, VIm and Emac keybindings (which work very well in browser), and autosave which is enabled by default, and I promptly disabled.</p>

<p>You can also drag-and-drop files from your local machine into Codespaces filesystem, and preview and edit certain non-text files in the browser, such as images, both of which are really handy for web development.</p>

<h2 id="terminal-emulator">Terminal emulator</h2>
<p>Codespaces includes a powerful terminal editor that seems to be based on a stock Debian image. The only thing I didn’t like is that separate terminals are accessed using a dropdown instead of with tabs, but this is a minor detail.</p>

<p><strong>Big news: Docker is here</strong>, and it works well.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-docker.png" alt="Docker in Codespaces" title="Docker in Codespaces"></p>

<p>One of my biggest issues with C9.io was the lack of Docker support, which was solved when AWS bought Cloud9 but comes with the extra complexity of configuring your Amazon machine. So being able to simply run Docker in the browser is great. Docker-compose isn’t installed by default, and I haven’t had a chance to see how that works.</p>

<p>The only issue I found with the terminal emulator was you can only paste with right-click into Chromium-based browsers like Chrome or Edge, <em>Firefox users beware</em>.</p>

<h2 id="serving-sites">Serving sites</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace">Codepsaces does a great job of handling port forwarding for you </a>, so you can simply start you server process (on a non-Port 80 port) and if GitHub detects a <code>localhost:PORT</code> combination it makes it accessible for you by clicking on the URL, as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-jekyll.png" alt="Jekyll in Codespaces" title="Jekyll in Codespaces"></p>

<p>Loading and reloading Jekyll was fast, and by the time I clicked the forwarded link or switched tabs to preview changes to the site, it was already refreshed. 
<del><strong>However, this is another Chromium-only feature the clikcable port forward links don’t work in Firefox</strong></del>  this seems to be fixed now in Firefox.</p>

<p>One other minor issue is you can’t open your site in a private window or different browser to view the server without logging into GitHub. This isn’t a huge issue, but if you are trying to view what your site looks like under different browser or when logged out it can be troublesome.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-final-site.png" alt="Aristotle Home Page in Codespaces" title="Aristotle Home Page in Codespaces"></p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p><strong>This is amazing</strong> and may become my default IDE - as a co-founder who is spending less time as a developer, and more time in meetings, writing emails, strategy papers, letters and tenders, <em>this is just amazing</em>! Most of my daily tools are Windows based, so I’ve been spending a lot of time getting Windows Subsystem for Linux working alongside the rest of my daily workflow, which comes with its own headaches. So being able to quickly checkout a branch, make changes and take some load of my local machine seems very promising.</p>

<p>There are a lot of features here to review that I haven’t had a chance to look at, including collaborative workspaces, Git integration and connecting with a local version of Visual Studio, but from a quick glance everything works smoothly.</p>

<p>Overall, it’s an extremely quick way to get started on a project, and I look forward to writing an update after I’ve had a chance getting the Aristotle Metadata Registry software, with all its many dependencies, running in codespaces under Docker-compose.</p>

<![CDATA[Compiling a Lisp: Overture | Max Bernstein]]>

August 31, 2020 | https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>In my <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/lisp/">last series</a>, I wrote about building a
Lisp interpreter. This time, we’re going to write a Lisp compiler.</p>

<p>This series is an adaptation of Abdulaziz Ghuloum’s excellent paper <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/assets/img/11-ghuloum.pdf">An
Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction</a>, with several key differences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our implementation is in C, instead of Scheme</li>
  <li>Our implementation generates machine code directly, instead of generating
text assembly</li>
  <li>Our implementation may omit some runtime data structures</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/ghuloum">my implementation</a> for reference,
but note that it may be incomplete and also may look a little bit different
than the compiler detailed in these posts.</p>

<p>You probably have a couple questions, like <em>why Lisp?</em> and <em>why compile
directly to x86-64?</em> and <em>why C?</em> and <em>come on, another Lisp series?</em>, and
those are all very reasonable questions that will be answered in due time.</p>

<p>I want to implement this compiler in another language than Scheme because it
will prevent me from copying too much of the code from the paper. Even though
the paper doesn’t actually contain the source for the whole compiler (most of
it is, after all, left as exercises for the reader), I think I will learn a lot
more when I have to write all of the code by myself. I get to make my own
mistakes and you get to watch me make and fix them in “real” time.</p>

<p>I also don’t want to generate text assembly, but those reasons are a little
different than my reason for choosing another implementation language:</p>

<p>First, I think that would be harder to test: I want to have an in-process unit
test suite that compiles Lisp programs and executes them on-the-fly. Shelling
out to a system assembler like <code>as</code> or <code>nasm</code> would be somewhat error prone.
What if the person building this doesn’t have the assembler I need? Sure, I
could also write a small assembler as part of this compiler, but that’s a lot
of work.  Harder than just generating x86-64 directly, perhaps.</p>

<p>Second, I want to learn more about machine architecture. While <code>add a, b</code> seems
like one machine instruction, it could probably be encoded in 50 different ways
depending on whether <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are registers, stack locations, other memory
addresses, immediates, which registers they are, etc. Shelling out to an
assembler abstracts a lot of that detail away. I <em>want</em> to get my hands dirty.
Hopefully you do, too.</p>

<p>I chose Lisp because that’s what the Ghuloum paper uses, and because Lisp can
be represented as a small, compact, dynamically typed language. Many
interpreter implementations are under 200 lines. I don’t think this compiler
will be that short, though.</p>

<p>For questions, comments, and suggestions please post on <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~max/compiling-lisp">this sr.ht
elist</a>. It’s a public inbox that I can
use to discuss and receive patches. I got the idea from <a href="https://nullprogram.com/">Chris
Wellons</a>.</p>

<h3 id="background-knowledge">Background knowledge</h3>

<p>In order to get the most out of this series, I recommend having at least passing
familiarity with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>C or a C-like language</li>
  <li>some kind of assembly language</li>
  <li><em>Abstract Syntax Trees</em> and recursive tree traversal</li>
  <li>no particular aversion to parentheses</li>
</ul>

<p>Having the background helps your focus be more on the bigger picture than the
minutia, but it is by no means required. I expect most of this series to be
fairly readable. If it’s not, that’s a bug and you should report it to me.</p>

<h3 id="structure-of-the-series">Structure of the series</h3>

<p>I plan on writing this series in installments where each installment adds a
feature of some kind. Maybe that feature is a new bit of Lisp functionality, or
maybe it’s a refactoring of the compiler, or maybe it’s a compiler
optimization.</p>

<p>For this reason, each post will tend to depend on the code and understanding
from previous posts. As such, I recommend reading the series in order. I’ll
still try to keep the big ideas understandable for those who don’t.</p>

<p>At each stage of the compiler, we should have a battery of tests that ensure
that the features we have already build continue to work as expected.</p>

<p>I plan on adhering to this rough plan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Compile integers</li>
  <li>Compile other immediate constants (booleans, ASCII characters, the empty
list)</li>
  <li>Compile unary primitives (<code>add1</code>, <code>sub1</code>, <code>integer-&gt;char</code>, <code>char-&gt;integer</code>,
<code>null?</code>, <code>zero?</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>Compile binary primitives (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>=</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>Compile local variables (<code>let</code>-expressions)</li>
  <li>Compile conditional expressions (<code>if</code>-expressions)</li>
  <li>Compile heap allocation (<code>cons</code>, strings, symbols, etc)</li>
  <li>Compile <code>label</code> procedure calls</li>
  <li>Compile closures</li>
  <li>Add tail-call optimization</li>
  <li>Compile complex constants (<code>quote</code>)</li>
  <li>Compile variable assignment (<code>set!</code>)</li>
  <li>Add macro expander</li>
  <li>Add extended forms using macro expander (<code>let*</code>, <code>letrec</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>Add support for libraries and separate compilation</li>
  <li>Compile foreign function calls</li>
  <li>Add error checking to primitives and procedure calls</li>
  <li>Compile variable-arity procedures (aka varargs)</li>
  <li>Compile <code>apply</code></li>
  <li>Add output ports (kind of like <code>FILE*</code>)</li>
  <li>Add <code>write</code>, <code>display</code></li>
  <li>Add input ports</li>
  <li>Add a tokenizer in Lisp</li>
  <li>Add a reader in Lisp</li>
  <li>Add a Lisp interpreter (or compiler) in Lisp</li>
</ol>

<p>With optional add-ons also described in the initial paper:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Big numbers, IEEE754 floats, complex numbers</li>
  <li>User-defined macros</li>
  <li>A module system</li>
  <li>Heap overflow handler and garbage collector</li>
  <li>Stack overflow handler</li>
  <li>Improved code generation</li>
</ul>

<p>And optional add-ons not described in the original paper:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An intermediate representation for optimization</li>
  <li>Generate executables and write them to disk</li>
  <li>An interpreter with optional just-in-time compiler</li>
</ul>

<p>You may have noticed that this is a <em>lot</em> of steps, and there are some steps
that I intend to take but have completely omitted because I want to roll them
into other posts. Things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code generation infrastructure (a writable buffer, <code>mmap</code>/<code>mprotect</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>Compiler data structures (variable environments, label environments, etc)</li>
  <li>Testing infrastructure (unit testing, integration testing)</li>
</ul>

<p>So it’s really actually more work than I listed above. This series may take a
long time. It may take some twisty turns. It may take some shortcuts. But there
is good news: I’ve already written the compiler up to compiling heap allocation
(still working on procedure calls), and even if I don’t finish this series
there is still Ghuloum’s excellent paper to learn from.</p>

<p>Next up, <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-1/">the smallest program</a>.</p>

<p>Why are we interested in the announcement by Fastly (NYSE: <a href="#fastlystock">FSLY</a>), a content delivery network (CDN) provider, to acquire Signal Sciences, a web application firewall (WAF) cybersecurity firm, for a whopping $775M (<a href="#revenue-valuation">27x revenue</a>!)?</p>

<p>We encourage you to read the author’s entire post titled, “<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4370434-fastly-great-story-terrible-price" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fastly: Great Story At A Terrible Price</a>.” He published his research just a couple of days before Fastly’s announcement of its intent to acquire Signal Sciences, so the stock charts, analysis, and commentary are timely and relevant.</p>



<h3><span id="Business_Model"></span>Business Model<span></span></h3>



<p>Like so many high-flying growth companies, Fastly leverages the “buy revenues” business model, which reflects market participants’ <sup data-mfn="2">2</sup><span data-mfn="2"> (a nontrivial number of entrepreneurs, management/boards, and investors)</span> psychology that is dubbed <a aria-label="FOMO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-we-seeing-a-fomo-rally-2020-04-06" target="_blank">FOMO</a> (“Fear of Missing Out”) and is under-girded by the Fed’s <a aria-label="POMO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/permanent-open-market-operations.asp" target="_blank">POMO</a> (“Fed’s Permanent Open Market Operations”). </p>



<p>We understand this is our environment, so “when in Rome….” Or, in other words, “<a aria-label="don't fight the FED (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-meaning-of-dont-fight-the-fed-2466886" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t fight the FED</a>.”</p>



<h4><span id="Buying_Revenues"></span>Buying Revenues<span></span></h4>



<p>For example, It spent 33% of revenue on sales &amp; marketing in the quarter ending June 2020 (<a aria-label="page 11 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://investors.fastly.com/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/2Q20-Shareholder-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">page 11</a> of its 2Q 2020 shareholder letter). That’s called buying revenues, Dear Friends.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Sales and marketing expenses were $25 million in Q2 2020, representing <strong>33% of revenue</strong>, up from $17 million, or 37% of revenue in Q2 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in headcount and personnel related costs to drive future enterprise customer acquisition growth, as well as to encourage further use of our platform by existing customers.</p><cite>Fastly’s 2Q 2020 shareholder letter</cite></blockquote></figure>







<p>Nevertheless, this market environment as described does reward people and businesses that provide <a href="https://coventryleague.com/blogentary/do-you-need-a-contract-cfo-or-investment-banking-kiosk/" target="_blank" aria-label="services related to M&amp;A (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">services related to M&amp;A</a> and <a href="https://coventryleague.com/blogentary/refinance-loans-restructure-debt/" target="_blank" aria-label="strategic finance (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">strategic finance</a>, including Coventry League.</p>

        <p>Web pages are ghosts: they’re like images projected onto a wall. They aren’t durable. If you turn off the projector (i.e. web server), the picture disappears. If you know how to run a projector, and you can keep it running <em>all the time</em>, you can have a web site.</p><p>But as soon as there’s no one to babysit the projector, it eventually gets turned off, and everything you made with it goes away. If the outage is permanent, the disappearance is too. This is happening all the time, as servers fail, or companies are acquired and shut down.<label for="2914955557482844267"></label><span>“When Yahoo! switched off the servers for GeoCities, the Web posting service, on Oct. 27, some 7 million of the Internet’s first websites went dark forever.” <a href="http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1936645,00.html">Time Magazine, 9 Nov 2009</a></span></p><p>I think about this a lot. And I’m not even thinking about the fate of the Entire Internet. Just the small sites I care about, the blogs and small publications. It’s sad to think that when their authors are gone, all their writing will eventually disappear. (And don’t tell me about the Internet Archive—that’s just another backup projector, run by volunteers. We have no assurance that it’ll still be running a year or ten years from now.) Then, too, I also think about my own web sites. Babysitting that projector can be a lot of work sometimes. If it’s all going to go up in smoke as soon as I’m unable to work on it anymore, then publishing on the web seems, really, quite futile.</p><p>The obvious contrast is with hard-copies: things written on paper or printed in books. We can still read books and pamphlets printed five hundred years ago, even though the presses that made them have long since been destroyed.</p><p>How can we give the average independent web writer that kind of permanence?</p><figure><label for="97268267117236911">⊕</label><span>From <a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/post_artifact/">Post-Artifact Books and Publishing</a> by Craig Mod (<span>CC</span> License)</span><img src="https://thelocalyarn.com/excursus/secretary/posts/img/post-artifact-full-large.png"></figure><p>When Craig Mod drew this diagram, he was thinking about this issue the other way around. He was focused on traditional print publishing, and how the web would change that process. We started with print books, he said, and by <em>adding digital publishing</em> we can create this much fuller realm of author-reader interaction. It’s a brilliant and well-considered <a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/post_artifact/">piece</a>. It has this flip-side, though, which we web publishers don’t often talk about: <strong>books can be improved by the web, but the web can also be improved by books.</strong> Digital publishing could use more “Immutable Artifacts”, because <strong>artifacts are durable</strong>.</p><p>Of course there’s a reason why, in all our discussion about CMSs, about design, markup, semantics, and programming, we almost never include books. The <em>tools</em> we use don’t even consider book publication, much less integrate it. But they could. And that’s what this website, <a href="https://thelocalyarn.com/excursus/secretary/index.html"><em>Secretary of Foreign Relations</em></a>, is really about.</p><p><span>This site</span> is basically a rough, first-effort experiment in creating a mini-publication that realizes both sides of Craig’s diagram above. It exists simultaneously as a web site <em>and</em> as a printed, bound book—a book that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/152396216X">you can order right now</a> and have delivered to your door.<label for="-906686242337141937"></label><span>This being a basic proof-of-concept, the book’s cover is extremely generic, and the price is set as low as Amazon KDP will allow me to go ($5.38 in this case). At this point, only the content in the <em>Flatland</em> portion of the site is included in the print edition.</span></p><p>What do I mean by “exists simultaneously”? I mean that the production of the printed book is, for the most part, not some separate workflow from the production of the web site. I’m not copying text from the web site and pasting it into InDesign, for example. When I enter the command to generate the HTML files that make up this site, the complete PDF file for the book is generated at the same time, from the same source and by the same software.<label for="-2475282464837853604"></label><span>See more details on the <a href="https://thelocalyarn.com/excursus/secretary/colophon.html">Colophon</a> page and on <a href="https://github.com/otherjoel/try-pollen">the project’s Github repository</a>.</span> I can upload this PDF file to Amazon KDP, who will print a copy for anyone who cares to order it.</p><p>Why a book? Of course anyone can load a web page in their browser and send it to their inkjet printer. But, seriously: no one does that, even for websites they feel quite attached to. Even if they did, and even if the printout looked really nice (very much not the norm for web pages), who wants to save a sheaf of loose papers? A book is the best kind of printed artifact, and with print-on-demand services you can have them made with reasonable quality at a very low cost.</p><p><span>So here’s</span> how this will play out. After I reimplement my other web sites using this system, I’ll be making book editions of those sites available for free to anyone who cares to request a copy<label for="-2781867892142790827"></label><span>This was what I had in mind originally with my <a href="https://thelocalyarn.com/article/the-annual-yarn-2011"><em>Annual Yarn</em> project</a>, which I hope to resume.</span>. This is a win for both sides. The reader gets a permanent, well-designed copy of something they have enjoyed. And <em>I</em> get the satisfaction of knowing those books are out there, being held in various places by people who (at least somewhat) care about them. The point is not to make money selling books, but to sow the writing as far as it can go—even knowing it has very narrow appeal and no market value. It’s a way to write purely for the joy of it, and still know that the work will easily outlive me. My writing will not depend for its continuance on someone maintaining backups and complicated hosting arrangements.</p><p>So much for my own stuff. But my larger, longer-shot hope is that others will start thinking about doing this too: <em>building</em> and <em>making use of</em> tools that integrate print publishing with web publishing. This goes back to the concern I talked about earlier. I don’t want the writing on small, independent sites to disappear. Not only do I want it not to disappear, there’s a good deal of it that I would like to have on my bookshelf. Some of those authors and those sites are gone already.<label for="-3393301825901819575"></label><span>“I don’t know Mark Pilgrim personally. I only know his work and it’s excellent.

The services and technology we need are already sitting there, ready to print those books for us. Supposing we were able to adopt this kind of approach, it’s easy to suppose we could develop a culture of sharing our books with each other. Our writing would be durable again. That would be a lovely thing.</p><p><label for="558553613229387845">⊕</label><span><em>Sonnet</em> by John Keats</span></p><div><pre>When I have fears that I may cease to be<br>  Before my pen has glean’d my teeming brain,<br>Before high-piléd books, in charact’ry,<br>  Hold like rich garners the full ripen’d grain…</pre></div>

    <p>I watched the talk
“<a href="https://vimeo.com/230142234">Platform as a Reflection of Values: Joyent, Node.js and beyond</a>”
by Bryan Cantrill, and I think he was able to put into words something I already
felt for some time: if there’s no piece of software out there that reflects your
values, it’s time for you to build that software<sup id="fnref:talk-time" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:talk-time">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I kind of agree with what he said, because this is already happening to me. I
long for a database with a certain set of values, and for a few years I was just
waiting for someone to finally write it. After watching his talk, Bryan is
saying to me: “time to stop waiting, and start writing it yourself”.</p>

<p>So let me try to give an overview of such database, and go over its values.</p>



<p>I want a database that allows me to create decentralized client-side
applications that can sync data.</p>

<p>The best one-line description I can give right now is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s sort of like PouchDB, Git, Datomic, SQLite and Mentat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A more descriptive version could be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An embedded, immutable, syncable relational database.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s go over what I mean by each of those aspects one by one.</p>



<p>I think the server-side database landscape is diverse and mature enough for
my needs (even though I end up choosing SQLite most of the time), and what I’m
after is a database to be embedded on client-side applications itself, be it
desktop, browser, mobile, etc.</p>

<p>The purpose of such database is not to keep some local cache of data in case of
lost connectivity: we have good solutions for that already. It should serve as
the source of truth, and allow the application to work on top of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html"><strong>SQLite</strong></a> is a great example of that: it is a very powerful
relational database that runs <a href="https://sqlite.org/whentouse.html">almost anywhere</a>. What I miss
from it that SQLite doesn’t provide is the ability to run it on the browser:
even though you could compile it to WebAssembly, <del>it assumes a POSIX filesystem
that would have to be emulated</del><sup id="fnref:posix-sqlite" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:posix-sqlite">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><a href="https://pouchdb.com/"><strong>PouchDB</strong></a> is another great example: it’s a full reimplementation of
<a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> that targets JavaScript environments, mainly the browser and
Node.js. However I want a tool that can be deployed anywhere, and not limit its
applications to places that already have a JavaScript runtime environment, or
force the developer to bundle a JavaScript runtime environment with their
application. This is true for GTK+ applications, command line programs, Android
apps, etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mentat"><strong>Mentat</strong></a> was an interesting project, but its reliance on SQLite
makes it inherit most of the downsides (and benefits too) of SQLite itself.</p>

<p>Having such a requirement imposes a different approach to storage: we have to
decouple the knowledge about the intricacies of storage from the usage of
storage itself, so that a module (say query processing) can access storage
through an API without needing to know about its implementation. This allows
the database to target a POSIX filesystems storage API and an IndexedDB storage
API, and make the rest of the code agnostic about storage. PouchDB has such
mechanism (called <a href="https://pouchdb.com/adapters.html">adapters</a>) and Datomic has them too (called
<a href="https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/storage.html">storage services</a>).</p>

<p>This would allow the database to adapt to where it is embedded: when targeting
the browser the IndexedDB storage API would provide the persistence layer
that the database requires, and similarly the POSIX filesystem storage API would
provide the persistence layer when targeting POSIX systems (like desktops,
mobile, etc.).</p>

<p>But there’s also an extra restriction that comes from by being embedded: it
needs to provide and embeddable artifact, most likely a binary library object
that exposes a C compatible FFI, similar to
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html">how SQLite does</a>. Bundling a full runtime environment is
possible, but doesn’t make it a compelling solution for embedding. This rules
out most languages, and leaves us with C, Rust, Zig, and similar options that
can target POSIX systems and WebAssembly.</p>



<p>Being immutable means that only new information is added, no in-place update
ever happens, and nothing is ever deleted.</p>

<p>Having an immutable database presents us with similar trade-offs found in
persistent data structures, like lack of coordination when doing reads, caches
being always coherent, and more usage of space.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.datomic.com/"><strong>Datomic</strong></a> is the go to database example of this: it will only add
information (datoms) and allows you to query them in a multitude of ways. Stuart
Halloway calls it “accumulate-only” over “append-only”<sup id="fnref:accumulate-only" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:accumulate-only">3</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s accumulate-only, it is not append-only. So append-only, most people when
they say that they’re implying something physical about what happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also a database can be append-only and overwrite existing information with new
information, by doing clean-ups of “stale” data. I prefer to adopt the
“accumulate-only” naming and approach.</p>

<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/"><strong>Git</strong></a> is another example of this: new commits are always added on top
of the previous data, and it grows by adding commits instead of replacing
existing ones.</p>

<p>Git repositories can only grow in size, and that is not only an acceptable
condition, but also one of the reasons to use it.</p>

<p>All this means that no in-place updates happens on data, and the database will
be much more concerned about how compact and efficiently it stores data than how
fast it does writes to disk. Being embedded, the storage limitation is either a)
how much storage the device has or b) how much storage was designed for the
application to consume. So even though the database could theoretically operate
with hundreds of TBs, a browser page or mobile application wouldn’t have access
to this amount of storage. SQLite even <a href="https://sqlite.org/limits.html">says</a> that it does
support approximately 280 TBs of data, but those limits are untested.</p>

<p>The upside of keeping everything is that you can have historical views of your
data, which is very powerful. This also means that applications should turn this
off when not relevant<sup id="fnref:no-history" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:no-history">4</a></sup>.</p>



<p>This is a frequent topic when talking about offline-first solutions. When
building applications that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>can fully work offline,</li>
  <li>stores data,</li>
  <li>propagates that data to other application instances,</li>
</ul>

<p>then you’ll need a conflict resolution strategy to handle all the situations
where different application instances disagree. Those application instances
could be a desktop and a browser version of the same application, or the same
mobile app in different devices.</p>

<p>A three-way merge seems to be the best approach, on top of which you could add
application specific conflict resolution functions, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pick the change with higher timestamp;</li>
  <li>if one change is a delete, pick it;</li>
  <li>present the diff on the screen and allow the user to merge them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some databases try to make this “easy”, by choosing a strategy for you, but I’ve
found that different applications require different conflict resolution
strategies. Instead, the database should leave this up to the user to decide,
and provide tools for them to do it.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(version_control)"><strong>Three-way merges in version control</strong></a> are the best example,
performing automatic merges when possible and asking the user to resolve
conflicts when they appear.</p>

<p>The unit of conflict for a version control system is a line of text. The
database equivalent would probably be a single attribute, not a full entity or a
full row.</p>

<p>Making all the conflict resolution logic be local should allow the database to
have encrypted remotes similar to how <a href="https://spwhitton.name/tech/code/git-remote-gcrypt/">git-remote-gcrypt</a>
adds this functionality to Git. This would enable users to sync the application
data across devices using an untrusted intermediary.</p>



<p>I want the power of relational queries on the client applications.</p>

<p>Most of the arguments against traditional table-oriented relational databases
are related to write performance, but those don’t apply here. The bottlenecks
for client applications usually aren’t write throughput. Nobody is interested in
differentiating between 1 MB/s or 10 MB/s when you’re limited to 500 MB total.</p>

<p>The relational model of the database could either be based on SQL and tables
like in SQLite, or maybe <a href="https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/query.html">datalog</a> and <a href="https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/whatis/data-model.html#datoms">datoms</a> like in
Datomic.</p>



<p>Now let’s try to translate the aspects above into values, as suggested by Bryan
Cantrill.</p>



<p>Being able to target so many different platforms is a bold goal, and the
embedded nature of the database demands portability to be a core value.</p>



<p>When the local database becomes the source of truth of the application, it must
provide consistency guarantees that enables applications to rely on it.</p>



<p>The database should empower applications to slice and dice the data in any way
it wants to.</p>



<p>Since I can’t find any database that fits these requirements, I’ve finally come
to terms with doing it myself.</p>

<p>It’s probably going to take me a few years to do it, and making it portable
between POSIX and IndexedDB will probably be the biggest challenge. I got myself
a few books on databases to start.</p>

<p>I wonder if I’ll ever be able to get this done.</p>
