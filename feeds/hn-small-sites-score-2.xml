<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>My backup tool <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/bupstash">bupstash</a> stores backups in a repository as an evergrowing set of
encrypted data trees which use content addressing and structural sharing
to deduplicate data. In order to delete unused backups we need to do something very similar to how
many programming languages free unreferenced memory - garbage collection. This post will
explain the evolution and implementation of the garbage collector in bupstash for the curious.</p>
<h2 id="stop-mark-and-sweep">Stop, mark and sweep.</h2>
<p>The initial version of the bupstash garbage collector was a naive stop-the-world
garbage collector. It walks all backup data trees creating a set of reachable data chunks
by address and then deletes unreachable data.</p>
<p>The algorithm can be described as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop the world.</li>
<li>Mark.</li>
<li>Sweep.</li>
<li>Restart the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the pseudo code:</p>
<pre><code>lock_repository()
reachable_addresses = empty_set()

for data_tree in all_backups():
  
  work_list = new_work_list_from_backup(data_tree.root_address)
  
  until work_list.is_empty():
    
    node_height, node_address = work_list.pop()
    reachable_addresses.add(node_address)
    
    if node_height != 0:
      add_child_nodes_to_worklist(work_list, node_address)

for chunk_address in repository:
  if not reachable_addresses.has(chunk_address):
    delete_chunk(chunk_address)

unlock_repository()
</code></pre><p>This algorithm is short and sweet, but if the repository is very large our repository becomes unavailable
for a potentially long time. The next version shortens the downtime of the repository significantly.</p>
<h2 id="mark-stop-mark-and-sweep">Mark, stop, mark and sweep.</h2>
<p>The bupstash v0.6.4 garbage collector takes advantage of two facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because many backups share data with each other, we can memoize the walk phase to skip work.</li>
<li>Because backups are immutable while the repository is unlocked, we can walk most of them without
stopping the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>This time we walk the repository without the repository locked, then lock it and walk
the repository again using our memoization to quickly complete the job. If any new backups
appeared during our first walk, we are guaranteed to mark them now that the repository lock is held. Doing the majority of the slow mark phase without locking the repository greatly increases
the repository availability for other operations.</p>
<p>The algorithm can be described as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memoized mark repository.</li>
<li>Stop the world.</li>
<li>Memoized mark repository.</li>
<li>Sweep.</li>
<li>Restart the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the pseudo code:</p>
<pre><code>walked_trees = empty_set()
reachable_addresses = empty_set()

func walk_repository():

  for data_tree in all_backups():

    if walked_trees.has(data_tree):
      continue

    walked_trees.add(data_tree)
    
    work_list = new_work_list_from_backup(data_tree.root_address)
    
    until work_list.is_empty():
      
      node_height, node_address = work_list.pop()
      already_walked = reachable_addresses.has(node_address)
      reachable_addresses.add(node_address)
      
      if node_height != 0 and not already_walked:
        add_child_nodes_to_worklist(work_list, node_address)

walk_repository()
lock_repository()
walk_repository()

for chunk_address in repository:
  if not reachable_addresses.has(chunk_address):
    delete_chunk(chunk_address)

unlock_repository()
</code></pre><h2 id="mark-stop-mark-bloom-adjust-and-sweep">Mark, stop, mark, bloom adjust, and sweep</h2>
<p>The next version of the garbage collector is a WIP unreleased version.</p>
<p>In bupstash each data chunk address is 32 bytes, which means we need at least 32 bytes of RAM per chunk in the repository to successfully perform a garbage collection. For a repository containing a 100 million chunks or
more this could easily exhaust memory on a busy or small system.</p>
<p>If we are willing to accept a very low probability of retaining some extra data, we can reduce this down
to a few <em>bits</em> per chunk reducing memory usage by 64x or more.
To do this we use a probabilistic data structure called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">bloom filter</a> to track reachable addresses.</p>
<p>Bloom filters have two downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can have false positives. For us this means we might keep a data chunk by accident we could have actually freed.</li>
<li>We must presize them. They cannot grow if we got the size wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily for us these downsides are not bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because memory use is so low per address, we can generously size our bloom filter reducing false positives to less than one percent, even for large repositories.</li>
<li>We can easily detect when a bloom filter gets overly full and produces many false positives, and thus adjust it’s size for future garbage collections.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus, the bupstash implementation of a bloom filter is actually simpler than a hash table, with the implemenation
weighing in at around 30 lines of code plus tests and helpers.</p>
<p>The algorithm can be described as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memoized mark repository.</li>
<li>Stop the world.</li>
<li>Memoized mark the repository.</li>
<li>Adjust bloom filter size.</li>
<li>Sweep.</li>
<li>Restart the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the pseudo code:</p>
<pre><code>walked_trees = empty_set()
walked_addresses = empty_cache()
reachable_addresses = empty_bloom_filter(repository_bloom_size())

func walk_repository():

  for data_tree in all_backups():

    if walked_trees.has(data_tree):
      continue

    walked_trees.add(data_tree)
    work_list = new_work_list_from_backup(data_tree.root_address)
    
    until work_list.is_empty():
      
      node_height, node_address = work_list.pop()
      already_walked = walked_addresses.has(node_address)
      reachable_addresses.add(node_address)
      walked_addresses.add(node_address)
      
      if node_height != 0 and not already_walked:
        add_child_nodes_to_worklist(work_list, node_address)

walk_repository()
lock_repository()
walk_repository()

if bloom_filter_overutilized(reachable_addresses):
  increase_bloom_filter_size_for_next_gc()
else if bloom_filter_underutilized(reachable_addresses):
  decrease_bloom_filter_size_for_next_gc()

for chunk_address in repository:
  if not reachable_addresses.has(chunk_address):
    delete_chunk(chunk_address)

unlock_repository()
</code></pre><p>One thing to note about this implementation is that because the bloom filter has false positives we can not use it to skip processing addresses, instead
we must introduce a new cache for this purpose. A cache also lets us put a fixed upper bound on memory usage for large repositories.</p>
<p>Overall for large repositories, the addition of a bloom filter reduces ram requirements from the gigabyte range down to tens of megabytes while increasing the repository size by only a fraction of a percent.</p>

<p>The bupstash garbage collector tries hard to keep the repository avaliable as long
as possible while also providing excellent performance with a small memory profile. If you are implementing
a content addressed storage system, this post will hopefully provide you with some new ideas.</p>
<p>In the future bupstash could follow the same path as programming language garbage collectors to find more improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parallelism in the mark phase.</li>
<li>Parallelism in the sweep phase.</li>
<li>Incremental collection.</li>
<li>Object generations.</li>
<li>Write barriers</li>
<li>Yet to be invented techniques…</li>
</ul>

<div>
<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>5</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>It’s a story that’s becoming more and more common.</p>
<p>You’re smack dab in the middle of harvest and an error code appears on your combine’s monitor. A call to the dealership results in a long wait for a technician to come out, with anxiety rising with every passing hour because priceless harvesting time is being lost or, worse, nasty weather is moving in.</p>
<p>Then when the technician gets to your farm, he determines what is needed is to reset (or ‘flash’) the onboard computer.</p>
<p>That happened to Cole Siegle last fall when he was harvesting canola, leaving the Fairview-area producer to wonder why he can’t have access to the same diagnostic tools.</p>
<div id="attachment_133445"><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120509/repair-rights1-siegle-supplied-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120509/repair-rights1-siegle-supplied-150x150.jpg 150w, https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120509/repair-rights1-siegle-supplied.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px"></p><p>Cole Siegle.<br><small><i>photo:</i><span> Supplied </span></small></p></div>
<p>“If I could have done that myself or been able to use a mechanic or a technician who’s closer to me, our downtime could have gone from six hours to two hours,” he said. “That four hours could have been the difference between getting&nbsp;a crop off before the snow or not.”</p>
<p>But these days it’s dealerships — via sales and service agreements with manufacturers — that have legal access to these diagnostic tools. So when an error message pops up, farmers and independent mechanics are out in the cold, sometimes literally.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Read more: <a href="https://www.albertafarmexpress.ca/news/remote-diagnostics-blocked-by-poor-internet-on-farms/">Remote diagnostics blocked by poor internet on farms</a></strong></li>

</ul>
<p>“As a producer I think we need access to these diagnostic tools,” said Siegle. “If (manufacturers) want to continue to build equipment like this that’s fine, but we need access to the laptops with the programs that we can plug into our equipment so we can buy whatever part we need.”</p>
<p>Equipment manufacturers make a lot of repair information public, including what codes mean, but giving access to proprietary tools raises several issues, said John Schmeiser, CEO of the Western Equipment Dealers Association.</p>
<p>The hardware and software Siegle and other farmers wish to acquire for repair purposes can also be used to modify equipment to the detriment of machinery, warranties, the lawfulness of their operations and even their own safety, he said.</p>
<p>“I applaud the manufacturers that put a lot of stuff online&nbsp;like parts, service manuals and operational guides. But it’s a slippery slope,” said Schmeiser.</p>
<p>“When you provide special tools to somebody outside a controlled environment like the manufacturer/dealer&nbsp;relationship, that opens the door for illegal modification. They lose that control when they provide&nbsp;diagnostic or special tools to a third-party retailer with whom they don’t have the same sales and services agreement.”</p>
<h2>Repair versus modify</h2>
<p>‘Right to repair’ is a term being thrown around a lot in ag circles today, but it means different things to different people.</p>
<p>For Siegle and other like-minded producers, it means the right to either repair equipment themselves or hire an unaffiliated local mechanic — just as farmers have done throughout the history of mechanized agriculture.</p>
<div id="attachment_133446"><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120516/SchmeiserJohn-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120516/SchmeiserJohn-150x150.jpg 150w, https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120516/SchmeiserJohn.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px"></p><p>John Schmeiser.<br><small><i>photo:</i><span> Supplied </span></small></p></div>
<p>But Schmeiser argues that farmers’ right to repair is already entrenched in law in many jurisdictions (including Alberta) as long as the owner is using the equipment for its intended purpose and doesn’t violate manufacturer standards.</p>
<p>The right to repair (R2R) movement (which started in the tech sphere but expanded to other areas, such as ag equipment) is actually a front for promoting the ‘right to modify,’ he said.</p>
<p>Often that means making modifications to bypass environmental controls in order to boost vehicle horsepower.</p>

<p>“There are over 25 states that had R2R bills introduced — every one impacting farm equipment has been defeated,” said Schmeiser. “They haven’t passed&nbsp;because as the state representatives were hearing the rationale coming from R2R advocates, they were finding out that what they were really looking for is to modify the equipment in a manner where&nbsp;it can get around emission standards and violate U.S. Environmental Protection Agency laws and regulations.”</p>
<h2>DEF delete and chipping</h2>
<p>There are two specific actions that concern Schmeiser’s association (a Missouri-based advocacy group for equipment dealerships with a Canadian headquarters in Calgary).</p>
<p>One is circumventing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (or DEF) emissions systems using grey-market ‘DEF delete’ kits to boost horsepower on tractors and combines. Another is ‘chipping’ or ‘tuning,’ which usually refers to adding a specific chip to increase horsepower.</p>
<p>Bypassing emissions control systems contravenes the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, leaving producers open to fines, said Schmeiser, adding he was unsure of the Canadian penalties but breaches of similar U.S. laws have produced fines in excess of $300,000.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that not everyone knows this practice is illegal. Another is it comes with a host of potential risks including damaged equipment, voided warranties, reduced trade-in value, insurance cancellation and even safety, he said.</p>
<p>“We have seen an unusual number of combine fires this (past) year,” said Schmeiser.</p>
<p>“Now, we have had some dry conditions but in some of those cases the combines were running hotter (due to alterations).</p>

<p>“The insurance company will look at it from the standpoint that you have altered your combine away from the manufacturer’s original standards and you are going to be denied insurance coverage in a situation like that.”</p>
<p>But Siegle isn’t convinced.</p>
<p>He said he has no interest in making such modifications to his equipment and suggested it’s a straw man argument from manufacturing and dealership interests seeking exclusive control over the diagnostic tools.</p>
<p>The kind of modification Siegle is concerned about losing is the legal ability to place, for example, a third-party manufacturer’s custom header on a John Deere combine. Specifically, he worries about big manufacturers denying third-party companies the codes required for an implement to interact with a tractor or combine.</p>
<p>Schmeiser said this isn’t considered modification but rather interoperability or connectivity: A third party designing an implement to attach to another manufacturer’s product. This is a long-standing tradition in the manufacturing and dealership industries that few if anyone has any interest in ceasing, he said (see accompanying story).</p>
<h2>The business aspect</h2>
<p>All of this still does not answer Siegle’s fundamental question: Why can’t I — or mechanics unaffiliated with specific manufacturers — have all the tools required to diagnose and fix a mechanical problem?</p>
<p>In the past it was relatively easy for mechanically minded producers and unaffiliated mechanics to repair machinery because it ran on tried-and-traditional engineering principles. This is still by and large the case, said Schmeiser, adding 95 per cent of equipment issues can still be fixed mechanically.</p>
<p>He said he understands the frustration farmers feel by not having diagnostic tools at their fingertips. But at the same time dealerships have rights as well, especially when one considers the considerable training and expense needed to obtain service contracts with manufacturers.</p>
<p>“What the farmer is speaking to is the frustration of being down. He wants to get up and running as quickly as possible. We get that,” said Schmeiser.</p>
<p>“But the moment the manufacturers start providing special tools or diagnostics&nbsp;equipment to businesses that are outside of their dealer contracts, doesn’t that diminish the value of the contract in the dealer’s eyes as well?… So what’s the incentive for the manufacturer&nbsp;to provide special tools or even service manuals to a third party that would be competing with somebody they have a contractual relationship with&nbsp;(and) who is also making a substantial financial investment to be the representative for the manufacturer?”</p> </div>

February 26, 2021 | https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Why, in 2021, does anyone need to learn about assembly language?
First, reading assembly language is the way to know <em>exactly</em> what
your program is doing. Why, <em>exactly</em>, is that C++ program 1 MiB (say)
instead of 100 KiB? Is it possible to squeeze some more performance
out of that function that gets called all the time?</p><p>For C++ in particular, it is easy to forget or just not notice some
operation (e.g., an implicit conversion or a call to a copy
constructor or destructor) that is implied by the source code and
language semantics, but not spelled out explicitly. Looking at the
assembly generated by the compiler puts everything in plain sight.</p><p>Second, the more practical reason: so far, posts on this blog haven’t
required an understanding of assembly language, despite constant
links to <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>. By <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottWolchok/status/1361022423399755776">popular
demand</a>,
however, our next topic will be parameter passing, and for that, we
will need a basic understanding of assembly language. We will focus
only on <em>reading</em> assembly language, not writing it.</p><p>The basic unit of assembly language is the <strong>instruction</strong>. Each
machine instruction is a small operation, like adding two numbers,
loading some data from memory, jumping to another memory location
(like the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto">goto</a>
statement), or calling or returning from a function. (The x86
architecture has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">lots of not-so-small
instructions</a>
as well. Some of these are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5959890/enter-vs-push-ebp-mov-ebp-esp-sub-esp-imm-and-leave-vs-mov-esp-ebp">legacy
cruft</a>
built up over the 40-odd years of the architecture’s existence, and
others are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">newfangled
additions</a>. )</p><p>Our first toy example will get us acquainted with simple
instructions. It just calculates the square of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm">norm</a>
of a 2D vector:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Vec2</span> {
    <span>int64_t</span> x;
    <span>int64_t</span> y;
    <span>int64_t</span> z;
};

<span>int64_t</span> <span>normSquared</span>(Vec2 v) {
    <span>return</span> v.x <span>*</span> v.x <span>+</span> v.y <span>*</span> v.y;
}
</code></pre></div><p>and here is the resulting x86_64 assembly from clang 11, <a href="https://godbolt.org/#z:OYLghAFBqd5QCxAYwPYBMCmBRdBLAF1QCcAaPECAM1QDsCBlZAQwBtMQBGAFlICsupVs1qhkAUgBMAISnTSAZ0ztkBPHUqZa6AMKpWAVwC2tEAGYADKS3oAMnlqYAcsYBGmYiADspAA6oFQnVaPUMTcyt/QLU6e0cXI3dPHyUVGNoGAmZiAlDjU0tFZUxVYMzsgjjnNw9vRSycvPDChQbKh2rE2q8ASkVUA2JkDgByKTMHZEMsAGpxMx1kVvx6eexxCwBBDc3W4gNVGYA1Esk5r1ktmeuZhwIANm4AfQIZgA95y82b2/pHl5mAE9PuIvAAREFbHZ3f6vWgkIwMACOBmymHQEBOyDOADceucvj9iJgCINaDMcQA6N4zABUFOpcxkDMBdJZkO24JGfVYIBGAFYRqRTCMLELUHydHI5DMFAMhpgmWZOEKCHyxT0%2BgBrcxmSlmA2Go1G%2B5CPncIUisWkCUjIUKEBWNWi7mkOCwJBoIy%2BPDsMgUCBen1%2BlDCUScTgWTikKi%2BggeB0QVzqoWuBzZQF8lWkL1GLQEADytFYmZdpCwRhEwHYKfLeGJpRxmAdZcwbxKBnjWaFd2U3aEeFcxAzeiw/YIxDwRm7fRo9CYbA4PH4gjDYmlMgHrgdkD6qF86RbAFoC2YZkflvMwRIZHJJNbUiV0pptE1TNGbFUEklBFEgnQ31/AJ/1oL8ak8aNH1KOhykafR8kEKD0lg9p4nAxC2kAyC2jAroIL6OVBmGLgeT5QVhVrW03gADnuI9HhmKYqxmCNKQsSlOBmCBcEIEglWjGY9G9X0PH4/EpVvGRVRTTVSB1A19WNJSDVNXkRgtCiy1te1HVIZ0NTdGBEBQVBhL9chKCDETPCY8NI2jWNWHjYhE2TMs01oDN%2B1zfMixLWsKyrGsy3wBs1CbFtrTbDsuxGbNezU61WEHYdiEBUdRmtCcpxnGM6EYFga2XARJCEKsUA3eRku3eA9wPYJj1Pc9LzMa9Kvve1img0wIBsLDrG0XCf2jP90n60bgiG2pIK65DMPg8IZrSMocI6b9pvqCp%2BtaCopvw/oiKXUiBUtSi%2BRouiGNs4AWM4NiOK4niiGIfjSEE0zg1E8ZJHEyrpJdWT5L1ZTlLNdTTq0vkdKdGTjskCHrW0vTYdIJsXOCEBuCAA%3D%3D">via Compiler Explorer</a>:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>imulq</span>   %rdi, %rdi

</code></pre></div><p>Let’s talk about that first instruction: <code>imulq %rdi, %rdi</code>. This
instruction <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/imul">performs signed integer
multiplication</a>. The <code>q</code>
suffix tells us that it is operating on 64-bit quantities. (In
contrast, <code>l</code>, <code>w</code>, and <code>b</code> would denote 32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit,
respectively.) It multiplies the value in the first given register
(<code>rdi</code>; register names are prefixed with a <code>%</code> sign) by the value in
the second register and stores the result in that second
register. This is squaring <code>v.x</code> in our example C++ code.</p><p>The second instruction does the same with the value in <code>%rsi</code>, which
squares <code>v.y</code>.</p><p>Next, we have an odd instruction: <code>leaq (%rsi,%rdi), %rax</code>. <code>lea</code>
stands for “load effective address”, and it stores the address of the
first operand into the second operand. <code>(%rsi, %rdi)</code> means “the
memory location pointed to by <code>%rsi + %rdi</code>”, so this is just adding
<code>%rsi</code> and <code>%rdi</code> and storing the result in <code>%rax</code>. <code>lea</code> is a quirky
x86-specific instruction; on a more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC</a>-y
architecture like ARM64, we would expect to see a plain old <code>add</code>
instruction.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>Finally, <code>retq</code> returns from the <code>normSquared</code> function.</p><p>Let’s take a brief detour to explain what the registers we saw in our
example are. Registers are the “variables” of assembly
langauge. Unlike your favorite programming language (probably), there
are a finite number of them, they have standardized names, and the
ones we’ll be talking about are at most 64 bits in size. Some of them
have specific uses that we’ll see later. I wouldn’t be able to rattle
this off from memory, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Architectural_features">per
Wikipedia</a>,
the full list<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> of 16 registers on x86_64 is <code>rax</code>, <code>rcx</code>, <code>rdx</code>, <code>rbx</code>,
<code>rsp</code>, <code>rbp</code>, <code>rsi</code>, <code>rdi</code>, <code>r8</code>, <code>r9</code>, <code>r10</code>, <code>r11</code>, <code>r12</code>, <code>r13</code>,
<code>r14</code>, and <code>r15</code>.</p><p>Now, let’s extend our example to debug print the <code>Vec2</code> in <code>normSquared</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>

</code></pre></div><p>In addition to the obvious call to <code>Vec2::debugPrint() const</code>, we have
some other new instructions and registers! <code>%rsp</code> is special: it is
the “stack pointer”, used to maintain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">function call
stack</a>. It points to the
bottom of the stack, which grows “down” (toward lower addresses) on
x86. So, our <code>subq $24, %rsp</code> instruction is making space for three
64-bit integers on the stack. (In general, setting up the stack and
registers at the start of your function is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue">function
prologue</a>.) Then, the
following two <code>mov</code> instructions store the first and second arguments
to <code>normSquared</code>, which are <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> (more about how parameter
passing words in the next blog post!) to the stack, effectively
creating a copy of <code>v</code> in memory at the address <code>%rsp + 8</code>. Next, we
load the address of our copy of <code>v</code> into <code>%rdi</code> with <code>leaq 8(%rsp), %rdi</code> and then call <code>Vec2::debugPrint() const</code>.</p><p>After <code>debugPrint</code> has returned, we load <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> back into
<code>%rcx</code> and <code>%rax</code>. We have the same <code>imulq</code> and <code>addq</code> instructions as
before. Finally, we <code>addq $24, %rsp</code> to clean up the 24
bytes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> of stack space we allocated at the start of
our function (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue#Epilogue">function
epilogue</a>),
and then return to our caller with <code>retq</code>.</p><p>Now, let’s look at a different example. Suppose that we want to print
an uppercased C string and we’d like to avoid heap allocations for
smallish strings.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> We might write something like

control flow instructions as well. Let’s take a closer look at the
prologue:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>pushq</span>   %rbp
        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %rbp

        <span>pushq</span>   %rax
        <span>movq</span>    %rdi, %r14
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>pushq %rbp; movq %rsp, %rbp</code> sequence is very common: it pushes
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#FRAME-POINTER">frame
pointer</a>
stored in <code>%rbp</code> to the stack and saves the old stack pointer
(which is the new frame pointer) in <code>%rbp</code>. The following four
<code>pushq</code> instructions store registers that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI">we need to save before
using</a>.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
Finally, we save our first argument (<code>%rdi</code>) in <code>%r14</code>.</p><p>On to the function body. We call <code>strlen(s)</code> with <code>callq strlen</code> and
store <code>sSize + 1</code> in <code>%rdi</code> with <code>lea 1(%rax), %rdi</code>.</p><p>Next, we finally see our first <code>if</code> statement! <code>cmpq $1024, %rax</code> sets
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register">flags register</a>
according to the result of <code>%rax - $1024</code>, and then <code>ja .LBB0_2</code>
(“jump if above”) transfers control to the location labeled <code>.LBB0_2</code>
if the flags indicate that <code>%rax &gt; 1024</code>. In general, higher-level
control-flow primitives like <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements and loops are
implemented in assembly using conditional jump instructions.</p><p>Let’s first look at the path where <code>%rax &lt;= 1024</code> and thus the branch
to <code>.LBB0_2</code> was not taken. We have a blob of instructions to create
<code>char temp[sSize + 1]</code> on the stack:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %r15
        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %rbx

use.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Then, we add 15 to <code>%rdi</code> (which,
remember, contains the size of our array), mask off the lower 4 bits
with <code>andq $-16, %rdi</code>, and subtract the result from <code>%rbx</code>, which we
then put back into <code>%rsp</code>. In short, this rounds the array size up to
the next multiple of 16 bytes and makes space for it on the stack.</p><p>The following block simply calls <code>copyUppercase</code> and <code>puts</code> as written in the code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rdi

using <code>leaq</code>. Then, we <code>popq</code> the registers we saved during the

      <p><span>Greenwashing is when a company pretends to be </span><b>eco-friendly</b><span> despite using toxic ingredients and unsustainable practices to manufacture their product.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When a company engages in </span><i><span>greenwashing</span></i><span>, they effectively influence consumers to believe that they’re working towards saving the environment when they’re not. In fact, companies that go to great lengths to create a </span><b>greenwashed marketing strategy</b><span> are sometimes covering up their lack of </span>environmentally friendly products or processes<span>. They are interested only in improving their sales and making more money, and they do so by projecting a green image and deceiving </span><b>conscious consumers</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It should be noted that some companies greenwash their products accidentally. Misinformation surrounding sustainability is so widespread that companies can get the wrong idea about what's sustainable and what's not. Although there's no excuse for large corporations with hefty research budgets, smaller companies sometimes think they're being eco-friendly when they're not.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Why do companies use this marketing strategy?</b></h2>
<p><span>The short answer is that companies who deliberately use this strategy do so to attract more customers and increase revenue.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Over the past couple of decades, there has been a shift toward holding companies accountable for their carbon footprint and environmental impact. At the same time, consumers have become more conscious of their impact on the environment. Naturally, conscious customers try their best to buy </span><b>environmentally friendly products</b><span> when possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There isn’t currently a lot of regulation around sustainable terms such as: natural, green, eco-friendly, and environmentally friendly. Any company can include green colors and imagery on their products and use terms such as </span><i><span>natural</span></i><span>. Therefore, it’s usually easy for brands to attract well-meaning consumers and improve their sales. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Another reason for companies using this marketing strategy is to stand out from their competitors in the market. They promise the consumers that their product is more efficient, saves more power, or is </span><b>sustainable</b><span>. In response, many people start purchasing from them believing that they are helping the environment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Many companies see this </span><i><span>green agenda</span></i><span> as an opportunity to gain a competitive advantage, especially because “natural products” are usually priced higher.&nbsp;Particularly when shopping on-the-go at the grocery store or mall, consumers don’t have time to research every single product they put into their cart. And with good reason! Unless you only buy from trusted brands, it’s hard to distinguish between the truly sustainable products and the fake ones.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Examples of Greenwashing</b><b><br></b><span><br></span><span>A very common example of greenwashing is when a company rebrands as natural or eco-friendly. If a company changes their name, logo, or slogan to appear greener without actually changing their business to be environmentally friendly, then chances are it's an attempt to greenwash. Food companies, cosmetic companies, and household product manufacturers are often seen involved in greenwashing. &nbsp;</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Another example of greenwashing is when a company labels its products with buzz-words and meaningless statistics.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have you ever seen one or more of the the following descriptions on a product?<br></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>"99% naturally derived"&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><span>"100% recyclable"</span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>"Made with natural ingredients"&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span>"Biodegradable"&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>While these things all sound great to the conscious consumer, these phrases don't mean anything.</p>
<p>Single-use plastic can be 100% recyclable, but it isn't sustainable or eco-friendly. Many chemicals are naturally-derived, yet are still harmful to the environment. Food, cosmetics, textiles, and more can all be made with "natural" ingredients, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're inherently healthy or environmentally friendly. Lastly, most things are biodegradable, but that doesn't mean it's okay to dump them in a landfill.</p>

<h2><b>Impact of Greenwashing</b></h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0266/4346/4271/files/pexels-catherine-sheila-2409025_480x480.jpg?v=1613572719" alt="false green claims"></p>
<p><b></b><span>Greenwashing is unethical.&nbsp;False green claims have&nbsp;a negative impact not only on consumers but also on the environment. Let’s look at some of the problems that arise because of greenwashing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Encourages Uninformed Decisions</b> <b><br></b><b><br></b><span>The most important danger of greenwashing is that it misinforms people, leading them to make wrong decisions and contribute to unintended environmental harm. Customers, without knowing if a company’s eco-friendly claims are genuine or not, act unsustainably, and make an uninformed decision. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><b>Harms the Environment</b></p>
<p><a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/ehp.118-a246"><span>Greenwashing harms the environment and public health</span></a><span>. When consumers are unable to understand the false practices of a company and they decide to buy from a greenwashing company, they contribute to the growth of that company.</span></p>
<p><span>Their support gives such companies more revenue and they continue with their greenwashed marketing and non-environmentally friendly products. Many companies that use greenwashing are often found to be using toxic ingredients in their products or using unsustainable practices such as excess water usage, causing unnecessary air pollution,&nbsp;or producing toxic run-off. To stop this, consumers should look into what they are buying and support the company only if they are genuinely working towards protecting the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Harms Genuine Brands</b><b><br></b><b><br></b><span>Apart from harming the environment, greenwashing also causes trouble for companies that are genuinely working towards saving the environment. This happens because greenwashing breaks consumer trust and consumers start suspecting </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> brands</span><b>, </b><span>even those that are working hard to produce </span><b>environmentally friendly products</b><span>. The reputation of true eco-friendly companies are hindered, making it difficult for them to gain significant market share.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><b>How to Identify Greenwashing&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0266/4346/4271/files/Webp.net-resizeimage_3_480x480.jpg?v=1613572793" alt="greenwashed" width="480x480" height="480x480"></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, it can be hard to know if a company is greenwashing or not.&nbsp;It is important for consumers to be educated and aware about which companies and products are truly green and which are not, but this takes time and a lot of effort.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, there are some things you can look out for that might help you make more informed decisions. Here are a few tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Many companies use specific phrases like natural, sustainable, organic, healthy, vegan, etc. to attract consumers. The use of such words gives the impression that they are eco-friendly and green. However, be skeptical. You should read the information provided by the company on the packaging material, label, and website. The only way to know about the product is to read the label carefully.&nbsp;</span></li>
<ul>
<li>
<span>You should know what common products are inherently not eco-friendly: PVC, triclosan, microbeads, aerosols, phosphates, and chlorine bleach are just a few toxic materials that companies use while still marketing themselves as safe and natural. </span><span></span>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<span>Product imagery that depicts natural scenery is also a tool used by many companies to deceive potential buyers. Consumers should be aware not to be fooled by pictures of fruit, nuts, farms, or any other natural-looking imagery on the labels of the product. Using a particular image does not represent the true sustainability of a company’s products.</span><span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Besides using earth-centered imagery, companies also using earthy tones to promote a natural vibe. They use greens, browns, and blues instead of bright and flashy colors while packaging their products. This is to lure the consumers who are drawn to earth-friendly products. However, consumers should remember that greens and browns don’t necessarily imply that the product is earth-friendly.</span><span><br></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Ways to Verify Sustainable Brands&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><b><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0266/4346/4271/files/MG_1114_copy_480x480.jpg?v=1613568843" alt="what is greenwashing"></b></p>
<p><span>These days, the number of environmentally-conscious buyers is growing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you find it hard to obtain information about a company’s factory or production details, there's a chance&nbsp;that the company is greenwashing or it has something to hide.To verify the sustainability of a brand,&nbsp;you&nbsp;should try to find out more and more about the way a company operates. <p>Here are some things you can look out for:</p></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Don't trust everything that a company shares or says if they don't have evidence to back it up. There is a possibility that the company is sugar-coating their information or spinning the truth.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Try to find out about the company’s supply chain, their production facilities, the employees, working conditions, contractors, etc.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Evaluate the logistics of the product. If a company is claiming they're sustainable, but they're still using single-use plastics...you know something is off.&nbsp;Look for the trademarks of true sustainability such as zero waste practices and/or materials.</span></li>
<li><span>For textiles and household goods, check the material and quality of the product. For food and cosmetic products, check the ingredients and learn more about the production processes of common ingredients. For example, "palm oil" sounds relatively unproblematic, but is actually one of the <a href="https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/8-things-know-about-palm-oil">greatest&nbsp;drivers of deforestation</a>.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>Ask tough questions! Even true eco-friendly companies are not perfect, but they'll be happy to answer your questions and show you how they're willing to improve.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>If you really want to avoid giving business to companies who are&nbsp;intentionally greenwashing, you'll need to screen your purchases carefully. Keep an eye out for harmful ingredients, materials, and production practices. When you're informed, you can spot fake eco-friendly companies much more easily.&nbsp;<br></span></p>
<p><span>Continue to read labels and always think about the entire product lifecycle - all the way from the sourcing of materials all the way down to&nbsp;discarding, recycling, or reusing the product.</span></p>
<p><span>Greenwashing needs to be stopped and we need to hold companies accountable. Let’s continue to do our part by becoming conscious consumers and buying environment friendly products.</span></p>

<p>TL;DR: It’s possible to mine Ethereum on a M1 Mac GPU. Hashrate is about 2Mh/s.</p>

<p>I’ve had my M1 MacBook Air for a bit of time now, and I also recently started mining Ethereum. I can’t help asking myself: What’s Ethereum mining performance like on a M1 Mac?</p>



<p>The obvious thing to do first is to run the off-the-shelf <code>ethminer</code>, which gives the following error:</p>



<pre><code>ethminer 0.19.0-alpha.0
Build: darwin/release/appleclang

Unrecognized platform Apple
Error: No usable mining devices found</code></pre>



<p>Not good. Apparently Apple GPUs are not whitelisted in ethminer. That should be easy to fix. Relevant lines are in <code>libethash-cl/CLMiner.cpp</code>, and I added Apple GPUs to the whitelist, pretending it’s an Intel GPU.</p>



<p>Then <code>boost</code> won’t compile since it’s trying to compile with a <code>-fcoalesce-templates</code> argument, which doesn’t exist in recent clang versions. So I have to update <code>boost</code> to the latest version, and fix relevant <code>asio</code> code since <code>ethminer</code> was using deprecated <code>asio</code> APIs.</p>



<p>I also need to upgrade OpenSSL to the latest version to have it support darwin + arm64.</p>



<p>After getting everything to compile. Here’s the result:</p>



<pre><code>ethminer 0.19.0-17+commit.ce52c740.dirty

<h2>Is it worth it?</h2>



<p>Um. Not really. At current Ethereum prices (2021-02-26), it generates $0.14 of profit per day. It’s still a profit, but very miniscule.</p>

<p>See our <a href="https://laurencemolloy.github.io/RepoDash/"><strong>github.io pages</strong></a> 
for detailed instructions on how to use RepoDash.</p>



<p>Do you maintain a project codebase on Github? Would you like to be able to collate statistics 
that summarise historic monthly activity on that codebase and see, at a glance, how that impacts 
the project issues list over time? Would you like to be able to perform this analysis for any 
given time period of your choosing?</p>

<p>RepoDash can do just this. It uses the Github API to collect repository data and generate a 
data visualisation of a range of historic metrics of the project issues list over a user-specified 
period of time. For each calendar month in the time period of interest, it displays the following 
metrics:</p>

<ul>
<li>The number of new issues created</li>
<li>How many of these issues are still open at the time of generating the dashboard</li>
<li>How many of these issues still require triage (labelling) at the time of generating the dashboard</li>
<li>The number of existing issues resolved</li>
<li>The percentage split between opened / closed issues</li>
<li>The aggregate number of open issues in the issues list (month start &amp; month end)</li>
<li>The aggregate number of open issues in the issues list requiring triage (month start &amp; month end)</li>
<li>The change in total number of open issues over the month</li>
<li>The average age and age spread of open issues in the isssues list</li>
</ul>


<p>It also displays aggregate counts for the most frequently used labels for all issues that remained open
at the end of the displayed time period.</p>

<h3>Typical Use Cases</h3>

<p>Perhaps you are managing an open source project, the maintenance of which you'd like to keep on top 
of. Or perhaps you manage a software product at work where you are required to provide your boss with 
exective summary updates of your support team's progress on an ongoing monthly basis. Either way, if 
your codebase is managed via Github, RepoDash could be just what you need.</p>

<h3>Demo Mode</h3>

<p>For demo purposes, this code processes the first 10 pages of the matplotlib<sup>1</sup> project and 
displays the most recent 12 months of metrics by default. Command line arguments allow you to set your
own project repository and analysis timeframe. It couldn't be simpler.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <em><a href="https://matplotlib.org/"><strong>matplotlib</strong></a> is a popular open science 
plotting library for python which is utilised by RepoDash to generate its data visualisations</em></p>

<h3>Future Development</h3>

<p>This project is a work in progress. The current version of RepoDash has only been tested with open 
source (public) projects. However, there are plans to ensure that it works with private ones as well. 
Over time, we also plan to build on the range of metrics offered and make it easy for the user to select 
which metrics to display... watch this space!</p>

        <p>Over-fitting is a lie.</p>

<h2 id="backgroud">Backgroud</h2>

<p>I <a href="https://drorcohengithub.github.io/website/decoding/encoding/fmri/2020/07/31/decoding_visual_experience.html">previously talked about</a> predicting and decoding brain activity as recorded using fMRI. In that post I followed the tried and true approach of (1) extracting some features from the stimulus and (2) fitting a regularised linear regression from the features to brain activity. It works really well.</p>

<p>One of the reasons we use linear regression in these type of “encoding” studies is that there is not much data. For example in that study the training set had only about 7200 samples (which is quite a lot by fMRI community standards). The traditional thinking is that very rich models, such as deep neural nets (NNs) with millions of parameters, will disastrously over-fit in this type of situation, resulting in low performance. However, this traditional thinking may be out of date.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.293878v1">recent paper uploaded to bioarxiv</a> generated some discussion in our lab. It is a very thorough study looking at predicting brain activity using deep NNs with many interesting results. Among these results, the authors show that replacing the linear regression with a NN provides a substantial improvement over linear regression (see also <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00021/full">here</a>).</p>

<p>I think is pretty likely that with some effort and a lot of NN know-how an expert can improve on the performance of a linear model. But I figured that avoiding over-fitting in this situation is going to be really hard, and that an out of the box implementation would perform disastrously. So I thought I’d give it a go.</p>

<p>In this post I go through fitting a simple NN, though still with millions of parameters, to predict brain activity. I’ll use a vanilla NN paired with the same data I analyzed in my previous post. This way we will have a direct comparison with the linear model. A full notebook to reproduce this is up on my <a href="https://github.com/drorcohengithub/Prediciting_BOLD_with_TensorFlow">github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="preparations">Preparations</h2>

<p>We will use the same data from last time. For convenience I put everything you’ll need <a href="https://figshare.com/s/9803543b6736009e7a83">here</a>.</p>

<p>I restrict the analysis to the 2000 voxels that were best predicted using the linear model. This is a bit harsh on our NN here because it is possible that the NN improves on voxels that the linear model was poor at predicting, so keep that in mind.</p>

<h2 id="the-network">The network</h2>

<p>We first need to decide on the structure of the network. There is now a whole zoo of network architectures and I think it is pretty likely that many of them are superior to the linear model. However, the point here to see how well an “out of the box” NN works. Nothing is more vanilla than a tutorial, so I will use the architecture from the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/regression">TensorFlow regression tutorial</a>. The architecture has two hidden, densely connected layers with relu activations. We will be fitting a mere 1,812,304 parameters.</p>

<p>There really is no reason to think that this architecture is suited to our specific problem. But if something like this <em>does</em> work, then it may not be so difficult to come up with a NN that is superior to the linear model.</p>

<p>The next thing is to choose an optimizer for the network. The tutorial used ADAM with a hardwired learning rate, but I went with a simple weight decay approach.

<h2 id="prepare-the-training-and-validation-data">Prepare the training and validation data</h2>

<p>I will keep some data aside for validation as we train the model. The key thing to remember here is that we are using time series data. This means that the data is not iid. If we just grabbed samples randomly for validation then there is a good chance that dependent samples will be in the training set. For example, we may end up with sample at t=n in the val set but t=n-1 in the training set. These are dependent, and in fact likely to be quite similar. In this case performance on the validation test will reflect something of double dipping and probably be much higher than what we get on the final test set.</p>

<p>I will very crudely grab three chunks of 200 samples at intervals of 2000, 4000 and 6000 samples. This is completely arbitrary and pretty poor practice. We did much better on the ridge regression in the previous post, but I think it is good enough for illustration. Note that we might have a bit of leakage (since the samples around these chunks are still in the training set), but I think it is not too much of a worry.</p>

<p>flatcat invites to experience a new dimension of touch and motion. Cuddle with it, have a gentle romp, or just watch it do weird things on its own, to caress your soul. The robot feels everything exactly with cognitive sensorimotor loops based on ten years of developmental robotics research. flatcat has no face, no app, no cloud, full privacy. It is built around a 3D printed skeleton and is powered by Jetpack Cognition Lab‘s own electrical motor design.</p>



<p>The new product will be available on Kickstarter and selected outlets beginning March 3, 2021. Visit https://flatcat.berlin for more information.</p>

When you should (and shouldn't) buy things</h3><p id="0c7ad9de-777a-444b-a703-e2fd64c6a748">Buy things if they:</p><ol id="fb66b42a-e007-4f54-92ee-0125704a9790" start="1"><li>Spark joy, especially when buying for someone else — the emotional ROI of gift-giving is off the charts.</li></ol><ol id="61953c5a-f373-460a-8c86-a1df20760a17" start="2"><li>Get used everyday (Ex. Nice pants, laptop and phone).</li></ol><ol id="38edd8a2-4d00-455e-90c4-351dfb0e2b8b" start="3"><li>Come in between you and the ground (Ex. Mattresses, chairs, winter tires).</li></ol><ol id="dce98e87-6a65-4304-994a-fbaf12c1e596" start="4"><li>Make your life &gt;1% easier (Ex. Good cookware/knives, tools, software).</li></ol><ol id="d6357926-602c-4450-aad9-c53bee4d4845" start="5"><li>Make you better (Ex. Education, gym memberships, travel).</li></ol><p id="dccfbf19-9ddc-4278-b1e6-b8dfa92d77b8">Don't buy things if:</p><ol id="2bb2a4df-bd52-4d81-bb3d-4f34d2a515fd" start="1"><li>You pretty much already own them (Ex. The newest iPhone if you have the last gen already, anything limited edition that won't appreciate in value, cars unless somethings wrong with them).</li></ol><ol id="e14026b6-6d57-439c-baef-b19bf5115bc9" start="2"><li>They're "on sale" — by all means try to get a good deal but sometimes products "on sale" were the same price last month and you just didn't see it, use a price tracker like <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/">camelcamelcamel.com</a> to avoid this and make sure you're actually getting a good deal for something you will actually use. Marketing people get paid millions to make you buy things you don't need with money you don't have - outsmart them.</li></ol><ol id="2a9c7b05-6a47-4be0-a8ff-e642252f11d6" start="3"><li>They're cheap — inexpensive and cheap mean 2 different things here but generally look for quality items with lifetime warranties, 1 coat that costs $1000 but lasts 30 years has better ROI than buying a $100 coat every other year. Plus it's less mental strain since you don't have to think about replacing it and you'll get to use something you actually like.</li></ol><ol id="37763a48-4232-460c-86f0-87dcb651fea1" start="4"><li>They're heavily advertised to you — more money spent on marketing means a higher price for you since you're not just paying for the product but the salaries of the people hired to sell/advertise it to you.</li></ol><ol id="f7b4a249-f8bd-4ae4-8fb2-2329bd1b01b6" start="5"><li>You can't afford it! Treat your credit card like a debit card and even then make sure it doesn't dip below an uncomfortable balance.</li></ol><h3 id="2e2f2deb-32bc-4e8d-be04-8a43469e6060">3. Legal tax evasion strategies</h3><p id="31a30907-dbb4-4d92-a98f-4adcdc753115">There are a few ways to legally pay less taxes that the average joe usually isn't aware of. </p><p id="0dff2cad-cfef-4b44-9f44-8577b867fd68">If you have a company, incorporated or not, you can write off lots of things as business expenses like transportation, buying new equipment or rent for co-working spaces. It's also not that hard to start a company — if you're a freelancer, call yourself a consultant and start a "consulting firm" or start an e-commerce store and call yourself a sole-proprieter. Then you can hire a family member, deduct home office expenses and even if you lose money operating the business, you'll save money on taxes. </p><p id="3b719889-6616-4458-94ca-655d168fe3d5">Investing in your government's version of a retirement savings plan is tax deductible against your personal income. So are losses from the stock market. So is charitable giving!</p><p id="62423246-e396-4a48-a5de-a2435a7b19e6">Always try to max out tax free investment accounts/retirement accounts — even if you think it's not worth it the taxes breaks alone mean you come out ahead, even better if your employer matches your contributions. And at the very least, not being able to withdraw for a few decades means you'll be in it for the long run and the market always goes up in the long run.</p><h3 id="93a74cf1-8c77-4182-9946-e91424039ed0">4. <strong>Investing the 80/20 way</strong></h3><p id="05897fe9-4a0e-47d4-8df2-cd910fe40f75">For traditional investing, I try to maximize output and minimize effort. I only use 1 app: Wealthsimple Trade. </p><p id="919727c6-9844-4e45-9aaf-173cb2c3689c">Wealthsimple Trade is like a broker — they let you buy stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, etc., all with $0 fees. They make money from charging a 1.5% currency conversion fee — you can only hold CAD in your account but have to buy US equities with USD and when you sell holdings in USD your balance is credited with CAD. $0 fees are not typical for a brokerage but the currency exchange fees are a killer so I try to only buy Canadian equities. Sometimes I can't resist and I'll run a YOLO on GME - this is more common than I'd like to admit.</p><p id="6dc5cb83-3b1e-410c-b972-d95b9797fc56">Since I'm young, have a job, live at home and can take lots of financial risk, my net worth is divided up roughly as follows (in order of volatility):</p><ul id="467c8446-9ec7-43ad-8b1f-1791cdd43b52"><li>35.5% virtual NBA trading cards</li></ul><ul id="bf81caae-aa42-4c95-a52c-5b3ddf5d07f8"><li>1% Cryptocurrency</li></ul><ul id="8b770356-e3fd-4fb1-ad38-bc3c816dc0d9"><li>33.3% individual stocks I picked (mostly tech companies, this is basically gambling)</li></ul><ul id="5cdbf0f9-7f1d-472a-92ce-9b2b01f7f923"><li>7.1% tech ETFS (ZQQ, ARKK)</li></ul><ul id="4ce7e8fa-3420-4f06-be9d-3418a842c2fd"><li>21.6% whole market ETFs (VSP.TO, VTI, EEMV)</li></ul><ul id="12e4ffe2-10d1-409e-b40a-cf0726ac9eb5"><li>1.5% cash</li></ul><p id="b48787d4-7850-4d49-9104-2819465bd622">This portfolio was made when I was young and stupid. I do not recommend this for anyone and am slowly selling off my more risky positions and buying more into whole market ETFs. It also makes no sense that I'm so heavily invested in the tech sector while working in tech - if that industry goes to shit I'll be doubly ruined. I'm just sharing this for full disclosure since you should know who you're in business with while reading this. Do as I say, not as I do. </p><p id="ddde7cc2-1ab0-4ced-8353-1fe79f450c38">For most investors under 30 who have a similar financial and risk profile as me but aren't as insane, I'd recommend the following steps:</p><ul id="ecc17c23-5127-4155-99d6-30a736287057"><li>Open up a $0 fee trading account - likely Wealthsimple Trade or QuestTrade in Canada, Robinhood in the States</li></ul><ul id="05d79173-10cf-4145-9713-6bb38ced3c08"><li>Deposit a certain % of your paycheque every time you get it and try to maintain a certain ratio of risky investments to safe ones - consistently depositing $500 every month is way better than $10 000 at one time, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp#:~:text=Dollar%2Dcost%20averaging%20(DCA)%20is%20an%20investment%20strategy%20in,volatility%20on%20the%20overall%20purchase.&amp;text=Dollar%2Dcost%20averaging%20is%20also%20known%20as%20the%20constant%20dollar%20plan.">trust me</a></li></ul><ul id="4df5cac9-c4f4-42ae-8c3e-711a751152fd"><li>I believe inflation is worse than market volatility and the market has always gone up and likely will continue to. For that reason, I recommend the following allocation for your investing money:<ul id="4d3ce485-0523-4605-afe5-c97bacc99497"><li>40% in a whole market fund - something that tracks a lot of high quality stocks and moves in the direction of the entire stock market every day (ex. VRGO, SPY)</li></ul><p id="36533864-3c86-44f4-8bbe-144d15b97ab3">The rest is based on your risk tolerance:</p><ul id="2599b8be-90db-47ad-8ea9-151e9b7b538d"><li><details open=""><summary>Risky (in order of ascending risk): </summary><ul id="6a974d7a-0e47-4fa1-ad6f-226fd0949462"><li>20-30% in a tech sector ETF (I like QQQ/ZQQ, ARKK and ARKW)</li></ul><ul id="24e9d83b-a18d-489a-a7dd-9a8450856b2f"><li>15-20% in individual stocks (this is basically blackjack)</li></ul><ul id="5f3b11bd-9b9f-4ebb-9293-724fea03a1a7"><li>5-10% in cryptocurrency (this is basically roulette)</li></ul><ul id="d8860df2-13af-47d9-816c-dcbe43ecb54e"><li>10-20% in cash</li></ul></details></li></ul><ul id="b9d7004e-e41f-4eda-a330-dbc5d5d13da4"><li><details open=""><summary>Conservative:</summary><ul id="6338a2a9-ded0-4731-ac23-9de34ba326ba"><li>Another 20-40% in in a whole market fund</li></ul><ul id="3d919383-87af-4291-86b0-1e4a6cb790ba"><li> 10-20% in a tech ETF (or pick a more stable industry like banking/energy)</li></ul><ul id="6db6640c-7c77-446b-bd0a-a67883caa04f"><li>10-20% in an ETF tracking bonds</li></ul><ul id="8dc7967e-2184-4ccb-a303-f9f0bf0be1c7"><li>10-20% cash</li></ul><ul id="2e285b82-ee2e-40d1-a547-46ae9a3c3dad"><li>0-5% gold</li></ul></details></li></ul></li></ul><p id="7ca5d98c-014c-4654-8ccc-6e333334b9b8">Some other things to remember:</p><ul id="9225f5e9-eb42-4d81-945f-39e312b14045"><li>Wherever you're investing, keep it consistent and comfortable — it's better to invest 20% of your salary every month and never withdraw than depositing $10000 sporadically when "you see an opportunity"<ul id="ab8e384c-f4a5-4b48-8075-9041ce3ed137"><li>You'll have cash when you need it — if something happens and all your money is tied up in investments, you have to withdraw no matter what → the stock market may always go up in the long run but it fluctuates in the short run, if you need money immediately you may need to sell while you're at a loss.</li></ul></li></ul><ul id="1321b660-f49d-4127-9920-56410f7d3fa5"><li>Keep your personal wellbeing above all<ul id="6e47ce6d-42d0-4836-8a06-ab17b09af564"><li>I have a low appetite for risk when it comes to things I don't understand — that's why I'll never trade on margin, trade options or invest more than 40% of my portfolio in one equity, the possibility of losing all my money would keep me up at night and wouldn't be worth the potential financial upside.</li></ul><ul id="32700e60-6458-4a6a-a801-8318377ba405"><li>I keep less cash on hand because I don't need to buy things very often - you may the opposite in that case your asset allocation will look different from mine - the most important thing is just beating inflation by getting at least 2-4% return (ideally more).</li></ul></li></ul><ul id="6f4d5ce0-26bb-480e-b466-30deb7b0ff0d"><li>Don't over-optimize<ul id="29ad34f1-b279-4417-971b-b2c6e3be98e8"><li>The average person doesn't need to spend hours researching trading strategies or comparing fees for different investment platforms.

Today, I thought I would help out wannabe homesteaders by gathering together tips for living off grid without money, some you probably haven’t seen before.</p><p>How to live off grid with no money:</p><ul><li><strong>Get yourself a piece of free or low-cost land (4 methods below)</strong></li><li><strong>Build a free home</strong></li><li><strong>Gather and grow naturally abundant foods</strong></li><li><strong>Purify available water for free — no wells to dig</strong></li><li><strong>Set up dirt cheap (free) waste disposal</strong></li><li><strong>Bonus: Find a free living community</strong></li></ul><p>Despite what advertisers, builders, and real estate agents might want you to believe, there are actually many ways to get off grid with out much cost. It all depends on how much work you are willing to put in, and being able to think outside the box.</p><h2 id="getting-land-for-no-money">Getting Land for No Money</h2><p>Free land is still out there and still available. Right now there are many out of the way towns and villages offering plots free or basically free if you are willing to live there. Out in the country, there also opportunities for farm caretakers or land contract deals that will not be advertised online. You have to know where to look. Lastly, there are many tracks of land sitting, unused, that could be yours for <strong>free</strong>, using the unknown law called “adverse possession” that exists in some form in all 50 states!</p><div><div><h5>Free Off Grid Guide</h5><p>Thinking about going off grid?

While not free up front, <a href="https://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/landsales">the Alaskan government routinely sells cheap land</a> over the counter as well as through periodic auctions.</p><h4 id="free-money-for-living-in-alaska">Free Money for Living in Alaska</h4><p>While not initially free, establishing residency in Alaska makes you eligible to receive the annual <a href="https://pfd.alaska.gov/">Permanent Fund Dividend</a>. Last year’s dividend was <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2019/09/27/this-years-alaska-permanent-fund-dividend-1606/">$1,606 per person</a> including dependents and children. <strong>So a household of five would have seen a $8030 payment this year.</strong> The amount paid depends on how much money Alaska is making, and thus the economy, but the dividend payout has been between about $1,000 – $2,000 per person in recent memory.</p><p>For a family who lives frugally and attempts to produce most of their food off grid through hunting would be able to pay of their off grid land purchase in only a few years.</p><figure><img alt="Subsistence Fishing in Alaska" height="393" src="https://offgridpermaculture.com/img/subsistence_fishing_alaska_salmon.jpg" width="600" ezimgfmt="rs rscb8 src" data-ezsrc="/img/subsistence_fishing_alaska_salmon.jpg"></figure><h4 id="subsistence-hunting-and-fishing-licenses">Subsistence Hunting and Fishing Licenses</h4><p>Residents of Alaska also get <a href="https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=residentfishing.main">special privileges concerning hunting and fishing rights</a>. This includes practices such as net fishing for Salmon and subsistence hunting that are not possible in other states. When I lived in Alaska, it was rare to find a home without a chest freezer packed with salmon and moose meat caught for free.</p><p><span data-ez-name="offgridpermaculture_com-leader-1"></span>For those of you haven’t spent time in Alaska the remoteness of the land and ferocity of the cold weather may astonish you. Likewise, the cost of necessities such as gas and food is well above most regions of United States. So be careful if you decide to go up there. However, for many of my readers, Alaska might just be the perfect spot.</p><h3 id="usda-farm-grant-and-loan-program">USDA Farm Grant and Loan Program</h3><p>No money, but interested in opening a functioning off grid farm? <a href="https://www.usda.gov/topics/farming/grants-and-loans">USDA Grants &amp; Loans</a> has programs to provide money for family size farms as well as a program specifically for new farms.</p><p>In exchange for accepting these funds you will be obligated to attempt to start a farm that conforms to the USDA’s standards of farming. But, for looking to get started with their own off grid agriculture business, these programs could be perfect for you.</p><h3 id="farm-caretaker">Farm Caretaker</h3><p>One way to get started off grid for no money is to become a <a href="https://www.motherearthnews.com/homesteading-and-livestock/farm-caretaker-zmaz76mjztak">Farm Caretaker</a>. Farm care taking is a free rent situation where you work in exchange for free rent. And, can often be a longer term arrangement, lasting years if you choose.</p><p>With labor in rural farm lands at an all time low, and children of farming families moving to the city, there are many farms out there that are looking for people to watch over them. Depending on the situation, some owners may ask you to work part time on the farm — tending livestock and the like — while others may just want someone around to keep an eye on the place and do occasional maintenance work.</p><p>You will not find offers for farm care taker advertised online or on job sites. and will have to search for your own opportunities. Try posting an add on Craigslist, Facebook local forums, or in regional newspapers with good rural distribution. Explain clearly and quickly what you are looking for and what you plan to offer in return.</p><h3 id="land-contract">Land Contract</h3><p>Undeveloped land is not easily financed or mortgaged by banks, which makes land contracts, also known as owner carry, very common practice for purchasing off grid land. A land contract is an agreement between the buyer and seller that you will pay off the purchase over time at a set rate, and at the end of the contract you become the full owner of the land.</p><p>Essentially, the seller becomes the bank.</p><h4 id="finding-no-down-land-contracts">Finding No Down Land Contracts</h4><p>While land contracts typically require a 10% – 20% down payment, finding a motivated owner through direct contact gives you the opportunity to negotiate for a zero down or work exchange situation. See my article <a href="https://offgridpermaculture.com/Finding_Land/How_to_Find_Off_Grid_Land_Ways_You_Havent_Heard_Of.html">“How to Find Off Grid Land - Ways You Haven’t Heard Of”</a> for details on how to find and contact motivated sellers not yet on the market.</p><h4 id="local-businesses-that-sell-land">Local Businesses that Sell Land</h4><p>Another no down option would be to contact <a href="https://www.classiccountryland.com/blog/become-a-land-owner-with-no-down-payment-or-fees">small companies that specialize in off grid properties</a>. Some have special deals for no down payment parcels, while others might be amenable to negotiating special terms. Also, if you are in a lumber producing area, search for local timber investment firms. I have found firms that sell off grid “timber land” with land contracts, and may be willing to provide good terms on parcels of land that they consider unproductive.</p><p>Land contracts are well established legally, generally safe for both parties. However, be wary if you sign one, because failure to pay timely payments or follow through with the contract usually results in the buyer losing the property and anything they paid up to that point.</p><figure><img alt="Map of Adverse Possession Laws in the US" height="450" src="https://offgridpermaculture.com/img/adverse_possession_free_land_laws_in_the_us_by_state.jpg" width="600" ezimgfmt="rs rscb8 src" data-ezsrc="/img/adverse_possession_free_land_laws_in_the_us_by_state.jpg"></figure><h3 id="adverse-possession">Adverse Possession</h3><p>One legal concept for acquiring land that you probably haven’t heard of before is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_possession#United_States">adverse possession</a> or “squatter’s rights”. What they are is the right to claim ownership of a piece of land that you have been openly living on it for a certain amount of time (see above map), between 5 – 30 years depending on your state.</p><p>The idea of these laws are that vacant pieces of land where, the owner is completely absent, should go to someone who is putting it to good use. What that means in practice varies form state to state. Every state in the US has some form of adverse possession.</p><p>Adverse possession does not mean you have the right to live on a piece of property if you have been asked to leave. The legal owner can ask you to leave at any time. Ultimately, it can be a gamble, since you <strong>must live on the land without the owner’s permission in order to claim adverse possession.</strong></p><p>EDIT: More info on adverse possession and squatters rights, including a state by state breakdown of the laws, can be found here —</p><ul><li><a href="https://offgridpermaculture.com/Finding_Land/How_to_Homestead_on_Abandoned_Property_Is_It_Legal.html">How to Homestead on Abandoned Property | Is It Legal?</a></li></ul><h2 id="low-cost-or-no-cost-off-grid-housing">Low Cost or No Cost Off Grid Housing</h2><p>The next big hurdle to get started living off grid is housing. While some of the options provided above may come with a living arrangement, there are may free or low cost ways to live comfortably off the grid.</p><p>Homes are usually the mainstream family’s biggest expense, but if you are willing to work and to live conservatively, a dept free or even plain free home is within your grasp. Building a tiny home is well within the skills of most people with minimal training. And, they can be built quickly and cheap or free depending on your building material foraging skills. There are also may natural building styles like cob building, light straw clay, earth bag, and straw bale that can be build largely from earth already on site, and can last for generations.</p><figure><img alt="Tiny Home Living for Free" height="400" src="https://offgridpermaculture.com/img/tiny_home_living_off_grid.jpg" width="600" ezimgfmt="rs rscb8 src" data-ezsrc="/img/tiny_home_living_off_grid.jpg"></figure><h3 id="tiny-home-from-recycled-materials">Tiny Home from Recycled Materials</h3><p>With the tiny home craze growing every year, there are many places to …</p></div></div>

<p><a href="#1">• Clotting activation</a><br>
<a href="#2">• Therapeutic approach</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is already known on this topic</strong><br>
Cardiovascular diseases, which include stroke and heart attack, are one of the leading cause of death worldwide. Most heart attacks result from the formation of a blood clot that obstructs one or more coronary arteries, the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients to the heart. Low levels of microbial molecules called endotoxins have been found in the blood of people whose coronary arteries are obstructed by blood clots, but the role of endotoxins in the formation of blood clots is still unclear.</p>
<p><strong>What this research adds</strong><br>
Researchers have analyzed blood samples from 150 people, including 50 individuals affected by heart attack, from whom the researchers also obtained samples of coronary blood clots. The analysis showed that endotoxins derived from Escherichia coli, a bacterium commonly found in the gut, could enter the blood circulation and trigger the formation of blood clots in coronary arteries. The team also found that, compared to the gut of healthy people, the intestine of individuals who suffered a heart attack is more permeable — a condition that could allow endotoxins to enter the blood circulation. Mice injected with E. coli or treated with endotoxins developed more blood clots than untreated mice. But these detrimental effects disappeared when mice were given an inhibitor of TLR4 — the cellular receptor to which E. coli binds to trigger the formation of blood clots.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
The findings suggest a new mechanism that could favor heart attacks and could open up therapeutic avenues that rely on TLR4 inhibition to counteract the formation of coronary clots in people with cardiovascular disease, the researchers say.</p>

<p>Cardiovascular diseases, which include stroke and heart attack, are one of the leading cause of death worldwide, but the mechanisms behind these disorders are unknown. Now, researchers have found that <strong>a bacterium commonly found in the gut could enter the blood circulation, triggering the formation of blood clots in vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients to the heart</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The findings</a>, published in the <i>European Heart Journal</i>, suggest a new mechanism that could favor heart attacks. They also open up therapeutic avenues to treat this condition, the researchers say.</p>
<p>Most heart attacks result from the formation of a blood clot that obstructs one or more coronary arteries. <strong>Low levels of</strong> microbial molecules called <strong>endotoxins have been found in the blood of people whose coronary arteries are obstructed by blood clots</strong>, but the role of endotoxins in the formation of blood clots is still unclear.</p>
<p>To address this question, <strong>Francesco Violi</strong> at Umberto I University Hospital in Rome and his colleagues analyzed blood samples from 150 people, including 50 individuals affected by heart attack. From these individuals, the researchers also obtained samples of coronary blood clots.</p>
<h2 id="1">Clotting activation</h2>
<p>The analysis showed that <strong>endotoxins derived from </strong><strong><i>Escherichia coli</i></strong>, a bacterium commonly found in the gut, <strong>circulate in the blood of people with heart attack</strong>. <strong>That’s likely because</strong> <strong>the intestine of these individuals is more permeable that the gut of healthy people</strong>, the researchers found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The increased gut permeability observed in people with heart attacks could allow endotoxins as well as gut bacteria to enter the blood circulation. Indeed, the researchers found that 34% of samples from people with a heart attack contained <i>E. coli</i> DNA, compared to 4% of samples from healthy people.</p>
<p><strong>The presence of low levels of endotoxins in the blood appears to trigger the formation of coronary blood clots through several mechanisms</strong>, the researchers found. These include the activation, adhesion, and aggregation of small cell fragments known as platelets, which help to turn blood from a liquid into a gel.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="2">Therapeutic approach</h2>
<p><strong>To trigger the formation of blood clots, <i>E. coli</i></strong><strong> appears to bind to a specific cell-surface receptor called TLR4</strong>. The team also identified <strong>a molecule that inhibits the TLR4 receptor, hindering the formation of blood clots</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mice injected with <i>E. coli</i> or treated with endotoxins developed more blood clots than untreated mice. But the detrimental effect of endotoxins disappeared when mice were given the TLR4 inhibitor.</p>
<p>The results could help to develop <strong>new therapeutic strategies that rely on TLR4 inhibition to counteract the formation of coronary clots in people with cardiovascular disease</strong>, the researchers say.</p><div>

<p>On 16<sup>th</sup> June 2014, Jeremiah Heaton declared 2,060km<sup>2</sup> of arid land in Africa as the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.kingdomsudan.org/" target="_blank">Kingdom of North Sudan</a>, after promising his daughter that one day she would become a Princess.</p>



<p>Heaton, a farmer from the US state of Virginia, had been looking for unclaimed territory around the world and after some research settled on an area known as Bir Tawil, an uninhabited piece of land between Egypt and Sudan.</p>



<p>Due to two conflicting treaties drawn up by the British, both Egypt and Sudan interpreted the treaties as they saw fit. A claim on a piece of land close to Bir Tawil would disqualify the party from claiming Bir Tawil itself, and since the former enjoyed prospective mineral wealth, both sides claim this land as their own. Bir Tawil ended up a ‘terra nullius’ – land that belongs to no one until this was claimed by Heaton himself.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="488" src="https://i0.wp.com/karlsnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bir-Tawil.png?resize=640%2C488&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/karlsnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bir-Tawil.png?w=941&amp;ssl=1 941w, https://i0.wp.com/karlsnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bir-Tawil.png?resize=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/karlsnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bir-Tawil.png?resize=768%2C586&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<h3>Rose Island</h3>



<p>Like many others, I have recently watched ‘<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81116948" target="_blank">Rose Island</a>‘ on Netflix and started to think about how countries we know today came to be. In the film, Giorgio Rosa, the real-life founder of the former ‘<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Rose_Island" target="_blank">Republic of Rose Island</a>‘, tried, in vain, to convince the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the Italian Government that since his artificial island was outside Italy’s territorial waters, it should be considered an independent state. While Rose Island and North Sudan are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronation" target="_blank">micronations</a> – which are usually small in size, lack recognition from other states and are generally the creation of a single individual – their founding stories can tell us a lot about the challenges that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-state" target="_blank">proto-states</a> meet with, and how countries are indeed volatile entities that can be created and destroyed.</p>



<p>When one thinks of countries like the United States, Russia, China, Japan or Germany for example, we usually consider these as permanent entities, however even these same countries had different borders, governments and cultures throughout their existence. While micronations cannot be compared to these countries, they do have one thing in common – they all are trying to find or maintain their place on the world stage.</p>



<p>So, how do you create a country?  First of all – what exactly is a country?</p>



<p>While there is no single definition of what constitutes a ‘country’, there are some <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state" target="_blank">international guidelines</a> that this entity must follow, for it to be recognised as such. The two main competing schools of thought are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state#Constitutive_theory">constitutive theory of statehood</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state#Declarative_theory">declarative theory of statehood</a>. </p>



<p>Big words, however, the main difference is that the first one only affords recognition to states that have been recognised by other states, while the second allows for an entity to declare sovereignty without having to be explicitly recognised as such by other states.</p>



<p>The declarative theory was codified in 1933 in the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States and is used by many proto-states, including micronations to help prove their cause, as its the easier way of declaring sovereignty. This does not guarantee that someone following this theory is automatically considered a country. Let’s take a look at each one of the qualifications under this theory and see how they affect the aspirations of proto-countries, not only micronations but also regions and people fighting for their sovereignty. </p>



<p>The Convention states that “the state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications”:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Permanent Population;</strong></li><li><strong>Defined</strong> <strong>Territory;</strong></li><li><strong>A Government;</strong></li><li><strong>The ability to enter into agreements with other states.</strong></li></ol>



<hr>



<h3>1. Permanent Population</h3>



<p>The first qualification under this Convention is for the proto-state to have a permanent population belonging to the land one is claiming as a country.  </p>



<p>The Sahrawi people in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara">Western Sahara</a> have been roaming the lands for hundreds of years. The area was governed by the Spanish until 1975 when Morocco, Mauritania and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polisario_Front" target="_blank">Polisario</a> all claimed the land as their own. </p>



<p>In a dispute between the latter two, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/01/13/who-should-control-western-sahara" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declared</a> that Western Sahara was not <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_nullius" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_nullius" target="_blank">terra nullius</a>, as in the case of Bir Tawil, and before the Spanish conquered the area, there were tribes connected to Morocco, who were already living off the land. Morocco took this as a sign that it has historical precedent to control Western Sahara, even if the ICJ did not reach that explicit conclusion.</p>



<p>Earlier, the United Nations General Assembly adopted <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/Independence.aspx" target="_blank">Resolution 1514 (XV)</a> on 14 December 1960, which declared that non-self-governing territories have to “transfer all powers to the peoples of those territories, without any conditions or reservations, …. in order to enable them to enjoy complete independence and freedom.”</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/morningstaronline.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/11sahrawiprotesters.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Sahrawi women protesting against the Moroccan occupation, 2005 Photo: Western Sahara / Creative Commons</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This is were Morocco and Polisario, which is recognised as the representative of the Sahrawi people by the United Nations, disagree. Polisario has been fighting for control of the land ever since, and after 1991 when a war between the Front and Morocco ended, the former only controlled a strip of land to the east of Western Sahara with the border of Mauritania.</p>



<p>The Sahrawis are banking that having a permanent population on the land would make it easier for them to declare independence of Western Sahara. However, even this hope is fading as Morocco has been increasingly moving Moroccans on the land, making sure that any future referendum, if it takes place, confirms its control on Western Sahara. Without outside pressure, especially from major players in the region and around the world, Polisario supporters and Sahrawis see little hope that someday they would control the area, despite their people having lived there for hundreds of years.</p>



<p>The case of Western Sahara contrasts with the tens of colonies that after World War II started gaining independence on account of their different cultures, languages and customs compared to the coloniser – and also as a result of the UN Security Council Resolution mentioned above. Even today, pro-independence parties and supporters in Catalonia and Scotland, for example, who have occupied their lands for hundreds of years, built institutions around their customs and passed on their language from generation to generation, claim their right to govern themselves as they see fit. The call for the sovereignty of these regions is, in fact, stronger than that of the people in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cyprus">Northern </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cyprus" target="_blank">Cyprus</a>, for example, whose claim for independence is the result of a military incursion in 1974. Article 11 of the same Convention even claims that states will not recognise territorial acquisitions claimed by force.</p>



<h3>2. Defined Territory</h3>



<p>Several proto-countries often start with this specification – finding or occupying a piece of land or estate – something tangible that can give the claim of a state a real feel. Some, like Heaton, go to great lengths to find land unclaimed by official states, while others declare regions or parts of their country as a separate entity. Rosa, in ‘Rose Island’, even built the artificial island himself.</p>



<p>On the night of 2<sup>nd</sup> May 2020, a number of slogans such as ‘<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nationalia.info/brief/11308/away-from-rome-independence-slogans-written-with-fire-on-mountains-in-south-tyrol" target="_blank">Away from Rome</a>‘ were written with fire on the side of the mountains in South Tyrol in what seems to be criticism by right-wing separatist supporters, against the centralisation of COVID-19 regulations by the Italian government.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="320" src="https://i0.wp.com/karlsnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/los_von_rom.jpg?resize=640%2C320&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/karlsnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/los_von_rom.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/karlsnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/los_von_rom.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><em>Author: Schützenkompanie Johann-Jaeger Niederdorf Süd Tirol</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The geographic position and history of South Tyrol with its neighbours and Rome, has led some movements to argue for the region to cede from Italy and join Austria. Pro-separatist South Tyrolean parties highlight their historical borders and their cultural and language differences with other parts of Italy as the reason why they cannot form part of the country. </p>



<p>Many regions around the world have promoted territorial separatism as a way to reduce tension, sometimes even violence, between people of different backgrounds and different cultures. This is not usually the case in most independence movements in Europe, such as in South Tyrol or Corsica. However, violence has sometimes been used by separatist movements who believe that this will accelerate their cause, and even by the Government of the country who believes it will keep these movements in check.</p>



<p>Even so, cases like South Tyrol, Corsica, West Papua (Indonesia) or New Caledonia (France), where there is an existing natural or man-made border separating people with similar backgrounds from other parts of the country tend to be more successful in making their case for independence accepted, or at least understood, within that same community and with the mainland. Compare this with people who have the same cultural background but are found in different regions/countries. One example is the case of the Kurds who are concentrated in parts of Turkey, Syria, Iran and Iraq. Without a single place to call home, Kurds have had to take up their quest for sovereignty with several regional powers, which has made it harder for them to claim territory. The Syrian civil war did provide hope for Kurds, after the setting up of Rojava or the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Administration_of_North_and_East_Syria" target="_blank">Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria</a>,  which created a de facto proto-state controlled by Syrian Kurds. However, as soon as Turkey realised the danger of having an entity controlled by the Kurds right outside their borders, they invaded and re-took part of the lands aligned with Rojava.</p>



<p>Take also the example of Cyprus and the Turkish invasion in 1974, which de facto divided the country into two. Whereas before the invasion Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriots lived amongst each other all over the country, the invasion and subsequent building of borders, led to the separation of these two cultures. The now defined territory of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus made it possible for some Cypriot-Turks to try and claim independence.</p>

<p>
Shapes are mysterious. They are basic, rudimentary forms — simple ideas upon which we build more complex systems of understanding. They are also vast landscapes of information and meaning — doorways into mental worlds of thought, unhindered by physical limitations.
</p>
<p>
You can look at the simplest of forms — a square, a circle, a triangle — and its edges will accommodate your curiosity; they will stretch; they will become porous; their liminality will beckon you to enter and to hold them. Like the Sphinx, they may be all their edges tell you, or they may be anything else. They are riddles for the eye.
</p>
<p>
Ellsworth Kelly put it much more simply when he said that “a shape contains personality.”
</p>
<p>
Kelly was talking about just one of his Blue Panels when he said this, though his entire body of work exemplifies the idea. He is best known for painting fields of color. His contribution to modern art was, in part, a vast collection of shaped canvasses, painted in single, flat colors. Beginning his career at a time when abstract expressionism was the idea carrying modern art forward, Kelly’s work was universally iconoclastic. For many onlookers at the time, it simply wasn’t art. And though many of them had their complaints about the expressionist work of his peers, they could at least still see the artist’s <i>hand</i> in the work, be swept up in its motion, or even lose themselves in the physical beauty of the material itself. Kelly’s objects were made precisely to do the opposite: not to engage the viewer in the object or its maker, but to draw them in to everything beyond it. To be a riddle and an invitation.
</p>
<p>
Kelly once <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/metmedia/video/collections/modern/ellsworth-kelly-blue-panel" target="_blank">told a story</a> about a man he met on an airplane. They got to talking about painting. The man shared that he often visits The Metropolitan Museum of Art to look at the paintings. “One painting really throws me,” he said. “It’s a large blue painting with nothing on it.” Kelly replied, “That’s mine. Go look at it again.” Rather than a correction, Kelly offers another riddle.
</p>
<p>
I love this story because I can tell the same one. When I was seventeen, I went with my senior art class to the same museum, and saw the same painting. We had come to tour the modern art gallery in general, but Kelly’s <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/484636" target="_blank">Blue Panel <span>II</span></a>, which is still on view in <a href="https://maps.metmuseum.org/galleries/fifth-ave/2/922" target="_blank">Gallery 922</a>, became our fixation. We gathered in front of it and stared; it silently divided us. Some said it was art. Others said it was not. Its name further provoked the angst of the naysayers: “Blue Panel number <i>two</i>? So there are more of these things?”
</p>
<p>
The debate continued as we left the museum. It went on as we explored the city. And on still, all way home on the bus. Someone suggested we keep this going — that we get together once a week to talk about art outside of class. We named our little group <i>The Wedge</i>. It was a nod to Kelly’s panel and the way it had cleaved our assumed intellectual unity. The group, as far as I know, remained a fixture at my high school for a few years after we were gone but eventually faded away. But I have remained transfixed by <i>the wedge</i>.
</p>
<p>
As I said, Kelly made more than one Blue Panel. In what feels like an almost supernatural coincidence, one of them just happens to hang in a gallery near me at the North Carolina Museum of Art. I remember the first time I strode into the room and saw it. I stopped, dead in my tracks, as if I’d seen a ghost of my past returned in tremendous glory. The <span>NCMA</span>’s <a href="https://ncartmuseum.org/art/detail/blue_panel" target="_blank">Blue Panel</a> is not the same Blue Panel as the one I’d seen as a teenager at The Met. It’s bigger. It’s brighter. Its movement is less of a subtle lean to the side and more of an explosive twist. It’s my favorite of Ellsworth Kelly’s <i>Blue Panels</i>, and a perfect example of what is so magical about his work. I stare at his shapes and am in awe of their endless capacity. In them I see all of geometry, all of math, all surfaces, all spaces, all movement.
</p>
<p><span>

</span></p>
<p>
In no other shape is there greater mystery than the square. I wonder if that is why one of the very few single, square images that Ellsworth Kelly produced is just black. He even titled it that way: “Black,” without reference to shape or surface, leaving us all to decide what it is, or where it is, or where we are within it.
</p>
<p>
A square is a plane with four equal sides set at four right angles. Such a thing hardly exists in the world. Everything we call <i>a square</i> is an example that falls considerably short of the definition, provided you look closely enough. That’s because the precision of numbers doesn’t really exist in the natural world.
</p>
<p>
Plato considered numbers to be <i>abstract</i>. For him, they were ideas that lack physical form necessarily, because to take any form would be to lose their perfection. He also considered numbers to be <i>eternal</i> — perpetually existing — and therefore more real than the world in which we live. His reverence for the perfection of the abstract was almost religious. In fact, he believed that things like numbers and shapes actually existed in another space, often called now, after him, <i>The Platonic Realm</i>. Aristotle, his student, was more pragmatic. He considered numbers to be nothing more than an invention of the mind to aid in our understanding of nature, providing measures of amount, or distance, or duration. One can imagine the debate: One side might say, “If numbers are just a construct, then why do they describe the universe so well?” To which the other might reply, “So would anything else, if that’s what we decided to use to describe the universe!”
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, both a Platonist and an Aristotelian can agree that there is quite some distance between the perfection of geometry and the plasticity of nature. The square, again, makes for an ideal symbol. It is too perfect for nature. Observing both where we <i>find</i> squares and how we <i>use</i> them bears that out. Of all the geometric shapes, the square may be the least commonly occurring in nature. This is because most things in the natural world are molecularly asymmetrical. Mineral structures, for instance, are quite varied in their geometric correspondence. The few that are square are pyrite, galena (the mineral form of lead sulfide), and halite (rock salt). Most everywhere you look for structure in nature, though, you will find far less rigid forms. While there are a few scant natural squares — lobster eyes comprise millions of micron-length square channels; wombat poop is, oddly, cubic — circles, triangles, rhombuses, and all sorts of polygons are far more common. And most of them are warped.
</p>
<p>
When we make squares and when we don’t follows nature’s lead. I often think about how infrequently we use squares when creating spaces and structures. Our bodies, of course, determine this. A square door, for example, would be interesting to look at but impractical to use. We are taller than we are wide. A square door tall enough to give us passage would be wider and intrude upon the space in which it opened more than necessary. So doors, like many other things created by nature, for nature, in nature, are rarely square. Perfect symmetry, as it turns out, is inefficient.
</p>
<p>
I often think about that principle when, as a designer, I consider aspect ratios of imagery. Why is everything a rectangle? There is a reason why cinema screens, televisions, and monitors are wider than they are tall. A rectangular plane in landscape orientation fits our biology. Our two eyes, spaced apart on our head as they are, create a wider periphery. We can see more horizontally than vertically without moving our heads. A square screen, large enough to be absorbingly “cinematic,” would have us literally moving our heads up and down continually in order to take in the visual information it displayed. The ergonomics of wide screens are obviously superior. The visual economy of the rectangle works its way inward, from the edges of the form to its contents. As many a web designer will lament, another day, another rectangle. But it’s worth pointing out that the complaint would be the same and certainly louder, if it were another day, another square. Symmetry of form is beautiful, but it isn’t always functional.
</p>
<p>
Symmetry of system, on the other hand, can be extremely efficient, even when it doesn’t correspond to nature. Because a square is perfectly symmetrical, it can be duplicated into infinity, creating a reliably consistent structure — a grid — in all directions. Grids help us to work within and upon nature, even when within nature no grids can be found.
</p>
<p>
As a child — and to this day — I was fascinated by maps and pages of text and easily transfixed by them. I often find myself drawn to pages and screens, for instance, not by their contents but by their form. By how the information is arranged. As a child, I didn’t realize that what I was actually looking at was <i>the grid</i>. The form of the page became a puzzle; I was in search of the system beneath it. The grid becomes another riddle for the eye. Most things we make we do so upon a grid, though the precision of their form can never match the abstract system beneath them. There’s a tension in that, one which provides endless provocation to anyone who looks.
</p>
<p>
Ellsworth Kelly understood that. He created an <a href="https://ellsworthkelly.org/work/the-boston-panels-the-john-j-moakley-federal-courthouse-boston/" target="_blank">installation in Boston</a> which is an ideal illustration of the tension between the perfect symmetry and eternality of the abstract and the asymmetry and limits of nature. Within a large, open column of space within the John J. Moakley Federal Courthouse building, Kelly hung a set of colored panels. From a mezzanine, you can look out and up into the column to a point at which the arc’ed ceiling above you cuts off your view, creating the illusion that the grid of shapes goes on and up forever. When you stand in front of it, you can easily imagine them encircling you, too. It’s as if <i>The Boston Panels</i> were as close as Kelly could get to merging our world with The Platonic Realm.
</p>

<p>
It’s not lost on me that this has been more about forms that are <i>not</i> squares than those that are. For me, …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="s1-context"><a href="#s1-context">Context</a></h2>

<p>I think it's important to have a sense of where Common Lisp came from and what
kind of a language it is before you start learning it.  There are some things
that will seem very strange if you're coming straight from modern languages,
but will make more sense if you've got a bit of background context.</p>

<h3 id="s2-history"><a href="#s2-history">History</a></h3>

<p>Common Lisp has a long, deep history.  I'm not going to try to cover it all here
— if you're interested you should check out some of the following (in roughly
increasing order of detail):</p>

<ul>
<li>Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)#History">History of Lisp</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp#History">History of Common Lisp</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>I realize you probably won't want to read all of the links above immediately, so
here's a whirlwind tour of sixty years of Lisp.</p>

<p>Lisp began in the late 1950's.  It was invented by John McCarthy at MIT.</p>

<p>Over the next twenty or so years various versions and dialects of Lisp grew and
flourished.  Some of the more notable dialects were Maclisp, BBN Lisp/Interlisp,
Franz Lisp, Spice Lisp, and Lisp Machine Lisp.  There were others too.  The
point is that there were a <em>lot</em> of different implementations, all growing,
changing, and trying out different things.</p>

<p>(Scheme also originated in this time frame, but took a very different route and
diverged from the path we're looking at.  I won't cover Scheme in this post.)</p>

<p>In the early 1980s people decided that having a whole slew of
mutually-incompatible dialects of Lisp might be not be ideal.  An effort was
made to take these different languages that had grown organically and produce
one common language that would satisfy the needs of everyone (or at least
a reasonable subset of "everyone").  In 1984 the first edition of Guy Steele's
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html">Common Lisp: the Language</a> was published.</p>

<p>If you do some math you'll see that at the time the book was published Lisp had
around twenty-five years of real-world use, experimentation, experience, and
history to draw upon.  Even so, the book alone didn't quite satisfy everyone and
in 1986 a committee (X3J13) was formed to produce an ANSI specification for
Common Lisp.</p>

<p>While the committee worked on the standardization process, in 1990 the second
edition of Common Lisp: the Language was published.  This was more
comprehensive and contained some of the things the committee was working on
(see the comp.lang.lisp FAQ linked above for more on this).  At this point the
Lisp family of languages had over thirty years of experience and history to
draw upon.  For comparison: Python (a "modern" language many people think of as
also being "kind of old") <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python#Early_history">was released</a> for the first time the
following year.</p>

<p>In 1992 the X3J13 committee published the first draft of the new Common Lisp
ANSI standard for public review (see Pitman's paper).  The draft was approved in
1994 and the approved specification was finally published in 1995.  At this
point Lisp was over thirty-five years old.  The first version of Ruby <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)#First_publication">was
released</a> in December of that year.</p>

<p>That's the end of the history lesson.  There has not been another revision of
the ANSI specification of Common Lisp.  The version published in 1995 is the one
that is still used today — if you see something calling itself "an
implementation of Common Lisp" today, that is the specification it's referring
to.</p>

<h3 id="s3-consequences"><a href="#s3-consequences">Consequences</a></h3>

<p>I wanted to give you a quick overview of the history of Common Lisp because I
want you to know what you're getting yourself into.  I want you to realize that
Common Lisp is a stable, large, practical, extensible, ugly language.
Understanding these characteristics will make a lot of things make more sense
as you learn the language, and I want to talk a little bit more about each of
them before I start offering recommendations.</p>

<h4 id="s4-escaping-the-hamster-wheel-of-backwards-incompatibility"><a href="#s4-escaping-the-hamster-wheel-of-backwards-incompatibility">Escaping the Hamster Wheel of Backwards Incompatibility</a></h4>

<p>If you're coming from other languages, you're probably used to things breaking
when you "upgrade" your language implementation and/or libraries.  If you want
to run Ruby code you wrote ten years ago on the latest version of Ruby, it's
probably going to take some effort to update it.  My current day job is in Scala,
and if a library's last activity is more than 2 or 3 years old on Github I just
assume it won't work without a significant amount of screwing around on my part.
The Hamster Wheel of Backwards Incompatibility we deal with every day is a fact
of life in most modern languages, though some are certainly better than others.</p>

<p>If you learn Common Lisp, this is usually not the case.  In the next section of
this post I'll be recommending a book written in 1990.  You can run its code,
unchanged, in a Common Lisp implementation released last month.  After years of
jogging on the Hamster Wheel of Backwards Incompatibility I cannot tell you how
much of a <em>relief</em> it is to be able to write code and reasonably expect it to
still work in twenty years.</p>

<p>Of course, this is only the case for the language itself — if you depend on any
libraries there's always the chance they might break when you update them.  But
I've found the stability of the core language is contagious, and overall the
Common Lisp community seems fairly good about maintaining backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p>I'll be honest though: there are exceptions.  As you learn the language and
start using libraries you'll start noticing some library authors who don't
bother to document and preserve stable APIs for their libraries, and if
staying off the Hamster Wheel is important to you you'll learn to avoid relying
on code written by those people as much as possible.</p>

<h4 id="s5-practicality-begets-purity"><a href="#s5-practicality-begets-purity">Practicality Begets Purity</a></h4>

<p>Another thing to understand about Common Lisp is that it's a large, practical
language.  The second edition of Common Lisp: the Language (usually abbreviated
as "CLtL2" by Common Lisp programmers) is 971 pages long, not including the
preface, references, or index.  You can get a surprising amount done by writing
pure Common Lisp without much extra support.</p>

<p>When programming applications in Common Lisp people will often depend on
a small(ish) number of stable libraries, and library writers often try to
minimize dependencies by utilizing as much of the core language as possible.
I try to stick to fewer than ten or so dependencies for my applications and no
more than two or three for my libraries (preferably zero, if possible), but I'm
probably a bit more conservative than most folks.  I <em>really</em> don't like the
Hamster Wheel.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that since Common Lisp has been around and stable for so
long, it has <em>libraries</em> older and more stable than many programming languages.
For example: Bordeaux Threads (the de-facto threading library for Common Lisp)
was first proposed in 2004 and released soon after (2006 at the latest but
possibly earlier, it's hard to tell because so many links are dead now), which
makes it about fourteen years old.  So yes, threading is handled by a library,
but I'm not worried about it breaking my code in the next decade or two.</p>

<p>My advice is this: as you learn Common Lisp and look for libraries, try to
suppress the voice in the back of your head that says "This project was last
updated six years ago?  That's probably abandoned and broken."  The stability of
Common Lisp means that sometimes libraries can just be <em>done</em>, not <em>abandoned</em>,
so don't dismiss them out of hand.</p>

<h4 id="s6-extensibility"><a href="#s6-extensibility">Extensibility</a></h4>

<p>Part of Common Lisp's practicality comes from its extensibility.  No one has
been clamoring for a new version of the specification that adds features
because Common Lisp's extensibility allows users to add new features to the
language as plain old libraries, without having to alter the core language.
Macros are what might come to mind when you hear "Lisp extensibility", and of
course that's part of it.  Macros allow users to write libraries that would
need to be core language features in other languages.</p>

<p>Common Lisp doesn't include string interpolation.  You want it?  No problem, you
don't have to wait for <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/string-interpolation.html">Scala
2.10</a> or
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/">Python 3.6</a>, just <a href="https://edicl.github.io/cl-interpol/">use
a library</a>.</p>

<p>Want to try some nondeterministic programming without any boilerplate?  <a href="https://nikodemus.github.io/screamer/">Grab
a library</a>.</p>

<p>Pattern matching syntax can make for some really beautiful, readable code.
Common Lisp doesn't include it, but of course <a href="https://github.com/guicho271828/trivia/wiki/What-is-pattern-matching%3F-Benefits%3F">there's a library</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoying algebraic data types in Haskell or Scala?  Here's your
<a href="https://github.com/tarballs-are-good/cl-algebraic-data-type">library</a>.</p>

<p>All of these libraries rely on macros to make using them feel seamless.  Of
course you could <em>do</em> all of that without macros, but you've have to add a layer
of boilerplate to manage evaluation.  This:</p>

  '(list x y z) (lambda (x y z) (+ x y z))
  '(vector x y) (lambda …</code></pre></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Streaming SQL</strong> is about taking the same declarative SQL used to write database queries, and instead <strong>running it on streams of fast-changing data</strong>.</p>
<p>This is useful because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data is often more valuable when you can act on it quickly</li>
<li>The existing tools for deriving real-time insights from streams are too complex.</li>
</ol>
<p>The “declarative” nature of SQL plays an important role in addressing the second point because it allows the user to focus on <strong>WHAT</strong> they want, and lets the underlying engine worry about <strong>HOW</strong> it gets done.</p>
<p>In the real world, Streaming SQL is used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable new internal and customer-facing insights, automation, and applications</li>
<li>Increase value of business intelligence data by providing a single up-to-date source of truth for key metrics</li>
<li>Simplify microservices by replacing code doing data coordination and transformation</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is streaming SQL?</h2>
<p>Let’s start by being specific about what we mean when we say <strong>streaming</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>.</p>
<h3>Streaming (event streams)</h3>
<p>Streaming refers to message brokers like Kafka, Kinesis, or Pulsar that handle data as a <strong>continuous stream of events or messages</strong>.</p>
<p>Event streams handle everything from transactions to user actions on sites or mobile apps, IoT sensor data, metrics from servers, even activity on traditional databases via <a href="https://materialize.com/change-data-capture-part-1/">change data capture</a>.</p>
<h3>SQL</h3>
<p>In the context of streams, SQL gives users a declarative language for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating <strong>views</strong> that join, filter, and group the raw data from the stream into more useful outputs (<a href="https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-materialized-view/"><code>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW</code></a>)</li>
<li>Selecting data from sources and views (<a href="https://materialize.com/docs/sql/select/"><code>SELECT</code></a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> The CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW command is the core concept in streaming SQL. It comes from <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/sql-creatematerializedview.html">databases</a>, where it’s used to precompute the VIEW ahead of time in case the data changes. In streaming, the data is changing all the time, so queries are often more useful when maintained as materialized views.
</p>
<p>Other common SQL verbs like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE have roles in streaming SQL, but for this article we’ll focus on the core concepts of <strong>reading</strong> from streams, joining/filtering/transforming these streams, and making their outputs queryable or <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-sink/">writing out to a new stream</a>.</p>
<h3>Differences between SQL on streams and databases</h3>
<p>A soon as you try using SQL on streams, a few key differences become apparent:</p>
<h4>Point-in-time vs continuous queries</h4>
<p>Running a SQL query on a traditional database returns a static set of results from a single point in time.</p>
<p>Take this query:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT SUM(amount) as total_amount FROM invoices;
</code></pre>
<p>When you run it, the database engine scans all invoices that existed <em>at the time of</em> the query and returns the sum of their amounts.</p>
<p>With streaming SQL, you <em>could</em> run the exact query above and get a point-in-time answer. But you’re querying a stream of fast-changing data, and as soon as you’ve gotten the results back they’re probably out-dated. In many cases a <strong>query that continually updates itself</strong> (a materialized view) is much more useful in a few ways we’ll describe below.</p>
<p>To turn the query above into a materialized view, you’d write:</p>
<pre><code>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW invoice_summary AS
  SELECT SUM(amount) as total_amount FROM invoices;
</code></pre>
<p>When you first create it, the SQL engine will process the entire history of invoice events it has access to up to the present, <strong><em>and then continue to update as new invoice events come through.</em></strong></p>
<h4>Response time vs lag</h4>
<p>Traditional databases have the concept of query response times: you run a query, some time elapses while the engine computes the results, and you get the response.</p>
<p>In streams the initial response time is only a factor when you first materialize a view. But there has to be some kind of time penalty in streaming results if we get a sudden surge of input events. That penalty is <strong>time lag</strong>: <em>by how much time is the output trailing the input?</em></p>
<p>Like response times in traditional databases, most end-users won’t need to think about time-lag in streaming systems, but knowing it exists helps to write and use streaming SQL in ways that avoid issues.</p>
<h4>Different actions create work for the underlying engine</h4>
<p>On the READ side, a traditional database engine idles until it receives a query, then it plans and optimizes it and gets to work providing the results. Once it responds with the results it idles again until it gets another query.  <strong>The sending of queries is what creates work for the engine.</strong></p>
<p>If you go back to the materialized view from above, <strong>new data from the stream creates the work</strong> for the engine. In Materialize, this approach is made possible by incremental computation: the work done to update the view is proportionate to the data coming in not the complexity of the query. We don’t need to do a full re-scan of data to update the results.</p>
<p>This paradigm shift makes streaming SQL best for queries that ask the same question over and over again (e.g. dashboards, reports, automation, most application code) and not ad-hoc queries.</p>
<h2>Why is streaming SQL useful?</h2>
<h3>1. Data is often most valuable when it first appears</h3>
<p>There are two reasons for this, one obvious and one less so:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Faster data = faster decisions</strong> — The stock market is a clear example of this idea taken to an extreme. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11527560/108846387-81f3df00-75ac-11eb-8caa-f293b48bf54c.png" data-src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11527560/108846387-81f3df00-75ac-11eb-8caa-f293b48bf54c.png" alt="Chart showing higher value for newer data"> But it also applies to SaaS businesses, verticals like Marketplaces, Travel, Events that need to make fast decisions about rates and inventory, retail and logistics where faster decisions can reduce inefficiency, etc…
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data closer to its origin has fewer opportunities to be misinterpreted</strong> — Every step that data takes between where it’s created and where it’s used adds more potential for errors of the type where the end-user (person or machine) thinks the data represents something it does not. Time plays a role in this by forcing coordination around order of operations and alignment of work. In this case, switching to streaming data isn’t better because it’s faster, it’s better because you no longer have to think about timing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. SQL is a great means of deriving insights from streaming data</h3>
<p>Here is another example of a materialized view on streaming events:</p>
<pre><code>  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW experiments AS
   SELECT
     experiment_views.name,
     experiment_views.variant,
     COUNT(DISTINCT(experiment_views.user_id)) as unique_users,
     COUNT(DISTINCT(conversions.user_id)) as unique_conversions
   FROM experiment_views
   LEFT JOIN conversions ON
     conversions.user_id = experiment_views.user_id 
     AND conversions.created_at &gt; experiment_views.created_at
   GROUP BY experiment_views.name, experiment_views.variant;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>The SQL is not unique to streaming</strong> — The meaning of data doesn’t change when it moves from a stream to a database, so the way we query it shouldn’t change either.</li>
<li><strong>The declarative nature of it increases productivity</strong> — There are little or no optimization decisions for the developer to make, especially in comparison to the same task in code.</li>
</ul>
<p>SQL has the added benefit of being a mature language built over three decades with an ecosystem of tooling and education around it. This means a much larger group of developers can work with streaming data and easily integrate it into the rest of their stack.</p>
<h2>Example use cases for Streaming SQL</h2>
<p>Today, anyone already working with a message broker like Kafka can start using streaming SQL without significant effort. In the future as CDC software matures, that criteria will expand to “anyone with a database.” Here are some examples of how streaming SQL is used:</p>
<h3>Business Intelligence and Analytics</h3>
<p>When deciding “what is the best way to empower our internal teams to make intelligent decisions from data”, Streaming SQL is one option to consider, with trade-offs that make it better for some cases than others.</p>
<p>In many cases, a materialized view on primary source data done in streaming SQL is a simpler <a href="https://nchammas.com/writing/data-pipeline-materialized-view">data pipeline</a>. In addition to the benefit of real-time data, businesses use this approach to side-step issues of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coordination of time intervals and order of operations in batch processing</li>
<li>Extended outages caused by bugs that are not fixable or testable until next batch run</li>
<li>Slow-loading dashboards</li>
<li>Inconsistency issues caused by caching, denormalization</li>
</ul>
<p>See this walkthrough on <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/demos/business-intelligence/">streaming SQL to a business intelligence dashboard</a> with Materialize for an example.</p>
<h3>Microservices</h3>
<p>Streaming SQL is used to replace code doing complex data coordination and transformation in microservices.</p>
<p>An event stream like kafka is typically already a first-class citizen in microservice architectures. Engineers often find themselves building and maintaining complex applications consuming from kafka. For example: applications that read from an event log to produce insights and measurements on API usage for a SaaS application.</p>
<p>Any component of a microservice that looks like a query might be replaceable with streaming SQL.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/demos/microservice/">Streaming SQL on Microservices example</a> walks through a working demo using Materialize to produce billing data based on product events from a stream.</p>
<h3>Real-Time Applications</h3>
<p>If the value of your application depends on your ability to deliver updates and data in real time, Streaming SQL may be an alternative to building an expensive or complex multi-component stack.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://materialize.com/a-simple-and-efficient-real-time-application-powered-by-materializes-tail-command/">a simple and efficient real-time application</a> post for an example.</p>
<h3>New capabilities</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>User-facing real-time analytics</strong> – Previously, only tech behemoths like LinkedIn and Google had the scale and engineering teams to build user-facing real-time analytics (like LinkedIn’s “Who has viewed your profile” page or Google Analytics’ Real-time dashboard.) By lowering the complexity, streaming SQL opens magical real-time user analytics features up to more companies.</li>
<li><strong>Business Automation</strong> – Once you have streaming SQL powering real-time dashboards, a natural progression is to begin making automated decisions on the same data. (For example: If your e-commerce site gets a spike in traffic from a particular source, add a promotion to the homepage.)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Materialize provides a streaming SQL implementation that’s unique in two important ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Materialize, you write queries in postgres-compatible SQL. <em>We think it’s worth going through the …</em></li></ol></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My journey at Orbit started with this funny tweet by Josh.</p><p>I wasn't looking for a new job but his tweet caught my attention.</p><p>The mission of Orbit, right there on the careers page, made me curious to learn more about the company. Building thriving communities and developer tools was very much aligned with my past career path and current interests. That ultimately led me to join the team.</p><h2>My background</h2><p>I started my career as a self-taught software developer who didn’t own a computer. I worked from a cybercafé in a small African country with a very bad internet connexion. I quickly gained plenty of technical experience and contributed to products used by millions of people across the world. I even wrote <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/learning-bootstrap/9781782161844">a technical book</a> and had <a href="https://www.flyerco.com/">a small startup exit</a>! I attribute a large part of that growth to being involved in gaming and developer communities where I made friends, met mentors, and found clients.</p><p>After about ten years of basically 100% online life, I spent the past five building up the tech community in my country of origin, Benin, by serving as vice-president and CTO of <a href="https://etrilabs.com/">the leading tech innovation hub</a>, and co-founding <a href="http://www.tekxl.com/">a small product studio</a> over there. It was awesome contributing to projects with real-world impact on tens of thousands of people. Over time, my involvement decreased as we were able to build a talented team that could continue moving the mission forward.</p><p>So, when COVID hit, I knew the next step of my professional career was due, and it was about the online-first life again. I spent the best part of 2020 helping <a href="https://irawotalents.com/">Irawo</a>, a community of more than 50.000 talents and creators in francophone Africa, launch new programs and develop a sustainable business model.</p><h2>Meeting Orbit</h2><p>When I saw Orbit's homepage and model, something clicked. The <a href="https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model">Orbit Model</a> was in line with my own experience of contributing and growing communities. I’d also long dreamed of building a CRM-like solution that’s centered around each customer’s experience as an individual. I think the Orbit Model captures the multi-dimensional aspect of how people interact in a community, or with organization products or services. It’s a refreshing break from the linear view of traditional sales and marketing funnels.</p><p>Needless to say, I was drawn to Orbit and decided to email the founders right away. I wasn’t looking for a full-time job, but they were looking for part-time consultants to help with integrations and other stuff.</p><p>Josh, the co-founder and CTO, replied a couple of days later, and, about a week after my email, we were on a call. The call was awesome! That’s when I knew I wanted to join the team instead of just contributing some integrations. Talking with Josh sold me on the vision. It also helped that the team was great at execution. They had made enormous progress in terms of traction and product development. And they were backed by some of the top VCs in Silicon Valley.</p><p>The opportunity to join this rocket ship about to take off was amazing. For me, this is the ideal time to join a startup in its growth trajectory, and I am very confident that Orbit is going to grow even faster and be successful. It was the best learning opportunity I could have at this step of my career.</p><h2>The Interviews</h2><p>After the call with Josh, he introduced me to Nicolas, who is a software engineer and the first non-founder team member. We scheduled a technical interview for the next day. It was not your typical algorithmic coding interview. It was a pair programming session where we worked together on actual production code to implement a new fun feature in the product. We had a great time together! Nicolas was happy to have another French-speaking programmer in the team so we spoke French. I learned a lot about the team culture, how technical decisions are made, etc. I could get a taste of what it would be like to work together.</p><p>After the interview with Nicolas, I went into my last interview with Patrick, 100% convinced Orbit was the next step in my journey. Patrick is the other co-founder and CEO of Orbit. He's a very high-energy guy. We talked about the company vision and the plans for the next months. I could feel his enthusiasm and how he was dedicated to reaching the goals. After our chat, he told me right away that I would receive an offer in the next few days. The offer came a couple of days later and, after a short negotiation, I signed it. It took less than a week from the first call to signing the offer, and I was starting the next Monday!</p><h2>The First Days</h2><p>Onboarding remote employees can be difficult but, for a young company, Orbit onboarding is pretty solid. A few days before I started, Josh had shared access to all the communication and collaboration tools: Miro, Slack, GitHub, Airtable, Trello, and more. I went through basically everything and learned so much about the company, what product and strategic decisions were made in the past, why they had been made, most major events, the company values, the processes, and many more key points.</p><p>Being an early riser, I was even able to submit a small pull request before anyone in the Paris or San Francisco timezone was up on the first day! I got a handful of pull requests merged in my first week overall. This is how fast a team member can onboard when there are great asynchronous communication processes in place. It was like someone had onboarded me on the basics before actually talking with anyone in person. The calls with team members on the next few days were mostly around getting to know each other and getting help on my tasks.</p><h2>The Hard Parts</h2><p>The technical aspects of my new role are going very smoothly, and I haven’t had any difficulties with them so far. The hard parts were mostly around some emotional aspects of stepping into new shoes. Working with Orbit is my first full-time role not being in a founder or executive position, so it came with its challenges. Around the middle of the month, I was hit by a bunch of insecurities and, for 2-3 days, I wasn’t as productive as I would have loved. Would I be able to adjust to a different culture? Would I be able to perform at my full potential? Would my integration into the team go smoothly? Would I be given the kind of responsibilities I’m looking for?</p><p>I think it’s normal to have such interrogations when joining a new role. They would differ from one person to another, but they are frequently addressed with good communication with other team members, and some amount of self-reflection. The team has been handling the communication aspect very well so far. I have 1:1s with Josh every two weeks where I’m able to openly discuss all I have in mind. It also helped that Josh, Nicolas, and I were able to meet in person once for lunch.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, my first month at Orbit has been an awesome experience. The team is made of caring and driven people with great product and business chops. I learned a lot in just a few weeks and I look forward to learning, growing and contributing more over the next months.</p><p>We're looking for more awesome people to join the Orbit team! <a href="https://orbit.love/careers/">See our open positions.</a></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                  <p>Hummingbard is an experiment in building communities on top of <a href="https://matrix.org/" rel="nofollow">Matrix</a>. Hummingbard has social elements like user profiles, posts, communities, sharing and so on. It is intended to be more than just a decentralized link aggregator or a microblogging platform.</p>

<h3>Spaces</h3>

<p>The main centre of interest in Hummingbard is a space, which is an ordinary <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/kegan/spaces-summary/proposals/2946-spaces-summary.md" rel="nofollow">Matrix space</a>. A space is similar to a forum board, subreddit or an FB group. The posts in a space are ordinary Matrix events, with additional metadata for rendering social-like posts. Posts can include images, attachments and links. This should be extendable to add polls, reviews etc. in the future. Hummingbard posts can be blog posts too, like <em>this one youâ€™re reading right now</em>.</p>

<p>Spaces can be rendered in various ways, which makes it possible to use them as user profiles like <a href="https://hummingbard.com/@david" rel="nofollow">@david</a>, or communities like <a href="https://hummingbard.com/art" rel="nofollow">art</a>. Spaces can be arbitrarily nested, allowing sub-spaces like <a href="https://hummingbard.com/music/classical" rel="nofollow">music/classical</a> or <a href="https://hummingbard.com/music/jazz/fusion" rel="nofollow">music/jazz/fusion</a>. Spaces can also have sub-spaces that render as wiki pages like <a href="https://hummingbard.com/hummingbard/about" rel="nofollow">hummingbard/about</a>.</p>

<p>It is possible to have different types of spaces. A gallery type renders a space in Instagram-like fashion, like the <a href="https://hummingbard.com/pics" rel="nofollow">pics</a> space. Any type of space can be nested under any other type of space. This allows normal boards to have sub-spaces which are galleries, or vice versa. In the future, a space could be rendered to be a business page, and e-commerce page etc.</p>

<p>Hummingbard spaces are very limited in options right now, but basic info like title, description, header-image can be changed. Spaces support custom CSS too.</p>

<h3>Social</h3>

<p>Hummingbard has very basic social-like features. Users can follow other users and join spaces. A user feed shows posts chronologically. Posts can be shared from one user/community to another user/community. Posts can be replied to. Replies can be nested like in this <a href="https://hummingbard.com/test/$kXWe3pG7N53PIWl33KnW_zA0GYGTRDWy2d5jj6rE0G8" rel="nofollow">thread</a>.</p>

<h3>Federation</h3>

<p>Hummingbard works with federated Matrix servers too. Users can create Matrix accounts on remote servers, or log in with an existing account. Logging in with an existing account creates a user profile automatically, unless one already exists. Hummingbard spaces on federated servers work just the same as local spaces. Here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://hummingbard.com/rhythm:matrix.org" rel="nofollow">rhythm:matrix.org</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://hummingbard.com/food:tchncs.de" rel="nofollow">food:tchncs.de</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://hummingbard.com/ask:matrix.org" rel="nofollow">ask:matrix.org</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://hummingbard.com/@ahq:matrix.org" rel="nofollow">ahq:matrix.org</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Federated spaces can also have nested spaces like <a href="https://hummingbard.com/ebooks:matrix.org/fantasy" rel="nofollow">ebooks:matrix.org/fantasy</a> or pages <a href="https://hummingbard.com/rhythm:matrix.org/about" rel="nofollow">rhythm:matrix.org/about</a>.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, owners of Matrix servers would be hosting their own instance of Hummingbard, instead of going through one popular instance.</p>

<h3>Dendrite</h3>

<p>Hummingbard is dependent on <a href="https://github.com/hummingbard/dendrite/tree/thread_pagination" rel="nofollow">Dendrite</a>, the second-generation Matrix homeserver written in Go. Features like spaces and threading have only been implemented on Dendrite. Note that it is a forked repo with a temporary patch for paginating threads.</p>

<h3>Code</h3>

<p>Hummingbardâ€™s code will be available as soon as I am able to decide which license works best for us.</p>

<h3>Whatâ€™s Coming</h3>

<p>Hummingbard is very bare-bones at the moment. Iâ€™m actively working on the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Private spaces</p></li>

<li><p>Power levels for admins/mods</p></li>

<li><p>Dark mode and various UI changes</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from that, Hummingbard has a lot of bugs, and will likely crash randomly. If you do want to check out the site, either create a local Hummingbard account, or use an existing throwaway Matrix account. Iâ€™d advice against using your main Matrix account, as the authentication code may have bugs. Please try to avoid any rooms that are too large. My tiny VPS running dendrite will not be able to handle it.</p>

<h3>Contact/Feedback</h3>

<p>Weâ€™re using <a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23hummingbard:matrix.org" rel="nofollow">#hummingbard:matrix.org</a> as a meeting place to discuss Hummingbard development. You can also leave bug reports on a Hummingbard space itself - <a href="https://hummingbard.com/hummingbard/bugs" rel="nofollow">hummingbard/bugs</a></p>

<p>Lastly, if youâ€™d like to leave a reply on this blog post itself, you can log into Hummingbard with an existing Matrix account, join the <a href="https://hummingbard.com/hummingbard" rel="nofollow">hummingbard</a> space, and come back here to write your reply.</p>

<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong>: If this post has a typo, I wonâ€™t be able to fix it because Hummingbard has not implemented editing posts yet.</p>

<p><strong>PPS</strong>: Thanks to <a href="https://hummingbard.com/@david" rel="nofollow">@david</a> for reviewing this post.</p>

<p>
  Cosmopolitan makes C a build-once run-anywhere language, similar to
  Java, except it doesn't require interpreters or virtual machines be
  installed beforehand. Cosmo provides the same portability benefits as
  high-level languages like Go and Rust, but it doesn't invent a new
  language and you won't need to configure a CI system to build separate
  binaries for each operating system. What Cosmopolitan focuses on is
  fixing C by decoupling it from platforms, so it can be pleasant to use
  for writing small unix programs that are easily distributed to a much
  broader audience.

</p><h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>
  Assuming you have GCC on Linux, then all you need are the five
  additional files which are linked below:

</p><pre><span># create simple c program on command line</span>
printf %s <span>'
  main() {
    printf("hello world\n");
  }
'</span> &gt;hello.c

<span># run gcc compiler in freestanding mode</span>
gcc -g -O -static -fno-pie -no-pie -mno-red-zone -nostdlib -nostdinc \
  -o hello.com.dbg hello.c -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,-z,max-page-size=0x1000 -fuse-ld=bfd \
  -Wl,-T,<a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/ape.lds">ape.lds</a> -include <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.h">cosmopolitan.h</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/crt.o">crt.o</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/ape.o">ape.o</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.a">cosmopolitan.a</a>
objcopy -SO binary hello.com.dbg hello.com

<span># ~40kb static binary (can be ~16kb w/ MODE=tiny)</span>
./hello.com
</pre>

<p>
  The above command fixes GCC so it outputs portable binaries that will
  run on every Linux distro in addition to Mac OS X, Windows NT,
  FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD too. For details on how this works,
  please read the <a title="Actually Portable Executable" aria-label="Actually Portable Executable" href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">αcτµαlly
  pδrταblε εxεcµταblε</a> blog post. This novel binary format is also
  optional, since <code>hello.com.dbg</code> is executable too, only on
  your local system since it's an ELF binary.

</p><p>
  Your program will also boot on bare metal too. In other words, you've
  written a normal textbook C program, and thanks to Cosmopolitan's
  low-level linker magic, you've effectively created your own operating
  system which happens to run on all the existing ones as well. Now
  that's something no one's done before.

</p><h3>Mailing List</h3>

<p>
  Please join
  the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/cosmopolitan-libc">Cosmopolitan
  Cosmonauts</a> Google Group!

</p><h3>Performance</h3>

<p>
  Cosmopolitan has been optimized by hand for excellent performance on
  modern desktops and servers. Compared with glibc, you should expect
  Cosmopolitan to be almost as fast, but with an order of a magnitude
  tinier code size. Compared with Musl or Newlib, you can expect that
  Cosmopolitan will generally go much faster, while having roughly the
  same code size, if not tinier.

</p><p>
  In the case of the most important libc function, memcpy(),
  Cosmopolitan outperformed every other open source library tested. The
  chart below shows how quickly memory is transferred depending on the
  size of the copy. Since it's log scale, each grid square represents a
  2x difference in performance. What makes Cosmopolitan so fast here is
  it uses uses several different memory copying strategies. For small
  sizes it uses an indirect branch with overlapping moves; for medium
  sizes it uses simd vectors, and for large copies it uses nontemporal
  hints which prevent cache thrash. Other libraries usually fall short
  because they use a one-size-fits-all strategy. For example, Newlib
  goes 10x slower for the optimal block size (half L1 cache) because it
  always does nontemporal moves.

</p><p>
  <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/memcpy.png">
    <img width="960" height="540" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/justine/cosmopolitan/memcpy.png" alt="memcpy() performance for varying n values"></a>

</p><h3>Trickle-Down Performance</h3>

<p>
  Performing the best on benchmarks isn't enough. Cosmopolitan also uses
  a second technique that the above benchmark doesn't measure, which we
  call "trickle-down performance". For an example of how that works,
  consider the following common fact about C which is often overlooked.
  External function calls such as the following:

</p><pre>memcpy(foo, bar, n);
</pre>

<p>
  Are roughly equivalent to the following assembly, which leads
  compilers to assume that most cpu state is clobbered:

</p><pre><span>asm volatile</span>(<span>"call memcpy"</span>
             : <span>"=a"</span>(rax), <span>"=D"</span>(rdi), <span>"=S"</span>(rsi), <span>"=d"</span>(rdx)
             : <span>"1"</span>(foo), <span>"2"</span>(bar), <span>"3"</span>(n)
             : <span>"rcx"</span>, <span>"r8"</span>, <span>"r9"</span>, <span>"r10"</span>, <span>"r11"</span>, <span>"memory"</span>, <span>"cc"</span>,
               <span>"xmm0"</span>, <span>"xmm1"</span>, <span>"xmm2"</span>, <span>"xmm3"</span>, <span>"xmm4"</span>, <span>"xmm5"</span>, <span>"xmm6"</span>);
</pre>

<p>
  In other words the compiler assumes that, in calling the function,
  fifteen separate registers and all memory will be overwritten. See
  the <a href="https://www.uclibc.org/docs/psABI-x86_64.pdf">System V
  ABI</a> for further details. This can be problematic for
  frequently-called functions such as memcpy, since it inhibits many
  optimizations and it tosses a wrench in the compiler register
  allocation algorithm, thus causing stack spillage which further
  degrades performance while bloating the output binary size.

</p><p>
  So what Cosmopolitan does for memcpy() and many other
  frequently-called core library leaf functions, is defining a simple
  macro wrapper, which tells the compiler the correct subset of the abi
  that's actually needed, e.g.

</p><pre><span>#define</span> memcpy(DEST, SRC, N) ({       \
  void *Dest = (DEST);                \
  void *Src = (SRC);                  \
  size_t Size = (N);                  \
  <span>asm</span>(<span>"call memcpy"</span>                   \
      : <span>"=m"</span>(*(<span>char</span>(*)[Size])(Dest))  \
      : <span>"D"</span>(Dest), <span>"S"</span>(Src), <span>"d"</span>(n),  \
        <span>"m"</span>(*(<span>char</span>(*)[Size])(Src))    \
      : <span>"rcx"</span>, <span>"xmm3"</span>, <span>"xmm4"</span>, <span>"cc"</span>); \
    Dest;                             \
  })
</pre>

<p>
  What this means, is that Cosmopolitan memcpy() is not simply fast, it
  also makes unrelated code in the functions that call it faster too as
  a side-effect. When this technique was first implemented for memcpy()
  alone, many of the functions in the Cosmopolitan codebase had their
  generated code size reduced by a third.

</p><p>
  For an example of one such function, consider <code>strlcpy</code>,
  which is the BSD way of saying <code>strcpy</code>:

</p><pre><span>/**
 * Copies string, the BSD way.
 *
 * <span>@param</span> d is buffer which needn't be initialized
 * <span>@param</span> s is a NUL-terminated string
 * <span>@param</span> n is byte capacity of d
 * <span>@return</span> strlen(s)
 * <span>@note</span> d and s can't overlap
 * <span>@note</span> we prefer memccpy()
 */</span>
<span>size_t</span> strlcpy(<span>char</span> *d, <span>const</span> <span>char</span> *s, <span>size_t</span> n) {
  <span>size_t</span> slen, actual;
  slen = strlen(s);
  if (n) {
    actual = MIN(n - 1, slen);
    memcpy(d, s, actual);
    d[actual] = <span>'\0'</span>;
  }
  <span>return</span> slen;
}
</pre>

<p>
  If we compile our <code>strlcpy</code> function, then here's the
  assembly code that the compiler outputs:

</p><table><tbody><tr><td>

</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>
  That's a huge improvement in generated code size. The above two
  compiles used the same gcc flags and no changes to the code needed to
  be made. All that changed was we used cosmopolitan.h (instead of the
  platform c library string.h) which contains ABI specialization macros
  for <code>memcpy</code> and <code>strlen</code>. It's a great example
  of how merely choosing a better C library can systemically eliminate
  bloat throughout your entire codebase.

In the end, the organization of the state’s power resources and grid, rather than the merits of any particular energy source, seem to bear the majority of responsibility.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zlayEqnt73ZL31G0fANICz68V9RNU7F1H6CUHpIeoRDlCiv3bOVqUZtJi22V2tO8LcFV5VPRBAyoIrluEeEtyYXLm0JvXwbiqTtwghCq4PvfE5sie3J0k-D9cgSSXEq7HZqs6Q7H" width="726" loading="lazy"></p>

<h4><strong>Was Renewable Energy Responsible?</strong></h4>
<p>The rapid transformation of a climatic crisis into a political battleground began with a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/2/17/22287469/fox-news-winter-storm-uri-windmills-ercot-greg-abbott-hannity-carlson" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>salvo of accusations</span></a> that renewable energy sources were responsible for the power grid’s collapse. Frozen wind turbines, plastered across some news sites, supposedly bore responsibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be sure, many of the wind turbines in Texas are not winterized, meaning they lack heated or protected elements that permit continued operation in freezing temperatures. As a result, some wind facilities slowed or stopped their production of electricity entirely. Critics missed, however, that wind was only expected to account for less than 10%, or <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2021/02/18/texas-power-outages-greg-abbott-dan-crenshaw-fact-check/6791469002/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>6,000 megawatts</span></a> (MW), during winter production, when Texas relies mostly on natural gas. At its lowest point, it looks like about <a href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Whos-To-Blame-For-The-Texas-Power-Crisis.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>2,000 MW</span></a> of that went offline, while up to 29,000 MW from natural gas, coal, and nuclear went missing — <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/02/what-went-wrong-texas/618104/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>a third</span></a> of ERCOT’s total production capacity. They also missed that wind’s shortfall was only intermittent, with offshore turbines causing wind generation to <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2021/02/19/texas-power-outage-energy-grid-wind-renewable-energy-greg-abbott-fact-check/4500251001/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>exceed expectations</span></a> during periods of the storm.</p>
<p>In short, the missing wind energy only accounted for a small portion of the overall missing capacity that led to Texas’s power outages. Natural gas, coal, and nuclear were to account for 80% of wintertime production and were experiencing similar or greater levels of failure. Afterwards <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2021/02/16/wind-power-isnt-to-blame-for-texas-electricity-crisis/?sh=749255ef21b3" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ERCOT noted</span></a>, for example, that “wind turbine outages have been responsible for less than 13% of Texas’ total power shortages.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>As critics used the incident to ridicule wind technology, and renewables at large, they neglected to mention that wind turbines in other parts of the world, like the <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2021/02/wind-turbines-didnt-cause-texas-energy-crisis/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>North Sea</span></a>, are designed to function at freezing temperatures and regularly do so without issue. The lack of winterization in Texas represents a choice by Texas’s energy producers, not the type of energy itself, and ERCOT was <a href="https://reason.com/2021/02/22/the-texas-blackout-blame-game/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>well aware</span></a> that only a fraction of wind capacity would be available in winter months.</p>
<div><p>This combination of factors shows that the responsibility for the bulk of Texas’s power outages, instead, lies elsewhere.</p></div>
<h4><strong>Does Blame Fall on Natural Gas, Coal, or Nuclear?</strong></h4>
<p>It’s easy to turn around and then heap blame on <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/2/20/22292926/texas-high-electric-bills-winter-storm-griddy" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>failures in thermal energy sources</span></a>, and especially natural gas, which nominally accounts for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/02/what-went-wrong-texas/618104/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>around half</span></a> of all power generation in the state. Just as frigid temperatures were negatively impacting wind turbines, they were causing major failures for natural gas, coal, and nuclear energy. Given Texas’s abundance of energy resources, natural gas is pumped up from the ground as needed, but these <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2021/02/wind-turbines-didnt-cause-texas-energy-crisis/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>pumps failed</span></a>, as did a whole range of equipment needed to keep the system moving. Likewise, coal plants saw their production capacity fall, and a nuclear reactor <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/how-and-why-a-nuclear-reactor-shut-down-in-texas-cold-snap-when-energy-was-needed-most" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>shut down entirely</span></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a sense, natural gas, as the state’s largest energy provider and experiencing the greatest <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/17/abbott-republicans-green-energy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>reduction in capacity</span></a>, bears more responsibility than any other energy source. But blaming a reliance on fossil fuels for Texas’s troubles is just as short-sighted as blaming renewable energy. During normal times, natural gas is lauded as a reliable, cheap, and abundant energy source, and it is the cornerstone of the state’s ability to supply electricity to nearly 30 million people. Shortcomings of natural gas in terms of contributions to greenhouse gas emissions are clear, as with other fossil fuels, but nothing inherent to fossil fuels made them more or less likely to fail during the record cold temperatures.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>The failure, rather, seems to be systematic and organizational, not specific to a singular energy source.</p></div>
<h4><strong>The Need for Winterization</strong></h4>
<div><p>The more likely culprit is a lack of winterization standards in Texas's power grid as a whole. Texans are well-known to value independence and freedom from regulation, so much so that their power grid is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/texas-set-stage-its-energy-crisis-more-80-years-ago-n1258341" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>disconnected from the rest of the U.S</span></a>. The laissez-faire approach has purported benefits, like lower prices, but also limitations.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UjEf_OrUCpcjv9od8SzUYcCcE2B2aDKX_Fj-SDKzkr3oqvGM4A6qwzjNgsFsqWQsqsdZSvXWJ2mdNwX4KvD9TxCFWepIbYXLWuRME2MRyDe1pWK-udM1h0YxybN26Xl_E_t-Hyka" width="576" height="288" loading="lazy"></p>
<div><p>Note: Because Texas has its own electrical grid and does not transmit power across state lines, it can avoid regulations like those from the FERC.</p></div>
<p>National bodies, like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), can only make recommendations for how the state should deal with energy issues, including winter preparedness. In the aftermath of cold temperatures in 2011 that caused similar but less severe outages, FERC undertook an investigation of what went wrong, eventually highlighting a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/02/18/state-energy-winter-protections-lacking-reports-have-suggested/4490501001/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>lack of winterization and emergency storage</span></a> in natural gas plants as the primary cause. It then provided plans for mitigation strategies to Texas energy producers.</p>
<p>Fast forward 10 years to 2021, and Texas’s energy producers can produce affidavits of winterization, but that concept doesn’t contain specific, enforceable steps at the state level as <span>they do elsewhere</span>. <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/investigations/2021/02/20/texas-tells-power-plants-to-be-winter-ready-but-it-lets-them-decide-how-to-prepare/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Without such standards</a>, “state utility regulators have issued only three fines ever related to inadequate weather planning by power generators.” This means the natural gas network once again found itself unable to cope with cold temperatures — sufficient gas couldn’t be pumped from the ground due to failing equipment, emergency above-ground reserves were scarce, and <a href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Whos-To-Blame-For-The-Texas-Power-Crisis.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>gas distribution</span></a> networks stopped working. The same goes for wind turbines, which <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/20/texas-power-grid-winterize/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>weren’t prepared</span></a> to operate in such low temperatures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Texas’s open and unregulated market, the desire to produce energy when it is in greater demand, like during the winter, when there are fewer sources of supply, is intended to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/texas-freeze-power-grid-failure-electricity-market-incentives-11613777856" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>incentivize winterization</span></a> — producers that continue operation in winter are rewarded by higher prices. Yet as energy producers sought greater profits, the extra cost of winterization precautions was deemed prohibitive, especially given the infrequency of extreme cold weather. In this way, the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/02/what-went-wrong-texas/618104/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>incentive for profit</span></a>, not something specific to any energy source, seems to be the key to the grid’s lack of preparedness.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>While there’s no guarantee that improved winterization standards would have forestalled all power outages, they would have at a minimum enabled better outcomes, with less lost capacity, shortened power outages, and probably fewer dead.</p></div>
<h4><strong>A System Meant to Benefit Texans Ended Up Hurting Them</strong></h4>
<p>Adding insult to injury, many Texans now face sky-high energy bills in the aftermath of insufficient and intermittent power, courtesy of the energy market's design. The ERCOT grid allows consumers to choose between <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/2/20/22292926/texas-high-electric-bills-winter-storm-griddy" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>variable and fixed rates</span></a> for energy consumption. A variable rate allows the cost of electricity to follow supply, while a fixed rate means customers pay the same amount regardless of how much electricity is available.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>The variable-rate system, which can lead to prices as low as <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/2021/02/20/griddy-customers-face-5000-bills-for-5-freezing-days-in-texas/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>2 cents</span></a> per kWh, gave way to unprecedented prices as supply dwindled. This led customers, including single households, to pay as much as <a href="https://theconversation.com/whats-behind-15-000-electricity-bills-in-texas-155822" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>$9 per kWh</span></a>, an arbitrary cap imposed by ERCOT. For context, the average retail cost per kWh varies by state but is generally around <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/183700/us-average-retail-electricity-price-since-1990/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>11 cents</span></a> and averaged <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>8.6 cents</span></a> in Texas in 2019, and the average home consumes just under <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3#:~:text=How%20much%20electricity%20does%20an,about%20877%20kWh%20per%20month." rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>900 kWh per month</span></a>. Had the cap not existed, customers could have paid even higher prices. Energy retailers, such as <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/2021/02/20/griddy-customers-face-5000-bills-for-5-freezing-days-in-texas/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Griddy</span></a>, warned customers that higher than normal prices were anticipated, but switching companies before the storm proved impossible for most. This led to headlines like “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/texas-army-veteran-faces-16000-bill-due-to-rocketing-energy-prices-2021-2" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Texas: Army veteran faces $16,000 bill due to rocketing energy prices</span></a>.”</p></div>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QZt0csXKhNchYumakXv3lGoYYHPaNjVvsmYUdMZUcFbKYnW-eEyGH61Ld-eduvNlf8e0AZA-lBG049GQTloiovIBzAYMlgC8xwedWkMsIodQvkctTJR_1eWvkYIhrRTMIGphwd5E" width="652" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>For some, this failure represents the duplicity of leaving a critical utility up to market forces. In seeking to protect the freedom of energy producers from federal regulation, Texas ultimately ended up <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/02/what-went-wrong-texas/618104/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>curtailing the freedom of everyday Texans</span></a> — for some by making electricity unaffordable, for others by effectively taking away that access, and the freedom to power and heat one’s home, entirely. It’s easy to see overregulation as a burden, but in this instance, there’s a clear rationale for how an absence of regulation made an extreme weather event worse. Indeed, it likely cost some Texans their lives.</p>
<div><p>Now, amid the scrutiny on the system’s lack of regulation, Texans may also be reconsidering the merits of deregulation. An <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/texas-electric-bills-were-28-billion-higher-under-deregulation-11614162780" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>analysis</span></a> from the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>in the aftermath of the crisis even casts doubt on the purported low costs of such a system, finding that “deregulated Texas residential consumers paid $28 billion more for their power since 2004 than they would have paid at the rates charged to the customers of the state’s traditional utilities.”&nbsp;</p></div>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<p>The rapid politicization of Texas’s weather troubles seems on par with the partisan tensions that epitomize the beginning to 2021, …</p></span></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When Google users browse in â€œIncognitoâ€� mode, just how hidden is their activity? The Alphabet Inc. unit says activating the stealth mode in Chrome, or â€œprivate browsingâ€� in other browsers, means the company wonâ€™t â€œremember your activity.â€� But a judge with a history of taking Silicon Valley giants to task about their data collection raised doubts Thursday about whether Google is being as forthright as it needs to be about the personal information itâ€™s collecting from users.</p>

<p>At a hearing Thursday in San Jose, California, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh said sheâ€™s â€œdisturbedâ€� by Googleâ€™s data collection practices in a class-action lawsuit that describes the companyâ€™s private browsing promises as a â€œruseâ€� and seeks US$5,000 in damages for each of the millions of people whose privacy has been compromised since June of 2016.</p>

<p>Weighing Googleâ€™s attempt to get the suit dismissed, Koh said she finds it â€œunusualâ€� that the company would make the â€œextra effortâ€� of data collection if it doesnâ€™t use the information to build user profiles or targeted advertising. Google has become a target of antitrust complaints in the last year filed by state and federal officials -- as well as businesses -- accusing it of abusing its dominance in digital advertising and online search. Koh has a deeper history with the company as a vocal critic of its privacy policies. She forced Google in one notable case to disclose its scanning of emails to build profiles and target advertising.</p>

<p>In this case, Google is accused of relying on pieces of its code within websites that use its analytics and advertising services to scrape usersâ€™ supposedly private browsing history and send copies of it to Googleâ€™s servers. Google makes it seem like private browsing mode gives users more control of their data, Amanda Bonn, a lawyer representing users, told Koh. In reality, â€œGoogle is saying thereâ€™s basically very little you can do to prevent us from collecting your data, and thatâ€™s what you should assume weâ€™re doing,â€� Bonn said.</p>

<p>Andrew Schapiro, a lawyer for Google, argued the companyâ€™s privacy policy â€œexpressly disclosesâ€� its practices. â€œThe data collection at issue is disclosed,â€� he said.Another lawyer for Google, Stephen Broome, said website owners who contract with the company to use its analytics or other services are well aware of the data collection described in the suit.</p>

<p>Broomeâ€™s attempt to downplay the privacy concerns by pointing out that the federal court systemâ€™s own website uses Google services ended up backfiring.</p>

<p>The judge demanded an explanation â€œabout what exactly Google does,â€� while voicing concern that visitors to the courtâ€™s website are unwittingly disclosing information to the company. â€œI want a declaration from Google on what information theyâ€™re collecting on users to the courtâ€™s website, and what thatâ€™s used for,â€� Koh told the companyâ€™s lawyers. The case is Brown v. Google, 20-cv-03664, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).</p>

<p>One of Southeast Asia’s <strong>biggest crypto exchanges</strong> is bracing itself for legal fallout after it suspended thousands of accounts in the wake of a <a href="https://bitpinas.com/cryptocurrency/pdax-suffers-outage-what-happened/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major outage</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>PDAX users thought they’d hit the jackpot when the platform started selling <a href="https://protos.com/bitcoin-treasuries-tesla-square-crypto-stocks-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> for just $6,000 — <strong>nearly 90% below</strong> its value at the time.</p>
<p>Sadly, it turns out the sale of the century was actually down to a glitch in PDAX’s system. Within 24 hours, the exchange started to lock users out of their accounts.</p>
<p>It even demanded some give the Bitcoin back, <strong>threatening those who refused</strong> with legal action.</p>

They say they did nothing wrong, and by losing access to their accounts <strong>the exchange denied customers</strong> the opportunity to <a href="https://www.philstar.com/business/2021/02/25/2080142/pdax-ready-face-lawsuits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make the most</a> of Bitcoin’s latest price surge.</p>

        <p>A <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.panic.html">panic</a> in Rust is the final resort when the code reaches an erroneous or impossible state. The stack of the thread it occurred on is unwound, every value that falls out of scope <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/destructors.html">dropped</a>, and the thread terminated. This is isolated to that specific thread<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, which allows other threads to detect and gracefully handle the error condition by e.g. spawning a new thread to replace it, or logging and exiting cleanly.</p>
<p>In most programs this is pretty useful, but I've been tripped up enough by this behaviour in my <a href="https://github.com/DomWilliams0/name-needed">game engine</a> to warrant implementing an alternate method of panic handling.</p>
<h2 id="all-panics-are-terminal">All panics are terminal</h2>
<p>Ideally, no panics should ever occur. Clearly this isn't possible, so I'm striving for the next best thing - <strong>immediate detection and graceful shutdown</strong>. Any panic on any thread should be treated as a hard error, and the main thread should attempt to save all game data and exit as soon as possible. </p>
<p>This provides the benefit of increased confidence in finding error conditions during testing, especially automated end-to-end tests where the game is run headless with debug asserts enabled. I've been bitten by this many times, when a worker thread panics but the main thread continues on oblivious, exiting cleanly and marking the test as a "success". It can be frustrating to hunt down bugs like these where the error is swallowed and silently breaks things<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, as I describe in the section below.</p>
<h2 id="the-pain-of-silent-panics">The pain of silent panics</h2>
<p>My game engine makes heavy use of thread pools to process expensive workloads over several ticks without affecting the frame rate - examples include generating chunks of terrain, or calculating paths for <a href="https://domwillia.ms/devlog3">navigation</a>. The main thread will post work to the thread pool via a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/">channel</a>, then consume available results each tick, all without blocking.

</code></pre></div>


<p>This works swimmingly until something causes a panic in the worker thread. Depending on the exact setup, one or more of the following could happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ The panic causes the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Receiver.html">receiving end</a> of the requests channel to disconnect, meaning <code>request_tx.send</code> now returns <code>Err</code> on the main thread<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. Panic detected!</li>
<li>✅ The panic causes the sending end of the results channel to disconnect, meaning <code>result_rx.try_recv</code> now returns <code>Err</code> on the main thread. Panic also detected!</li>
<li>✅ Any mutex held by the worker thread is now <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html#poisoning">poisoned</a>, and attempts to lock it from any other thread will fail. Panic still detected!</li>
<li>😧 The panic happens before any channel or mutex is in scope, so the thread dies and takes the request to its grave.</li>
<li>😌 The thread pool notices a worker thread died and spawns a new one in its place.</li>
<li>😩 The panic is unconditional (e.g. a <code>todo!()</code>) and we're now stuck in an infinite loop of thread killing and spawning.</li>
<li>🤬 The IDE locks up from the strain of resolving so many stack traces.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've seen all of these happen, and any of the last 4 are a real pain to either notice or track down. The most amusing is #4; the main thread has requested a chunk of terrain and now waits forever for it, leaving a gaping hole in the world where that terrain should be<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p><span><img alt="Screenshot of single missing chunk" src="https://domwilliams0.github.io/images/panik-missing-chunk.png" title="A panic killed the thread before it could finish processing that chunk, so I guess they'll just have to learn to live without it."><span>A panic killed the thread before it could finish processing that chunk, so I guess they'll just have to learn to live without it.</span></span></p>
<p>I've written a small crate to avoid this happening again, which is the whole point of this post.</p>
<p><span><img alt="panik-rs logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomWilliams0/panik-rs/master/panik.jpg" title="I refuse to apologise for this."><span>I refuse to apologise for this.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="panik-rs-to-the-rescue">panik-rs to the rescue</h2>
<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/panik">panik</a> is a simple wrapper around the standard panic functionality, and does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wraps the application in <code>catch_unwind</code> to handle panics on the main thread</li>
<li>Registers a custom panic hook to keep track of all panics</li>
<li>Exposes functions to query all panics (<a href="https://docs.rs/panik/0.1.1/panik/fn.panics.html"><code>panik::panics</code></a>) and check if a panic has occurred on any thread (<a href="https://docs.rs/panik/0.1.1/panik/fn.has_panicked.html"><code>panik::has_panicked</code></a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.rs/panik/">docs</a> include some basic examples, but I want to show here how the API fits into the code base it was designed for.</p>
<h3 id="example-in-context">Example in context</h3>
<p>Below is a cut-down snippet from the game engine's <code>main</code>. The game spends its whole runtime inside the context of <code>panik::run_and_handle_panics</code>, which boils down to installing a custom panic hook and a <code>catch_unwind</code>, which catches any panics on the main thread and prevents them from bubbling up to kill the program too soon.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>// ... initialize game state ....</span>

<span>// run the game inside panik's handler</span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>result</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>panik</span>::<span>run_and_handle_panics</span><span>(</span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>do_main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>});</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>None</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>// 1 or more panics occurred which have already been</span>
<span>        </span><span>// logged, nothing more to do</span>
<span>        </span><span>1</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>_</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>// no panics occurred</span>
<span>};</span><span></span>

<span>// ... optionally use panik::panics() to programatically access</span>
<span>//     panic messages, backtraces etc ...</span>

<span>// ... attempt to save any game data ...</span>

<span>std</span>::<span>process</span>::<span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>exit_code</span><span>);</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Now that panics will be detected by the custom panic handler, we need a way to interrupt the main thread if a panic occurred on different thread, in order to gracefully exit. This is done in two places:</p>
<ul>
<li>During startup, while waiting for the world to be loaded/generated by worker threads</li>
<li>Every tick during gameplay</li>
</ul>
<p>The first was an early cause of annoyance; the game initially requests a radius of terrain around the player's position, then blocks with a timeout until the world is available. While the game is in an early state, there isn't much to do and world generation finishes quite quickly, but if something panics it will sit there and wait until the timeout has elapsed<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. That code now looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>block_until_world_loaded</span><span>(</span><span></span>

</span><span><span>        </span><span>}</span><span></span>
</span>
<span>        </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>this_timeout</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>

<span>            </span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>            </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>end_time</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>now</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>        </span><span>};</span><span></span>

<span>        </span><span>// ... block for `this_timeout` and return `Ok(res)`</span>
<span>        </span><span>//     if a result is returned ...</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>The lines of interest are highlighted - a function pointer is passed in which triggers an early exit if it returns true when called with no arguments. The limit on the timeout and the <code>loop</code> mean that <code>bail()</code> will be called periodically. As you've probably guessed, a function that fits that function signature is <code>panik::has_panicked</code>! </p>
<p>The other place this is checked is every tick in the game loop. As soon as a panic is detected the loop is broken with an error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>// core game loop</span>
<span>loop</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>panik</span>::<span>has_panicked</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>            </span><span>debug</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"breaking out of loop due to panics"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>            </span><span>break</span><span> </span><span>Exit</span>::<span>Stop</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>}</span><span></span>

<span>        </span><span>// ... tick and render ...</span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>That's it! The API is pretty simple and easy enough to integrate into a code base. </p>
<h3 id="before-after-comparison">Before/after comparison</h3>
<p>This is what a panic in a worker thread during world initialisation looked like before. The panic and backtrace is mixed in with other logs, and the game window was unresponsive for 30 seconds before dying.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>...</span>

<span>000000 INFO exiting cleanly, code: 1</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>But now, with the power of <code>panik</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>  000000 DEBG populating chunk with slabs</span>
<span>000000 ERRO handling panic on thread ThreadId(9) (wrld-worker-3): 'intentional panic!!11!'</span>

<span>000000 INFO waiting 2 seconds to allow other threads to finish logging, seconds: 2</span>
<span>000000 INFO exiting cleanly, code: 1</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>The logs are clear and not intermingled, and the game exited immediately. Much better!</p>
<h2 id="watch-out-for-async-runtimes">Watch out for async runtimes</h2>
<p>Since moving my manual thread pools to <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tokio">tokio</a>, panics have become more of a pain, especially unconditional panics when I forget to remove a <code>todo!()</code>. The runtime's behaviour of auto-spawning new threads to replace the dead ones doesn't lead to pretty results, and I'm sure the following log speaks for itself:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>...</span>
<span>000000 ERRO handling panic on thread ThreadId(7) (wrld-worker-1): …</span></code></pre></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There was many changes over the last few months in KDE developer
documentation tooling. The hope is to make KDE development easier
to both newcomers but also long-time KDE contributors to use
KDE technologies to build cool stuff.</p><h2 id="api-documentation">Api documentation</h2><p>The tooling for our generated documentation tooling improved. First
of all, KApiDox got a new theme with a cleaner appearance and a
better dark theme. But the improvement goes beyond just theming.</p><figure><a href="https://carlschwan.eu/2021/02/26/documentation-improvement-in-kde/api.png" data-size="1908x891"><img srcset="https://carlschwan.eu/2021/02/26/documentation-improvement-in-kde/api_hu75ec079396b4d1e999137d12765b0477_152990_700x0_resize_box_2.png 700w, https://carlschwan.eu/2021/02/26/documentation-improvement-in-kde/api_hu75ec079396b4d1e999137d12765b0477_152990_1824x0_resize_box_2.png 1824w" src="https://carlschwan.eu/2021/02/26/documentation-improvement-in-kde/api.png" width="1908" height="891" loading="lazy" alt="API.kde.org new look"></a><figcaption>API.kde.org new look</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://invent.kde.org/sdk/doxyqml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doxyqml</a>, our documentation
bridge between QML and doxygen, got various improvements, thanks
to Olaf Mandel and Lasse Lopperi. Now QML enums are supported and
the lexer/parser got various bug fixes.</p><p>Speaking of QML documentation, the Kirigami API documentation was
improved and now uses more correctly <code>@inherit</code> tags and
<code>@property</code> tags. There is still room for improvements, but the
current state is already a lot better. Most Components are now
showing all their properties correctly and the type of the
property is correct. (<a href="https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami/-/commit/6ce80224a9fe46216cf47d29458e16f3519ec693" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kirigami!239</a>)</p><p>Another improvement is that the generated Kirigami documentation
now shows more accurate names: e.g. <code>Kirigami.Page</code> instead of
<code>org::kde::kirigami::Page</code>. This makes it easier to read and
navigate the documentation.</p><p>There was also a bit of background work inside KApiDox, Jannet
added support for QDoc, allowing to use QDoc as an alternative
to Doxygen. This might be a better solution for generating
documentation for projects with a lot of QML.</p><h2 id="high-level-documentation">High level documentation</h2><p>Since <a href="https://develop.kde.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">develop.kde.org</a> was announced
back in September 2020 just before Akademy, it received a steady
stream of updates. In terms of visuals, Jannet replaced the left
sidebar with a better-looking one.</p><p>A Doxygen integration was also added in the Hugo based website,
allowing to link to the API documentation in an easy way (e.g.
<code>[Kirigami.Page](docs:kirigami2;Page)</code>).</p><figure><a href="https://carlschwan.eu/2021/02/26/documentation-improvement-in-kde/doxapi.png" data-size="438x211"><img srcset="https://carlschwan.eu/2021/02/26/documentation-improvement-in-kde/doxapi_hu1dd9834c8070fdaaebb60963fde23a42_20357_700x0_resize_box_2.png 700w, https://carlschwan.eu/2021/02/26/documentation-improvement-in-kde/doxapi_hu1dd9834c8070fdaaebb60963fde23a42_20357_1824x0_resize_box_2.png 1824w" src="https://carlschwan.eu/2021/02/26/documentation-improvement-in-kde/doxapi.png" width="438" height="211" loading="lazy" alt="Link to API documentation"></a><figcaption>Link to API documentation</figcaption></figure><p>The Plasma documentation was massively improved. Zren moved his
excellent tutorial about creating Plasma Widgets to
<a href="https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/widget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">/docs/plasma/widget</a>.
I also moved the <a href="https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/scripting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plasma Desktop Scripting tutorial</a>
and the <a href="https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/theme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plasma Theme Tutorial</a>
from techbase to develop. This was a good occasion to update them to a
more recent version of Plasma since some parts were from the early
days of Plasma 5 and a few bits from KDE4 remained.</p><p>Concerning the Framework documentation, most of the tutorials from
the Framework book, that was written a few years ago to develop.
Same as the Plasma documentation, I used this opportunity to update
the documentation and remove any mentions of deprecated APIS. I
also did the same for most of the old tutorials from <a href="https://techbase.kde.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">techbase</a>.</p><figure><a href="https://carlschwan.eu/2021/02/26/documentation-improvement-in-kde/features.png" data-size="1239x831"><img srcset="https://carlschwan.eu/2021/02/26/documentation-improvement-in-kde/features_huf04e7f133efae172b4c5dc22c5d6a5ed_66521_700x0_resize_box_2.png 700w, https://carlschwan.eu/2021/02/26/documentation-improvement-in-kde/features_huf04e7f133efae172b4c5dc22c5d6a5ed_66521_1824x0_resize_box_2.png 1824w" src="https://carlschwan.eu/2021/02/26/documentation-improvement-in-kde/features.png" width="1239" height="831" loading="lazy" alt="List of features oriented tutorials"></a><figcaption>List of features oriented tutorials</figcaption></figure><p>Tobias Fella imported the old <a href="https://develop.kde.org/docs/d-bus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DBus tutorial</a>
from techbase and David Redondo wrote a tutorial about how to
<a href="https://develop.kde.org/docs/sensor-faces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create sensor faces</a>
for the new Plasma Monitor.</p><p><img src="https://develop.kde.org/docs/sensor-faces/images/config.png" alt="Custom sensor faces"></p><p>Finally, Clau Cambra wrote a tutorial for getting started in
<a href="https://develop.kde.org/docs/kirigami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirigami</a>. The tutorial

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="section-5-61"><div><div id="new_columns-6-61"><div id="div_block-7-61"><p><span id="span-26-61">
<p>You might think the US would be world champion of household debt, yet the highest private indebtment has always been in the Nordic countries. Debt, however, takes different forms, writes <strong>Martino Comelli</strong>. In Scandinavia, inclusive welfare systems make debt into an investment. Elsewhere, gerontocratic welfare and consumer credit can become a burden</p>
<h2>Debt and welfare: a trade-off?</h2>
<p>The economic crisis of 2007–2008 put household debt in the spotlight. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">A common narrative</a></strong> was that cheap credit fuelled a house price bubble in the US. The financial industry sold derivatives based on those debts and many European banks who bought those products went belly up, allowing the crisis to spread across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Debt, and in particular, household debt, has been regarded with suspicion ever since. Many scholars argue that the rise of household debt was caused by welfare retrenchment, suggesting a trade-off between welfare and debt. A lack of welfare was compensated by private leveraging. Other scholars pointed out that many governments were pushing for asset-based welfare – like buying housing as a form of private welfare – encouraged by steadily rising house prices in the years preceding the crash.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="776" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png" alt="" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png 683w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1-264x300.png 264w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"><figcaption>Figure 1: Quantity of household debt in OECD countries</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet empirical data suggests that the welfare-debt trade-off may be mistaken. Curiously, the highest indebtment ratio in the OECD was, and is, in northern European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. These are the countries with the most far-reaching welfare programmes, and known to be fiscally responsible. Clearly, the welfare-debt trade-off theory needs a rethink.</p>
<h2>Private debt, public virtues: on the age-orientation of welfare</h2>
<p>Is it, then, a complementary relationship? Generous welfare provides security, encouraging people to borrow more. But this interpretation does not fly either. Many European countries have generous welfare – France for example, has higher social spending than Denmark – but nowhere near the level of household debt of the Nordic countries.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02732173.2021.1875088">My research on the relations between welfare and household debt</a> </strong>offers a novel explanation of the welfare-debt conundrum. There is no trade-off between private debt and welfare, nor is there a complementary relation. What matters is where the welfare money is spent and how. It isn’t necessarily about the quantity of spending, but about its direction.</p>
<blockquote><p>While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need</p></blockquote>
<p>Most welfare spending is concentrated on older generations, particularly retired people. According to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">Franco Modigliani</a>'s life-cycle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">hypothesis</a></strong>, debt is linked to one's stage in life. People take on debt when young because their income is low but their expenses (housing, children, leisure) high – and they pay this debt off as they age.</p>
<p>Countries that not only provide social help for the elderly, but counterbalance that with spending and services for the young and economically active, tend to have higher private debt (see Figure 2). In particular, countries that spend on education and active labour market policies, and those which offer better protection for people in precarious jobs, have the highest levels of private debt.</p>
<p>Household debt is an unintended consequence of assuring a smoother transition to adulthood. In conservative continental European countries, however, despite high welfare spending, welfare is concentrated mostly on the elderly and on people with stable jobs. This discourages younger generations from taking risks, including mortgage debt.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="980" height="714" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png" alt="Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png 980w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-300x219.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-768x560.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"><figcaption>Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Note: Figure 2 illustrates an inverse relationship between the elderly orientation of social spending (EBiSS, on the x axis), and the quantity of household debt as % of net disposable income (on the y axis). The EBiSS is a rate between social spending for the economically active (at the numerator) versus spending oriented toward the elderly (at the denominator). A higher value on the EBiSS index means that a greater share of social spending is going to the elderly.</p>
<h2>Consumer credit? The three worlds of debtfare capitalism</h2>
<p>Most of the debt in OECD countries is mortgage debt. While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need.</p>
<p>If we consider consumer credit, the welfare-debt theory makes sense again. While consumer credit is more the exception than the norm in Europe, and almost absent in the Nordic countries, it is common in Anglo-liberal countries (UK, US and Canada) where it is used by families as a substitute for poor welfare provision.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="895" height="531" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3.png" alt="Figure 3. Clusters measures" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3.png 895w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3-300x178.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3-768x456.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px"><figcaption>Figure 3. Clusters measures</figcaption></figure>
<p>Figure 3 shows three main patterns of private debt/welfare configurations; what we call debtfare:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Nordic / youth-oriented model, household debt is high, consumer credit is low, and the rate of young people Not in Education, Employment, or Training (NEET) is very low.</li>
<li>
<p>In conservative European countries such as Germany and Italy, there are a lot of NEETs, welfare is orientated toward the elderly, and there is little household debt or consumer credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Anglo-liberal countries such as the UK, US and Canada, consumer credit is high, and so is overall debt. But it is not as high as in the Nordic countries, where the share of NEETs is remarkably high, and most welfare is oriented toward the elderly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Household financialisation, then, follows different paths and patterns. Both liberal and conservative welfare is gerontocratic, and they have a high level of NEETs, but while the former is oriented toward a market solution to inequality (more debt), the latter discourages any form of risk taking.</p>
<p>So, while paying attention to debt is important, it shouldn’t be the only lesson of the 2008 crisis. Further attention should be paid to the macro-sociological conditions that give debt different meanings: inclusive welfare can make debt into an investment, but gerontocratic welfare can make debt a burden.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This post was originally drafted in August 2018, but I never got around to finishing it. As such, parts of its framing (e.g. the focus on bindgen) are outdated, given the relative infancy of the interop space at the time. I was recently told that the post is still useful in this form so I decided to finish and publish it anyway, while attempting to mark outdated things as such when I notice them. Everything after the allocators section was written near the time of publication.</em></p>

<p>In 2017 I worked on the <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/">Stylo</a> project, uplifting Servo’s CSS engine (“style system”) into Firefox’s browser engine
(“Gecko”). This involved a <em>lot</em> of gnarly FFI between Servo’s Rust codebase and Firefox’s C++ codebase. There were a
lot of challenges in doing this, and I feel like it’s worth sharing things from our experiences.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in Rust integrations, you may find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9acx2zgx4Q">this talk by Katharina on Rust - C++ FFI</a>, and <a href="https://hsivonen.fi/modern-cpp-in-rust/">this blog post by Henri on integrating encoding-rs into Firefox</a> useful as well.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-this-post-for">Who is this post for?</h2>

<p>So, first off the bat, I’ll mention that when integrating Rust into a C++ codebase, you
want to <em>avoid</em> having integrations as tight as Stylo. Don’t do what we did; make your Rust
component mostly self-contained so that you just have to maintain something like ten FFI functions
for interacting with it. If this is possible to do, you should do it and your life will be <em>much</em> easier. Pick a clean API boundary, define a straightforward API, use cbindgen or bindgen if necessary without any tricks, and you should be good to go.</p>

<p>That said, sometimes you <em>have</em> to have gnarly integrations, and this blog post is for those use cases.
These techniques mostly use bindgen in their examples, however you can potentially use them with hand-rolled bindings or another tool as well. If you’re at this level of complexity, however, the potential for mistakes in the hand-rolled bindings is probably not worth it.</p>

<p><em>Note from 2021: <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx">cxx</a> is probably a better tool for many of the use cases here, though many of the techniques still transfer.</em></p>

<h2 id="what-was-involved-in-stylos-ffi">What was involved in Stylo’s FFI?</h2>

<p>So, what made Stylo’s FFI so complicated?</p>

<p>It turns out that browsers are quite monolithic. You can split them into vaguely-defined components, but
these components are still tightly integrated. If you intend to replace a component, you may need to
make a jagged edge of an integration surface.</p>

<p>The style system is more self-contained than other parts, but it’s still quite tightly integrated.</p>

<p>The main job of a “style system” is to take the CSS rules and DOM tree, and run them through “the cascade”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
with an output of “computed styles” tagged on each node in the tree. So, for example, it will take a document like
the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;style </span><span>type=</span><span>"text/css"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>body</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> <span>12px</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>div</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>2em</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>&lt;/style&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"foo"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and turn it into something like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>&lt;body&gt;</code> has a <code>font-size</code> of <code>12px</code>, everything else is the default</li>
  <li>the <code>div</code> <code>#foo</code> has a computed <code>height</code> of <code>24px</code> <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup>, everything else is the default. It “inherits” the <code>font-size</code> from <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> as <code>12px</code></li>
</ul>

<p>From a code point of view, this means that Stylo takes in Gecko’s C++ DOM tree. It parses all the CSS,
and then runs the cascade on the tree. It stores computed styles on each element in a way that Gecko can read
very cheaply.</p>

<p>Style computation can involve some complex steps that require calling back into C++ code. Servo’s style system
is multithreaded, but Gecko is mostly designed to work off of a single main thread per process, so we need to
deal with this impedence mismatch.</p>

<p>Since the output of Stylo is C++-readable structs, Stylo needs to be able to read and write nontrivial C++
abstractions. Typical FFI involves passing values over a boundary, never to be seen again, however here we’re
dealing with persistent state that is accessed by both sides.</p>

<p>To sum up, we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lots and lots of back-and-forth FFI</li>
  <li>Thread safety concerns</li>
  <li>Rust code regularly dealing with nontrivial C++ abstractions</li>
  <li>A need for nontrivial abstractions to be passed over FFI</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this conspires to make for some really complicated FFI code.</p>



<p>I’ll try to structure this so that the more broadly useful (and/or less gnarly) techniques come earlier in the post.</p>

<h2 id="the-basics-of-bindgen">The basics of bindgen</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/">Bindgen</a> is a tool that generates Rust bindings for structs and functions from the provided C or C++ header files. It’s often used for writing Rust bindings to existing C/C++ libraries, however it’s useful for integrations as well.</p>

<p>To use it for an integration, write a header file containing the functions your Rust code needs (referencing structs from other header files if necessary), and <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-bindgen/command-line-usage.html">run bindgen on it</a>. For some codebases, doing this once and
checking in the generate file suffices, but if your C++ code is going to change a lot, <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-bindgen/tutorial-1.html">run it as a build dependency instead</a>. Beware that this can adversely impact build times, since your Rust build now has a partial
C++ compilation step.</p>

<p>For large C++ codebases, pulling in a single header will likely pull in a <em>lot</em> of stuff. You should <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/allowlisting.html">allowlist</a>, <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/blocklisting.html">blocklist</a>, and/or mark things as <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/opaque.html">opaque</a> to reduce the amount of bindings generated. It’s best to go the allowlisting route — give bindgen an allowlisted list of functions / structs to generate bindings for, and it will transitively generate bindings for any dependencies they may have. Sometimes even this will end up generating a lot, it’s sometimes worth finding structs you’re not using and marking them as opaque so that their bindings aren’t necessary. Marking something as opaque replaces it with an array of the appropriate size and alignment, so from the Rust side it’s just some bits you don’t care about and can’t introspect further.</p>

<p>Bindgen <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-bindgen/cpp.html"><em>does</em> support some C++ features</a> (you may need to pass <code>-x c++</code>). This is pretty good for generating bindings to e.g. templated structs. However, it’s not possible to support <em>all</em> C++ features here, so you may need to blocklist, opaqueify, or use intermediate types if you have some complicated C++ abstractions in the deps. You’ll typically get an error when generating bindings or when compiling the generated bindings, so don’t worry about this unless that happens.</p>

<p>Bindgen is <em>quite</em> configurable. Stylo has a <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/servo/components/style/build_gecko.rs">script</a> that consumes a <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/style/ServoBindings.toml">large toml file</a> containing all of the configuration.</p>

<h2 id="cbindgen">cbindgen</h2>

<p>We don’t use <a href="https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen">cbindgen</a> in Stylo, but it’s used for Webrender. It does the inverse of what bindgen does: given a Rust crate, it generates C headers for its public <code>extern "C"</code> API. It’s also quite configurable.</p>

<h2 id="cxx">cxx</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx">cxx</a> is the cool new hotness in 2021, which kind of approaches the problem from both sides, enabling you to write Rust bindings for C++ and C++ bindings for Rust. It’s definitely worth checking out, a lot of the things that are hard to make work with bindgen are trivial in cxx. For example, it automatically figures out what types need to be opaque, it automatically converts between <code>&amp;T</code> and <code>T*</code> across FFI, and it is overall more targeted for the use case of an FFI layer where Rust and C++ both call each other.</p>

<h2 id="bindgen-aided-c-calling-rust">Bindgen-aided C++ calling Rust</h2>

<p>So bindgen helps with creating things for Rust to call and manipulate, but not in the opposite direction. cbindgen can help here, but I’m not sure if it’s advisable to have <em>both</em> bindgen and cbindgen operating near each other on the same codebase.</p>

<p>In Stylo we use a bit of a hack for this. Firstly, all FFI functions defined in C++ that Rust calls are declared in <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/layout/style/ServoBindingList.h">one file</a>, and are all named <code>Gecko_*</code>. Bindgen supports regexes for things like allowlisting, so this naming scheme makes it easy to deal with.</p>

<p>We also declare the FFI functions defined in Rust that C++ calls in <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/layout/style/ServoBindingList.h">another file</a>, named <code>Servo_*</code>. They’re also all <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/servo/ports/geckolib/glue.rs">defined in one place</a>.</p>

<p>However, there’s nothing ensuring that the signatures match! If we’re not careful, there may be mismatches, causing bad things to happen at link time or runtime. We use a small <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/servo/ports/geckolib/tests/build.rs">autogenerated</a> <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/servo/ports/geckolib/tests/servo_function_signatures.rs">unit test</a> to ensure the validity of the signatures.</p>

<p>This is especially important as we do things like type replacement, and we need tests to ensure that the rug isn’t pulled out from underneath us.</p>

<h2 id="type-replacing-for-fun-and-profit">Type replacing for fun and profit</h2>

<p>Using <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/blocklisting.html">blocklisting</a> in conjunction with the <code>--raw-line</code>/<code>raw_line()</code> flag, one can effectively ask bindgen to “replace” types. Blocklisting asks bindgen not to generate bindings for a type, however bindgen will continue to generate bindings <em>referring</em> to that type if necessary. (Unlike opaque types where bindgen generates an opaque binding for the type and uses it everywhere). <code>--raw-line</code> lets you request bindgen to add a line of raw rust code to the file, and such a line can potentially define or import a new version of the type you blocklisted. Effectively, this lets you replace types.</p>

<p>Bindgen generates unit tests ensuring that the layout of your structs is correct (run them!), so if you accidentally replace a type with something incompatible, you will get warnings at the struct level (functions may not warn).</p>

<p>There are various ways this can be used:</p>

<h3 id="safe-references-across-ffi">Safe references across FFI</h3>

<p><em>Note from 2021: <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx">cxx</a> does this automatically</em></p>

<p>Calling into C++ (and accepting data from C++) is unsafe. However, there’s no reason we should have to worry about this more than we have to. For example, it would be nice if accessor FFI functions – functions which take a foreign object and return something from inside it –  could use lifetimes. It would be even nicer if nullability were represented on the FFI boundary so that you don’t miss null checks, and can assume non-nullness when the C++ API is okay with it.</p>

<p>In Stylo, we have lots of functions like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>RawGeckoNodeBorrowedOrNull</span> <span>Gecko_GetLastChild</span><span>(</span><span>RawGeckoNodeBorrowed</span> <span>node</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which bindgen translates to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>extern</span> <span>"C"</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>Gecko_GetLastChild</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>RawGeckoNode</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>RawGeckoNode</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>   
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using the <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/servo/components/style/build_gecko.rs">bindgen build script</a> on a provided <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/layout/style/ServoBindings.toml#648-671">list of borrow-able types</a>, we’ve told bindgen that:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>FooBorrowedOrNull</code> is actually <code>Option&lt;&amp;Foo&gt;</code></li>

<div><p><em>for Joseph Castronovo &amp; Edward S. Klima, in memoriam</em></p><p>  [The great breakthrough resulting from a new signing poetry in Deaf Culture has been to call into question a poetics in which orality &amp; sounding are assumed to be the foundational bases of <em>all</em> poetic expression. That revelation goes back three decades &amp; more, recently &amp; notably presented in <em><a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/9424.php">Signing the Body Poetic: Essays on American Sign Language Literature</a></em>, ed. by Dirksen L. Bauman, Jennifer L. Nelson, &amp; Heidi M. Rose (University of California   Press, 2006).&nbsp;Still closer to the present is an ASL-oriented web site, <em><a href="http://deafjam.org/links.html">Deaf Jam</a></em>, dedicated to a documentary film of that name, from which the first of the comments, below, is taken. The other two notes presented here represent my own early attempts to bring the poetry of sign into the ethnopoetics that I was promoting in the 1970s &amp; 1980s. They also coincide in a startling way with the exploration of an outsider poetry that has been one of the themes of <em>Poems &amp; Poetics </em>– a poetry distanced enough from the mainstream as to effect substantially our ideas about the nature of poetry itself. (J.R.)]</p></div>

<div><p><strong>THE SILENT LANGUAGE</strong><strong><br> </strong>“Pain” <em>for Joe Castronovo</em></p><p>  two fingers,<br> pointing,<br> nearly touch</p><p>  matching the pulse inside<br> the skull<br> a figure “8” explodes</p><p>  over the temples,<br> gentle movements of the mind<br> of words in air</p><p>  in silence:<br> do I learn to speak you?<br> can you <em>hear</em><em><br> </em><br> the way the lines weave,<br> barely<br> moving from the touch</p><p>  to vanish<br> as sounds do<br> writing frees itself</p><p>  from object-<br> hood<br> at last</p><p>  (1) ASL POETRY is a performance art form utilizing body language, rhythm and movement to create a three dimensional pictorial equivalent to oral poetry. The similarity of hand-shapes can act as alliteration, and using the same hand-shape repetitively works as rhyme. Visual Vernacular (a term and technique originated by Bernard Bragg) involves cinematic concepts. The technique involves references to close-ups, wide shots, images dissolving into other images as well as "cutting" back and forth between characters to show different points of view on a scene.</p><p>  <strong>HISTORY: From 1880 to 1960, American Sign Language Was Suppressed In The Schools And Went Underground, Until Statistics Showed That The Suppression Of Sign Language Was Detrimental To Learning For The Deaf.</strong><strong><br> </strong><br> Signed poetry grew out of a tradition of playing with the language in Deaf clubs throughout the country, where deaf individuals and their families and friends would congregate for entertainment and to socialize.</p><p>  ASL poetry has been described "as a kind of writing in space... a language in motion, and, like oral poetry, truly inseparable from its realization in performance." (Edward S. Klima and Ursula Bellugi, "Poetry Without Sound,” 1983)</p><p>  *******</p><p>  Translation for ASL poetry into a written or oral form involves crossing modalities. In ASL poetry the body is the text. It exists in performance or through a video recording, not on paper. Rhyming schemes are based on visual elements such as facial expression, movement, locations of the signs, and hand shapes. Therefore an oral or written translation of an ASL poem can only be an approximation of what is being expressed.</p><p>  (2) Regarding Ameslan [American Sign Language] poetry, you might check the<br> anthology <em>Symposium of the Whole</em> (edited by myself &amp; Diane Rothenberg) for the article "Poetry without Sound" by Edward S. Klima and Ursula Bellugi. Bellugi has done terrific work in this area &amp; early contacted me on the relation of signing poetry to the way in which I and others had been approaching oral poetry in the course of doing (so called) "total translation." I then published this piece in my magazine, <em>New Wilderness Letter</em> (a successor to the earlier <em>Alcheringa Ethnopoetics</em>) with my very strong sense that what was involved touched on a dimension of poetry that made pure oralism inadequate, however much we had then been (or continued to be) committed to a speech model. I made an attempt (around 1976/77) to work out an experimental approach to a total translation from Ameslan, collaborating with the deaf poet Joe Castronovo, who was himself a native signer. But circumstances got in the way &amp; we never followed through on it, although since then I've come on the work of performance poets like Peter Cook &amp; Kenny Learner composing &amp; performing in ASL &amp; have been hoping to see how much further it would go.</p></div>

<div><p>(3) POETRY WITHOUT SOUND. Even in its early, tentative stages, the signing poetry emerging as an aspect of the "culture of the deaf" challenges some of our cherished preconceptions about poetry and its relation to human speech. Ameslan (American Sign Language) represents, literally, a poetry without sound and, for its practitioners, a poetry without access to that experience of sound as voice that we've so often taken as the bedrock of all poetics and all language. In the real world of the deaf, then, language exists as a kind of writing in space and as a primary form of communication without reference to any more primary form of language for its validation. It is in this sense a realization of the ideogrammatic vision of a Fenollosa -- "a splendid flash of concrete poetry" -- but an ideogrammatic language truly in motion and, like oral poetry, truly inseparable from its realization in performance. (Ethnopoetic analogues -- for those who would care to check them out -- include Hindu and Tantric mudras, Plains Indian and Australian Aborigine sign languages, and Ejagham [southeastern Nigerian] "action writing": a history of human gesture languages that would enrich our sense of poetry and language, should we set our minds to it.) // The reader may also want to relate this piece to recent discourse about "written-oral dichotomies, etc., but the revelation of Ameslan, in that sense, isn't a denial of the powers of oral poetry but the creation of its possible and equally impermanent companion in performance.

        <p><span>Have you ever wanted to wear your game character's clothes? Maybe you cosplay and enjoy looking like your favorite character.</span></p>
<p><span>I know you've tried looking like your Roblox character in real life. Don't deny it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Well, what if you can stop copying your avatar's clothes and have it match YOU instead?</span></p>
<p><span>This merger between the physical and digital world creates what is known as "Phygitals." This is exactly what Real Items is working towards. Our team of dedicated developers and designers has integrated the digital universe and fashion into one platform.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That's right, you can easily access the Roblox version of your new fashion haul using the Real Items platform. All you have to do is scan the QR code on the clothes to collect the NFT. <a href="https://realitems.shop/collections/100-authentic-marketplace/products/the-future-is-phygital-roblox-avatar">Check out this Phygital shirt in our shop.</a></span></p>

<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0335/4119/3867/files/phygital_scan_480x480.jpg?v=1614178842" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span><i><span><span>Phygital shirt powered by Real Items technology. Simply scan the QR code on the physical shirt to acquire your digital Roblox clothing.</span></span></i></span></p>




<p><b>What is Phygital?</b></p>
<p><span>Phygital is about creating a new dimension of ecosystems between the brand and consumer. It is a convergence of technologies that bridge the digital and physical worlds with the purpose of unlocking unique business capabilities and creating engaging interactive experiences for enterprises and consumers. Introducing a physical t-shirt that can be worn digitally is one of many aspects of the phygital experience.</span></p>
<p><span>The phygital experience also extends to the gaming industry. A great example of this is Nintendo’s Amiibo products. Amiibos are wireless communication figurines. These collectible toys are shaped like Nintendo characters and can interact and transfer data in and out of their supported game software. By simply tapping the Amiibo to the game, players can immediately enjoy new characters, modes, and other in-game perks.</span></p>
<p><b>Uniquely secure</b></p>
<p><span>Real Items takes the phygital experience a step further by ensuring the security of information. In a recent speech by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, he stated that federal agents had seized over 11 million fake N95 masks intended for frontline healthcare workers throughout the nation. Such threats of counterfeit PPEs have motivated Real Items to trace the origin and prove Tricol Clean KN95 masks' authenticity.</span></p>

              <p>Aldhair made a career change due to Covid. He became a web developer by learning to code with <a href="https://scrimba.com/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=nocsdegree_email#join">Scrimba</a>, an online learning platform. Before, Aldhair was working as a cleaner on cruise ships. This interview tells you how Aldhair learned to code, his tips for self-taught web developers and how he got his first job. Enjoy!</p><h2 id="hey-so-can-you-introduce-yourself">Hey, so can you introduce yourself?</h2><p>Hi, I’m Aldhair Escobar, I’m from Mexico and currently living in Veracruz, MX. Currently, I’m working as a Developer for Client Solutions at Scalero, My main duty is building HTML Email Templates for clients, apart from that there are some “inside” projects where I’m using Node JS and even Electron JS to try things out. The company is based on San Francisco so it’s a remote position and I’m loving it a lot. Previously, I have worked as a Tax advisor for almost 4 years, and as a cleaner at a cruise ship.</p><h2 id="why-did-you-learn-to-code">Why did you learn to code?</h2><p>Well, as I said before, I was working as a Tax advisor and spending a lot of time and energy without getting paid enough so I decided to start learning English (You can see that I am still learning it), this language opened some doors so I submitted an application to Royal Caribbean International as a cleaner on a cruise ship (which got me a better salary than my last job).</p><p>The idea to work as a cleaner was to have some experience in that industry and improve my English skills, at the same time I was saving some money.</p><p>When I was on the ship, I applied to some jobs but they didn’t allow me to have an interview (you need a second contract in the company so you can apply to another position), and I was thinking on return to the ship and apply to a better position with a better salary and then COVID happened…</p><p>Fortunately while on the ship I thought about learning some new skills after finishing my contract (e.g English for business, code, or maybe to buy a franchise).</p><p>I decided to start learning to code because I was curious about it and had some business ideas that required it.</p><h2 id="how-did-you-start-learning-to-code">How did you start learning to code?</h2><p>I started with some courses in my native language for around 1 month but I did not like them. I realized I was able to understand English resources so I began with FreeCodeCamp and did the first web development certification module, along with that I found an Udemy course called “The Complete Web Development Bootcamp” by Angela Yu ($10) and things started to make sense.</p><p>So if I can make a timeline could be like this:</p><p>April – FreeCodeCamp (Free), “The Complete Web Development Bootcamp” by Angela Yu ($10).</p><p>May – Full Academy Intro (Free), Full Academy prep (It was Free)</p><p>June – Continued with the courses above, building some projects. (I also tried some new courses that did not like)</p><p>July – Building projects in Frontendmentor, youtube video courses (JS, CSS), Started in Scrimba with a <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact?utm_source=nocsdegree.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=aldhair_interview">React Course</a> (Free).</p><p>August – “<a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend?utm_source=nocsdegree.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=aldhair_interview">Frontend Developer Career Path</a> Scrimba ($19 Monthly), “21 Days Challenge “Conquering Responsive Layouts” by Kevin Powell (Free), Frontendmentor projects.</p><p>September – <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/responsive?utm_source=nocsdegree.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=aldhair_interview">Responsive Web Design Bootcamp</a> (Scrimba), Building projects for my portfolio.</p><p>October – <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/designbootcamp?utm_source=nocsdegree.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=aldhair_interview">UI Design Bootcamp</a> (Scrimba), Building Projects and continuing with the Frontend Career Path (Scrimba).</p><p>November – FullStackOpen Part 0 and Part 1 (Free), (Finished Frontend Career Path), Started Practicing about Interviews (Scrimba has <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/reactinterview?utm_source=nocsdegree.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=aldhair_interview">a module about it</a>), Applied for jobs, I got an interview.</p><h2 id="what-made-you-decide-to-learn-to-code-with-scrimba">What made you decide to learn to code with Scrimba?</h2><p>I was curious about the platform because of this option to modify the code directly on the screen and the mini browser so I decided to take the <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact?utm_source=nocsdegree.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=aldhair_interview">Learn React For Free course</a> and I just loved it.</p><p>It is so interactive! They have amazing teachers! , you are writing code the whole course and that is something that I like about their courses, there are many challenges and repetition is the key! (And I love the “spaced repetition” system).</p><p>Apart from that, I like to hear someone explaining a concept and I like when they use images or diagrams to show something, so I realized that Scrimba was created for me 😀</p><h2 id="what-courses-did-you-do-with-scrimba">What courses did you do with Scrimba?</h2><p>I started with the <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact?utm_source=nocsdegree.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=aldhair_interview">Learn React For Free course</a>, and then I decided to get the subscription because I wanted to take some Bootcamps and the Frontend Developer Career Path, so I paid $19 per month until finishing the Path.</p><p>The advantage is that you have access to everything with the subscription and maybe in the FrontendCareerPath there’s a module that is also part of a Bootcamp so then you can finish the Bootcamp and get the individual certificate while you continue with the “main” (FrontendCareerPath) course.</p><p>I loved the Path because they are putting together all the things that are going to help you to get hired.</p><p>With Scrimba I learned a lot of JavaScript and CSS and also improved my &nbsp;ReactJS knowledge, the challenges and projects helped me to build my projects that I was going to use in my portfolio.</p><h2 id="how-did-you-get-your-first-entry-level-developer-job">How did you get your first entry level developer job?</h2><p>I always had this idea to have my GitHub profile with everything I was building, together with a “nice” CV because you know… without any experience or degree, you need to show something…</p><p>For that reason, I had my GitHub profile with almost every project I was building, a CV, and a simple portfolio website and started applying for jobs that I was interested in; I sent four applications and then got the opportunity to have an interview from one of those submissions.</p><p>Scrimba has a module dedicated to interviews and some challenges about it so it helped me with my confidence.</p><p>I was nervous because I was so interested to get the job in that company and I got some questions like “What did you learn in that course (Frontend Developer Career Path - Scrimba)?” “Why did you change careers?” Why did you go to the ship (my last job)? “The best characteristic a leader can have...” The best attitude of an employee”, Am I willing to relocate?”.</p><p>After that interview, I had three more interviews (same company), did a test (Wonscore), and built a small project with HTML, CSS and Jinja Template Engine (I learned a little bit of python to get this done).</p><p>So after 812 hours of learning and this interview process I got an offer!!</p><h2 id="what-does-a-typical-day-as-a-software-developer-look-like-for-you">What does a typical day as a software developer look like for you? </h2><p>My main duty is building Email Templates, so I get my ticket with its handoff and I start building the template with old HTML and CSS, apart from that, for instance, last week I was testing some stuff with Selenium WebDriver and Selenium IDE, and this week I am building a small desktop app with ElectronJS.</p><p>So it depends on the day, if there are a lot of templates or not then I do something else. I love what I am doing and everything is better than I was expecting.</p><h2 id="do-you-have-tips-for-people-who-want-to-learn-to-code-without-doing-a-degree">Do you have tips for people who want to learn to code without doing a degree?</h2><p>If I needed to start again, I would do things slightly different, for instance, I would start with 2 weeks of watching a lot of YouTube videos about web development, frontend, backend, stacks, languages, and also some videos that gave you the “roadmap” and all that kind of things.</p><p>After that, you will know what you don’t know and what you want to do, maybe you want to build websites or desktop apps, so you will see exactly the language that you need to learn.</p><p>Then, the most important thing, in my opinion, is to learn how you like to acquire information. Do you prefer books, video or audio? Or just the exercises without video or audio like FreeCodeCamp? It’s really important to know this because you need to search for resources that will work for you (because you prefer it).</p><p>I realized I was spending time on some resources that I didn’t like a lot so that was the main reason I decided to test Scrimba (and it worked!!)</p><p>Only with those first steps, you are going to save you a lot of time so now you can focus on the resources that you chose.</p><p>Always build stuff, it’s going to be a disaster, It won’t look good and that’s great! You can always return and fix it 😉.</p><p>I encourage you to use a “Pomodoro app” (I used “forest”) so you can keep track of your journey and see how much time you are spending, this is going to help you to push yourself and gives you extra motivation.</p><h2 id="what-are-your-career-goals-for-the-future">What are your career goals for the future?</h2><p>The idea is to get familiar with my new job, this is my first time working remotely, in tech, in a startup so it is taking time, and after a few months I want to return to build personal projects, I have some ideas and maybe I will try to build a SaaS product. In short, I want to get used to working in this field and keep pushing myself.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div id="ron_db"><h2>‍<strong>The rise of key-value stores as online feature stores.&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Online feature stores are the data layer for operational machine learning models - the models that make online shopping recommendations for you and help identify financial fraud. When you train a machine learning model, you feed it with high signal-to-noise data called features. When the model is used in operation, it needs the same types of features that it was trained on (e.g., how many times you used your credit card during the previous week), but the online feature store should have low latency to keep the end-to-end latency of using a model low. Using a model requires both retrieving the features from the online feature store and then sending them to the model for prediction.&nbsp;</p><p>Hopsworks has been using NDB Cluster as our online feature store from its first release. It has the unique combination of low latency, high availability, high throughput, and scalable storage that we call LATS. However, we knew we could make it even better as an online feature store in the cloud, so we asked one of the world’s leading database developers to do it - the person who invented NDB, Mikael Ronström. Together we have made RonDB, a key-value store with SQL capabilities, that is the world’s most advanced and performant online feature store. Although NDB Cluster is open-source, its adoption has been hampered by an undeserved reputation of being challenging to configure and operate. With <a href="https://www.rondb.com/?utm_source=rondb" target="_blank">RonDB</a>, we overcome this limitation by providing it as a managed service in the cloud on AWS and Azure.<strong>‍</strong></p><h3><strong>Requirements for an Online Feature Store</strong>‍</h3><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/60364af8c8f5d47b1f1f70ce_graph_white.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The main requirements from a database used as an online feature store are: low latency, high throughput for mixed read/write operations, high availability and the ability to store large data sets (larger than fit on a single host). We unified these properties in a single muscular term <strong>LATS</strong>:</p><p><a href="https://www.rondb.com/?utm_source=rondb" target="_blank">‍<strong>LATS</strong>: low <strong>L</strong>atency, high <strong>A</strong>vailability, high <strong>T</strong>hroughput, scalable <strong>S</strong>torage.&nbsp;</a></p><p>RonDB is not without competition as the premier choice as an online feature store. To quote Khan and Hassan from DoorDash, it should be a low latency database:&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/11/19/building-a-gigascale-ml-feature-store-with-redis/?utm_source=rondb" target="_blank">“latency on feature stores is a part of model serving, and model serving latencies tend to be in the low milliseconds range. Thus, read latency has to be proportionately lower.”&nbsp;</a></p><p>To that end, Redis fits this requirement as it is an in-memory key-value store (without SQL capabilities). Redis is open source (BSD Licence), and it enjoys popularity as an online feature store. Doordash even invested significant resources in increasing Redis’ storage capacity as an online feature store, by adding custom serialization and compression schemes. Significantly, similar to RonDB, it provides sub-millisecond latency for single key-value store operations. There are other databases that have been proposed as online feature stores, but they were not considered in this post as they have significantly higher latency (over one order-of-magnitude!), such as DynamoDB, BigTable, and SpliceMachine.</p><p>As such, we thought it would be informative to compare the performance of RonDB and Redis as an online feature store. <strong>The comparison was between Redis open-source and RonDB open-source</strong> (the commercial version of Redis does not allow any benchmarks). In addition to our benchmark, we compare the innards of RonDB’s multithreading architecture to the commercial Redis products (since our benchmark identifies CPU scalability bottlenecks in Redis that commercial products claim to overcome).<br></p><h2>Benchmark: RonDB vs Redis</h2><p>In this simple benchmark, I wanted to compare apples with apples, so I compared open-source RonDB to the open-source version of Redis, since the commercial versions disallow reporting any benchmarks. In the benchmark, I deliberately hobble the performance of RonDB by configuring it with only a single database thread, as Redis is <a href="https://redis.io/topics/benchmarks/utm_source=rondb" target="_blank">“a single-threaded server from the POV of command execution”</a>. I then proceed to describe the historical evolution of RonDB’s multithreaded architecture, consisting of three different generations, and how open-source Redis is still at the first generation, while commercial Redis products are now at generation two.</p><p>Firstly, for our single-threaded database benchmark, we performed our experiments on a 32-core Lenovo P620 workstation with 64 GB of RAM. We performed key-value lookups. Our experiments show that a single-threaded RonDB instance reached around 1.1M reads per second, while Redis reached more than 800k reads per second - both with a mean latency of around 25 microseconds. The throughput benchmark performed batch reads with 50 reads per batch and had 16 threads issuing batch requests in parallel. Batching reads/writes improves throughput at the cost of increased latency.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/6037dae7ff678a83e8eaf1a8_performance.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>On the same 32-core server, both RonDB and Redis reached around 600k writes per second when performing SET for Redis and INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE operations for RonDB. For high availability, both of those tests were done with a setup using two replicas in both RonDB and in Redis.<br></p><h3><strong>Low latency</strong></h3><p>We expected that the read latency and throughput of RonDB and Redis would be similar since both require two network jumps to read data. In case of updates (and writes/deletes), Redis should have lower latency since an update is only performed on the main replica before returning. That is, Redis only supports asynchronous replication from the main replica to a backup replica, which can result in data loss on failure of the main node. In contrast, RonDB performs an update using a synchronous replication protocol that requires 6 messages (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/MySQL-Cluster-7-5-Inside-Out/dp/9176998142/utm_source=rondb" target="_blank">a non-blocking version of two-phase commit</a>). Thus, the expected latency is 3 times higher for RonDB for writes.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>High Throughput</strong></h3><p>A comparison of latency and throughput shows that RonDB already has a slight advantage in a single-threaded architecture, but with its third-generation multithreaded architecture, described below, RonDB has an even bigger performance advantage compared to Redis commercial or open-source. RonDB can be scaled up by adding more CPUs and memory or scaled out, by automatically sharding the database.&nbsp; As early as 2013, we developed a benchmark with NDB Cluster (RonDB’s predecessor) that showed how <a href="http://mikaelronstrom.blogspot.com/2015/03/200m-reads-per-second-in-mysql-cluster.html?utm_source=rondb" target="_blank">NDB could handle 200M Reads per second</a> in a large cluster of 30 data nodes with 28 cores each.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>High Availability</strong></h3><p>The story on high availability is different. A write in Redis is only written to one replica. The replication to other replicas is then done asynchronously, thus consistency can be seriously affected by failures and data can be lost. An online feature store must accept writes that change the online features constantly in parallel with all the batched key reads. Thus handling node failures in an online feature store must be very smooth.<br></p><p>Given that an online feature store may need to scale to millions of writes per second as part of a normal operation, this means that a failed node can cause millions of writes to be lost, affecting the correctness and quality of any models that it is feeding with data. RonDB has transactional capabilities that ensure that transactions can be retried in the event of such partial failures. Thus, as long as the database cluster is not fully down, no transactions will be lost.<br></p><p>In many cases the data comes from external data sources into the online Feature Store, so a replay of the data is possible, but an inconsistent state of the database can easily lead to extra unavailability in failure situations. Since an online feature store is often used in mission-critical services, this is clearly not desirable.<br></p><p>RonDB updates all replicas synchronously as part of writes. Thus, if a node running the transaction coordinator or a participant fails, the cluster will automatically fail over to the surviving nodes, a new transaction coordinator will be elected (non-blocking), and no committed transactions will be lost. This is a key feature of RonDB and has been tested in the most demanding applications for more than 15 years and tested thousands of times on a daily basis.<br></p><p>Additionally it can be mentioned that in a highly available setup, in a cloud environment RonDB can read any replica and still see the latest changes whereas Redis will have to read the main replica to get a consistent view of the data and this will, in this case, require communicating across availability zones which can easily add milliseconds to latency for reads. RonDB will automatically setup the cluster such that applications using the <a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/research/distributed-hierarchical-file-systems-strike-back-in-the-cloud?utm_source=rondb" target="_blank">APIs will read replicas that are located in the same availability zone</a>. Thus in those setups RonDB will always be able to read the latest version of the data and still deliver data at the lowest possible latency. <strong>Redis setups will have to choose between delivering consistent data with higher latency or inconsistent data with low latency in this setup.</strong><br></p><h3><strong>Scalable Storage</strong></h3><p>Redis only supports in-memory data - this means that Redis will not be able to support online Feature Stores that store lots of data. In contrast, RonDB can store data both in-memory and on-disk, and with support for up to 144 database nodes in a cluster, it can scale to clusters of up to 1PB in size.<br></p><h3><strong>Analysis: Three Generations of Multithread Architectures</strong></h3><p>For our single-threaded benchmark, we did not expect there to be, nor were there, any major differences in throughput or latency for either read or write operations. The purpose of the benchmark was to show that both databases are similar in how efficiently they use a single CPU. RonDB and Redis are both in-memory databases, but the implementation details of their multithreaded architectures matters for scalability (how efficiently they handle increased resources), as we will see.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Firstly, <a href="https://redis.io/topics/benchmarks/utm_source=rondb" target="_blank">“Redis is not designed to benefit from multiple CPU cores. People are supposed to launch several Redis instances to scale out on several cores if needed.”</a> For our use-case of online feature stores, it is decidedly non-trivial to partition a feature store across multiple redis instances. Therefore, commercial …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p><a href="http://blackboxframework.org/">blackboxframework.org</a></p><p>
Blackbox is a free and open source programming environment for the Component Pascal language, developed by the Swiss company Oberon Microsystems. The environment supports dynamic loading of modules (compiled into machine code) and garbage collection, i.e. provides its own component object model. Writing, compiling, executing, testing can be done inside an integrated environment, which greatly increases the productivity of the programmer. Blackbox is an operating environment (a kind of micro-OS) that runs on top of a regular OS. This operating environment can be included in whole or in part in the final application (along with the compiler), allowing this application to be easily extended and rebuilt on the fly.

There is no shared state between them, instead, they interact via message passing. This has the advantage that actors become trivial to paralellize (in Erlang, an actor is called a <em>process</em>) and errors became easier to handle.</p><p id="3a04">The actor model is a concurrency p<span id="rmm">a</span>radigm created by Carl Hewitt in 1973 with the goal of making the task of writing concurrent programs simpler. It is based on the idea of actors, entities that can only send, receive and process messages. By reducing the amount of shared state it reduces the need of locks for synchronization. There exists several battle-tested implementations of the Actor Model such as Erlang/OTP, Akka (Scala/Java) and Orleans (C#).</p><p id="b028">In this interview, we chat with Leandro Ostera, the founder of Abstract Machines. Ostera is working on LAM, The Little Actor Machine, an embeddable virtual machine for the actor model that runs native or compiles to WebAssembly.</p><p id="32e1"><em>The questions for this interview were thought by Juan Pablo Amoroso, Javier Chatruc &amp; Federico Carrone. Joaquín Centeno and Juan Bono wrote the introduction and edited the article.</em></p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="d09c"><strong>Tell us a bit about your project lab, Abstract Machines. What kind of work do you do?</strong></p><p id="22fa">I started Abstract Machines with a single goal in mind: build tools that would help me think more clearly.</p><p id="9e03">Right now what I do think about the most is writing software. I think typed languages help me think clearly, so I’m building Caramel, an OCaml for the BEAM. I also think that understanding the program that runs your programs is fundamental to thinking clearly about the quality of what you build, so I’m building LAM, an actor-model VM.</p><p id="c436"><strong>LAM’s tagline is “A Little Actor Machine that runs on Native and WebAssembly”. Could you give us a brief overview of the actor system?</strong></p><p id="dca4">The original name was Leandro’s Abstract Machine. Like Prolog’s WAM was named after Warren, Warren’s Abstract Machine, and the early Erlang VM was JAM after Joe’s Abstract Machine. But Little I think it’s a much better name overall: LAM should be small, tiny even.</p><p id="6bf0">The actor system it implements is in spirit very close to Erlang’s take on the actor model — processes with mailboxes, message passing across them, fair scheduling through reduction counting. There’s a few more things in the roadmap, like process linking and monitoring. Overall, if you have worked with Erlang or Elixir before, you should feel right at home with LAM.</p><p id="e673"><strong>What is the motivation behind LAM? Why build a BEAM alternative?</strong></p><p id="05cb">LAM’s mission is to make Actor concurrency available everywhere by providing a specified, lightweight runtime. Think LuaVM meets the Actor Model. I’ve always liked the LuaVM, there’s a certain elegance to it that I find very appealing.</p><p id="f192">One of the reasons to build an alternative is that the BEAM is rather large, and the implementation is the only real spec. [Erik Stenmans’ Beam Book] or [kvavks Beam Wisdoms] have tried to document it, but without an official effort to produce a JVM style spec (like the one you can get in a bookshelf), it’s unlikely we will have a reliable drop-in alternative any time soon.</p><p id="ec18">So I thought I could instead make a new thing that could learn from both the LuaVM and the BEAM. At 35 instructions, LAM can run an interesting amount of Erlang programs, in fact I’d like most code that runs on the BEAM to be bytecode-translatable to run on LAM. Not all of it tho, and we’ll see what doesn’t make the cut.</p><p id="a6a3"><strong>One of LAM’s targets is WebAssembly. Is there any alternative actor system for the web? How do they compare with LAM?</strong></p><p id="3b25">Yes, there are plenty! A most promising one these days is Lunatic, but on the Erlang side of things, there’s the up-and-coming Lumen.</p><p id="871a">Most of the rest are libraries for building actor applications in other languages, like how Actix lets you use Actors in Rust. Lumen in particular is more of a compiler + runtime that brings Erlang down to LLVM and gives you this single optimized executable.</p><p id="7414">LAM by contrast is a higher level VM: you feed it bytecode (spawn, send, receive, call, make list, etc), and as it runs it, side-effects happen through FFI/Bindings depending on the platform.</p><p id="a15e">Around LAM there’s a tiny compilation toolchain that takes that bytecode, lowers it to something that can be run a little faster, and packs it <em>with the VM</em> in a single binary that is optimized for a specific platform.</p><p id="3bf4">Because the VM is tiny, and the FFIs are pluggable, it’s straightforward to compile it to WebAssembly and run your bytecode there.</p><p id="e3b3"><strong>The documentation mentions that one of the goals is to support Erlang/OTP’s supervision tree structure. Would this allow more reliable/resilient web UIs, capable of gracefully recovering from errors?</strong></p><p id="848e">Absolutely! I expect it to let you build even more natural and flexible UIs. After all the “event” model fits perfectly: when process Button receives message Click, do this/that.</p><p id="b621">The main problem is that preemptive scheduling makes it impossible to guarantee certain processes will have enough time to make stuff like animations run smoothly. But I’m borrowing the idea of dirty schedulers and considering introducing Greedy Processes instead, that can either request upfront how much time they need, or just run to completion. Definitely interesting to experiment with hard-real time scheduling as well.</p><p id="69ed"><strong>What are some interesting use cases for LAM?</strong></p><p id="0aac">Off the top of my head, there’s 2. The first one is perhaps why I want it the most these days: fast cli tools. Write ’em in Erlang/Elixir/Caramel, ships as a single binary.</p><p id="1e96">The second one will have the largest impact on how we build for the BEAM: actually writing full-stack applications in a single BEAM Language.</p><p id="df52">Write your backend in Elixir and run it on the BEAM, write your frontend in Elixir too but run it on LAM. And it doesn’t have to be a web-based app, it could be an actual native GUI application too.</p><p id="0045"><strong>Why write it in Rust? Is the Rust-WASM toolchain mature enough to target WASM reliably with LAM?</strong></p><p id="aa48">I love Rust. It’s a good language and the learning curve has certainly taught me a lot about how to build software. I think the Rust-wasm toolchain is pretty mature these days too.</p><p id="9104"><strong>Besides performance (LAM compiles AOT), what will be the advantages of LAM over the BEAM?</strong></p><p id="479e">Really the AOT stuff I can’t consider an advantage — I don’t expect LAM to be fundamentally faster than the BEAM, especially after the BeamJIT work. Nor do I expect it to compete in speed with Lumen.</p><p id="fc63">What I see as an advantage is that LAM is being built to have a Specification and to be Embeddable.</p><p id="2cd6"><strong>WebAssembly lacks a garbage collector and the BEAM is a GC environment. How does LAM tackle this?</strong></p><p id="059d">There is a wasm-gc spec in the works, and some other folks are waiting on it as well (like the OCaml-wasm efforts).</p><p id="52f6">But since WebAssembly isn’t the only LAM target, we’ll have to embed a GC anyway. I expect it to work very closely to the BEAMs (per process collections, ref counted binary strings, etc). I haven’t looked so deeply into this, but I have a chunky book waiting for me (The Garbage Collection Handbook).</p><p id="26bf"><strong>Is this a solo project or are you looking for contributors? If you are looking for contributors, how should they get started (first issues, roadmap, etc)?</strong></p><p id="48d2">So far it is just me, but I’d love to build a friendly and welcoming community around it. At the moment I’ve been focused on getting this vertical slice of the project up and running so it becomes easier to do some horizontal scoping: how far along are we with the specification, or how much of the BEAM bytecode can we support via translation.</p><p id="2ea9">There’s tons of work to do starting at the design level. From figuring out how to build the right layers to FFIs across platforms (native, wasi, web), to how to optimize the main emulator loop to crunch the bytecode as fast as possible, to GC and bundling the final binaries, to writing the spec and the manual.</p><p id="967a">Formalizing the spec is a big topic where I hope I can get some interest from the TLA+ community to guide me into doing justice to both TLA+ and LAM.</p><p id="e341">LAM could use help across the board, so if you’re reading this please tweet at me (<a href="https://twitter.com/leostera/" rel="noopener">@leostera</a>)!</p><p id="ee97"><strong>For our last question, in general, what are your favorite books, articles or resources for programmers?</strong></p><p id="889c">I think that if you asked me this a year ago I would have regurgitated a bunch of books that I should list here, but that didn’t really further my understanding. There’s a lot of reference material that is just terrible for learning, because its meant to be a compendium of information rather than a pedagogically written introduction to a subject.</p><p id="8aa0">For example, Types and Programming Languages by Benjamin Pierce is deemed <em>the ultimate</em> reference for type stuff. But I learned more about the nature of typing by reading The Little Typer. After that it was a lot easier to get into the right headspace to understand what Pierce wanted me to get out of the book.</p><p id="b1fa">So if you’re getting into a subject, don’t rush for the ultimate reference, and find something written to teach you <em>the core</em> of the subject. Then the rest becomes a little easier.</p><p id="35f0">Virtual Machines by Iain D. Craig, and Formal Development of a Network-Centric RTOS have been very useful in working with LAM. Hillel Wayne’s Practical TLA+, and Alloy’s Software Abstraction books have been really good to get a better grip on how to specify systems as well. Of course <a href="http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/book.html" rel="noopener">“Specifying Systems” by Lamport</a> has been a good reference as well.</p><p id="17c4">Some books that have had a massive impact in how I think and communicate have (unsurprisingly) nothing to do with computers. Like Umberto Eco’s “6 Walks in the Fictional Woods” (focused on how to create narratives and rhetoric) or Mandelbrot’s “The (Mis)Behavior of Markets” (a historical account of how fractal geometry describes better the financial markets). Nonetheless, they’ve helped shape the way I think and I’ve come out a better programmer.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2/0*nPPWbd4-7dJavk5P.gif" width="1" height="1" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/0*nPPWbd4-7dJavk5P.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></figure></div></div></section></div>]]>

Steampipe, an open-source project from <a href="https://turbot.com/">Turbot</a>, enables cloud pros (e.g. software developers, operations engineers and security teams) to query their favorite cloud services with SQL.</p><p>The heart of Steampipe is an intuitive command line interface (CLI) that solves the challenges encountered when asking questions of cloud resources and services. Traditional tools and custom scripts that provide visibility into these services are cumbersome, inconsistent across providers and painful to maintain. Steampipe provides a consistent, explorable and interactive approach across IaaS, PaaS and SaaS services.</p></div><div><div><div><div><div><p>&gt;</p><div><pre><code><p><span>select</span><span> </span></p><p><span>  region</span><span>,</span><span> </span></p><p><span>  instance_state </span><span>as</span><span> state</span><span>,</span><span> </span></p><p><span>  instance_type </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>type</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>from</span><span> </span></p><p><span>  aws_ec2_instance</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div><div><pre>

Steampipe v0.2.0 delivers an even faster response to those questions with our preview of <a href="https://steampipe.io/#blazing-fast-query-response-with-new-query-caching">query caching</a>, and enables you to do more work in each query with our new <a href="https://steampipe.io/#aws-multi-region-queries-with-steampipe">multi-region</a> and <a href="https://steampipe.io/#connection-configuration-management-in-steampipe">connection configuration</a> features.</p><h2 id="aws-multi-region-queries-with-steampipe">AWS multi-region queries with Steampipe</h2><p>Starting with version <code>0.2.0</code> of the Steampipe CLI and version <code>0.5.0</code> of the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws">Steampipe AWS Plugin</a> you can perform multi-region queries that execute in parallel against all AWS regions within your account (see below for multi-account too).</p><br><div><div><div><div><p>&gt;</p><div><pre><code><p><span>.</span><span>timing </span><span>on</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>select</span><span></span></p><p><span>  region</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  instance_id</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  instance_state</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  instance_type</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  title</span></p><p><span></span><span>from</span><span> </span></p><p><span>  aws_ec2_instance</span><span>;</span></p></code><span></span></pre></div></div></div><div><pre>

When you execute a query it fans out concurrent connections to the configured regions, aggregates the results and then presents them to you as one result set.

Everyone has multiple Slack channels and Github repositories that we work with and most cloud pros have multiple AWS accounts that they work with on a daily basis.</p><p>The latest Steampipe release now makes it even easier to work with (and across multiple api connections). This example shows how to configure multiple AWS accounts in a single Steampipe configuration:</p><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>connection </span><span>"dmi_scranton"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  plugin      = </span><span>"aws"</span><span> </span></p><p><span>  profile     = </span><span>"scranton"</span><span></span></p><p><span>  regions     = </span><span>[</span><span>"us-east-2"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>connection </span><span>"dmi_albany"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  plugin      = </span><span>"aws"</span><span> </span></p><p><span>  profile     = </span><span>"albany"</span><span></span></p><p><span>  regions     = </span><span>[</span><span>"us-east-1"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span> </span></p><p><span>connection </span><span>"dmi_global"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  plugin      = </span><span>"aws"</span><span> </span></p><p><span>  profile     = </span><span>"dmi_corp"</span><span></span></p><p><span>  regions     = </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>"eu-west-1"</span><span>,</span><span> </span></p><p><span>    </span><span>"eu-west-2"</span><span>,</span><span> </span></p><p><span>    </span><span>"us-east-1"</span><span>,</span><span> </span></p><p><span>    </span><span>"us-east-2"</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>In the example above, I chose different <code>[profiles]</code> from my <code>~/.aws/config</code> configuration for the connection credentials.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy">Privacy on the Internet</a> is important because privacy risks range from the gathering of statistics on users to more malicious acts such as the spreading of spyware and the exploitation of various forms of bugs (software faults). Many companies, such as Google, track which websites people visit and then use the information, for instance by sending advertising based on one's web browsing history. Sometimes prices on products are changed on the same website, depending on tracking information, and two people may view the exact same product on the exact same website yet be presented with very different prices.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This article isn't specifically about privacy issues only, it's about promises that are being broken, which might be about privacy. It is also about the lack of user freedom, as in the choice to enable or disable features, such as automatic updates, or forced usage of third party services, or software that the user generally is unaware of or don't have a say about.</p>

<p>Privacy as a subject regarding the usage of services on the Internet is a very difficult subject to deal with. Not only can it be difficult to actually define privacy, but it also requires a balance between freedom of choice by the users, security and usability. Naturally you need to be able to use the browser on the Internet and as such you will always leave some kind of trail behind, and this article is not about how you can hide your tracks. What I am addressing in this article are browsers that are either promoted as "privacy-respecting" by the developers, or in general are considered to be so (mostly due to misunderstanding or misinformation), while it is very clear they are not.</p>

<p>Some browsers either directly violate users by collecting telemetric data without consent, or you have to opt-out rather than opt-in, or they bounce around the Internet visiting places in the background without you knowing (using dns-prefetch or automatic updates etc.), using third party services that operates with a privacy policy you either cannot trust, or that are directly violating your privacy, or they have integrated third party software that do some of these things.</p>

<p>I will try to keep this article updated with relevant information as much as possible. I know several other browsers exist, but if they are not mentioned on this list I have either not had a change to investigate them, they are closed source and completely irrelevant (such as Microsoft Edge or Opera), or they are not actively maintained, or they cannot perhaps be trusted for some reason or another.</p>

<p>I will also <b>not</b> be looking at browsers that only work on Microsoft Windows or macOS, even if they are Open Source. Both Microsoft Windows and macOS are highly controversial and completely untrustworthy operating systems.</p>

<p>Also please note that just because the developers of a browser are promising that their browser is privacy-respecting doesn't mean that you can trust the information. As you will see with the examples of some of the browsers below even developers some times compromise user privacy perhaps without even thinking about it.</p>

<p>I also want to make a strong advice to people recommending browsers to other people without investigation or knowledge. The <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/">privacy related channel on Reddit</a> is filled with wrong recommendations regarding privacy-respecting browsers and many people are merely guessing or blindly trusting the information the browser producers are publishing. Neither Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or Chromium, Brave, Waterfox, or several of the other recommended browsers truly respect privacy. They all do some form of telemetry and/or privacy-compromising actions without the user consenting to it or even knowing about it.</p>

<p>Also, privacy doesn't mean that you simply pull out telemetry from Firefox, rebrand it, and then ship it. Privacy is more than that. Unless the browser is automatically checking for an updated version, and the website isn't logging that request, it cannot be considered truly private if the browser starts bouncing around on the Internet visiting all kinds of places without the user has done anything more than open the browser up! Every time the browser makes a DNS request, that DNS request is in most cases logged unless the user actively does something to mitigate that - such as using a trusted VPN or non-logging DNS service etc. Furthermore, the Mozilla add-on CDN is logging user activity, as is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_CloudFront">Amazon Cloudfront</a>, so if the browser visits these places without the user explicitly pushes a "check for updates" option, the browser is compromising user privacy. The point I'm trying to make is that the user needs to have the choice and that nothing happens until the user actively do something.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, if you discover any mistakes on my part, feel free to email me about it so that I can correct the information.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-compromising">Privacy compromising browsers</h2>

<h3 id="firefox">Mozilla Firefox</h3>
<p>In the past I have always supported Mozilla and promoted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox</a>, but Mozilla has made some pretty controversial decisions as of late and I no longer feel that Mozilla is an organization that deserves any support. Not unless they change the way they conduct their business.</p>
<p>Firefox is promoted by Mozilla as a privacy-respecting browser, but this is highly misleading. Firefox "phones home" every time you start it up even when you have disabled telemetry and automatic updates of extensions. Domains such as mozilla.org, cloudfront.net, firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com (see: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1598562#c12">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1598562#c12</a>), autopush.prod.mozaws.net, detectportal.firefox.com and location.services.mozilla.com are visited each time you start Firefox.</p>
<p>In 2017 Mozilla made a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliqz#Integration_with_Firefox">deal with Cliqz</a> where approximately 1% of users downloading Firefox in Germany would receive a version with Cliqz software included. And in 2018 Mozilla revealed that they had no data on the number of Firefox installations with disabled Telemetry.</p>
<p>Mozilla then developed the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1487578">Telemetry Coverage</a> system and distributed it to 1% of the Firefox installations. The system is automatically installed and designed to inform Mozilla whether telemetry is enabled in the browser.</p>
<p>Mozilla also <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/telemetry-collection-windows-default-browser-trend">developed a Windows-only scheduled task</a> which runs in the background once a day for each installation of Firefox installed on a computer running Microsoft Windows. The task collects information related to the system's current and previous default browser setting and the operating system locale and version.</p>
<p>This is a list of some of the things that Mozilla collects: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/#suggest-relevant-content">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/#suggest-relevant-content</a>.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/">Mozilla website</a> we can read (when I originally started writing this article) that <q>We put people over profit</q>, and <q>a product to support user privacy</q>. We can also read in the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla manifesto</a>, in the fourth principle, that <q>Individuals' security and privacy on the internet are fundamental and must not be treated as optional.</q> However, with their decision to make Cloudflare the default DNS provider for DNS over HTTPS, they are definitely not supporting user privacy or putting people over profit!</p>
<p>DNS over HTTPS is by itself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxTdEEuyxHU">bad enough</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS#Criticism">highly criticized</a> with <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/dns-over-https-causes-more-problems-than-it-solves-experts-say/">very good reason</a>, but combining it with a US based company like Cloudflare makes it even worse. Cloudflare <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/d52kop/eli5_why_cloudflare_is_depicted_as_evil_and_whats/f0jrxox/">cannot be trusted</a> with DNS requests.</p>
<p>Cloudflare has made an <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/firefox/">agreement</a> with Mozilla that when it acts as a DNS resolver for Firefox, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>DNS requests will be stored as part of Cloudflare's "temporary" logs which are permanently deleted within 24 hours.</li>
<li>Cloudflare will also collect and store the following information as part of its permanent logs:
<ul>
<li>Total number of requests processed by each Cloudflare co-location facility.</li>
<li>Aggregate list of all domain names requested.</li>
<li>Samples of domain names queried along with the times of such queries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Information stored in Cloudflare's permanent logs will be anonymized and may be held indefinitely by Cloudflare for its own internal research and development purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone who has worked with DNS servers knows what goes into such logs and in order for Cloudflare to keep their promise they need to: Delete the DNS requests information, but at the same time somehow still keep "anonymized" logs of the total number of requests, a list of all domain names requested, a so-called "sample" of complete DNS queries along with date and time.</p>
<p>This means that even if Cloudflare could be trusted and they have the best of intentions, they will still log everything the first 24 hours. If Cloudflare is ever compromised all these logs could be copied and distributed over a period of time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the actual wording of the agreement is such that the technical procedure for how they actually do this can only be guessed at. How do they plan to anonymize the data? Is the "sample" 99.9% of all the queries, or is it 1%?</p>
<p>Last, but not least, Cloudflare is an American company subject to American law, a law that pretty much undermines the foundation of any kind of privacy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cloudflare will not retain or sell or transfer to any third party (except as may be required by law) any personal information, IP addresses or other user identifiers from the DNS queries sent from the Firefox browser to the Cloudflare Resolver for Firefox;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Real privacy means:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>No logging</b></li>
<li><b>No data retention</b></li>
<li><b>No phoning home without consent before doing so</b></li>
<li><b>No user opt-out telemetry, it has to be opt-in</b></li>
<li><b>Real and 100% transparency regarding …</b></li></ul></article></div>

            <p>I love box-fan based air purifiers. They are cheap, trivial to build, and people around the world have done experiments to show they <a href="https://dynomight.net/2020/12/15/some-real-data-on-a-DIY-box-fan-air-purifier/">actually work</a>.</p>

<p>Still, box-fan purifiers have two downsides: They create a lot of noise, and they consume a fair amount of electricity.</p>

<p>I wanted a new design that preserves the best aspects of using a box-fan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cheap.</li>
  <li>Easily built with no tools.</li>
  <li>No proprietary parts.</li>
  <li>Good at purifying the air.</li>
</ol>

<p>The design should also fix the worst parts of using a box fan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make less noise.</li>
  <li>Use less electricity.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think I’ve found such a design. Behold, the Cuboid:</p>

<p>I’ve done some experiments comparing this to a <a href="https://dynomight.net/2020/12/15/some-real-data-on-a-DIY-box-fan-air-purifier/">box-fan based purifier</a>, using the same filters.  Here’s a summary.</p>

<p>Less is better for everything except the clean air delivery rate (CADR). The half-life is calculated in a 31 m³ room. Electricity costs assume operation 24 hours/day at 1 kWh = $0.13.</p>

<p>As you can see, the cuboid gives major improvements in noise and electricity consumption, with small regressions in cost, difficulty of construction, and IED resemblance. Particularly on low, the cuboid is very quiet and energy-efficient. Somewhat accidentally, it’s also better at removing particles.</p>

<h2 id="the-fanfilter-tradeoff">The fan/filter tradeoff</h2>

<p>Air purifiers push air through filters. If you’ve ever built a box-fan-based air purifier, you noticed that once you attach HEPA filters, throughput decreases dramatically. If you use a weak fan, it will barely push any air at all.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, if you want to increase purification, you have two options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Big fan</strong>: Keep the same amount of filter, but run a bigger/faster motor to push air through it faster.</li>
  <li><strong>Big filter</strong>: Keep the same fan, but install more filters in parallel. This will decrease the pressure on each of them, meaning more total airflow.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we want to be quiet and energy-efficient, the choice is clear: Use a relatively weak fan, but with a large a filter surface area.</p>

<p>Using more filters has a higher upfront cost — filters aren’t free. However, that extra cost disappears over time. If each filter can remove a fixed amount of particulates before it needs to be replaced, then doubling the number of filters means also doubling the replacement interval.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-build-it">How to build it</h2>

<p>(Contact me if you want the exact products I used.)</p>

<h3 id="materials-used">Materials used</h3>

<ul>
  <li>An 8inch (20.32cm) diameter inline duct booster fan ($30).</li>
  <li>Four HEPA air filters, each approximately 32 cm x 22 cm and 5cm thick ($70 for all).</li>
  <li>Two bungee cords (free).</li>
  <li>Tape (free).</li>
  <li>Two pieces of packaging foam (free).</li>
</ul>

<p>Inline duct <em>booster</em> fans are fairly weak fans often used to help with grow rooms or range hoods. An <em>inline duct fan</em> would probably perform even better (see the <a href="#discussion">discussion</a>) but at a higher cost. The one I bought is rated to push around 12 m³ of air per minute.</p>

<p>You can use filters and fans of different sizes if you want. All that matters is that the fan has a smaller diameter than the filters (20.32 cm &lt; 22 cm). The pieces of foam also need to be at least as large as the matching dimension of the filter. I just used the foam that my fan was shipped in.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-form-a-column-out-of-the-filters">Step 1: Form a column out of the filters</h3>

<p>Take the four filters, and assemble them into a vertical structure. Be careful to align the edges as you see in the middle, with two sides slightly “inside” of the other sides.</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/cuboid_purifier/step1.jpg" alt="Step 1 of construction" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>This column is somewhat unstable, but we’ll deal with that.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-cut-out-a-base-for-the-column">Step 2: Cut out a base for the column</h3>

<p>Cut one piece of foam to the size of the square at the bottom of the filter column (I taped over a hole in the foam I used.) Place it at the bottom.</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/cuboid_purifier/step2.jpg" alt="Step 2 of construction" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>I did this by setting the filters on top of the foam, tracing out the shape with a pencil, and then cutting the foam with scissors. You probably want to err on the side of making it larger and trim if necessary. It should fit firmly so that it’s held in place by the filters.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, you could also probably skip this step. I did that in an early version and it was OK. However, this adds a lot of stability allows the purifier to work even if it isn’t on top of a flat surface. You could also substitute some other material for the foam.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-cut-out-a-base-for-the-fan">Step 3: Cut out a base for the fan</h3>

<p>Cut another piece of foam so that it supports the fan from below while holding the fan in place. This should be large enough so that that the piece will sit on top of the filters.</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/cuboid_purifier/step3.jpg" alt="Step 3 of construction" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>As you can see, the foam was missing a corner, which I solved inelegantly by gluing on a piece of cardboard.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-set-the-fan-on-the-filter-column">Step 4: Set the fan on the filter column</h3>

<p>Set the fan+foam on top of the filters, oriented so it will blow air <em>upward</em>, and pull air through the filters.</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/cuboid_purifier/step4.jpg" alt="Step 4 of construction" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>That’s it, you’re done. The top is only held on by gravity, plus pressure if it’s on. You could obviously make this more stable or beautiful, but I wanted to focus on a design that’s <em>really</em> easy to build.</p>

<h2 id="cost">Cost</h2>

<p>The only significant cost is the fan ($30) and the filters ($70 for 4). This is more expensive than a box fan design, where the fan costs $19 and you only need 2 or 3 filters. However, as mentioned <a href="#the-fanfilter-tradeoff">above</a>, the cost of extra filters evens out in the long run since they need to be replaced half as often.</p>

<h2 id="measuring-filtering-performance">Measuring filtering performance</h2>

<h3 id="experimental-setup">Experimental setup</h3>

<p>I did experiments in a room with a volume of around 31 m³. To generate smoke, I cut 5 credit-card length sticks of incense and placed them on one end of a table. On the other end of the table, I placed a tablet that took a time-lapse video of a particle counter and a stopwatch. I then manually transcribed the measurements from this video.</p>

<p>The purifier (box fan or cuboid) was on the ground around a meter from the particle counter.</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/cuboid_purifier/setup.jpg" alt="setup for measuring air purification performance" loading="lazy">
</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>

<p>As a comparison, I attached three of the same filters to a box fan (Literally the <em>same</em> filters).</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/cuboid_purifier/boxfan.jpg" alt="DIY box fan compared to">
</p>


<p>Here are the results with the cuboid. Note that the y-axis is logarithmic. The straight lines indicate that particulates are decreasing at an exponential rate.</p>

<p><br>
Here are the results of the box fan.</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/cuboid_purifier/boxfan_performance_cropped.svg" alt="performance of the box fan on different fan speeds" loading="lazy">
</p>



<p>You’ll notice two things. First and most importantly, the slopes for the cuboid graphs are steeper. This indicates better performance.</p>

<p>Second, the particles peak at higher values with the cuboid. I believe this is because the incense was near the particle counter on a table, while the purifiers were sitting on the floor 2m away. If the air isn’t disturbed, it takes a while before smoke drifts over the purifier and it actually starts doing anything. However, the box fan creates so much wind that the smoke immediately diffuses around the room and the box-fan purifier essentially gets a “head start”.</p>

<p>While wind seems to help here, it could be harmful in other cases. I discuss this more <a href="#when-is-airflow-helpful">below</a>.</p>

<h3 id="fitting-exponential-curves">Fitting exponential curves</h3>

<p>The y-axes in the plots above are logarithmic. As you can see from the dotted lines, these are well-fit by straight lines. This is what we’d expect if a fixed fraction of the air were being cleaned per minute.</p>

<p>The dotted lines for each curve show a fit of the form <strong>y=a×bᵐ</strong>, where <strong>y</strong> is the level of particulates, <strong>m</strong> is the number of minutes, and <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> are constants.</p>

<p>We can convert a fit of this type to a half-life: The number of minutes the purifier needs to eliminate half the particles from the air when running in a 31 m³ room.  That would be the number of minutes <strong>m</strong> such that <strong>bᵐ = .5</strong>. We can solve this equation as <strong>b = log(.5) / log(b)</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="clean-air-delivery-rate-calculations">Clean air delivery rate calculations</h3>

<p>One common way of estimating the performance of purifiers is the clean air delivery rate (CADR). If the air that came out of the purifier had zero particulates, this would just be the volume of air per unit of time.</p>

<p>The fits above were of the form <strong>y=a×bᵐ</strong>. This means that the number of particulates drops by a factor of <strong>b</strong> each minute.</p>

<p>Here’s how I calculated the CADR. Note that that if the purifier delivered <strong>(cleaned air) m³</strong> of clean air in a single minute in a room with a total volume of <strong>(all air) m³</strong>, then the particulates in a room would drop by a factor of</p>

<p><b>b=(uncleaned air)/(all air)= 1 - (cleaned air) / (all air)</b>
</p>
<p><br>
per minute. We can solve this to find that equation to get that</p>

<p><b>(cleaned air) = (all air)×(1-b).</b>
</p>


<p>I measured the dimensions of the room where I did these measurements. I estimated it was 31m³. From this, I computed the CADR for each purifier and speed as <strong>CADR = 31×(1-b)</strong>. This gives the following table of CADR rates.</p>

<p>A recent <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/1.5900782">study</a> from the University of Toronto also measured the CADR of a similar box-fan purifier. They measure around 92 ft³/min. (They don’t give numbers, but there’s a <a href="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902727.1612545406!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_1180/air-purifiers-graph.png">graph</a> CADR=100 is 130 pixels high and the box fan is 100 pixels high.)

February 26, 2021 | https://konfuzio.com/de/automatic-text-summarization-in-pdf-files | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://konfuzio.com/de/automatic-text-summarization-in-pdf-files">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Today, rising amounts of documents and the contained information have to be processed by enterprises to be able to use the hidden content. This is either done by time-expensive manual text summarization or by using an automatization solution. Automatic text summarization helps humans to efficiently process the growing volume of information.&nbsp;</p><h4>What exactly is automatic text summarization?</h4><p>The Oxford English dictionary defines automatic text summarization as “the creation of a shortened version of a text by a computer program. The product of this procedure still contains the most important points of the original text.” [1]</p><p>A good example where summarization can be useful is the annual reports of companies. Those documents contain a lot of facts that can be crucial for investors since they include information on many factors such as sustainability or environmental policies which can help for the investors‘ decision. However, the annual reports are normally very long documents with hundreds of pages, which makes their analysis a time consuming process that could be facilitated by an automatic workflow.&nbsp;</p><h2>How can we summarize text in PDF files?</h2><p>We divide the process in three main parts. For each of those steps we go more into detail in the following sections of this article. Feel free to jump right into the details or let us first walk you through the main outcomes of each step.</p><h3>1. Use Object Detection for Page Segmentation</h3><p>In the first step, we need to select those parts of the document that have to be focused on. While we can get a lot of already summarized information from images, graphs, and headlines, it is the text that is the most complete source of information. A possible way to split the document in different components is to use a computer vision approach. A model for multiclass object detection can automatically differentiate between different elements in the annual report. All content can be split into five categories: title, text, table, list, and figure. Only the found locations of the category text are used for the following steps of the summarization process.</p><h3>2. Use OCR to convert the image to text</h3><p>The next step is to convert the selected bounding boxes of the document into text. This part can be defined as an optical character recognition (OCR) problem, which was resolved using estabilished tools.&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Text Summarization of any paragraph</h3><p>The final step is the summarization of the selected content. So-called Transformers, which lately have proven to be powerful models, come to play. We used the tailored BERT model PEGASUS which is especially designed for automatic summarization. The outcome shows us a summarized version of the paragraph which we detected and extracted from the report in the first steps. The original length of 910 characters was reduced to 193 characters, leading to a time saving of almost 80%. Still, all the relevant information to understand the paragraph is included.</p><h4>This approach shrinks paragraphs in a PDF by 80 %</h4><figure><img src="https://konfuzio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/summarize_annual_report.gif" alt=""><figcaption>The result of the automatic text summarization with the PEGASUS model of one paragraph extracted from the annual report shows us a good result. Let’s step through it to check what kind of aspects are included: name of company, likelyhood of an event, amount of the fine, name of the comission.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://konfuzio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/highres_494905924-650x431.png" alt="" srcset="https://konfuzio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/highres_494905924-650x431.png 650w, https://konfuzio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/highres_494905924-300x199.png 300w, https://konfuzio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/highres_494905924-150x100.png 150w, https://konfuzio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/highres_494905924-768x510.png 768w, https://konfuzio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/highres_494905924-1536x1019.png 1536w, https://konfuzio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/highres_494905924-16x12.png 16w, https://konfuzio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/highres_494905924.png 1611w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"></figure><h4>Join our Meetup talk on the 3rd of March 2021 from 5:00 pm to 6:00 pm GMT+1.</h4><h2>Do you want to learn more right now?</h2><h3>How to use object detection for page segmentation?</h3><p>Object detection is a task where objects of a known class are identified in the image and information about its location is provided. A very known architecture for this task is the Faster R-CNN. This architecture has two outputs for each object: a class label and a bounding-box. It consists of two modules: one deep fully convolutional network to propose regions and a Fast R-CNN that detects objects in those regions.</p><figure><img src="https://konfuzio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Object-detection-600x650.jpg" alt="Faster R-CNN has two outputs for each object: a class label and a bounding-box.

Then, a separated network (the region proposal network) takes that feature map and predicts possible regions for the objects (region proposals). Those region proposals are fed to a ROI pooling layer that reshapes them into a predefined size. Finally, the output vector from the pooling layer is used to classify the proposed regions and to refine the bounding boxes.&nbsp;</p><p>More recently, Mask R-CNN, which is an extension of the Faster R-CNN, added a third output that allows to have the mask of the object. This results in having the classification, bounding box and the mask of the object.The mask prediction is done in parallel with predicting the class and the bounding box [2].</p><figure><img src="https://konfuzio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/select-paragraphs-542x650.jpg" alt=" By fine tuning a mask R-CNN model trained in the PubLayNet, we can have a model that allows us to detect those parts of the documents that correspond to text.

Other parts that already include summaries, like headlines or tables, are not relevant. So the first thing we need is an annotated dataset with the different document elements. PubLayNet is a dataset with annotations of text, figures, titles, lists and tables on more than 360 k pages of scientific papers [3]. By fine tuning a mask R-CNN model trained in the PubLayNet, we can have a model that allows us to detect those parts of the documents that correspond to text. The model that we used is available in the Detectron2 platform, which is a platform from Facebook AI Research that allows fast tests of state of art algorithms [4]. In the figure we can see the bounding boxes and the classification shown with a different color for each class, which was the result without any finetuning. For our problem we are not interested in the mask of the text, just the bounding box highlighted in blue.&nbsp;</p><p>Register for free and try out the page segmentation API with your own documents. <a href="https://app.konfuzio.com/v2/swagger/">Register to access our API documentation.</a> Using our document labeling tool you can create a dataset and fine-tune the PubLayNet model on your own documents.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/VqjsXgNjS9Na36xmpvqcFjgMbYWtyC4g_Xg0T0lDkggpol3mu1akQpHNWjj6P2T6oNBAPSpKpldVep3liFeX_egvwh2AuaZkbUBHM9wHEZcj_NnuBJ3so110A8g9Ynp45_rCTq9a" alt="Konfuzio API to segment pages via Faster R-CNN."></figure><h3>Wich is the best OCR engine?</h3><p>After having found the portion of the images that we are interested in, the next step is to extract the text from them with the use of optical character recognition (OCR). OCR can be done by computer vision approaches that can include detection, segmentation and recognition of characters but most recent approaches include a combination of CNNs and Recurrent Neural Networks.</p><p>An example of a OCR pipeline can be:</p><ul><li>Text detection – detects where the characters are located</li><li>Pre-processing – the text is normalized</li><li>Feature extraction – the output is the feature map of the image</li><li>Post processing – errors can be corrected by comparing with more common sequences of words, for example.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><a href="https://github.com/kba/awesome-ocr">Several OCR tools can be used.</a> We found the best approach to select the OCR per project.

Transformers are a type of neural network architecture introduced in 2017. They were initially designed for machine translation, but are now used for almost all modern NLP applications, such as: entity recognition, natural language inference, question answering and summarization. Transformers are able to process all incoming data in parallel, in comparison to the previous state-of-the-art models, LSTMs, which processed data sequentially. This ability for parallelization makes them easier to scale up with an exponentially growing amount of compute and data.</p><p>The main novel concept introduced in the Transformer architecture is the use of “multi-head attention”. In the Transformer each element in the input sequence is split into three vectors: Q, K, and V. Attention calculated as a weighted sum of these vectors, where the weights are both learned and are context dependent. In other words, the data input into the model decides where the model should focus its attention. Multi-headed attention implies that we split each vector into multiple “heads” and calculate attention across each head in parallel. Therefore, we perform multiple attention calculations at once, all in parallel, before combining the results together at the output. [5]</p><p>The most commonly used Transformer variant is called BERT. BERT only uses the encoder from the original Transformer with very small architecture changes. The main novelty of BERT is that it was trained as a “masked language model” on a large amount of unlabelled text. Masked language models are tasked with “filling in the blanks” of a given sentence, i.e. given a sentence replace a few of the words with a [MASK] token and then try and predict what the actual word was. It turns out that this task teaches the model a lot about natural language, so much so that it is now common to take a pre-trained BERT model and then fine-tune it your desired task. This is usually a good starting point when trying out neural networks for NLP and most NLP research is now focused on how to improve Transformer models and their variants by either tweaking the architecture or inventing a new pre-training objective.&nbsp;</p><p>PEGASUS is a model designed for automatic summarization. The architecture is similar to the original Transformer, with the decoder, but it is pre-trained on two tasks simultaneously. The first task is the masked language modeling task introduced by BERT. The second task involves predicting an entire sentence that has been masked out in the input. PEGASUS is first pre-trained trained on a huge amount of text, consisting of 1.5 billion news articles and then fine-tuned on the target dataset. It achieved state-of-the-art performance across twelve commonly used summarization datasets.

    <section>
      
      

      <p>You’ve heard of Bitcoin, and probably Ethereum. But what are non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, which people like <a href="https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/crypto-art-nft-beeple-christies-auction-token-ethereum-dada-blockchain/">Gary Vaynerchuk, Chamath and Mark Cuban are so besotted with</a>?</p>
<p>Here’s an explainer, with help from two guides to the NFT world: The art and technology writer Jason Bailey, who also makes art as Artnome; and Priyanka Desai who is vice president of operations at OpenLaw, a research organization that helps set up and run new types of blockchain-specific funding vehicles that collect NFTs.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What’s an NFT anyway?</h2>
<p>The key word in NFT is fungibility. Whereas Bitcoin is fungible, meaning each unit of bitcoin is interchangeable with another, NFTs do not have this property. Instead, NFTs are unique digital tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NFTs are really just a type of computer program that runs on a blockchain. Some NFTs are programmed as items in a game, giving them certain properties that players can use. An example of this is CryptoKitties, where players collect different NFTs, representing digital cats, which they ‘breed’ with one another to create cats with new properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other NFTs are more like digital art, and they’re linked to a specific image or sound file. They might also have certain rules programmed into them that allow the artist to collect a cut of future sales of the work, much like a royalty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many blockchains have their own NFTs. Some popular blockchains for NFTs are Ethereum, which hosts CryptoKitties and top crypto artists like Beeple; Flow, which hosts the NBA Top Shot collectible game; and Wax, which hosts crypto versions of Topps cards.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Generally, an artist uses a platform to “mint,” or create, an NFT. In theory, anyone can mint an NFT, but you’d need to write your own code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The newly minted NFT usually doesn’t contain the graphic file or other data that make up an artwork. That data is usually stored somewhere else, off-chain. It could be stored on a centralized server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An increasingly common option is to store the artwork on something called the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), a peer-to-peer network that replicates a file across many machines, acting as a form of decentralized storage, says Bailey, the artist and critic. The NFT will contain a unique signature that points to that file’s location on IPFS.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1614230229656000%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0V_mZDO1yfF9QFqOIIC52U&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614230229670000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0XhDgxg8419--QzsxQrEvS" target="_blank">The Non-Fungible Token Bible</a>&nbsp;is a good resource to go deeper on the tech.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why do NFTs have value?</h2>
<p>Why shouldn’t they? NFT investors like Mark Cuban say you should think of them as forms of digital property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as fine wines, paintings or rare trading cards can hold value, so should their digital versions. But instead of physical scarcity, crypto tokens have digital scarcity. That’s why,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://blogmaverick.com/2021/01/31/the-store-of-value-generation-is-kicking-your-ass-and-you-dont-even-know-it/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1614230229656000%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw2UpaXEikYmokoVHXMWQgM6&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614230229671000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3yC_ORIj1fWrTQ_LmPwuXx" target="_blank">according to Cuban</a>, “blockchain driven assets have now legitimately become stores of value.”</p>
<p>Priyanka Desai, of OpenLaw, agrees with Cuban’s take. Digital property is important when we increasingly spend our lives online. She puts it this way: “The whole psychological nature of feeling that your taste and general outlook is signaled through a digital property. Whether that be audio or [crypto] collectibles or anything else&nbsp;—&nbsp;it's flexing wealth or taste. It's not dissimilar to how people behave in the real world.”</p>
<p>Finally, Bailey offers an analogy to the art world: “Art has no [inherent financial] value. A Rothko painting might be worth $40 million one minute and is worthless the next if an authenticator says, hey that’s not by Mark Rothko. Nothing changes about that painting. Art’s value comes from the social agreement that it’s from this artist. When you buy [NFTs], what you are buying is a token, and the artwork is what that token looks like.”</p>
<h2>Who’s Buying These Things?</h2>
<p>Lots of big names from the tech world. There’s Mark Cuban, who’s gotten deep in the weeds and is now collecting generative&nbsp;audio-art NFTs called Eulerbeats (“<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://twitter.com/BanklessHQ/status/1364255520857731072?s%253D20%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1614230229657000%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw2vPED03Wd15b8mnRi77B1M&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614230229672000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1kOffqT7INM4UPbm5x-LcU" target="_blank">the most genius idea ever</a>”); billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya who says he’s building a “sizable collection” of tokens; and wine merchant turned tech investor Gary Vaynerchuk who seems to tweet almost exclusively about NFTs these days.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Are NFTs Going For?</h2>

<p>According to data site NonFungible.com and L’Atelier, a unit of BNP Paribas, NFT sales hit $250 million in 2020, an increase of some 300% from a year earlier.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Types of NFTs</h2>
<p>The three biggest categories for NFTs are tokens used in games; artwork and items used in “metaverses” or virtual worlds, according to data from NonFungible.com. NFT sales are pretty evenly split among them at about 25% of the market each. Sports and other collectibles make up the remainder.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Platforms</h2>
<p>NFTs can be bought on a variety of platforms. Some of these platforms lend themselves to certain types of tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Desai:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Nifty Gateway, the marketplace backed by the Winklevoss twins, is a “bridge for newbies” because they can wire dollars to their accounts there.</li>
<li>Rarible and Opensea have “wide swaths” of NFTs, everything from collectibles to digital land.</li>
<li>Foundation and Zora are “more curated” with a focus on getting “edgy and interesting” artists into NFTs.</li>
<li>Superrare is “the OG” as far as crypto curated platforms go. Cryptoartists selling works for lots of coins today got their start here.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Displaying Your NFTs</h2>
<p>After spending so much money on a unique digital object how do you show it off? You can show off your crypto art by hanging them on your wall with an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://infiniteobjects.com%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1614230229662000%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1kHb_sBgCuBMKviXMwKP2j&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614230229674000&amp;usg=AOvVaw10rwU8fNdTzJexp7hOJvqH" target="_blank">Infinite Objects Video Print</a>, Desai says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also use a crypto wallet that’s designed to display your collection, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://rainbow.me%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1614230229662000%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw11i8wxyt5_GKl8Vkz5HgN3&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614230229674000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1bCEZLCSI66E6ZBUyE2xvR" target="_blank">Rainbow.me</a>. Platforms like Showtime let collectors show off their works in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://tryshowtime.com%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1614230229663000%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0s2jnq8J9ZZYeKLXDfQH1-&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614230229674000&amp;usg=AOvVaw38Po9J5FW01X8MbYV2VRbq" target="_blank">an Instagram-like format</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to get really fancy, you can build an entire museum or gallery in a metaverse like Decentraland or Cryptovoxels and show off there. “A lot of this art might just end up living virtually,” Desai says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, because NFTs are cryptoassets, there’s an increasing array of financial tools that let you borrow against them, fractionalize them, delegate them to a decentralized fund, or just sell them to anyone you like —&nbsp;which is more than you can say for a painting hanging on your wall.&nbsp;</p>

																										<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak will be announcing legislation today that will allow major technology companies to effectively form techno-governments.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gov. Sisolak first mentioned the proposal of creating “Innovation Zones” in Nevada during his&nbsp;</span><a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/full-transcript-annotations-of-sisolaks-2021-state-of-the-state-address" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">State-of-the-State address</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;on January 19. “New companies creating groundbreaking technologies can come to Nevada to develop their industries. This will be done without tax abatements or public financing.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the legislation wouldn’t provide subsidiaries or public funding, according to a draft of the Bill obtained by the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/2021-legislature/bill-would-allow-tech-companies-to-create-local-governments-2272887/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Las Vegas Review-Journal</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, major technology firms would be granted authority to form their independent techno-governments within Nevada. “[They] would carry the same authority as a county, including the ability to impose taxes, form school districts and justice courts and provide government services, to name a few duties,” Las Vegas Review-Journal reports.&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_3641" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3641"><img src="https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-min.png" alt="techno-governments " width="653" height="440" srcset="https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-min.png 653w,https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-min-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px" data-srcset="https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-min.png 653w, https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-min-300x202.png 300w" data-src="https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-min.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3641">Illustration shows Blockchains, LLC’s proposed “smart city” in rural northern Nevada.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During his remarks in January, Gov. Sisolak specifically mentioned the company Blockchains, LLC as already being committed to creating a techno-government in the state that would “fully run on blockchain technology.” Gov. Sisolak said the move would make Nevada “the epicenter of this emerging industry and creating the high paying jobs and revenue that go with it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the simplest terms, blockchain is a type of database system that stores computational information in groups, known as “blocks.” Though not entirely unalterable, blockchain technology is considered secure by design because data transactions between parties are recorded efficiently and in an open, verifiable, and permanent manner. Financial services, particularly cryptocurrencies, widely use blockchain technology.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company mentioned explicitly by Gov. Sisolak, Blockchains, LLC, was founded in 2014 by consumer protection attorney and cryptocurrency millionaire <a href="https://www.blockchains.com/our-people/jeffrey-berns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeffrey Berns</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to their&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.blockchains.com/real-life-sandbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">website</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Blockchains, LLC currently owns over 67,000 acres in Storey County, Nevada. The company says they aim to convert this land into “the most advanced ‘high-tech’ community and society for business and residents in the country.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Calling it “a new way to live,” Blockchains says they “believe the integration of our product suite is where the full potential of a smart community, digital economy, and connected society can be realized.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Blockchains aims to showcase how business development, residential living, and commerce can flourish alongside world-changing technologies. To do that, we have to start with a blank slate – otherwise, we’d merely be trying to insert smart technologies into devices that aren’t, well, ‘smart,'” reads the company’s “</span><a href="https://www.blockchains.com/real-life-sandbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Road to Development</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">” plan.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to state records, in 2018, Blockchains purchased 67,125 acres of uninhabited land at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center for $170 million. At the time, the company’s website did not list any executive, a phone number, or a clear explanation of what it’s software did, leading some local media outlets to label the company as “mysterious.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Since the land grab, Blockchains has been lobbying hard to get legislation passed that would allow the company to form its own techno-government.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Las Vegas Review-Journal reports Blockchains, LLC gave $50,000 to a political action committee, Home Means Nevada, which managed Sisolak’s transition into office in January 2019. Campaign&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/entity-details?eid=48060485" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">finance records</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;also show the company donated $10,000 to Sisolak and his Republican opponent Adam Laxalt’s campaign in 2018.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Records also show the company’s owner, Jeffrey Berns, personally gave $50,000 to the Nevada Democratic Party in 2019 and various donations ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 to various state lawmakers from both parties.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Over a week ago,<em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reached out to Blockchains, LLC for comment; however, the company did not respond to this request.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure id="attachment_3640" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3640"><img src="https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nevadasmartcty-min-e1614341465363.jpg" alt="techno-governments" width="760" height="428" data-src="https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nevadasmartcty-min-e1614341465363.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3640">Illustration shows Blockchains, LLC’s proposed “smart city” in rural northern Nevada. (Image Source: EYRC Architects/Blockchains LLC via AP)</figcaption></figure>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In an email to&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Communications Director for the Governor’s office, Meghin Delaney, said Gov. Sisolack will formally unveil the proposed “Innovation Zones” legislation during a virtual press conference today, Friday, February 26, at 4:30 pm (EST).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Joining Gov. Sisolack at today’s conference will be Michael Brown, Executive Director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, and Jeremy Aguero, principal analyst at Applied Analysis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/2021-legislature/bill-would-allow-tech-companies-to-create-local-governments-2272887/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Las Vegas Review-Journal</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the draft language in the proposal said the traditional local government model was “inadequate alone to provide the flexibility and resources conducive to making the State a leader in attracting and retaining new forms and types of businesses and fostering economic development in emerging technologies and innovative industries.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The draft proposal also reportedly said the creation of techno-governments or “alternative forms of local government” were needed to aid economic development within the state.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Governor’s Office of Economic Development is slated to handle applications for the Innovation Zones, which would be limited to specific “innovative technologies,” including “blockchain, autonomous technology, the internet of things, artificial intelligence, wireless technology, biometrics, and renewable resource technology.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Governor’s Office of Economic Development redirected <em>The Debrief’s</em> questions on the legislation backing techno-governments to the Governor’s communications staff; since the Bill had not been formally proposed, much less passed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The draft proposal laid out the requirements for companies to create their own techno-government, including an applicant owning at least 50,000 acres of undeveloped and uninhabited land, all within a single county but separate from any city, town or tax increment area.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Big Tech companies would also have to pledge at least $250 million toward initial development, with a plan to invest an additional $1 billion over ten years in the zone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Major technology companies would function as their own independent governmental body, with a three-member board of supervisors that would carry the same authority as a board of county commissioners. The Bill’s proposed draft suggests technology companies would have a significant say over who would sit on techno-government’s board.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the draft proposal provides insight into some of the details behind the concept, some aspects could be changed when the Bill is formally introduced.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Aside from lobbying by companies such as Blockchains, the primary motivation for proposing the allowance of techno-governments would be the hope that the move would significantly boost Nevada’s beleaguered economy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With tourism indirectly or directly accounting for&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.travelnevada.biz/wp-content/uploads/Nevada-Visitor-Economic-Impact-2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">almost 25%</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;of the state’s economy, Nevada has been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Las Vegas, the United States’ second-largest municipal tourism industry, accounted for over $19 billion of Nevada’s GDP before the pandemic. According to the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://nevadaresorts.org/cv19/Nevada%20NRA%20Corona%20Virus%20Assessment%20Fact%20Sheet%20%20FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nevada Resort Association</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, tourism and leisure services account for one out of every three jobs in Nevada.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/explaining-the-economic-impact-of-covid-19-core-industries-and-the-hispanic-workforce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Brookings Institute</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;found two Nevada cities, Las Vegas and Reno, were among the top three metro economies hardest-hit by the pandemic. In December 2020, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Nevada’s unemployment rate of 9.2% was the second-highest in the United States. Hawaii, which came in dead last, was only a tenth of a percentage point below Nevada at 9.3%.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Conversely, metropolitan hubs specializing in technology, such as Seattle and San Francisco, have thrived and benefited from COVID-19. Sales at non-store retailers (i.e., online shopping) increased by 15% from November 2019 to November 2020. Online retail giant Amazon, headquartered in Seattle,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/29/amazon-hiring-pandemic-holidays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">nearly doubled its workforce</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, adding 400,000 jobs in 2020. Social media monolith Facebook&nbsp;</span><a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/facebook-hiring-10000-workers-small-business-grants-1234570018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announced</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;plans to hire an additional 10,000 workers in April 2020.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The adage that “the most secure job is a federal government job” has held during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the U.S. Government grew by over 50,000 jobs in 2020. The metropolitan seat of America’s power, Washington D.C., saw a government employment rate increase over 2% last year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By allowing major technology corporations to form their techno-governments, Nevada will be trying to capture lightning in a bottle by enticing a mix of the most benefited industries during these economically downtrodden times.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While economic benefits seem enticing, almost assuredly, there will be some public concerns over the idea of Big Tech being allowed to form its own sovereign governance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fear over the power Big Tech companies wield has only increased in the past two years. The public and politicians alike have expressed concerns over Big Tech companies’ potential to be a cultural hegemony, dominating public ideas and beliefs.&nbsp;</span></p>

</center><p>1. <b>One paper published by a Duke University researcher in 2006 found that more than 40 percent of the actions people performed each day werenâ€™t actual decisions, but habits.</b></p><p>2. Habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort. Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often. This effort-saving instinct is a huge advantage. An efficient brain requires less room, which makes for a smaller head, which makes childbirth easier and therefore causes fewer infant and mother deaths. An efficient brain also allows us to stop thinking constantly about basic behaviors, such as walking and choosing what to eat, so we can devote mental energy to inventing spears, irrigation systems, and, eventually, airplanes and video games.</p><p><b>3. This process within our brains is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future:</b></p><p>4. By learning to observe the cues and rewards, though, we can change the routines.</p><p>5. This is how new habits are created: by putting together a cue, a routine, and a reward, and then cultivating a craving that drives the loop.</p><p>6. But to overpower the habit, we must recognize which craving is driving the behavior.</p><p>7. But countless studies have shown that a cue and a reward, on their own, arenâ€™t enough for a new habit to last. Only when your brain starts expecting the rewardâ€”craving the endorphins or sense of accomplishmentâ€”will it become automatic to lace up your jogging shoes each morning.</p><p>8. Cravings are what drive habits. And figuring out how to spark a craving makes creating a new habit easier.</p><p>9. Rather, to change a habit, you must keep the old cue, and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine.</p><p>10. Belief was the ingredient that made a reworked habit loop into a permanent behavior.</p><p>11. â€œEven if you give people better habits, it doesnâ€™t repair why they started drinking in the first place. Eventually theyâ€™ll have a bad day, and no new routine is going to make everything seem okay. What can make a difference is believing that they can cope with that stress without alcohol.â€�</p><p>12. â€œAt some point, people in AA look around the room and think, if it worked for that guy, I guess it can work for me,â€� said Lee Ann Kaskutas, a senior scientist at the Alcohol Research Group. â€œThereâ€™s something really powerful about groups and shared experiences. People might be skeptical about their ability to change if theyâ€™re by themselves, but a group will convince them to suspend disbelief. A community creates belief.â€�</p><p>13. But we do know that for habits to permanently change, people must believe that change is feasible. The same process that makes AA so effectiveâ€”the power of a group to teach individuals how to believeâ€”happens whenever people come together to help one another change. Belief is easier when it occurs within a community.</p><p><b>14. How do habits change? There is, unfortunately, no specific set of steps guaranteed to work for every person. We know that a habit cannot be eradicatedâ€”it must, instead, be replaced. And we know that habits are most malleable when the Golden Rule of habit change is applied: If we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted. But thatâ€™s not enough. For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.</b></p><p>15. Some habits have the power to start a chain reaction, changing other habits as they move through an organization. Some habits, in other words, matter more than others in remaking businesses and lives. These are â€œkeystone habits,â€�</p><p>16. Researchers have found similar dynamics in dozens of other settings, including individualsâ€™ lives. Take, for instance, studies from the past decade examining the impacts of exercise on daily routines.10 When people start habitually exercising, even as infrequently as once a week, they start changing other, unrelated patterns in their lives, often unknowingly. Typically, people who exercise start eating better and becoming more productive at work. They smoke less and show more patience with colleagues and family.</p><p>17. Small wins are exactly what they sound like, and are part of how keystone habits create widespread changes. A huge body of research has shown that small wins have enormous power, an influence disproportionate to the accomplishments of the victories themselves.<br></p><p>18. Small wins fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny advantages into patterns that convince people that bigger achievements are within reach.</p><p>19. The second way that keystone habits encourage change: by creating structures that help other habits to flourish.</p><p>20. At the core of that education is an intense focus on an all-important habit: willpower. Dozens of studies show that willpower is the single most important keystone habit for individual success.</p><p>21. â€œSelf-discipline predicted academic performance more robustly than did IQ. Self-discipline also predicted which students would improve their grades over the course of the school year, whereas IQ did not.â€¦ Self-discipline has a bigger effect on academic performance than does intellectual talent.â€�</p><p>22. And the best way to strengthen willpower and give students a leg up, studies indicate, is to make it into a habit.</p><p>23. Scientists began conducting related experiments, trying to figure out how to help kids increase their self-regulatory skills. They learned that teaching them simple tricksâ€”such as distracting themselves by drawing a picture, or imagining a frame around the marshmallow, so it seemed more like a photo and less like a real temptationâ€”helped them learn self-control.</p><p>24. By the 1980s, a theory emerged that became generally accepted: Willpower is a learnable skill, something that can be taught the same way kids learn to do math and say â€œthank you.â€�</p><p><b>25. â€œThatâ€™s why signing kids up for piano lessons or sports is so important. It has nothing to do with creating a good musician or a five-year-old soccer star,â€� said Heatherton. â€œWhen you learn to force yourself to practice for an hour or run fifteen laps, you start building self-regulatory strength. A five-year-old who can follow the ball for ten minutes becomes a sixth grader who can start his homework on time.â€�</b></p><p>26. Simply giving employees a sense of agencyâ€”a feeling that they are in control, that they have genuine decision-making authorityâ€”can radically increase how much energy and focus they bring to their jobs.</p><p><b>27. A company with dysfunctional habits canâ€™t turn around simply because a leader orders it. Rather, wise executives seek out moments of crisisâ€”or create the perception of crisisâ€”and cultivate the sense that something must change, until everyone is finally ready to overhaul the patterns they live with each day.</b></p><p>28. â€œThis crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not do before.â€�</p><p>29. Andreasen wanted to know why these people had deviated from their usual patterns. What he discovered has become a pillar of modern marketing theory: Peopleâ€™s buying habits are more likely to change when they go through a major life event. When someone gets married, for example, theyâ€™re more likely to start buying a new type of coffee. When they move into a new house, theyâ€™re more apt to purchase a different kind of cereal.</p><p>30.If a member made a friend at the YMCA, they were much more likely to show up for workout sessions. In other words, people who join the YMCA have certain social habits.</p><p>31. Itâ€™s a variation of the lesson learned by Target and radio DJs: to sell a new habitâ€”in this case exerciseâ€”wrap it in something that people already know and like, such as the instinct to go places where itâ€™s easy to make friends.</p><p>32. To market a new habitâ€”be it groceries or aerobicsâ€”you must understand how to make the novel seem familiar.</p><p>33. In general, sociologists say, most of us have friends who are like us. We might have a few close acquaintances who are richer, a few who are poorer, and a few of different racesâ€”but, on the whole, our deepest relationships tend to be with people who look like us, earn about the same amount of money, and come from similar backgrounds.</p><p>34. For Aristotle, habits reigned supreme. The behaviors that occur unthinkingly are the evidence of our truest selves, he said. So â€œjust as a piece of land has to be prepared beforehand if it is to nourish the seed, so the mind of the pupil has to be prepared in its habits if it is to enjoy and dislike the right things.â€�</p><p>35. THE DIFFICULT THING about studying the science of habits is that most people, when they hear about this field of research, want to know the secret formula for quickly changing any habit. If scientists have discovered how these patterns work, then it stands to reason that they must have also found a recipe for rapid change, right? If only it were that easy. Itâ€™s not that formulas donâ€™t exist. The problem is that there isnâ€™t one formula for changing habits. There are thousands.</p><p><b>36. THE FRAMEWORK: </b><br><b>â€¢ Identify the routine </b><br><b>â€¢ Experiment with rewards </b><br><b>â€¢ Isolate the cue </b><br><b>â€¢ Have a plan</b></p><p>37. STEP ONE: IDENTIFY THE ROUTINE</p><p>38. To understand your own habits, you need to identify the components of your loops. Once you have diagnosed the habit loop of a particular behavior, you can look for ways to supplant old vices with new routines. As an example, letâ€™s say you have a bad habit, like I did when I started researching this book, of going to the cafeteria and buying a chocolate chip cookie every afternoon. Letâ€™s say this habit has caused you to gain a …</p></div></div></div>

<p>
One day, while studying old code, I found out that it's possible to
encode Windows Portable Executable files as a UNIX Sixth Edition shell
script, due to the fact that the Thompson Shell didn't use a shebang
line. Once I realized it's possible to create a synthesis of the binary
formats being used by Unix, Windows, and MacOS, I couldn't resist the
temptation of making it a reality, since it means that high-performance
native code can be almost as pain-free as web apps. Here's how it works:

</p><pre>MZqFpD='
BIOS BOOT SECTOR'
exec 7&lt;&gt; $(command -v $0)
printf '\177ELF...LINKER-ENCODED-FREEBSD-HEADER' &gt;&amp;7
exec "$0" "$@"
exec qemu-x86_64 "$0" "$@"
exit 1
REAL MODE...
ELF SEGMENTS...
OPENBSD NOTE...
NETBSD NOTE...
MACHO HEADERS...
CODE AND DATA...
ZIP DIRECTORY...
</pre>

<p>
I started a project called
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan">Cosmopolitan</a> which
implements
the <a aria-label="Actually Portable Executable" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jart/cosmopolitan/667ab245fe0326972b7da52a95da97125d61c8cf/ape/ape.S">αcτµαlly
pδrταblε εxεcµταblε</a> format. I chose the name because I like the idea
of having the freedom to write software without restrictions that
transcends traditional boundaries. My goal has been helping C become a
build-once run-anywhere language, suitable for greenfield development,
while avoiding any assumptions that would prevent software from being
shared between tech communities. Here's how simple it is to get started:

</p><pre>gcc -g -O -static -fno-pie -no-pie -mno-red-zone -nostdlib -nostdinc -o hello.com hello.c \
  -Wl,--oformat=binary -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,-z,max-page-size=0x1000 -fuse-ld=bfd \
  -Wl,-T,<a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/ape.lds">ape.lds</a> -include <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.h">cosmopolitan.h</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/crt.o">crt.o</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/ape.o">ape.o</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.a">cosmopolitan.a</a>
</pre>

<p>
In the above one-liner, we've basically reconfigured the stock compiler
on Linux so it outputs binaries that'll run on MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD,
OpenBSD, and NetBSD too. They also boot from the BIOS. Please note this
is intended for people who don't care about desktop GUIs, and just want
stdio and sockets without devops toil.

</p><h3>Platform Agnostic C / C++ / FORTRAN Tooling</h3>

<p>
Who could have predicted that cross-platform native builds would be this
easy? As it turns out, they're surprisingly cheap too. Even with all the
magic numbers, win32 utf-8 polyfills, and bios bootloader code, exes
still end up being roughly 100x smaller than Go Hello World:

</p><p>
  <a href="https://justine.lol/life.com">life.com</a> is 12kb (<a href="https://justine.lol/life.com.dbg">symbols</a>,
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jart/cosmopolitan/667ab245fe0326972b7da52a95da97125d61c8cf/examples/life.c">source</a>)
  <br>
  <a href="https://justine.lol/hello.com">hello.com</a> is 16kb (<a href="https://justine.lol/hello.com.dbg">symbols</a>,
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jart/cosmopolitan/667ab245fe0326972b7da52a95da97125d61c8cf/examples/hello.c">source</a>)
  <br>

</p><p>
Please note that zsh has a minor backwards compatibility glitch with
Thompson Shell [update
2021-02-15: <a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/commit/326d9c203b3980c0f841bc62b06e37134c6e51ea">zsh
has now been patched</a>] so try <code>sh hello.com</code> rather
than <code>./hello.com</code>. That one thing aside, if it's this easy,
why has no one done this before? The best answer I can tell is it
requires an minor ABI change, where C preprocessor macros relating to
system interfaces need to be symbolic. This is barely an issue, except
in cases like <code>switch(errno){case EINVAL:...}</code>. If we feel
comfortable bending the rules, then the GNU Linker can easily be
configured to generate at linktime all the PE/Darwin data structures we
need, without any special toolchains.

</p><h3>PKZIP Executables Make Pretty Good Containers</h3>

<p>
Single-file executables are nice to have. There are a few cases where
static executables depending on system files makes sense, e.g. zoneinfo.
However we can't make that assumption if we're building binaries
intended to run on multiple distros with Windows support too.

</p><p>
As it turns out, PKZIP was designed to place its magic marker at the end
of file, rather than the beginning, so we can synthesize ELF/PE/MachO
binaries with ZIP too! I was able to implement this efficiently in the
Cosmopolitan codebase using a few lines of linker script, along with a
program for incrementally compressing sections.

</p><p>
It's possible to run <code>unzip -vl executable.com</code> to view its
contents. It's also possible on Windows 10 to change the file extension
to .zip and then open it in Microsoft's bundled ZIP GUI. Having that
flexibility of being able to easily edit assets post-compilation means
we can also do things like create an easily distributable JavaScript
interpreter that reflectively loads interpreted sources via zip.

</p><p>
  <a href="https://justine.lol/hellojs.com">hellojs.com</a> is 300kb (<a href="https://justine.lol/hellojs.com.dbg">symbols</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/667ab245fe0326972b7da52a95da97125d61c8cf/examples/hellojs.c">source</a>)

</p><p>
Cosmopolitan also uses the ZIP format to automate compliance with the
GPLv2 [update 2020-12-28: APE is now licensed ISC]. The non-commercial
libre build is configured, by default, to embed any source file linked
from within the hermetic make mono-repo. That makes binaries roughly 10x
larger. For example:

</p><p>
  <a href="https://justine.lol/life2.com">life2.com</a> is 216kb (<a href="https://justine.lol/life2.com.dbg">symbols</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/667ab245fe0326972b7da52a95da97125d61c8cf/examples/life.c">source</a>)
  <br>
  <a href="https://justine.lol/hello2.com">hello2.com</a> is 256kb (<a href="https://justine.lol/hello2.com.dbg">symbols</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/667ab245fe0326972b7da52a95da97125d61c8cf/examples/hello.c">source</a>)
  <br>

</p><p>
Rock musicians have a love-hate relationship with dynamic range
compression, since it removes a dimension of complexity from their
music, but is necessary in order to sound professional. Bloat might work
by the same principles, in which case, zip source file embedding could
be a more socially conscious way of wasting resources in order to gain
appeal with the non-classical software consumer.

</p><h3>x86-64 Linux ABI Makes a Pretty Good Lingua Franca</h3>

<p>
It wasn't until very recently in computing history that a clear shakeout
occurred with hardware architectures, which is best evidenced by the
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=TOP500&amp;oldid=966847096#Architecture_and_operating_systems">TOP
500 list</a>. Outside phones routers mainframes and cars, the consensus
surrounding x86 is so strong, that I'd compare it to the Tower of Babel.
Thanks to Linus Torvalds, we not only have a consensus on architecture,
but we've come pretty close to having a consensus on the input output
mechanism by which programs communicate with their host machines, via
the SYSCALL instruction. He accomplished that by sitting at home in a
bathrobe sending emails to huge corporations, getting them to agree to
devote their resources to creating something beautifully opposite to
tragedy of the commons.

</p><p>
So I think it's really the best of times to be optimistic about systems
engineering. We agree more on sharing things in common than we ever
have. There are still outliers like the plans coming out of Apple and
Microsoft we hear about in the news, where they've sought to pivot PCs
towards ARM. I'm not sure why we need a C-Class Macintosh, since the
x86_64 patents should expire this year. Apple could have probably made
their own x86 chip without paying royalties. The free/open architecture
that we've always dreamed of, might turn out to be the one we're already
using.

</p><p>
If a microprocessor architecture consensus finally exists, then I
believe we should be focusing on building better tools that help
software developers benefit from it. One of the ways I've been focusing
on making a contribution in that area, is by building a friendlier way
to visualize the impact that x86-64 execution has on memory. It should
should hopefully clarify how <span aria-label="Actually Portable
Executable">αcτµαlly pδrταblε εxεcµταblε</span> works.

  </center>

<p>
You'll notice that execution starts off by treating the Windows PE
header as though it were code. For example, the ASCII string <code>"MZqFpD"</code>
decodes as <code>pop %r10 ; jno 0x4a ; jo 0x4a</code> and the string
<code>"\177ELF"</code> decodes as <code>jg 0x47</code>. It then hops
through a mov statement which tells us the program is being run from
userspace rather than being booted, and then hops to the entrypoint.

<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/667ab245fe0326972b7da52a95da97125d61c8cf/libc/sysv/systemfive.S">easily
unpacked</a> for the host operating system using decentralized sections
and the GNU Assembler <code>.sleb128</code> directive. Low entropy data
like UNICODE bit lookup tables will generally be decoded using either
a <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/667ab245fe0326972b7da52a95da97125d61c8cf/libc/str/lz4cpy.c">103
byte LZ4 decompressor</a> or
a <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/667ab245fe0326972b7da52a95da97125d61c8cf/libc/nexgen32e/rldecode.S">17

done using
Intel's <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/667ab245fe0326972b7da52a95da97125d61c8cf/third_party/xed/x86ild.greg.c">3kb
x86 decoder</a>.

</p><p>
Please note that this emulator isn't a
requirement. <span aria-label="Actually Portable Executables">αcτµαlly
pδrταblε εxεcµταblεs</span> work fine if you just run them on the shell,
the NT command prompt, or boot them from the BIOS. This isn't a JVM. You
only use the emulator if you need it. For example, it's helpful to be
able to have cool visualizations of how program execution impacts
memory.

</p><p>
It'll be nice to know that any normal PC program we write will "just
work" on Raspberry Pi and Apple ARM. All we have to do embed an ARM
build of the emulator above within our x86 executables, and have them
morph and re-exec appropriately, similar to how Cosmopolitan is already
doing doing with qemu-x86_64, except that this wouldn't need to be
installed beforehand. The tradeoff is that, if we do this, binaries will
only be 10x smaller than Go's Hello World, instead of 100x smaller. The
other tradeoff is the GCC Runtime Exception forbids code morphing, but I
already took care of that for you, by rewriting the GNU runtimes.

</p><p>
The most compelling use case for making x86-64-linux-gnu as tiny as
possible, with the availability of full emulation, is that it enables
normal simple native programs to run everywhere including web browsers
by default. Many of the solutions built in this area tend to focus too
much on the interfaces that haven't achieved consensus, like GUIs and
threads, otherwise they'll just emulate the entire operating system,
like Docker or Fabrice Bellard running Windows in browsers. I think we
need compatibility glue that just runs programs, ignores the systems,
and treats x86_64-linux-gnu as a canonical software encoding.

</p><h3>Long Lifetime Without Maintenance</h3>

<p>
One of the reasons why I love working with a lot of these old unsexy
technologies, is that I want any software work I'm involved in to stand
the test of time with minimal toil. Similar to how the Super Mario Bros
ROM has managed to survive all these years without needing a GitHub
issue tracker.

</p><p>
I believe the best chance we have of doing that, is by gluing together
the binary interfaces that've already achieved a decades-long consensus,
and ignoring the APIs. For example, here are the
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/667ab245fe0326972b7da52a95da97125d61c8cf/libc/sysv/consts.sh">magic
numbers</a> used by Mac, Linux, BSD, and Windows distros. They're worth
seeing at least once in your life, since these numbers underpin the
internals of nearly all the computers, servers, and phones you've used.

</p><p>
If we focus on the subset of numbers all systems share in common, and
compare it to their common ancestor, Bell System Five, we can see that
few things about systems engineering have changed in the last 40 years
at the binary level. Magnums are boring. Platforms can't …</p></div>

<p>Done at: Montevideo</p>
<p>Date enacted: 1933-12-26</p>
<p>In force: 1934-12-26</p>
<div>
<p>The Governments represented in the Seventh International Conference of American States:
</p>
<p>Wishing to conclude a Convention on Rights and Duties of States, have appointed the following
Plenipotentiaries:</p>
<p>[List of plenipotentiaries omitted]</p>
<p>Who, after having exhibited their Full Powers, which were found to be in good and due order, have
agreed upon the following:</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="article-header-1">Article 1</h3>
<p>The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td nowrap="">a.</td><td>
<p>a permanent population;</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap="">b.</td><td>
<p>a defined territory;</p>
</td>

<p>government; and</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap="">d.</td><td>
<p>capacity to enter into relations with the other states.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="article-header-2">Article 2</h3>
<p>The federal state shall constitute a sole person in the eyes of international law.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="article-header-3">Article 3</h3>
<p>The political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states. Even before recognition the state has the right to defend its integrity and independence, to provide for its conservation and prosperity, and consequently to organize itself as it sees fit, to legislate upon its interests, administer its services, and to define the jurisdiction and competence of its courts. The exercise of these rights has no other limitation than the exercise of the rights of other states according to international law.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="article-header-4">Article 4</h3>
<p>States are juridically equal, enjoy the same rights, and have equal capacity in their exercise. The rights of each one do not depend upon the power which it possesses to assure its exercise, but upon the simple fact of its existence as a person under international law.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="article-header-5">Article 5</h3>
<p>The fundamental rights of states are not susceptible of being affected in any manner whatsoever.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="article-header-6">Article 6</h3>
<p>The recognition of a state merely signifies that the state which recognizes it accepts the personality of the other with all the rights and duties determined by international law. Recognition is unconditional and irrevocable.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="article-header-7">Article 7</h3>
<p>The recognition of a state may be express or tacit. The latter results from any act which implies the intention of recognizing the new state.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="article-header-8">Article 8</h3>
<p>No state has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="article-header-9">Article 9</h3>
<p>The jurisdiction of states within the limits of national territory applies to all the inhabitants. Nationals and foreigners are under the same protection of the law and the national authorities and the foreigners may not claim rights other or more extensive than those of the nationals.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="article-header-10">Article 10</h3>
<p>The primary interest of states is the conservation of peace. Differences of any nature which arise between them should be settled by recognized pacific methods.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="article-header-11">Article 11</h3>
<p>The contracting states definitely establish as the rule of their conduct the precise obligation not to recognize territorial acquisitions or special advantages which have been obtained by force whether this consists in the employment of arms, in threatening diplomatic representations, or in any other effective coercive measure. The territory of a state is inviolable and may not be the object of military occupation nor of other measures of force imposed by another state directly or indirectly or for any motive whatever even temporarily.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="article-header-12">Article 12</h3>
<p>The present Convention shall not affect obligations previously entered into by the High Contracting Parties by virtue of international agreements.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="article-header-13">Article 13</h3>
<p>The present Convention shall be ratified by the High Contracting Parties in conformity with their respective constitutional procedures. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Uruguay shall transmit authentic certified copies to the governments for the aforementioned purpose of ratification. The instrument of ratification shall be deposited in the archives of the Pan American Union in Washington, which shall notify the signatory governments of said deposit. Such notification shall be considered as an exchange of ratifications.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="article-header-14">Article 14</h3>
<p>The present Convention will enter into force between the High Contracting Parties in the order in which they deposit their respective ratifications.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="article-header-15">Article 15</h3>
<p>The present Convention shall remain in force indefinitely but may be denounced by means of one year's notice given to the Pan American Union, which shall transmit it to the other signatory governments. After the expiration of this period the Convention shall cease in its effects as regards the party which denounces but shall remain in effect for the remaining High Contracting Parties.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="article-header-16">Article 16</h3>
<p>The present Convention shall be open for the adherence and accession of the States which are not signatories. The corresponding instruments shall be deposited in the archives of the Pan American Union which shall communicate them to the other High Contracting Parties.</p>
</div>
<div>

<p>In witness whereof, the following Plenipotentiaries have signed this Convention in Spanish, English, Portuguese and French and hereunto affix their respective seals in the city of Montevideo, Republic of Uruguay, this 26th day of December, 1933.</p>
</div>
<div>

<p>Number of ratifications: 16</p>
<p>Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, United States of America, Venezuela</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>It might seem odd to have a blog post devoted entirely to reading. After all, if you’re reading this, chances are you can read. But reading effectively and efficiently is its own skill - one that we’re never really taught how to do.</p><p>Throughout our academic life, we’re programmed to believe that effective reading is measured by speed and breadth. The more we can read, the smarter we look. And the more broadly we can read, the more intelligent we seem.</p><p>In fact, I’ve fallen prey to this myself, making a clickbait video called <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tKuviI68Ss">How I Read 100 Books a Year</a></em>. Full disclosure: I don’t actually. It’s closer to 50. But that makes for a less clickable video (sorry, not sorry).</p><p>Because of this obsession we have with reading more, we miss out on a lot of valuable insights. Wisdom from across the ages, the lessons mastered by people who've overcome extraordinary challenges, and the chance to gain knowledge that challenges our beliefs. All because we're never taught the ultimate meta-skill: the art of reading.</p><p>Reading more effectively and efficiently means developing a watertight process to <strong>capture ideas</strong>, <strong>analyse arguments</strong>, and <strong>ask the right questions</strong>. It means identifying the <strong>right books to read</strong>, understanding the <strong>different reading goals</strong>, and using evidence-based techniques to <strong>increase reading productivity</strong>.</p><p>In many ways, improving the way we read is the number one skill that can change our lives for the better.</p><h2 id="the-importance-of-effective-efficient-reading">The Importance of Effective &amp; Efficient Reading</h2><blockquote>“A person who won’t read has no advantage over one who can’t read" - Mark Twain</blockquote><p>Books have had an enormous impact on my own life. They’ve acted as a personal mentor, and as a vehicle for compounding knowledge.</p><h3 id="-books-have-been-my-personal-mentors">🤓 Books have been my Personal Mentors</h3><p>If someone asked me to name the most influential people in shaping my life (outside of my immediate family), I wouldn't find it too hard to identify a group of people who've transformed my thinking through their incredible actions, ideas, and journeys. But the number one influence in my life wouldn't be people at all. It would be books.</p><p>By reading lots of books (and by trying to read effectively), I've managed to accumulate decades worth of knowledge and experience from the world's most incredible minds, with minimal personal effort. I've learned from mistakes without having to fail, I've learned from successes without having to take huge risks, and I've travelled thousands of miles without leaving the comfort of my bed in Cambridge.</p><p>Reading is the mentor without the cost, the pain, and the discomfort. I honestly wouldn't have started <a href="https://6med.co.uk/">6med</a>, my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOae5nYA7VqaXzerajD0lg">YouTube channel</a>, or decided to <a href="https://book.aliabdaal.com/">write a book</a> without the encouragement, motivation, inspiration, and boundless insights offered by my paper friends. Seriously. My only regret is that I didn't learn to read properly sooner.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hv1gOEY3cs4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>3 Books That Changed My Life</figcaption></figure><h3 id="-books-help-us-compound-knowledge">🧠 Books help us Compound Knowledge</h3><blockquote>"Compound interest is the 8th Wonder of the World" - Albert Einstein</blockquote><p>Just as money accumulates exponentially, so too does personal knowledge as it snowballs and branches out over time. In other words, the more we read and the better our reading processes are, the more our ideas, beliefs, and opinions begin to develop at an ever-increasing rate.</p><p>Not only does our brain begin effortlessly creating connections between seemingly disparate pieces of information, but cohesive and creative solutions to some of our most puzzling and perplexing problems gradually emerge. It's a personal superpower that all of us have the opportunity to discover.</p><blockquote>“To develop a complete mind: Study the science of art; Study the art of science. Learn how to see. Realise that everything connects to everything else” - Da Vinci</blockquote><h2 id="the-reading-objective">The Reading Objective</h2><p>Increasing our ability to read more effectively, as a means to unlock our own personal potential, begins by deciding on a reading goal. After all, we’re probably going to have a different objective and experience reading <em>Paradise Lost</em> compared to our favourite <em>Harry Potter</em> book.</p><p>Many brilliant authors talk about books as having a rather loose objective of success, happiness, and personal fulfilment. Roald Dahl, for instance, said that "if you are going to get anywhere in life, you have to read a lot of books". And J. K. Rowling once said that "something very magical can happen when you read a good book".</p><p>But I’d agree, these opinions are abstract, subjective, and largely unhelpful in guiding the way in which we should read. Instead, it's easier and more useful for our purposes to segment reading objectives into three distinct categories, as identified by Mortimer Adler in <em><a href="https://geni.us/HkStXXO">How to Read a Book</a></em>.</p><h3 id="-category-1-reading-to-entertain">🤪 Category 1: Reading to Entertain</h3><p>In this category, we read books purely for enjoyment. It’s how we spend the majority of our time as readers. There are no rules and there's no need to think too deeply or critically about what we’re reading. The goal is simple: we can relax and immerse ourselves in the story.</p><p>There’s nothing inherently wrong with reading to entertain ourselves.</p><p>It's a healthy way to escape from everyday stress and, if you're anything like me, a perfect way to finish <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMskdqtR1yA">a productive day of work</a>. In particular, I enjoy reading (or listening to) fantasy novels (with the <a href="https://brandonsanderson.com/">Brandon Sanderson</a> books being a personal favourite). I even created a video on <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7awefFU_Hg">My Favourite Fantasy Books</a></em>, which you can check out if you're interested.</p><h3 id="-category-2-reading-to-inform">🗞 Category 2: Reading to Inform</h3><p>In this second category, we read books to learn specific facts or information about something. These books are typically easy to navigate and simple in their layout and structure. This lets us consume them effortlessly and jump around to relevant sections without losing the gist of what's being said. The goal is to <strong>learn without judgement</strong>.</p><p>For example, we'd read the newspaper, a tourist guide, or the <em>Guinness World Records, </em>all to inform. Although we may find aspects of each of them entertaining, we primarily read these things to develop a factual picture of current affairs, a particular location, or some other snippet of knowledge.</p><p>Again, for most of us, reading to inform isn't too problematic.</p><h3 id="-category-3-reading-to-understand">📖 Category 3: Reading to Understand</h3><p>It's the final category of reading - reading to understand - that most of us (including me) tend to struggle with. It therefore deserves most of our attention when it comes to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our reading.</p><p>The problem is that out of the three reading categories, reading to understand requires the greatest cognitive effort. It forces us to challenge our preconceptions, critically analyse the status quo, and directly confront ideas that we may not be immediately comfortable with. This is hard. It can be uncomfortable. But it’s the only way for us to level-up our thinking and personal growth.</p><p>Ultimately, this is a skill that few of us have mastered. But it's at the very heart of meaningful productivity and improving the way we read. Therefore, we need a method that takes us from reading at an elementary level (like when we’re reading to entertain and inform) to reading at an analytical or syntopical level.</p><p>Let's dive into how we can do this.</p><h2 id="the-four-levels-of-reading">The Four Levels of Reading</h2><figure><img src="https://aliabdaal.com/content/images/2021/02/GW-Article.png" alt="" srcset="https://aliabdaal.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/GW-Article.png 600w, https://aliabdaal.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/GW-Article.png 1000w, https://aliabdaal.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/GW-Article.png 1600w, https://aliabdaal.com/content/images/2021/02/GW-Article.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>While the three categories of reading help guide our reading goal, the four cumulative levels of reading help guide our reading style. These levels were again devised by Mortimer Adler and operate to help us understand a book at a far deeper level than what most of us are used to. As we move up the levels we'll not only find ourselves more capable of grasping the author's perspectives and forge deeper insights, but we'll have a process that works with every single book we decide to read.</p><p>This is great stuff.</p><h3 id="-level-1-elementary-reading">👶 Level 1: Elementary Reading</h3><p>The first level of reading is the style of reading that everyone knows how to do, as it's what we're taught in school. As an elementary reader we can easily understand the words on the page, follow the plot, and have a solid grasp of what the book is trying to say.</p><p>However, even at this elementary level, it's easy to screw it up by trying to read too quickly.</p><p>As you know, I'm all about <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/productivity/">increasing productivity</a>, but trying to improve reading speed before understanding the fundamentals of effective reading is only going to hinder our capacity to learn new information.</p><p>My advice - we should try and first improve our reading level. Then, once we've mastered the art of reading analytically, we can worry about reading faster (and we'll talk more about this later).</p><blockquote>"Every book should be read no more slowly than it deserves, and no more quickly than you can read it with satisfaction and comprehension” - Adler</blockquote><h3 id="-level-2-inspectional-reading">🔎 Level 2: Inspectional Reading</h3><p>This second level of reading requires marginally more skill than at the elementary reading level. As an inspectional reader we're tasked with unearthing the overall framework of the book and mapping out the general picture the author is trying to paint. The idea is that we're making some preliminary calculations about the book's content and worth before delving into it properly.</p><p>There are two aspects to inspectional reading: systematic skimming and superficial reading.</p><p><strong>Systematic Skimming</strong></p><p>With systematic skimming our aim is to decide whether or not this is a book we actually want to spend the time reading. I like to ask myself "is this one of the greats that I'd happily spend the next few hours of my life looking at?". If the answer is anything less than "hell yes!" then I won't bother reading it.</p><p>To help me answer this question, I first look at the title, the blurb, and the contents page to determine what the book is about and understand its high-level structure. I then flip through the book concentrating on each chapter's introduction, conclusion, and any sub-headings that interest me. In other words, I do a surface level examination of the book before writing a couple of sentences that neatly summarises everything.</p><p>Another way to systematically skim a book is by reading a book summary. My favourite way of doing this is with the service <a href="https://go.aliabdaal.com/shortform">Shortform</a>. If a book’s available on <a href="https://go.aliabdaal.com/shortform">Shortform</a> (they’re always adding …</p></div></div>

<p>Shall I migrate to Signal, Threema or Telegram? No, because they all have — WhatsApp included — the same problem: They are walled gardens. Imagine a world where for each mail recipient using a separate domain, I would need separate mail client? Or in other words: Gmail users can only communicate with Gmail users.</p>



<h5>Let’s start with mail first.</h5>



<p>The origin of mail were a couple of geeks who wanted to exchange messages on ARPANET (the internets great grandmother). At the time they solved two challenges. Invent a packet-switching network with distributed control that was intended to survive a nuclear attack. And hook up different types of computers types that were not interoperable at the time: A DEC PDP-10, a SDS Sigma 7, an IBM 360/75 and SDS 940. The second topic is our primary issue here.</p>

<p>To achieve this they agreed on a common terminology and on common standards to exchange messages in a collaborative way. Layering on existing definitions (such as TCP/IP) they created:</p>



<ul><li>RFC 524: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc524">A Proposed Mail Protocol</a></li><li>RFC 561: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc561">Standardizing Network Mail Headers</a></li><li>RFC 680: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc680">Message Transmission Protocol</a></li><li>RFC 724: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc724">Proposed Official Standard for the Format of ARPA Network Messages</a></li></ul>



<p>That summed up later in the document RFC 733: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc733">STANDARD FOR THE FORMAT OF ARPA NETWORK TEXT MESSAGES</a> . And many of the aspects solved back then still live in today’s mail infrastructure. Including an address scheme using “@”.</p>

<p>Later the transport of the messages (originally they used multiple protocols such as CPYNET, UUCP or FTP) transitioned in 1981 to SMTP which is still todays way to transport mail. All of this allows that any mail client (MUA = Mail User Agent) can talk via any mail server (MTA = Mail Transfer Agent). An open, collaborative process defining an interoperable system.</p>



<h5>And now come the instant messengers.</h5>



<p>As I already said Signal, Threema, Telegram AND WhatsApp are broken. Why does everybody wanting to exchange messages need the same client? Before digging into more technical detail or rant about companies earning money with closed gardens let come to a possible solution: <a href="https://matrix.org/">The Matrix-Protocol</a>. In short it’s about the same deal as mail (building on HTTP and WebRTC) but for chat-messaging (including IP-telephony and video-telephony) initiated by a non-profit foundation based in the UK. After XMPP or IRC it’s not the only approach to solve the issue, but so far the most successful.</p>



<p>Their reference implementation of the client is called <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/client/element">Element (former Riot)</a> and a server called <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">Synapse</a>. So in theory there could be any chat client communicating over any chat server to any chat client. Sadly it’s not really used yet. Although the <a href="https://www.heise.de/security/meldung/Tchap-Frankreichs-nicht-so-exklusiver-Regierungschat-4403961.html">French Government</a> is supporting it with a client implementation named Tchap and <a href="https://www.golem.de/news/messenger-bundeswehr-will-komplett-auf-matrix-chat-wechseln-2005-148407.html">German Bundeswehr</a> plans to do alike.</p>



<h5>So what?</h5>



<p>Well no real cheering news and in case don’t want to be alone on Matrix you can write to @juerg:matrix.org.</p>



<p>And will it work? No, because there is already too much money in the game (and telcos try to <a href="https://stuker.com/2018/die-sms-nachfolge-heisst-rcs-rich-communication-services/">reanimate the SMS Eldorado</a> too, without success).</p>



<p>But it would be the right thing. And me? I don’t’ switch, I use them all!</p>



<p>PS: The post was inspired by the very nice article <a href="https://www.republik.ch/2021/02/24/kill-the-messenger">“Kill the Messenger”</a>.</p>

        <p>jq is like <code>sed</code> for JSON data - you can use it to slice and filter
and map and transform structured data with the same ease that <code>sed</code>,
<code>awk</code>, <code>grep</code> and friends let you play with text.</p>
        <p>jq is written in portable C, and it has zero runtime
dependencies. You can download a single binary, <code>scp</code> it to a far away
machine of the same type, and expect it to work.</p>
        <p>jq can mangle the data format that you have into the one that you
want with very little effort, and the program to do so is often
shorter and simpler than you'd expect.</p>

<div>
<p>Smart TV was once a term reserved for high end televisions with built-in streaming capabilities.&nbsp; The combination of massive reductions in panel costs, decreasing costs for embedded compute, and the ready availability of content platforms from Google, Roku, and others has made the term irrelevant.&nbsp; Almost every TV you can buy today has smarts built-in.&nbsp; There have been some fantastic outcomes of that, like breaking up the traditional channel bundle and increasing access to more personalized and niche content.</p>
<p>There have been some serious negatives too.&nbsp; Decreasing prices and decreasing margins on TVs combined with long replacement cycles have driven companies to take advantage of built-in smarts to enable a new revenue source: user data and advertising.&nbsp; As of Q2 2020, Vizio and HiSense are the <a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/tests/ads-in-smart-tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only major brands</a> making TVs that ship without advertising enabled in their UIs.&nbsp; Sony, Samsung, LG, and others have ads enabled by default, most of which can’t be disabled.&nbsp; All of the above brands have built capability to aggregate data on what content is being viewed, and again, not all of them have the option to disable that.&nbsp; TVs smart enough to help you are also smart enough to harm you.&nbsp; Incredibly, Samsung even <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/tip/TIP00083197/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommends</a> that you run virus and malware checking on your TV regularly.</p>
<p>An obvious way out of this as a consumer is to buy a TV without smarts built in (a “dumb TV”) and then add your own content source that is privacy focused like <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=j&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffoundation.mozilla.org%2Fen%2Fprivacynotincluded%2Fproducts%2Fapple-tv-4k%2F&amp;uct=1603511873&amp;usg=vKN2pgP52PToUDpxmZ4Qm04kwj0.&amp;source=chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple TV</a> or that you have full control over like <a href="https://kodi.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kodi</a>.&nbsp; This is something we personally looked for when we were buying a display for the conference room at Framework’s headquarters.&nbsp; Amazingly enough though, we found that none of the major consumer TV brands make basic “dumb” displays anymore.&nbsp; There are options in the commercial space like <a href="https://www.sharpnecdisplays.us/solutions/corporate/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NEC’s commercial displays</a>, but they cost substantially more than the consumer-focused alternatives.</p>
<p>We nearly gave in and bought a typical smart TV, and then we stumbled on <a href="https://www.sceptre.com/TV/4K-UHD-TV-category1category73.html?sort=tbt.parent_pdtype&amp;order=DESC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sceptre’s TV lineup</a>.&nbsp; You’ll notice that they have a range of extremely similar looking sets that have minor specification and weight differences.&nbsp; Our best guess is that they source LCDs from panel manufacturers that are either excess stock or fail the quality specifications set by other brands and build extremely minimal TVs around them.&nbsp; We haven’t noticed any quality issues on our Sceptre set, but for our use case of showing slides and spreadsheets, it wouldn’t have mattered anyway.&nbsp; The product was perfect for us: a dumb TV that as an added bonus reduces e-waste by using panels that would otherwise be scrapped.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting business model, and one that is consumer friendly, environmentally considerate, and economically sound.&nbsp; That is a powerful combination that we need to see across all of consumer electronics.</p>

Which one?</h5><h5>This post will highlight all the features that a DevOps team typically needs to add on top of a vanilla Kubernetes cluster to obtain a secure, production-ready Kubernetes cluster. Adding these features takes time and effort, hence, starting from a production-ready, battle-tested Kubernetes distribution can accelerate an organization’s adoption of Kubernetes.</h5></p></div></div><div data-id="fb2f93a" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>What is vanilla Kubernetes?</h2></p></div><div data-id="f0e6f8e" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p><span>“Vanilla Kubernetes” is a term used to describe a Kubernetes setup which is as small as it can get. This is the kind of Kubernetes cluster one gets from managed Kubernetes offers, such as AWS EKS, Azure AKS or Google GKE, and Kubernetes installation tools, such as kops or kubespray.</span></p><p><span>Vanilla is as plain as it gets, and comes with no bells and whistles included. So it’s like buying the most basic car in the lot: It has steering wheel and seat belts, but no additional safety features. So it can be driven immediately, but it won’t help keep you safe with lane departure warnings or auto-breaking.</span></p><p><span>How minimal vanilla Kubernetes is, is subject to some debate. At the very least, Kubernetes needs the following components:</span></p><ul><li aria-level="1"><span>On the control-plane nodes: etcd, apiserver, scheduler and controller-manager.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>On the worker nodes: some container runtime and kubelet.</span></li></ul><p><span>(Without these, can anyone really call the system “a Kubernetes cluster”?)</span></p></div></div></div><div data-id="cd8cf58" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>How vanilla is a vanilla Kubernetes really?</h2></p></div><div data-id="e486cdb" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p><span>So far, you have a car without fuel. The above Kubernetes setup cannot really run anything yet: Kubernetes does not know how to make Pods, i.e., a collection of one-or-more containers, talk to each other. To this end, even the “most vanilla” Kubernetes comes with a Container Network Interface (CNI) addon, such as </span><a href="https://www.projectcalico.org/"><span>Calico</span></a><span>. Now Kubernetes needs to know how to bring traffic to your Pods and how to store their data, a function fulfilled by the so-called cloud controller.</span></p><p><span>Knowing what is happening inside your Kubernetes cluster — also called “observability” — is essential to avoid unplanned downtime and customer disappointment. Therefore, most managed Kubernetes offers also include a few more integrations with the underlying cloud provider. For example, Google GKE sends logs, metrics and traces to Google StackDriver.</span></p><p><span>Great! Now you can run your application, you can direct traffic within the cluster and you can get traffic from end users into the cluster and to your application. Furthermore, logs and metrics are collected. What would I need more than vanilla Kubernetes?</span></p></div></div></div><div data-id="78a210a" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Add Secure Ingress Controller</h2></p></div><div data-id="bb5af44" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p><span>Data privacy regulations — such as HIPAA and GDPR — require you to encrypt public Internet traffic.

However, if you want to stay cloud agnostic and keep your application code focused on business logic, you can do TLS termination in the Kubernetes cluster. Projects, such as </span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/"><span>Ingress controller</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/"><span>cert-manager</span></a><span>, will not only provision TLS certificates for you, but will also rotate them before expiry. Rotating certificates is a best practice, but also a chore that sometimes gets forgotten if it is a manual process.&nbsp; Users would get a scary “</span><a href="https://www.ssl.com/guide/troubleshooting-ssl-tls-browser-errors-and-warnings/"><span>Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead</span></a><span>” message and flock to your competitors.</span></p></div></div><div data-id="c682772" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p><span>Kubernetes is </span><a href="https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/news/252487963/Kubernetes-security-defaults-prompt-upstream-dilemma"><span>not secure by default, nor by itself</span></a><span>. You should further improve your security posture, to minimize the risk of breaches. Why?

<p>I’m an occasional on-call operator for my battalion, assisting the on-call commander and staffing the control room from 16:00 in the afternoon until 08:30 the next morning on weekdays. Most of the work is answering and making calls, updating documents, and making sure that nothing is out of the ordinary. It’s not that difficult, just tiring as there is a lot of stuff to follow and pay attention to through the night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was on-call on Friday, the 10th, and for 24 hours last Wednesday (not the usual shift), starting from 08:30 to the next 08:30 since it was the legislative election day in Korea. I wrote most of this post over those two shifts to share how I personally am being on-call.</p>

<hr>

<p>A little past 2300 is when I try to find some peace. I usually make myself a cup of coffee, and it doesn’t take long to feel the caffeine flowing through my bloodstream. I’m exhausted. It’s been many hours since I started my shift, and I have nine hours to go. No shift goes without a hectic evening with lots of random situations to handle, and they are usually followed by a series of paperwork.</p>
<p>I sit in front of a bunch of monitors and tactical comms equipment in bad posture, and the chair predates the concept of ergonomics. Meanwhile my feet are trapped in my airtight combat boots and they are begging to take a breath. In addition, no matter how much water I drink, my mouth is dry the whole time. It’s probably from all the sugar-intakes from snacking. It’s a similar feeling to a tiring second day at a college hackathon - constant snack intakes and sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>Around midnight, after I’m finished with all the paperwork that needs to be done by the morning, is a good time to seek solace in a cup ramen. It’s hard to convey the exact late-night-cup-ramen sentiment, but the hot soup warms you up in a way no others can console you in this late time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have books with me so that I can read whenever I can. Late in the night especially after a ramen session is usually a good time to read. Every time I try to read in the evening or during the day, I either get a disruptive phone call or a situation, and they make me re-read the same page multiple times. It gets annoying after a couple of tries.</p>
<p>When I tried to read on the past few shifts, I faced some sad ironies. I brought <em>Why We Sleep</em> to my first shift. Reading about the importance of sleep while not being able to sleep was quite saddening, so I stopped after a few pages in. At least I learned why I feel wide awake towards the end of my shift (in the morning), and why I have difficulties sleeping after my shift despite being tired as hell. Now I’m reading <em>the Utopia of Rules</em>, a book filled with social commentaries on bureaucracy and filling out paper forms. Reading that in between the processing and filling out a ton of paperwork was yet another sad irony I encountered. Inevitably and unfortunately, as the night passes, my ability to focus gets decimated. I wish I could accomplish more reading on the job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around 0300~0400, a little after 12 hours (or 20) into the shift, I’m usually passed out on my desk. In a zombie-like state, I get half-woken up by periodic phone calls but I occasionally sleep through the ringings. Sometimes I answer the phone and pretend to handle whatever they tell me, and then go right back to sleep, forgetting everything I heard. I also get woken up when I have to unlock a small safe with ammunition for those going to a guard shift at night. Even then, my body isn’t fully awake sometimes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By dawn, I can feel my internal organs are rotting. With that, my body starts to produce an uncomfortable amount of gas. A little past 0600, with my internal rhythm resetting, my body spontaneously wakes me up. It’s when I start to get busy again. Meanwhile my body goes through this illusion of feeling refreshed, but soon enough it feels like it has aged about six months over the past six hours. It’s obviously not a great feeling and it takes me about two full days to recover. Five more on-call shifts will age me by two years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite such horribleness, the one positive aspect about doing the on-call shifts is that I get to sleep in and rest for the entirety of the next day, getting exempt from pretty much everything. Then, after one shift, two days have gone by just like that. Time flies and a week passes by only after a few days. And I get to rest over the weekend. That’s a good feeling to have in here, the sense of getting closer to the discharge date quicker than how I would feel it otherwise. Just gotta rinse and repeat till I’m out. It’s like Stockholm syndrome - despite how shitty I feel during and after the shift, I’m a bit disappointed that I don’t have a shift this week.</p>

        <br>

	<p>If you haven’t been living under a rock, you’ve probably heard that
there are different date formats in the world such as the American one
(mm/dd/yyyy) and the European one (dd.mm.yyyy). If you’re smart
enough, you’ve probably also noticed that the American one makes no
sense and is just awful. A simple conclusion that many people draw out
of this is that the European format is the best one, however I don’t
think this is true. If you’re one of these people who think so, I’m
here to (hopefully) change your mind by introducing you to a
lesser-known date format called ISO 8601.</p>
<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>As you can see by the “ISO” part in the format’s name, it’s an actual
standard written by the International Organization for
Standardization. It defines many cool things like a way to write time
intervals, which can be useful for writing portable software, and a
calendar where the year is separated not by months but by weeks, which
is used in finances, but here we’re only interested in the basics.
Simplified, the core date format looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
</code></pre><p>Yup, that’s about it. You write the year, the month, the day, and then
the time exactly like it’s done in other date formats. There’s nothing
extraordinary, so you can learn it in 2 minutes.</p>
<h2 id="why-its-better">Why it’s better</h2>
<h3 id="its-unambigous">It’s unambigous</h3>
<p>This is the main reason the standard was written and why people still
use it. Other date formats can be diffucult to tell apart. For
example, consider this date:</p>
<pre><code>02-03-04
</code></pre><p>When you read it out of context, you have absolutely no idea what’s
going on there. Is <code>02</code> here the day or the month? You just can’t know
unless the day in the date is greater than 12, in which case it just
can’t be a month:</p>
<pre><code>30-03-04
</code></pre><p>This day-month ambiguity is a really common problem, which often
occurs online. People just write down their dates in whatever date
format they know without even thinking that other people can interpret
it in different ways.</p>
<p>ISO 8601 doesn’t have this problem as it’s always obvious which part
is the day and which is the month because of the uniqueness of the
format:</p>
<pre><code>2004-03-02
</code></pre><h3 id="its-more-strict">It’s more strict</h3>
<p>While other date formats usually don’t provide strict requirements on
how to write something, ISO 8601 is an exception. Here there’s only
one correct way to write a date, which is not only useful for
computers to parse, but also helpful for humans to avoid confusion
with other formats and improve readability. Here are some of the
restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The elements in the date are always separated by a hyphen. Not many
date formats use this delimiter, and this also can be useful when
using dates inside filenames as slashes are usually not accepted in
them.</li>
<li>The elements are always padded to the maximum number of digits. This
not only makes all of the dates look equally nice, but also, coupled
with other quirks of this format, allows the files with the date in
the name to be sorted just by the filename.</li>
<li>The year is always written in the full form. This makes the format
unique when written down and  eliminates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">the year 2000 problem</a> in
any forms that it can take. For example, when writing down
birthdays, it always makes it obvious which century we’re talking
about.</li>
<li>The time is always written in the 24 hour format, so there can be no
confusion about what half of the day something happened in.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="it-makes-more-sense">It makes more sense</h3>
<p>On the first glance, it seems like the European format is about as
logical as it can get - days go into months and months go into years:</p>
<pre><code>18.12.2002
---------&gt; Elements
</code></pre><p>However, this ignores a very important characteristic of numbers -
endianness. Consider a regular number, for example:</p>
<pre><code>69420
&lt;---- Digits
</code></pre><p>As you can see the digits here do the opposite of what elements do in
the European format. When the leftmost element of something is the
most valuable, we call it big endian.</p>
<p>Thus, the European format is little endian while the numbers in it are
big endian:</p>
<pre><code>18.12.2002
&lt;- &lt;- &lt;--- Digits
---------&gt; Elements
</code></pre><p>And the American format just makes no sense:</p>
<pre><code>12/18/2002
&lt;- &lt;- &lt;--- Digits
?????????? Elements
</code></pre><p>And, as you can see, ISO 8601 is completely consistent in this regard
as everything is big endian:</p>
<pre><code>2002-12-18
&lt;--- &lt;- &lt;- Digits
&lt;--------- Elements
</code></pre><p>The situation becomes even worse if you consider time because it is
big endian, like ISO 8601, thus doesn’t work with any other date
format:</p>
<pre><code>18.12.2002 23:03:59
&lt;- &lt;- &lt;--- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- Digits
---------&gt; &lt;------- Elements

12/18/2002 23:03:59
&lt;- &lt;- &lt;--- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- Digits
?????????? &lt;------- Elements

2002-12-18 23:03:59
&lt;--- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- Digits
&lt;--------- &lt;------- Elements
</code></pre><p>If you’re still having trouble visualizing all of this in your head,
look at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ISO8601/comments/ln33j2/datetime_format_by_region_visualised_v3_thanks/">this Reddit post</a>.</p>
<h3 id="its-standardized-and-actively-used">It’s standardized and actively used</h3>
<p>If you think that ISO 8601 is a silly thing that someone in their
basement made up and no one actually uses, think again because that
can’t be further from the truth:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that it’s standardized says at least something. Does your
favorite format has a neat several hundred page document where it’s
described in extreme detail and that is internationally recognized?
Also the standard is quite far from being dead - after being
published in 1988 it was updated in 1991, 2000, 2004, and 2019.</li>
<li>As I already mentioned, the standard is actively used in IT.
Almost everything that is used by software and somehow involves a
written numerical date format already speaks ISO 8601.</li>
<li>yyyy-mm-dd has been adapted or used since the beginning as a
national date format by many countries such as Canada, Sweden, and
Japan. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country">this article</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3 id="why-not-use-a-format-like-01-jan-2020">Why not use a format like 01-Jan-2020?</h3>
<p>It doesn’t have any of the nice features ISO 8601 has and doesn’t work
well internationally (i.e. assumes the person you’re communicating
with knows knows English). If you think the latter is not a problem,
imagine how you would feel feel if you had to read a date someone
wrote in their native language that you don’t understand:</p>
<pre><code>01-Янв-2020
</code></pre><h3 id="yyyy-mm-dd-looks-weird">yyyy-mm-dd looks weird</h3>
<p>The only reason why it does to you is because you’re not used to it.
After a little bit of practice, it’ll be even less weird than your
favorite date format.</p>
<h3 id="maybe-the-european-date-format-is-better-because-the-elements-are-in-the--order-of-relevance">Maybe the European date format is better because the elements are in the  order of relevance?</h3>
<p>First of all, the claim that the order of relevance is little endian
is quite questionable. The only situation when you can say that for
certain is when we’re talking about events occuring on a day-to-day
basis, however I can think of numerous cases when the year and the
month are more relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Article publication date</li>
<li>Historical event</li>
<li>Personal event that happened a long time ago</li>
<li>Someone’s birthday</li>
<li>Random database entry</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, the order of relevance is actually irrelevant. Even if the
order of relevance was this way, you’re not reading the dates out
loud, so there’s no need for them to be ordered a certain way. If
you’re not interested in the year, you just skip it and read the end
of the date just like you would do when reading time while not being
interested in the hour.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In my opinion, ISO 8601 seems clearly superior to other date formats
when it comes to international communication (such as posting things
online), and as you can see, I have enough reasons to say so. While
the format certainly has an audience, it’s unfortunate that it’s not
as big as it could be. By writing this article, I hope I made you at
least think about different date formats and be more careful when it
comes to making people understand what date you’re talking about.</p>

  </p>

  
  

  <p>Two years ago, I starting learning <a href="https://www.purescript.org/">PureScript</a>.  I
had been intrigued by purely functional programming for some time but had failed
to learn <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> once or twice. PureScript seemed to
be a kinder, gentler introduction to this world while retaining the fundamental
properties of pureness that made Haskell intriguing to me. As part of my
learning process, I rebuilt a slack bot<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> I had previously written in go.</p>

<p>Once I had learned PureScript and become more comfortable with purely functional
idioms, the next logical step seemed to be learning Haskell. I was surprised to
discover how much Haskell I already knew from learning PureScript, but core
features like laziness (PureScript is a strict language) took some getting used
to.</p>

<p>I decided to finish my Haskell learning experience by rewriting my slack bot<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
once again, this time in Haskell. In this post I’ll compare and contrast my
experiences writing the same program in Haskell and PureScript. The application
I built was “real” enough to have some interesting design challenges. They
included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exposing an HTTP endpoint</li>
  <li>Parsing and generating JSON</li>
  <li>Full-text search</li>
</ul>

<p>On to the comparison!</p>



<p>Haskell is a lazy language while PureScript is a strict one. I expected this
core difference to manifest itself constantly when writing these applications,
but in reality it rarely came up. I had predicted a lot of banging my head
against the wall dealing with laziness bugs but it just didn’t happen.</p>

<p>I will say that I generally prefer PureScript being a strict-by-default
language. When laziness is required, there are plenty of ways to <a href="https://blog.drewolson.org/laziness-in-purescript">get
it</a>, but it is always explicit.</p>

<p>While not directly related to strictness, a pain point on the PureScript side
that I didn’t experience in Haskell was stack safety<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. In PureScript, it can
often be confusing to determine if the operation you’re using is stack safe.
When these operations <em>aren’t</em> stack safe, the errors that are produced can be
confusing and hard to track down. I found myself struggling with stack safety in
PureScript far more than I struggled with laziness in Haskell.</p>



<p>A year or two ago, I would have simply said that PureScript has incredible
tooling and Haskell does not. Thanks to the amazing work on the <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server">Haskell
Language Server</a> project,
this gap is starting to close.</p>

<p>Regardless, PureScript still has far better tooling.
<a href="https://github.com/purescript/spago">Spago</a> is an incredible build tool that
offers many of the same features as
<a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">Stack</a> while remaining far
more user friendly and PureScript’s <a href="https://github.com/nwolverson/purescript-language-server">language
server</a> is excellent
and easy to install.</p>

<p>However, PureScript is currently struggling on a few fronts. First, the package
ecosystem is moving from bower to a
<a href="https://github.com/purescript/registry">registry</a> hosted on Github. The
resulting registry seems to be moving along nicely and I believe the result will
be incredible for the language, but the current in-between state is unfortunate.
I am glad the core maintainers are taking their time to design this registry
well and I firmly believe that this will be a strong positive for the PureScript
community in 6-12 months.</p>

<p>Second, PureScript doesn’t have a great option for a formatter. While
<a href="https://gitlab.com/joneshf/purty">purty</a> does exist, it seems to be mostly in
maintenance mode and many of the formatting choices are frustrating for me.
Specifically, the automatic removal of blank lines within functions and the
addition of newlines for <code>let</code> assignments in <code>do</code> blocks both hamper
readability and author intent. On the Haskell side,
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ormolu">ormolu</a> was easy to install and
“just worked”.</p>



<p>It’s not a controversial statement to say that Haskell has far more language
features than PureScript. It’s also not a new observation to say that it is
challenging to determine which of these features one should be using and what
extensions one should enable to use them. Here’s the list of default extensions
I have enabled for my project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DataKinds</li>
  <li>DeriveGeneric</li>
  <li>FlexibleContexts</li>
  <li>FlexibleInstances</li>
  <li>GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving</li>
  <li>InstanceSigs</li>
  <li>LambdaCase</li>
  <li>MultiParamTypeClasses</li>
  <li>NamedFieldPuns</li>
  <li>OverloadedStrings</li>
  <li>ScopedTypeVariables</li>
  <li>TypeApplications</li>
  <li>TypeOperators</li>
</ul>

<p>I found Haskell’s deriving capabilities to be more powerful than PureScript and
led to reduced boilerplate, especially when creating my application monad. I
also like that Haskell’s type class instances do not require names. The names
required by PureScript add very little in terms of readability or author intent.</p>

<p>By far the biggest difference I felt between the two languages is the way they
deal with records. Again, this isn’t a new observation, but it can not be
overstated how much better PureScript’s records are than Haskell’s. Records
based on row polymorphism are a joy to work with, as is having a dedicated
syntax for creating, updating, and accessing records. GHC does have an <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0282-record-dot-syntax.rst">accepted
proposal</a>
for adding record dot syntax which will solve many of these problems, but I
think the underlying implementation based on row polymorphism will continue to
give PureScript the edge here.</p>



<p>When I first learned PureScript I compared its compile times to other statically
typed languages like Rust, Go, and Java. I found it much slower than these other
languages, though incremental rebuilds were generally quite fast. I assumed upon
moving to Haskell that the situation would be comparable or better. I was very
wrong.</p>

<p>Compilation times in Haskell are significantly worse than PureScript, often by
an order or two of magnitude when compiling a project’s dependencies. I say this
less to rag on Haskell (this seems like a challenging problem to tackle), but
more to applaud the PureScript community for the work they’ve already done on
this front.</p>



<p>Haskell has a far larger ecosystem of packages than PureScript – kind of. In
terms of Haskell and PureScript in isolation, Haskell has a vastly superior
collection of packages and the quality of these packages is generally very high.
However, PureScript has done a great job of porting over many of the best
Haskell packages.</p>

<p>Additionally, PureScript gives you access to the entire ecosystem of JavaScript
packages via FFI. While many in the community find this to be something of a
disadvantage, from a practical perspective it is fantastic. As an example, when
building full-text search for Haskell, I ended up using the full-text-search
package. It was fully featured and comprehensive, but required <a href="https://github.com/drewolson/epicbot-hs/blob/736e4a47a29f8935ecb489d3cdbeb48b738c34ca/src/Epicbot/Data/Index/SearchEngine.hs">quite a
bit</a>
of code to get working.</p>

<p>On the PureScript side, I built a <a href="https://github.com/drewolson/epicbot/blob/e7e93d2e2642ae135c92c6ff5b73b733685b550e/src/Epicbot/Index.js">simple FFI
wrapper</a>
around elasticlunr. While I understand that the JavaScript ecosystem has
packages of variable quality, it does have <em>lots</em> of package solving <em>many</em>
problems and PureScript’s FFI makes it extremely easy to leverage this giant
ecosystem in a safe way.</p>



<p>For my PureScript application I chose the
<a href="https://github.com/cprussin/purescript-httpure">HTTPure</a>. It was light-weight
and easy to use while feeling idiomatic. This was a relatively simple choice
because there are few options for server-side frameworks within the PureScript
ecosystem that included the features I needed (specifically middleware).</p>

<p>On the Haskell side, the choice of web framework was more complicated. I wanted
something small and light-weight, but with the ability work within my custom
monad stack for my application. I ended up using <a href="">scotty</a>, but the default
middleware solution doesn’t operate within your application’s monad stack, so I
needed to explicitly provide middleware-like-functions for <a href="https://github.com/drewolson/epicbot-hs/blob/736e4a47a29f8935ecb489d3cdbeb48b738c34ca/src/Epicbot/Web/Router.hs#L33-L34">each
endpoint</a>
in my router.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, this was mostly a wash between languages, but I expected
the Haskell ecosystem to be far more mature in the backend HTTP service space.</p>



<p>To deploy my PureScript application, I used
<a href="https://github.com/vercel/ncc">ncc</a>. While this required that I had <code>node</code>
available in my deployment environment, it made everything else easy. The <code>ncc</code>
tool produced a single, self-contained JavaScript file that included all of the
application code along with required dependencies. I then simply <code>scp</code>‘d this to
my deployment environment and ran it with <code>node</code>.</p>

<p>On the Haskell side, I used stack’s docker support to build my application’s
executable within a container that matches my deployment environment (debian),
and then shipped the resulting executable via <code>scp</code> as well. The executable was
completely self-contained.</p>

<p>Overall, both approaches felt equivalent in terms of ease. On the PureScript
side, it is a bit frustrating to need <code>node</code> within the deployment environment.
On the Haskell side, there was the added complication of having to use docker
for cross-compilation. Overall, though, both experiences were reasonably nice.</p>



<p>In reading over this post, I worry that it feels like I’m picking on Haskell –
I’m absolutely not. I’m very aware that PureScript is <em>heavily</em> influenced by
Haskell and is standing the shoulders of giants. PureScript was able to learn
from some of the mistakes of Haskell and make choices about intentional
departures from the Haskell ecosystem that better fit the intended use cases of
PureScript.</p>

<p>I found the experiences of learning and using both Haskell and PureScript very
rewarding. I will admit to being surprised at how well PureScript compared to
Haskell in the server-side HTTP space, given that its primary focus is currently
on the front end. I think both languages have a bright future and I’m excited to
follow their continued development.</p>

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="programrejectedformentalhealthreasons">PROGRAM REJECTED FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS</h2>
<p>In 1972, two students learning FORTRAN came up with a fantastic new programming language called INTERCAL.  INTERCAL is a bit unusual. For example, single quotes are called <em>sparks</em>, and double quotes are called <em>rabbit ears</em>, less than (&lt;) is an <em>angle</em>, and a dash (-) is a <em>worm</em>.  This makes the manual read like a word puzzle combined with an extended in-joke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One final comment about sparks and rabbit-ears; if the next character in the program is a spot, as often happens because onespot variables are common choices for operands, a spark and the following spot can be combined into a wow (!). - <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ick.htm">INTERCAL Manual</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The compiler errors are where the authors got genuinely creative. Errors include <code>VARIABLES MAY NOT BE STORED IN WEST HYPERSPACE</code> for accessing an array incorrectly, <code>IT CAME FROM BEYOND SPACE</code> for invalid control flow, <code>PROGRAM REJECTED FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS</code> for threading issues, <code>I HAVE NO FILE AND I MUST SCREAM</code> for file not found, and <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ick.htm#Errors">many many more</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a parody language, and reading the manual, you get the sense that no one has yet had as much fun writing technical documentation as Lyon and Woods did writing this.</p>
<p>The language itself looks less fun.  Here is <a href="http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Intercal">Hello World</a>:</p>
<pre><code>       NOTE THIS IS INTERCAL
       PLEASE ,1 &lt;- #5
       DO ,1 SUB #1 &lt;- #54
       DO ,1 SUB #2 &lt;- #192
       DO ,1 SUB #3 &lt;- #136
       PLEASE ,1 SUB #4 &lt;- #208
       DO ,1 SUB #5 &lt;- #98
       DO COME FROM (1)
       DO READ OUT ,1
(2)    DO ,1 SUB #1 &lt;- #134
(1)    PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM (2)
</code></pre>
<p>One of the exciting innovations of INTERCAL is the <code>COMEFROM</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM#Examples">instruction</a>, seen here in a variant of BASIC.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>10 COMEFROM 40
20 INPUT "WHAT IS YOUR NAME? "; A$
30 PRINT "HELLO, "; A$
40 REM
</code></pre>
<p>A <code>COMEFROM</code> anywhere in a program can grab control flow from the line you are reading. And in some implementations, if many <code>COMEFROM</code>'s reference the same line, execution splits off in each direction.</p>
<p>A <code>COMEFROM</code> is the inverse of a <code>GOTO</code> statement with multi-threading thrown in. It breaks the mental model of imperative execution where each line's evaluation leads to the next line. The idea that you can simulate its execution in your head, line by line, is fundamental to imperative programming and <code>COMEFROM</code> attempts to break that model.</p>

<p>At Twitter, they have a giant monorepo with lots of services in it.  And somebody at Twitter wanted to know which language was most prevalent.  Which language does Twitter use the most?</p>
<p>Java came in 3rd, and Scala came in 2nd. But 1st was a surprise.  The number one programming language used at Twitter was YAML.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>YAML usually doesn't feel like a programming language to me.  The file I'm currently writing in is in markdown with some YAML at the top to set the title and associated fields:</p>
<pre><code>title: INTERCAL, YAML, And Other Horrible Programming Languages
author: Adam
</code></pre>
<p>Nothing executes this YAML. It only offers some information to the blogging platform. But I don't think that is the type of YAML that made up the bulk of config at Twitter.</p>
<p>I suspect a lot of it was build and deployment scripts in the form of YAML. It was the type of configuration that encoded the control flow of some external system.  YAML like that lives in this grey zone between declarative configuration and a full-blown programming language.</p>
<p>I'll show you what I mean. Let's look at an example from <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/blob/master/.travis.yml">shellcheck</a>'s build script:</p>
<pre><code>language: shell
os: linux

services:
  - docker
</code></pre>
<p>That seems like straight-forward config.</p>
<pre><code>jobs:
  include:
    - stage: Build
      env: BUILD=linux
      workspaces:
        create:
          name: ws-linux
          paths: deploy
</code></pre>
<p><code>create</code>, in the above, is starting to seem a bit more like execution. Let's continue.</p>
<pre><code>      script:
        - ls -la ${CASHER_DIR}/ || true
        - tar -xvf ${CASHER_DIR}/ws-osx-fetch.tgz --strip-components=5
        - ls -la deploy
        - ./.github_deploy
</code></pre>
<p>Now the YAML has just devolved into specifying how to execute a grab bag of commands.  We haven't seen control-flow yet, but it's coming.</p>
<pre><code>      if: type = push
      script:
        - source ./.multi_arch_docker
        - set -ex; multi_arch_docker::main; set +x
</code></pre>
<p>There we go, branching. It's an if statement in a YAML file!</p>
<p>That was for TravisCI but this isn't TravisCI, or CI specific.  Here is a simple example from Ansible:</p>
<pre><code>- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - include: foo.yml
      when: something == "foo"
    
    - include: bar.yml
      when: something == "bar"
</code></pre>
<p>Here is GitHub Actions:</p>
<pre><code>steps:
 - name: Step 7
   if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' &amp;&amp; github.event.action == 'unassigned' }}
   run: echo This event is a pull request that had an assignee removed.
</code></pre>
<p>Here is part of a Grafana <a href="https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/grafana/templates/deployment.yaml">Helm Chart</a>:</p>
<pre><code>
{{ if (or (not .Values.persistence.enabled) (eq .Values.persistence.type "pvc")) }}
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ template "grafana.fullname" . }}
  namespace: {{ template "grafana.namespace" . }}
  labels:
    {{- include "grafana.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
{{- if .Values.labels }}
{{ toYaml .Values.labels | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
{{- with .Values.annotations }}
  annotations:
{{ toYaml . | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
</code></pre>
<p>I think this is a problem. Writing control flow in a config file is like hammering in a screw. It's a useful tool being used for the wrong job<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>How did we get to this world of little programming languages embedded into YAML? Is calling something configuration just less scary? And if so, is a c++ program just config you give to gcc?</p>
<p>Did things ever get this complicated in XML times?</p>
<p>It turns out they did:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:output method="text" omit-xml-declaration="yes" /&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:call-template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
      &lt;xsl:with-param name="i" select="1" /&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:param name="i" /&gt;
    &lt;xsl:choose&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="($i mod 3) = 0 and ($i mod 5) = 0"&gt;FizzBuzz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="$i mod 3 = 0"&gt;Fizz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="$i mod 5 = 0"&gt;Buzz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="$i" /&gt;&lt;xsl:text&gt;&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:choose&gt;
    &lt;xsl:if test="$i &amp;lt; 100"&gt;
      &lt;xsl:call-template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
        &lt;xsl:with-param name="i" select="$i + 1" /&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:if&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>That is <code>FizzBuzz</code> in <a href="https://gist.github.com/JustinPealing/6f619a23729720a9c14d9917201028c8">XSLT</a>. I assume it was written in jest, but in many ways, XML and XSLT are better than an ad-hoc YAML based scripting language. XSLT is a documented and standardized thing, not just some ad-hoc format for specifying execution.</p>
<p>It burns my eyes to look at it, but at least XSLT was intended to be used as a programming language. That is something we can't say about YAML or INTERCAL.</p>
<p>The problem with these languages embedded into YAML is they are all one-off implementations.  TravisCI conditionals have a TravisCI specific syntax, usage, and features. You can't use Travis's <code>concat</code> function or conditional regex in the YAML configuration for your ansible playbooks.</p>
<p>In a vague way, this YAML problem is like the <code>COMEFROM</code> problem. If you know yaml, you can't just open a .yml file and start reading file line by line.  You need to understand how the configuration controls the execution of the specific system it's for.  And that is hard.</p>
<h2 id="ihavenofileandimustscream">I HAVE NO FILE AND I MUST SCREAM</h2>
<p>The line between configuration and programming languages is not some bright dividing line. It's easy to slowly drift into adding programming language constructs to a config file. Before you know it, you have a full unspecified programming language embedded in the interpretation of your config file.</p>
<p>That is the worst of both worlds, and so much YAML seems to drift into this area.</p>
<p>I like YAML more than XML, but for control flow, you know what would be better than YAML? Anything else!  Maybe even INTERCAL? I mean, how bad could a joke programming language be?</p>

  <big>redbean</big><br>
  <small>single-file distributable web server</small>
</h2>

<p>
  redbean makes it possible to share web applications that run offline
  as a
  single-file <a aria-label="Actually Portable Executable" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/justine/ape.html">αcτµαlly
  pδrταblε εxεcµταblε</a> zip archive which contains your assets. All
  you need to do is download the <code>redbean.com</code> program below,
  change the filename to .zip, add your content in a zip tool like
  Windows 10 or InfoZIP, and change the extension back to .com.

</p><p>
  redbean can serve 1 million+ gzip encoded responses per second on a
  cheap personal computer. That performance is thanks to zip and gzip
  using the same compression format, which enables kernelspace copies.
  Another reason redbean goes fast is that it's a tiny static binary,
  which makes fork memory paging nearly free.

</p><p>
  redbean is also easy to modify to suit your own needs. The program
  itself is written as a single .c file.

  Assets can be listed by running the following command:

</p><pre>unzip -vl redbean.com        # lists files
</pre>

<p>
  Assets can be added to the zip archive as follows:

</p><pre>zip redbean.com index.html   # adds file
</pre>

<p>
  By default, anything you add to the archive gets compressed. Sometimes
  you don't want that to happen. A good example is video files. The web
  browser will want to send HTTP range requests to seek in the video, in
  which case redbean requires that the asset be uncompressed.

</p><pre>zip -0 redbean.com video.mp4  # adds file without compression
</pre>

<p>
  Each connection uses a point in time snapshot of your ZIP file.
  If your ZIP is deleted then serving continues. If it's replaced
  then issuing SIGUSR1 (or SIGHUP if daemon) will reindex the zip
  for subsequent connections without interrupting active ones. If
  SIGINT or SIGTERM is issued then a graceful shutdown is started
  but if it's issued a second time, active connections are reset.

I will later create an accompanying video to go over the Dasung HD-FT teardown process.</p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_203519.jpg"></p><h2 id="overview-of-the-dasung-hd-ft">Overview of the Dasung HD-FT</h2><p>The Dasung HD-FT is a third-generation e-ink monitor with a display of 13.3“, a screen resolution of 2200x1650, a touchscreen, and an adjustable backlight. The monitor connects via a proprietary Y cable, with connections for USB and HDMI; additionally, the Dasung HD-FT can be powered by the micro-usb connection on the left side.</p><p>Once connected to a computer, it acts as a second monitor or, for our purposes, a primary monitor for our e-ink laptop. The monitor’s physical buttons allow you to adjust the contrast, brightness, clear the screen, and change modes.</p><p>The modes (M1, M2, M3, Fast, Fast++, Black, Black+, Black++) correspond to how the monitor displays what’s rendered in the screen using different shades of grey or black/white.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look and dismantle the Dasung HD-FT and look at its components.</p><h2 id="opening-the-dasung-paperlike-hd-ft">Opening the Dasung Paperlike HD-FT</h2><p>Similar to Zettler’s observations and approach, the Dasung HD-FT is made of one piece of construction. I first began with a knife, carefully prying the outer edges of the Dasung Monitor where it’s all glued and making my way slowly through all of the sides.</p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_194558.jpg"></p><p>Once I finished prying through all of the sides, what became visible were the screws that were holding everything together.</p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_194714.jpg"></p><p>After removing all of the screws, I was able to gain access to the panel!</p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_203519.jpg"></p><h2 id="the-e-ink-display-module-and-control-board">The E-ink display module and control board</h2><p>Like Zettler discovered, the Dasung HD-FT chip components upon closer inspection were also chemically peeled off to prevent reverse engineering of the e-ink display and control board.</p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_201821.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_201158.jpg"> <img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_201211.jpg"></p><h2 id="es133tt3-display-module">ES133TT3 Display Module</h2><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_201921.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_202037.jpg"> <img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_202009.jpg"> <img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_202020.jpg"> <img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_202024.jpg"></p><p>The e-ink display module model number for the Dasung HD-FT is the: <span><strong>ES133TT3</strong></span></p><p>beck-elektronik<span data-nosnippet=""><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></span> describes it as “<em>reflective electrophoretic E Ink technology display module based on active matrix TFT and plastic substrate.

<p>Oh come on!  Don’t play it safe and only go just go for a Coke or Pepsi.  You’re in Japan now.  It’s time to try something more adventurous.</p>



<p>Vending machines mainly for carbonated drinks started appearing across the country in 1960.&nbsp; Now there are an estimated 2,470,000 of them throughout Japan or 1 for approximately every 50 people.&nbsp; Thus, it is easy to grab either a cold or hot drink virtually anywhere in the country on a 24/7 basis.</p>



<p>While the same global players such as Coca-Cola and national powerhouses in the beverage industry like Suntory do, in fact, dominate distribution via vending machines and other channels, relatively obscure minor entrants have still managed to carve out a niche with several unique offerings.&nbsp; Even the big boys have become used to granting a creative license to their marketers to go well beyond normal colas.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Strange-Drinks-Image-from-Crea-1024x640.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="320" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Strange-Drinks-Image-from-Crea-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Strange-Drinks-Image-from-Crea-300x188.jpg 300w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Strange-Drinks-Image-from-Crea.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"><figcaption>Some of the more unusual selections from Ryoko Shimizu’s Top 50, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The sheer variety of beverages—<em>both non-alcoholic and alcoholic</em>—available in Japan is staggering. &nbsp;To make sense of it all is soft drink critic Ryoko Shimizu (aside–<em>now that’s a cool job!</em>).&nbsp; She has been reviewing the world of non-alcoholic Japanese beverages since the 1980s.&nbsp; Shimizu recently published a <a href="https://news.nifty.com/article/entame/etc/12113-930661/">Top 50 list of her all-time favorites</a> (the original article in Japanese only).</p>



<p>…but wait!  First you need to know this.</p>



<h3><strong>What’s a <em>supodo</em>?</strong></h3>



<p><em>Supodo</em> (スポド) is an abbreviation for the made-up English term “sports drink” in Japanese.&nbsp; This category is a type of soft drink that replenishes the water and minerals lost from the body due to perspiration, especially during exercise. &nbsp;It supposedly helps to prevent dehydration and the potential for heatstroke while playing sports under the scorching sun.</p>



<h3><strong>Top Fifty</strong></h3>



<p>Okay, now that this term has been defined, let’s get to Shimizu’s extensive list which includes plenty of <em>supodo</em> as well as other types of drinks!</p>



<p>Not all of her favorites are still around, but, despite humble beginnings in some cases, a surprising number have since gone mainstream.&nbsp; Scroll down to see how Shimizu ranked them by counting backward from 50 down to 1:</p>



<h4>#50 Sports Mugicha</h4>



<p><strong>Sports Mugicha</strong> sold in the 1990s by Kanebo:&nbsp; Shimizu wrote, “When I first heard the name of this drink, my first impression was that it must be a blend of traditional barley tea and a ‘sports drink.’&nbsp; It consists, in fact, of a combination of an appropriate amount of salt mixed with regular barley tea to enhance its absorption into the body. &nbsp;The can was decorated with a theme from the professional baseball team Yokohama BayStars.”</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="223" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sports-Mugicha-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sports-Mugicha-Image-from-Crea.jpg 223w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sports-Mugicha-Image-from-Crea-209x300.jpg 209w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px"><figcaption>Sports Mugicha (barley tea), Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#49 Mountain Dew</h4>



<p><strong>Mountain Dew</strong> launched in 1981 by Pepsi Co:&nbsp; This long-seller, which is still popular today, is marketed in Japan with the tag line “new citrus beverage.”&nbsp; The package has changed little over the years.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="239" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mountain-Dew-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mountain-Dew-Image-from-Crea.jpg 239w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mountain-Dew-Image-from-Crea-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px"><figcaption>Mountain Dew (written in Japanese), Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#48 Tab Clear</h4>



<p><strong>Tab Clear</strong> launched in 1993 by Coca-Cola:&nbsp; Shimizu commented, “It became a hot topic because it was a transparent cola, but I remember that it was subtle in terms of taste. Kotaro Tawara, a popular newscaster at the time, appeared in a commercial.”</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="245" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tab-Clear-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tab-Clear-Image-from-Crea.jpg 245w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tab-Clear-Image-from-Crea-230x300.jpg 230w" sizes="(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px"><figcaption>Tab Clear, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#47 Tsubu-Tsubu Orange</h4>



<p><strong>Tsubu-Tsubu Orange</strong> was sold in the 1990s by Yamato:&nbsp; This orange drink was conceived based upon the trend of mashed fruit drinks in the 1980s.&nbsp; “Tsubu” means “bead” or “drop” in Japanese.&nbsp; When it was launched, Tsubu-Tsubu Orange lacked national distribution.&nbsp; It was only marketed locally in Nagoya, near where it was made.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="208" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tsubu-Tsubu-Orange-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tsubu-Tsubu-Orange-Image-from-Crea.jpg 208w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tsubu-Tsubu-Orange-Image-from-Crea-195x300.jpg 195w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px"><figcaption>Tsubu Tsubu Orange, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#46 Post Water</h4>



<p><strong>Post Water</strong> launched in 1990 by Kirin:&nbsp; Made from lychees, this <em>supodo</em>  or “sports drink” made quite a scene when it debuted in an unusually-shaped flask.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="554" height="554" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Post-Water-Image-Sourced-from-Twitter.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Post-Water-Image-Sourced-from-Twitter.jpg 554w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Post-Water-Image-Sourced-from-Twitter-300x300.jpg 300w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Post-Water-Image-Sourced-from-Twitter-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px"><figcaption>Post Water, Image sourced from Twitter</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#45 Cheerio Grape</h4>



<p><strong>Cheerio Grape</strong> launched in 1965 by Cheerio:&nbsp; Shimizu fondly recalls Cheerio’s Grape drink as being for sale at the candy store near her childhood home.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="204" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cheerio-Grape-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cheerio-Grape-Image-from-Crea.jpg 204w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cheerio-Grape-Image-from-Crea-191x300.jpg 191w" sizes="(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px"><figcaption>Cheerio Grape, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#44 J Water</h4>



<p><strong>J Water</strong> launched in 1993 by Suntory:&nbsp; This drink made its debut as an officially licensed beverage of the J League or Japan Professional Football (soccer) League back when J League was new.&nbsp; This “sports drink” did not have a particularly distinctive taste, but the taste was secondary to packaging in any case.&nbsp; There are also team-specific variants.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="195" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/J-Water-Image-from-Bunshun-Online.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/J-Water-Image-from-Bunshun-Online.jpg 195w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/J-Water-Image-from-Bunshun-Online-183x300.jpg 183w" sizes="(max-width: 195px) 100vw, 195px"><figcaption>J. Water, Image sourced from Bunshun Online</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#43 Ambasa</h4>



<p><strong>Ambasa</strong> launched in 1982 by Coca-Cola:&nbsp; Shimizu commented, “I felt a little &nbsp;uncomfortable with the unfamiliar word ‘Ambasa’ at first, but I quickly got used to it because it was put into virtually every Coca-Cola vending machine.” &nbsp;This carbonated beverage looks milky and tastes lighter than Calpis Soda. &nbsp;There were also melon and pine flavors for a while.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="240" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ambasa-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ambasa-Image-from-Crea.jpg 240w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ambasa-Image-from-Crea-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px"><figcaption>Ambasa, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#42 Apple Oolong Soda</h4>



<p><strong>Apple Oolong Soda</strong> launched in 1988 by Kirin:&nbsp; This is another drink that relies primarily upon packaging to drum up sales.&nbsp; It features characters from the anime Modern Children (いまどきのこども), which attracted a lot of attention when launched.  It is still fairly popular.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="239" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Apple-Oolong-Soda-Image-from-Bunshun-Online.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Apple-Oolong-Soda-Image-from-Bunshun-Online.jpg 239w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Apple-Oolong-Soda-Image-from-Bunshun-Online-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px"><figcaption>Apple Oolong Soda, Image sourced from Bunshun Online</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#41 Sweet Kiss</h4>



<p><strong>Sweet Kiss</strong> launched in 1982 by Cheerio:&nbsp; Sweet Kiss is sort of a variant of Mountain Dew (#49) and features a distinctive graphic design.&nbsp; It is, however, still relatively difficult to find this drink even in Tokyo.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="590" height="442" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sweet-Kiss-Image-from-J-Town-Net.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sweet-Kiss-Image-from-J-Town-Net.jpg 590w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sweet-Kiss-Image-from-J-Town-Net-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"><figcaption>Sweet  Kiss, Image sourced from J Town Net</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#40 Saruo Monkey King</h4>



<p><strong>Saruo Monkey King</strong> launched in 1994 by Lotte:&nbsp; The name Saruo literally means “monkey king” in Japanese.&nbsp; It was originally marketed as an exclusive type of oolong tea made from tea leaves grown on cliffs where monkeys like to forage food.&nbsp; There is, naturally, some question about whether monkeys actually harvest tea leaves.&nbsp; One of the respondents reportedly remarked in a taste test, “It sort of smells like a monkey.”&nbsp; Luckily for the brand, there are, however, plenty of other people who disagree!</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="216" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Saruo-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Saruo-Image-from-Crea.jpg 216w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Saruo-Image-from-Crea-203x300.jpg 203w" sizes="(max-width: 216px) 100vw, 216px"><figcaption>Saruo or “monkey king” in Japanese, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#39 Afternoon Tea</h4>



<p><strong>Afternoon Tea</strong> launched in sold in 1986 by Kirin:&nbsp; This drink is a best selling long-runner.&nbsp; It is fairly sweet and was the first black tea sold in a 1.5 liter PET bottle.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="194" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Afternoon-Tea-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Afternoon-Tea-Image-from-Crea.jpg 194w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Afternoon-Tea-Image-from-Crea-182x300.jpg 182w" sizes="(max-width: 194px) 100vw, 194px"><figcaption>Afternoon Tea, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#38 Bireley’s Orange</h4>



<p><strong>Bireley’s Orange</strong> launched in 1951 by Asahi:&nbsp; The name of this ultra-long-runner, “Birely’s,” used to be synonymous orange juice. Since the 1970s, when restrictions were introduced that limited marketers’ ability to label a drink as juice unless it was 100% juice, Birely’s had to drop the reference to juice.&nbsp; This minor setback did, however,  not make a major dent in its market share.  The brand is still sold today.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="239" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Birelys-Orange-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Birelys-Orange-Image-from-Crea.jpg 239w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Birelys-Orange-Image-from-Crea-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px"><figcaption>Bireley’s Orange, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#37 Hokuriku Soda Godzilla Matsui Can</h4>



<p><strong>Hokuriku Soda Godzilla Matsui Can</strong> launched in 1997 by Soka Komatsuen:&nbsp; This is a locally produced drink made to help immortalize the famous baseball player Hideki Matsui who was also a “favorite son” of Ishikawa Prefecture.&nbsp; Matsui, whose nickname was “Godzilla,” was a home run king who went on to play for the New York Yankees.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="214" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hokuriku-Soda-Godzilla-Can-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hokuriku-Soda-Godzilla-Can-Image-from-Crea.jpg 214w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hokuriku-Soda-Godzilla-Can-Image-from-Crea-201x300.jpg 201w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px"><figcaption>Hokuriku Soda Godzilla Matsui Can, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#36 Honey Lemon</h4>



<p><strong>Honey Lemon</strong> launched in 1986 by Suntory:&nbsp; This fruit drink experienced explosive sales upon its release.&nbsp; Suntory had a problem, though.&nbsp; As they could not register a trademark for “honey lemon” or even its nickname in Japanese <em>hachi-lemo</em>, this particular name essentially became its own category because several other manufacturers flooded the market with similar drinks by the same name.&nbsp; It is a classic example of just how cut-throat the non-alcoholic drink industry can be in Japan.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="225" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Honey-Lemon-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Honey-Lemon-Image-from-Crea.jpg 225w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Honey-Lemon-Image-from-Crea-211x300.jpg 211w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"><figcaption>Honey Lemon, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#35 McCOL</h4>



<p><strong>McCOL</strong> launched in 1982 by MMC:&nbsp; This collector’s item has long since been taken off the market.&nbsp; It was, apparently, relatively hard to find even when it was available through the mid-1990s.&nbsp; McCOL was marketed as “barley cola,” but it looked just like any other cola.&nbsp; The taste was a combination of barley tea and cider.</p>

<h4>#34 TESS Milk Tea</h4>



<p><strong>TESS Milk Tea</strong> sold in the late 1980s by Suntory:&nbsp; TESS had a relatively short lifetime as a semi-sweet type of milk tea.</p>

<h4>#33 NCAA</h4>



<p><strong>NCAA</strong> launched in 1981 by Suntory:&nbsp; Named for the National College Athletic Association (NCAA), this classic sports drink was introduced as “the brand new thirst quencher for those who love sports.”</p>

<h4>#32 Atamaruko</h4>



<p><strong>Atamaruko</strong> launched in 1990 by Suntory:&nbsp; This citrus mixture of kumquats and calamansi (aka “Philippine lime”) was actually sold hot in the heated section of vending machines. Its name means, in fact, “A Child to Warm You Up.”&nbsp; The cute package design proved effective at attracting customers. &nbsp;It actually led to a second-generation character called “Nacchan” that became even more famous than Atamaruko, who was relegated to the status of “the unknown older sister.”</p>

<h4>#31 Gatorade</h4>



<p><strong>Gatorade</strong> sold in the 1980s by Yukijirushi:&nbsp; Having been replaced by homegrown rival Pocari Sweat, American uber-brand Gatorade is no longer sold in cans in Japan. It was, though, the first “sports drink” to appear in Japan.&nbsp; At that point, Gatorade was only available as a powder.</p>

<h4>#30 Dr. Nakamatsu’s Head Tea</h4>



<p><strong>Dr. Nakamatsu’s Head Tea</strong> launched in 1994 by Cheerio:&nbsp; Now we’re entering the realm of the truly odd.&nbsp; Named for Dr. Yoshiro Nakamatsu, a leading researcher of “smart foods” at the time of launch, this strong blended tea was somehow supposed to enhance cognitive capability.&nbsp; Years later, the same Dr. Nakamatsu gained additional notoriety outside Japan by winning the “Ig Noble …</p></div></div>

<p>Nearly two years after releasing 1.0 Alpha 1, and after seven alpha releases,
            we are ready to bring EdgeDB to the public beta phase!</p>
<p>This means that as of now, we will make every effort to keep the public-facing
            APIs backwards compatible.  This includes EdgeQL, our standard library,
            schema definition language, official database clients’ APIs, even CLI
            commands and their options.  Most importantly, EdgeDB’s dumps made today
            will be restorable in future versions of the database.</p>
<p>This release completes a set of features we feel are crucial for
            a well-rounded 1.0 product, and we invite early adopters to try it out.
            On our end, we’re spending the next few months on getting EdgeDB ready
            for the first stable release.  Entering Beta means we won’t be adding
            new features until the release of 1.0 final.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/download">download</a> 1.0b1 in a number of ways or try it out
            in our <a href="https://tutorial.edgedb.com/">interactive tutorial</a> without the need to install
            anything.</p>

<h4>What’s EdgeDB</h4>
<p>EdgeDB is an advanced <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb">open source</a> relational database built
            on top of PostgreSQL which aims to <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/blog/a-path-to-a-10x-database">change the game</a> in terms
            of data layer usability and performance.</p>
<p>It combines an expressive object-oriented data model with a composable
            query language based on set logic, making complex data schemas easy to
            express, populate, and query.  The query system’s explicit goal is to
            address <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql">shortcomings of SQL</a>.</p>
<p>As a database designed for the long haul, EdgeDB allows for your data
            to evolve along with changing business needs, by providing built-in
            support for schema migrations.  It’s also developed in the open and
            under the permissive Apache license.</p>
<p>EdgeDB’s performance focus is embodied in its carefully designed
            first-party database clients (currently available for JavaScript, Go,
            and Python.)  The database server itself compiles EdgeQL queries to
            efficient SQL in ways that outperform many manually written queries.</p>
<p>As a modern database, EdgeDB also provides interoperability with your
            other services via built-in support for GraphQL, REST, and easy <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/docs/clients/01_js/api/connection#Connection.queryJSON">casting
                from and to JSON</a> while keeping your data strictly typed.</p>
<div id="built-in-database-migrations-in-use">

<p>We believe that managing the evolution of your data models is a crucial
                feature in a modern database product.  The alternatives would be either
                weakly typed schemas or a third-party product.  We’re not satisfied with
                either.  The former unnecessarily moves some of the responsibilities of
                the database into your application code, making data consistency harder
                and development more error-prone.  The latter on the other hand usually
                ties you to a particular database connection framework in a particular
                programming language, putting that language in a privileged position.
                This is suboptimal in today’s environment where very often mobile
                applications are written in multiple programming languages, a Web
                front-end can be another, and back-end processing using yet another.</p>
<p>With Beta 1, the migrations functionality we envisioned for EdgeDB
                is fully realized.  While you could <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/docs/edgeql/ddl/migrations">start, populate, and commit
                    migrations</a> from EdgeQL directly for a few releases
                already, now you can fully manage migrations from the CLI, making the
                workflow even more high-level.</p>
<p>The idea here is to be able to version your schema alongside your
                source code, possibly as a separate repository that you can link
                as a submodule in multiple applications that your system consists of.
                That repository would hold schema files describing migrations between
                different states of your data model.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s say we start with the following schema for a simple
                chat app:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>module</span> <span>default</span> {
    <span>type</span> User {
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> name <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> email <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> password_hash <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
    }

    <span>type</span> Message {
        <span>required</span> <span>link</span> author <span>-&gt;</span> User;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> body <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> timestamp <span>-&gt;</span> <span>datetime</span> {
            <span>default</span> <span>:=</span> <span>datetime_current</span>()
        }
    }
};</span></span></pre>
<p>The migration CLI looks for <code>.esdl</code> files in the <code>dbschema</code> directory
                by default, so let’s create one and write the above into a
                <code>dbschema/default.esdl</code> file inside it.  Let’s
                <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/docs/tutorial/install/">install</a> EdgeDB server and then create a new
                database instance for our chat app:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb server init chatapp</span></span></pre>
<p>Now, we can create the initial migration to the schema we’ve written above:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb -I chatapp create-migration
did you create object type 'default::User'? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]</span></span></pre>
<p>This is new, what do all those possible actions mean?  Let’s find out:</p>
<pre><span><span>?

y - confirm the prompt, use the DDL statements
n - reject the prompt
l - list the DDL statements associated with prompt
c - list already confirmed EdgeQL statements
b - revert back to previous save point, perhaps previous question
s - stop and save changes (splits migration into multiple)
q - quit without saving changes
h or ? - print help
did you create object type 'default::User'? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]</span></span></pre>
<p>That’s clear, we did in fact create <code>User</code>. Let’s confirm:</p>
<pre><span><span>y
did you create object type 'default::Message'? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]
y
Created dbschema/migrations/00001.edgeql, id:
m1ufwaxcqiwcq3ttcujnxv6f3jewhfrywc442z6gjk3sm3e5fgyr4q</span></span></pre>
<p>This creates the first migration file
                <code>dbschema/migrations/00001.edgeql</code>. After reviewing it to make
                sure everything is in order, we can apply the migration with the
                following command:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb -I chatapp migrate
Applied m1ufwaxcqiwcq3ttcujnxv6f3jewhfrywc442z6gjk3sm3e5fgyr4q
(00001.edgeql)</span></span></pre>
<p>In the course of implementing our app we decide to add more features,
                such as a friends list and multiple chat channels, so we alter our
                schema to be:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>module</span> <span>default</span> {
    <span>type</span> User {
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> name <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> email <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> password_hash <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;

        <span>multi</span> <span>link</span> friends <span>-&gt;</span> User;
    }

    <span>type</span> Message {
        <span>required</span> <span>link</span> author <span>-&gt;</span> User;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> body <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> timestamp <span>-&gt;</span> <span>datetime</span> {
            <span>default</span> <span>:=</span> <span>datetime_current</span>()
        }

        <span>link</span> channel <span>-&gt;</span> Channel;
    }

    <span>type</span> Channel {
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> title <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span> {
            <span>constraint</span> <span>exclusive</span>;
        };
        <span>property</span> description <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
    }
};</span></span></pre>
<p>And we apply the changes by using <code>create-migration</code> and <code>migrate</code>
                commands again:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb -I chatapp create-migration
did you create object type 'default::Channel'? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]
y
did you create link 'channel' of object type 'default::Message'?
[y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]
y
did you create link 'friends' of object type 'default::User'?
[y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]
y
Created dbschema/migrations/00002.edgeql, id:
m1kebitqygj3o75wvrnicnpwthinqsofb6hnpbnr7vrtjfynqelmzq
$ edgedb -I chatapp migrate
Applied m1kebitqygj3o75wvrnicnpwthinqsofb6hnpbnr7vrtjfynqelmzq
(00002.edgeql)</span></span></pre>
<p>At this point we may want to actually create a default channel “Main”
                and make the <code>channel</code> link required. So we alter the schema to make
                the link required and run <code>create-migration</code> again:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb -I chatapp create-migration
did you make link 'channel' of object type 'default::Message'
required? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]</span></span></pre>
<p>Indeed we did but for the sake of curiosity let’s list the DDL that
                the tool is producing for us here:</p>
<pre><span><span>l

Following DDL statements will be applied:
ALTER TYPE default::Message {
    ALTER LINK channel {
        SET REQUIRED USING (\(fill_expr));
    };
};</span></span></pre>
<p>Interestingly the DDL statement specifies that some expression will
                have to be provided to backfill data in the database.  Let’s see how
                it deals with this:</p>
<pre><span><span>did you make link 'channel' of object type 'default::Message'
required? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]
y
Please specify an expression to populate existing objects in
order to make link 'channel' required:
fill_expr&gt; SELECT Channel FILTER .title = 'Main'
Created dbschema/migrations/00003.edgeql, id:
m1wk64aoerkmvbdlurcxjxgbgv6c3xmuo3uz7pxc3gauyx4muysg6q</span></span></pre>
<p>However, before applying this migration we also add the line <code>INSERT
default::Channel {title := 'Main'};</code> at the beginning of the
                migration block in the <code>dbschema/migrations/00003.edgeql</code> file
                to ensure the <code>SELECT</code> above finds the default channel.
                Now we can actually apply the changes:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb -I chatapp migrate
edgedb error: could not read migrations in dbschema/migrations:
could not read migration file dbschema/migrations/00003.edgeql:
migration name should be
`m1fckqi5wqjtgynu77ummambcid3c2xp7wq4piadh5glbxcyxrkkba` but
`m1wk64aoerkmvbdlurcxjxgbgv6c3xmuo3uz7pxc3gauyx4muysg6q` is used
instead.
Migration names are computed from the hash of the migration
contents. To proceed you must fix the statement to read as:
  CREATE MIGRATION
  m1fckqi5wqjtgynu77ummambcid3c2xp7wq4piadh5glbxcyxrkkba ONTO ...
if this migration is not applied to any database. Alternatively,
revert the changes to the file.</span></span></pre>
<p>Uh-oh! The migration failed, but the error message actually explains
                what happened: the tool discovered we made manual changes to the file.
                Since this is deliberate, we just need to adjust the migration hash in
                order to proceed.  The tool even supplies us with the new hash. After
                adjusting the migration file, we can now apply it:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb -I chatapp migrate
Applied m1fckqi5wqjtgynu77ummambcid3c2xp7wq4piadh5glbxcyxrkkba</span></span></pre></div></section></article></div>

<p>
<span><i>ABSTRACT</i></span></p>


<p>
<span>Symbolic links make the Unix file system non-hierarchical, resulting in
multiple valid path names for a given file.
This ambiguity is a source of confusion, especially since some shells
work overtime to present a consistent view from programs such as
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>,
while other programs and
the kernel itself do nothing about the problem.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Plan 9 has no symbolic links but it does have other mechanisms that produce the same difficulty.
Moreover, Plan 9 is founded on the ability to control a program’s environment
by manipulating its name space.
Ambiguous names muddle the result of operations such as copying a name space across
the network.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>To address these problems,
the Plan 9 kernel has been modified to maintain an accurate path name for every active
file (open file, working directory, mount table entry) in the system.
The definition of ‘accurate’ is that the path name for a file is guaranteed to be the rooted,
absolute name
the program used to acquire it.
These names are maintained by an efficient method that combines lexical processing—such as
evaluating
</span><span><tt>..</tt></span><span>
by just removing the last path name element of a directory—with
local operations within the file system to maintain a consistently, easily understood view
of the name system.
Ambiguous situations are resolved by examining the lexically maintained names themselves.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>A new kernel call,
</span><span><tt>fd2path</tt></span><span>,
returns the file name associated with an open file,
permitting the use of reliable names to improve system
services ranging from
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
to debugging.
Although this work was done in Plan 9,
Unix systems could also benefit from the addition of
a method to recover the accurate name of an
open file or the current directory.
</span></p>

<span><tt>/home/rob</tt></span></p>

<p>
<span>(The same output results from running
</span><span><tt>tcsh</tt></span><span>;
we’ll discuss
</span><span><tt>ksh</tt></span><span>
in a moment.)
To a neophyte being schooled in the delights of a hierarchical file name space,
this behavior must be baffling.
It is, of course, the consequence of a series of symbolic links intended to give users
the illusion they share a disk, when in fact their files are scattered over several devices:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;ls&nbsp;-ld&nbsp;/home/rob&nbsp;/home/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>lrwxr-xr-x&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;root&nbsp;&nbsp;sys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14&nbsp;Dec&nbsp;26&nbsp;&nbsp;1998&nbsp;/home/ken&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;/n/bopp/v6/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>lrwxr-xr-x&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;root&nbsp;&nbsp;sys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14&nbsp;Dec&nbsp;23&nbsp;&nbsp;1998&nbsp;/home/rob&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;/n/bopp/v7/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>The introduction of symbolic links has changed the Unix file system from a true
hierarchy into a directed graph, rendering
</span><span><tt>..</tt></span><span>
ambiguous and sowing confusion.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Unix popularized hierarchical naming, but the introduction of symbolic links
made its naming irregular.
Worse, the
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
command, through the underlying
</span><span><tt>getwd</tt></span><span>
library routine,
uses a tricky, expensive algorithm that often delivers the wrong answer.
Starting from the current directory,
</span><span><tt>getwd</tt></span><span>
opens the parent,
</span><span><tt>..</tt></span><span>,
and searches it for an entry whose i-number matches the current directory;
the matching entry is the final path element of the ultimate result.
Applying this process iteratively,
</span><span><tt>getwd</tt></span><span>
works back towards the root.
Since
</span><span><tt>getwd</tt></span><span>
knows nothing about symbolic links, it will recover surprising names for
directories reached by them,
as illustrated by the example;
the backward paths
</span><span><tt>getwd</tt></span><span>
traverses will not backtrack across the links.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Partly for efficiency and partly to make
</span><span><tt>cd</tt></span><span>
and
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
more predictable, the Korn shell
</span><span><tt>ksh</tt></span><span>
[Korn94]
implements
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
as a builtin.
(The
</span><span><tt>cd</tt></span><span>
command must be a builtin in any shell, since the current directory is unique to each process.)
</span><span><tt>Ksh</tt></span><span>
maintains its own private view of the file system to try to disguise symbolic links;
in particular,
</span><span><tt>cd</tt></span><span>
and
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
involve some lexical processing (somewhat like the
</span><span><tt>cleanname</tt></span><span>
function discussed later
in this paper), augmented by heuristics such as examining the environment
for names like
</span><span><tt>$HOME</tt></span><span>
and
</span><span><tt>$PWD</tt></span><span>
to assist initialization of the state of the private view. [Korn00]
</span></p>
<p>
<span>This transcript begins with a Bourne shell running:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v7/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;ksh</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>This result is encouraging.  Another example, again starting from a Bourne shell:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;../ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>../ken:&nbsp;bad&nbsp;directory</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;ksh</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;cd&nbsp;../ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/home/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>By doing extra work,
the Korn shell is providing more sensible behavior,
but it is easy to defeat:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v7/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;bin</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v7/rob/bin</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;ksh</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v7/rob/bin</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;exit</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/home/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v6/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;ksh</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v6/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>In these examples,
</span><span><tt>ksh</tt></span><span>’s
built-in
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
failed to produce the results
(</span><span><tt>/home/rob/bin</tt></span><span>
and
</span><span><tt>/home/ken</tt></span><span>)
that the previous example might have led us to expect.
The Korn shell is hiding the problem, not solving it, and in fact is not even hiding it very well.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>A deeper question is whether the shell should even be trying to make
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
and
</span><span><tt>cd</tt></span><span>
do a better job.
If it does, then the
</span><span><tt>getwd</tt></span><span>
library call and every program that uses it will behave differently from the shell,
a situation that is sure to confuse.
Moreover, the ability to change directory to
</span><span><tt>../ken</tt></span><span>
with the Korn shell’s
</span><span><tt>cd</tt></span><span>
command but not with the
</span><span><tt>chdir</tt></span><span>
system call is a symptom of a diseased system, not a healthy shell.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>The operating system should provide names that work and make sense.
Symbolic links, though, are here to stay, so we need a way to provide
sensible, unambiguous names in the face of a non-hierarchical name space.
This paper shows how the challenge was met on Plan 9, an operating system
with Unix-like naming.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Names in Plan 9
</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Except for some details involved with bootstrapping, file names in Plan 9 have the same syntax as in Unix.
Plan 9 has no symbolic links, but its name space construction operators,
</span><span><tt>bind</tt></span><span>
and
</span><span><tt>mount</tt></span><span>,
make it possible to build the same sort of non-hierarchical structures created
by symbolically linking directories on Unix.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Plan 9’s
</span><span><tt>mount</tt></span><span>
system call takes a file descriptor
and attaches to the local name space the file system service it represents:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>mount(fd,&nbsp;"/dir",&nbsp;flags)</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>Here
</span><span><tt>fd</tt></span><span>
is a file descriptor to a communications port such as a pipe or network connection;
at the other end of the port is a service, such as file server, that talks 9P, the Plan 9 file
system protocol.
After the call succeeds, the root directory of the service will be visible at the
</span><span><i>mount point</i></span><span>
</span><span><tt>/dir</tt></span><span>,
much as with the
</span><span><tt>mount</tt></span><span>
call of Unix.
The
</span><span><tt>flag</tt></span><span>
argument specifies the nature of the attachment:
</span><span><tt>MREPL</tt></span><span>
says that the contents of the root directory (appear to) replace the current contents of
</span><span><tt>/dir</tt></span><span>;
</span><span><tt>MAFTER</tt></span><span>
says that the current contents of
</span><span><tt>dir</tt></span><span>
remain visible, with the mounted directory’s contents appearing
</span><span><i>after</i></span><span>
any existing files;
and
</span><span><tt>MBEFORE</tt></span><span>
says that the contents remain visible, with
the mounted directory’s contents appearing
</span><span><i>before</i></span><span>
any existing files.
These multicomponent directories are called
</span><span><i>union directories</i></span><span>
and are somewhat different from union directories in 4.4BSD-Lite [PeMc95], because
only the top-level directory itself is unioned, not its descendents, recursively.
(Plan 9’s union directories are used differently from 4.4BSD-Lite’s, as will become apparent.)
</span></p>
<p>
<span>For example, to bootstrap a diskless computer the system builds a local name space containing
only the root directory,
</span><span><tt>/</tt></span><span>,
then uses the network to open a connection
to the main file server.
It then executes
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>mount(rootfd,&nbsp;"/",&nbsp;MREPL);</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>After this call, the entire file server’s tree is visible, starting from the root of the local machine.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>While
</span><span><tt>mount</tt></span><span>
connects a new service to the local name space,
</span><span><tt>bind</tt></span><span>
rearranges the existing name space:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>bind("tofile",&nbsp;"fromfile",&nbsp;flags)</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>causes subsequent mention of the
</span><span><tt>fromfile</tt></span><span>
(which may be a plain file or a directory)
to behave as though
</span><span><tt>tofile</tt></span><span>
had been mentioned instead, somewhat like a symbolic link.
(Note, however, that the arguments are in the opposite order
compared to
</span><span><tt>ln</tt></span><span>
</span><span><tt>-s</tt></span><span>).
The
</span><span><tt>flags</tt></span><span>
argument is the same as with
</span><span><tt>mount</tt></span><span>.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>As an example, a sequence something like the following is done at bootstrap time to
assemble, under the single directory
</span><span><tt>/bin</tt></span><span>,
all of the binaries suitable for this architecture, represented by (say) the string
</span><span><tt>sparc</tt></span><span>:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>bind("/sparc/bin",&nbsp;"/bin",&nbsp;MREPL);</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>bind("/usr/rob/sparc/bin",&nbsp;"/bin",&nbsp;MAFTER);</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>This sequence of
</span><span><tt>binds</tt></span><span>
causes
</span><span><tt>/bin</tt></span><span>
to contain first the standard binaries, then the contents of
</span><span><tt>rob</tt></span><span>’s
private SPARC binaries.
The ability to build such union directories
obviates the need for a shell
</span><span><tt>$PATH</tt></span><span>
variable
while providing opportunities for managing heterogeneity.
If the system were a Power PC, the same sequence would be run with
</span><span><tt>power</tt></span><span>
textually substituted for
</span><span><tt>sparc</tt></span><span>
to place the Power PC binaries in
</span><span><tt>/bin</tt></span><span>
rather than the SPARC binaries.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Trouble is already brewing.  After these bindings are set up,
where does
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/bin</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;..</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>set the current working directory, to
</span><span><tt>/</tt></span><span>
or
</span><span><tt>/sparc</tt></span><span>
or
</span><span><tt>/usr/rob/sparc</tt></span><span>?
We will return to this issue.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>There are some important differences between
</span><span><tt>binds</tt></span><span>
and symbolic links.
First,
symbolic links are a static part of the file system, while
Plan 9 bindings are created at run time, are stored in the kernel,
and endure only as long as the system maintains them;
they are temporary.
Since they are known to the kernel but not the file system, they must
be set up each time the kernel boots or a user logs in;
permanent bindings are created by editing system initialization scripts
and user profiles rather than by building them in the file system itself.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>The Plan 9 kernel records what bindings are active for a process,
whereas symbolic links, being held on the Unix file server, may strike whenever the process evaluates
a file name.
Also, symbolic links apply to all processes that evaluate the affected file, whereas
</span><span><tt>bind</tt></span><span>
has a local scope, applying only to the process that executes it and …</span></p></div>

<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/chinopdsimmons/photos/crime-analyst-green-at-the-helm-of-our-real-time-crime-center/125426665468061/">Source: Chino Chief of Police</a></em></p>

<p dir="ltr">Over the last two decades, law enforcement agencies across the United States have been obtaining more and more sophisticated surveillance technologies to collect data. Technologies such as networked cameras, automated license plate readers, and gunshot detection are deployed around the clock, as are the tools to process this data, such as predictive policing software and AI-enhanced video analytics. The last five years have seen a distinct trend in which police have begun deploying all of this technology in conjunction with one another. The technologies, working in concert, are being consolidated and fed into physical locations called Real-Time Crime Centers (RTCCs). These high-tech hubs, filled with walls of TV monitors and computer workstations for sworn officers and civilian analysts, not only exploit huge amounts of data, but also are used to justify an increase in surveillance technology through new "data-driven" or "intelligence-led" policing strategies.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">As part of the Atlas of Surveillance project, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and students from the Reynolds School of Journalism at the University of Nevada, Reno have identified more than 80 RTCCs across the United States, with heavy concentrations in the South and the Northeast. In this report, we highlight the capabilities and controversies surrounding 7 of these facilities. As this trend expands, it is crucial that the public understands how the technologies are combined to collect data about people as they move through their day-to-day lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">RTCCs are similar to <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/why-fusion-centers-matter-faq#:~:text=about%20fusion%20centers%3F-,What%20are%20fusion%20centers%3F,who%20analyze%20and%20share%20intelligence.">Fusion Centers</a>, to the extent the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. We distinguish between the two: fusion centers are technology command centers that function on a larger regional level, are typically controlled by a state-level organization, and are formally part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's fusion center network. They also focus on distributing information about national security "threats," which are often broadly interpreted. RTCCs are generally focused on municipal or county level activities and focus on a general spectrum of public safety issues, from car thefts to gun crime to situational awareness at public events.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The term “real-time” is also somewhat misleading: while there is often a focus on accessing data in real-time to communicate to first responders, many law enforcement agencies use RTCC to mine historical data to make decisions about the future through "predictive policing," a controversial and largely unproven strategy to identify places where crime could occur or people who might commit crimes.&nbsp;</p>

<center>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="A map of the United States with small, orange circles representing real-time crime centers." src="https://atlasofsurveillance.org/files/pictures/12/content_RTCC_MAP.png"></p>
</center>

<p dir="ltr">So far, the Atlas of Surveillance project has identified RTCCs in 29 states, with the highest number in Florida (14) and New York (11); however, Mississippi also stood out with four RTCCs despite being a significantly smaller state. While RTCCs are commonly found in large metropolitan areas, even smaller cities such as Ogden, Utah and Hampton, Virginia have established their own RTCCs. There may be more RTCCs yet to be discovered. In Denver, local officials and news organizations were unaware the Denver Police Department had <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/denver-police-quietly-expand-surveillance-camera-network/73-80b180c4-2456-4a28-b106-feb1831ea61f">launched an RTCC </a>and expanded its camera network until Atlas of Surveillance researchers uncovered a job advertisement outlining its capabilities. The Honolulu Police Department has added a RTCC to its <a href="http://206.195.188.21/downloads/HPD_Moving_Forward.pdf">2020-2022 strategic plan</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">RTCCs tend to share common defining technological features, the most prominent being access to a <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/surveillance-cameras">surveillance camera network</a> with feeds that are broadcast live onto a wall of TV monitors within a centralized headquarters. The number of cameras can range from just a few hundred, as in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to more than 12,000, as in Atlanta, Georgia, but in all cases the number of cameras have been steadily growing.</p>

<p dir="ltr">RTCCs also go hand-in-hand with <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/gunshot-detection">gunshot detection technology</a>, especially ShotSpotter, a company that installs sensors throughout neighborhoods in order to listen for and locate suspected gunfire. The majority of RTCCs also tap into <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/automated-license-plate-readers-alpr">automated license plate readers</a> (ALPRs) to track and get real-time alerts on the locations of vehicles. In addition, RTCC staff typically have access to a variety of criminal justice databases and monitor social media feeds.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The starting cost of these RTCCs can range dramatically, from just a few hundred thousand dollars to as much as $11 million, as in New York City. This funding can come from a number of sources, including city budgets, voter-approved bonds, state and federal grants, private institutions, and wealthy individual donors. For example, the Atlanta Loudermilk Operation Shield Video Integration Center started with a $1-million donation from the Loudermilk family, who are real-estate developers, as well as $350,000 from the city. The price tag proved too high for the Fresno Police Department in California, which let go of its <a href="https://gvwire.com/2020/07/09/conservative-appointee-lasts-just-15-hours-on-fresno-immigrant-rights-committee/">part-time RTCC staff in 2019</a> and <a href="https://www.fresno.gov/finance/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/06/TRAY-MEMO-Response-to-Council-Direction-No.-41-Request-Audit-of-Video-Policing-Surveillance-Unit-6.18.20.pdf">ceased all real-time operations</a> at the RTCC in 2020 (although police can still access stored footage from previously installed cameras after crimes occur).&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Yet the cost barrier for these systems is steadily dropping. Based at the University of New Orleans, a private organization called <a href="https://www.projectnola.org/">Project NOLA</a> provides subsidized cameras and other technologies to cities and provides virtual RTCC software to municipalities through its NOLA National Real-Time Crime Center. So far, Project NOLA has partnered with police departments in Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, Alabama, and Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

</center>

<p dir="ltr">Funding isn't the only way that RTCCs blur the line between public and private surveillance. The Newark, New Jersey RTCC encourages citizens to view live video feeds from cameras across the city through its "<a href="https://cvp.newarkpublicsafety.org/">Citizen Virtual Patrol</a>" program. Meanwhile, police in Jackson, Mississippi began testing a new system to link doorbell cameras, including Amazon’s Ring, to their RTCC. Similar camera sharing programs are being promoted in <a href="https://www.wtxl.com/news/lcso-unveils-new-real-time-crime-center/article_af42e61c-f35a-11e8-a32d-2bd5dc910bb2.html">Leon County, Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.safecamnola.com/">New Orleans</a>.</p>

	<p>
In an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection">isometric</a>
display, it can be tricky to draw boxes of various sizes in the correct order
to keep them appropriately in front of or behind one another.  The figure below
shows an example.  The blue box should be drawn first, then green, then red.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure1a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure1b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 1: The boxes on the left are <u>not</u> drawn in the correct order, whereas the
boxes on the right are drawn correctly.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
We will explore a simple solution for determining the correct order to draw a
given set of boxes.  But first, we must define what we mean by <em>boxes</em>.
	</p>

	<h3>What do we mean by <em>boxes</em>?</h3>

	<p>
We define boxes as <em>axis-aligned</em> and <em>non-intersecting</em>
rectangular prisms. Take a look at the above Figure 1 again.  Each box is
parallel to the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em> axis (i.e.
axis-aligned).  Also, note that the boxes are next to each other but do not
intersect.
	</p>

	<h3>Determine if boxes overlap on screen.</h3>

	<p>
First of all, if two boxes do not overlap on the screen, then we do not have to
worry about which one is drawn first.  This is the first test we must perform,
which we explore in this section.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure2a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure2b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 2: No overlap on the left; overlap on the right.  (Note: we are talking
about overlap on screen, not intersection in space.)
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
The silhouettes of the 3D boxes become 2D hexagons in the isometric view, as seen below.  We use the
outline of these silhouettes to test for overlap.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure3a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure3b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 3: The box silhouettes in an isometric view are simple hexagons.  Note
that their sides are always parallel to the vertical and two diagonal axes.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
We take advantage of the fact that the hexagon sides are always parallel to
some axis.  This allows us to easily determine if the hexagons overlap by
checking for intersection of their regions on each axis.  We add an <em>h</em>
(horizontal) axis to help.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure4a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure4b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
The red and blue boxes do not overlap on the h axis, therefore they do not overlap.
The green and blue boxes do overlap since their region on every axis overlap.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
Now that we have outlined our concept for <em>determining if two boxes overlap
on the screen</em>, we will fill in the details necessary for implementing it.
	</p>

	<p>
The act of flattening the 3D box into a 2D hexagon involves getting rid of the
Z coordinate.  Notice that increasing a point's Z coordinate by 1 is the same
as incrementing both X and Y coordinates by 1.  Thus, we can add Z to both X
and Y and drop Z completely.  Shown below is the source code for a function
that performs this conversion.
	</p>

<code>
<span>function</span> spaceToIso(spacePos) <span>{</span>

    
    <span>var</span> isoX = spacePos.x + spacePos.z;
    <span>var</span> isoY = spacePos.y + spacePos.z;

    <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
        x: isoX,
        y: isoY,

        
        h: (isoX - isoY) * Math.cos(Math.PI/6),

        
        v: (isoX + isoY) / 2;
    <span>}</span>;
<span>}</span></code>

	<p>
And finally, after determining the bounds of each hexagon, we can determine if
they overlap by using the source code below.
	</p>

<code><span>function</span> doHexagonsOverlap(hex1, hex2) <span>{</span>
    
    <span>return</span> (

        
        !(hex1.xmin &gt;= hex2.xmax || hex2.xmin &gt;= hex1.xmax) &amp;&amp;

        
        !(hex1.ymin &gt;= hex2.ymax || hex2.ymin &gt;= hex1.ymax) &amp;&amp;

        
        !(hex1.hmin &gt;= hex2.hmax || hex2.hmin &gt;= hex1.hmax));
<span>}</span></code>

	<p>
Now that we have determined if two boxes overlap on the screen, we can begin exploring how to determine which box is in front of the other.
	</p>

	<h3>Determine which box is in front.</h3>

	<p>
Recall that our boxes do not intersect each other. we can visualize their separation
as a thin plane between them (see Figure 5 below).  After identifying this
plane, we can determine which box is in front by selecting the one on the
correct side of this plane.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure5a" width="230" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure5b" width="230" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure5c" width="230" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 5: A pair of blocks can be separated in one of three ways shown here.
The dark glass illustrates this separation.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
We can find this plane of separation by looking at each axis individually.  In
particular, we look for an axis which has non-intersecting box ranges (see
Figure 6 below).
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure6a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure6b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 6: On the left, the blocks are separated on the y-axis.  On the right,
the blocks are separated on the x-axis. (The z-axis is omitted for simplicity.)
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
In Figure 6 above, we have chosen a coordinate system which make lesser values
of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> to be closer to the camera.  Though not shown, the
<em>z</em> axis is positive in the up direction, so a greater value makes it
closer to the camera.
	</p>

	<p>
The following is a javascript function for determining if the first block is in
front of the second:
	</p>

	<code><span>function</span> isBoxInFront(box1, box2) <span>{</span>

    
    
    <span>if</span> (box1.xmin &gt;= box2.xmax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>false</span>; <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (box2.xmin &gt;= box1.xmax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>true</span>; <span>}</span>

    
    
    <span>if</span> (box1.ymin &gt;= box2.ymax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>false</span>; <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (box2.ymin &gt;= box1.ymax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>true</span>; <span>}</span>

    
    
    <span>if</span> (box1.zmin &gt;= box2.zmax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>true</span>; <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (box2.zmin &gt;= box1.zmax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>false</span>; <span>}</span>

<span>}</span></code>

	<h3>Draw boxes in the correct order.</h3>

	<p>
In general, <u>a box should not be drawn until all the ones behind it are
drawn</u>.  Thus, we begin by drawing the boxes that have nothing behind them.
Then, we can draw the boxes that are only in front of those that are already
drawn. This process continues until all boxes are drawn. (See Figure 4 below
for an example.)
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure7" width="650" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 4: (1) Nothing is behind blue, so draw it first. (2) Draw green next
since blue was the only one behind it and is already drawn.  (3) Then draw red,
since both blocks that were behind it have been drawn.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
To implement this algorithm, each box must know exactly which boxes are behind
it.  We have already determined how to do this in the last section.  A search
must be implemented so that each box has a list of boxes behind it.
	</p>

	<p>
You are now armed with everything you need to know to render isometric boxes in
the correct order.
	</p>

	<h3>A conundrum</h3>

	<p>
It is possible to have a situation seen in the figure below.  The aforementioned drawing
methods dictate that we first draw the box with nothing behind it, but this example illustrates
a case where this cannot be done.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure8" width="650" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Here are three boxes intertwined in a way such that one is always behind
another.  This prevents us from drawing a first box.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
The figure above cheats by segmenting the orange box into two.
This is one method of breaking this type of cycle.
	</p>

	<p>
There are formal methods used for detecting
such cycles mentioned in the appendix.  After detection of a cycle, the blocks in that cycle
could be drawn with special clipping regions to respect front boxes or to segment a block or blocks
that will break the cycle.  These are solutions that I will be exploring and updating this article as
my experiments progress.
	</p>

	<hr>
	<h2>Appendix</h2>

	<h4>A formal description of the solution</h4>

	<p>
This is a special case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painter%27s_algorithm">Painter's Algorithm</a>,
which handles occlusion by drawing back-to-front.
	</p>

	<p>
For those who are interested, our method for determining if hexagons and boxes
are overlapping is a result of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane_separation_theorem">hyperplane separation theorem</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
Also, the way in which we determined the drawing order of the boxes is known in graph theory as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topological sort</a>,
which is essentially a depth-first search of a directed graph.
	</p>

	<p>
You can build a directed graph of the <em>boxes</em>, with directed edges to
the boxes that are behind it.  Topologically sorting this graph will produce an
ordered list of boxes that can be drawn in that exact order.
	</p>

	<p>
Mathematicians will recognize this directed graph as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">partially ordered
set</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
Finally, to prevent the aforementioned cycle conundrum, we can use <a href="">Tarjan's
strongly connection components</a> algorithm.  After computing these cycles,
one could either split a block to prevent a cycle, or to use a clipping region
to prevent drawing over any blocks that are supposed to be in front of it.
	</p>

	<h4>Alternative Solutions</h4>

	<p>
You may be able to just use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering">Z-buffering</a>,
though drawing order is still important for transparent sprites.  Also, if all
bounding boxes are unit cubes, sorting is much simpler.
	</p>

	<h4>Full example of working code</h4>

	<p>
All the diagrams above were created using a simple isometric box renderer
written in Javascript, which applies all the techniques described in this
article.  You can study the fully annotated source code on <a href="https://github.com/shaunew/IsometricBlocks">IsometricBlocks project on
GitHub</a>.

<p>
Well, it's been a year since I started the draft, so I guess it's about time to publish this! :)
</p>
<p>
This is a map of my personal <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#dataliberation">data liberation</a> <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#infra">infrastructure</a>, with links to the scripts and tools used; and my blog posts elaborating on different parts of it.
</p>
<p>
My goal for data liberation is approximating the <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/sad-infra.html#data_mirror">'personal data mirror'</a> concept,
often <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">despite</a> crappy interoperability (or lack thereof) of different platforms.
</p>
<p>
I prepared this diagram for several reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>to give more context for my blog posts about data liberation and tools around it</li>
<li>to highlight the complexity and hoops we have to jump over because of the lack of interoperability</li>
<li>it was also sort of fun :)</li>
</ul>
<p>
This time I won't write too much text and just let you explore it. <b>Tips for exploring the diagram</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>perhaps open the <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/myinfra_files/myinfra.svg"><b>full size SVG</b></a> in a new tab</li>
<li>make sure to read the legend</li>
<li>links you can follow are marked with blue (and sometimes other colours)</li>
<li>there is a bubble (💬) near some nodes/edges, you can hover it to see the comment</li>
<li>some integrations are in progress: marked with <samp>WIP</samp>, construction signs (🚧🚧) and dashed edges</li>
<li>arrows roughly represent the direction of data flow</li>
<li>arrow colors roughly correspond to the data source (so it's easier to track how it flows)</li>
<li>there are some rendering issues

<ul>
<li>it's probably not very mobile friendly (it's barely desktop friendly!)</li>
<li>SVG support varies among web browsers, so there might be some minor artifacts (chromium works better, but firefox works well enough)</li>
<li>navbar centering isn't broken on this page – it's just a temporary hack to fit in the diagram till I figure out wide pages properly</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

Some <b>notes</b> regarding the diagram:
</p>
<ul>
<li>it's plotted via graphviz, and you can find the source <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/myinfra">here</a> (although the code is quite domain specific)</li>
<li>even though there is a lot of stuff on the diagram, it's still incomplete!

<ul>
<li><a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/my-data.html">here</a> there is an (also incomplete) list of data I collect/export</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/tree/master/my">HPI modules</a> are a good proxy for the data I'm using</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
note that despite some platforms dying (e.g. Jawbone/Endomondo), I can still use data produced with them!
</p>
<p>
E.g. after Endomondo was discontinued, I was able to quickly switch to open source <a href="https://github.com/jonasoreland/runnerup#readme">RunnerUp app</a>,
while <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/blob/5b501d156266ca8e185d681fab6bc3ee156498a6/my/runnerup.py">preserving</a> complete data compatibility.
</p></li>
<li>note how many services are outright malicious with their <b>anti-API/anti-scraping/anti-interoperability</b> measures (yellow/red highlight for API nodes)</li>
<li>probably more platforms have GDPR exports, I just haven't tried yet</li>
<li><p>
indirection is crazy
</p>
<p>
Note how for some data, before I can get it on my computer, it goes as
</p>
<ul>
<li>device –&gt; phone (over bluetooth)</li>
<li>phone  –&gt; cloud (over internet)</li>
<li>cloud  –&gt; computer (over internet)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
for many phone apps <b>the only way</b> I can sync the data is <b>by rooting my phone</b> in order to access the <code>/data/data</code> directory
</p>
<p>
This is getting worse and worse with every Android version. I understand the security concerns, but this is ridiculous.
</p></li>
<li><p>
some modules/packages (marked with<sup>sb</sup> superscript) were developed by <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge">Sean Breckenridge</a>
</p>
<p>
He's forked my <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI">HPI</a> package and working on it <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/HPI">in parallel</a>.
For now, we decided to hack on it independently, in the hope that eventually we figure out what's a good model for cooperating and maintaining the modules.
</p>
<p>
Also, he's done some cool work on <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/HPI_API">automatic HTTP API</a> for HPI!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<p>Milan prosecutors and the Italian Labour Inspectorate have jointly <a href="https://www.ispettorato.gov.it/it-it/notizie/Documents/Comunicato%20stampaTutele%20riders.pdf" target="_blank">ordered</a> four major food delivery platforms to fully hire over 60,000 couriers — and pay a total of €733 million in fines.</p>
<p>Couriers who worked for Uber Eats, Glovo, Just Eat and Deliveroo in Italy from 2017 to 2020 must now be treated as "coordinated and continuous workers," prosecutors declared.</p>
<p>If the companies pay the fines within 90 days, they will be able to avoid criminal proceedings — but legal experts say it's a little more complicated than that.</p>

<p>Should the platforms hire all 60,000 couriers, there's a high price to pay to catch up on previous, missed social security payments, said European labor law specialist Luca de Vecchi. Social security contributions in Italy can amount to up to 33 percent of an employee's salary and must be paid by the employer.</p>
<p>This poses a "very difficult decision" for the companies, de Vecchi added. Trying to appeal and fight the case in court risks criminal sanctions on the company managers, but accepting the fines could lead to the companies' demise. </p>
<p>"I don't know how they could manage to pay and remain alive," he said.</p>
<h3>Health and safety</h3>
<p>The sanctions are linked to alleged violations of health and safety regulations, following an investigation into driver accidents.</p>
<p>"It is no longer the time to say that riders are slaves, the time has come to say that they are citizens who need legal protection," said Milan's chief prosecutor Francesco Greco in an online press conference, according to <a href="https://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/21_febbraio_24/inchiesta-rider-pm-greco-assumere-60-mila-lavoratori-non-sono-schiavi-7d823a6c-76af-11eb-843a-1237b4657d5e.shtml" data-type="URL" data-id="https://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/21_febbraio_24/inchiesta-rider-pm-greco-assumere-60-mila-lavoratori-non-sono-schiavi-7d823a6c-76af-11eb-843a-1237b4657d5e.shtml" target="_blank">Italian media</a>.</p>
<p>"This is a very heavy blow to the platform narrative, to their business model based on false autonomy and the abuse of occasional work, on the denial of any right and the infringement of laws and contracts," added the Deliverance Milano syndicate group in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/deliverancemilano/posts/2734640120180349" target="_blank">Facebook post</a>. "There is no more time to waste: hiring and rights immediately, enough with precariousness and exploitation!"</p>

<p>The Assodelivery group — which represents the likes of Uber, Deliveroo, Glovo and JustEat — said they were "surprised" by the prosecutor's decision.</p>
<p>"The platforms, despite the specific differences, have operated in recent years in compliance with current regulations, including the classification of workers and workplace safety regulations," the group said in an emailed statement. "We therefore disagree with the picture illustrated today."</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>Attention will now turn to the platforms, and "whether they will go back to negotiate with the minister of labour and the representative trade unions to try to solve the issue," said labor law expert Valerio de Stefano.</p>
<p>A negotiated settlement might be the most likely outcome, de Vecchi said. </p>
<p>"I think that at the end of the story there will be a compromise solution that will allow these companies to stay active — probably a limited fine without any criminal prosecution," said de Vecchi. "But on the other end, they will be forced to change their operational model and to have a different standard in terms of employees' rights and guarantees."</p>
<p>The ruling comes off the back of a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1618801">U.K. supreme court ruling</a> that declared Uber drivers to be "workers" rather than self-employed contractors, as well as a recent <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1612457">Dutch appeals court decision</a> that Deliveroo drivers are employees — signs of changing times in the gig economy. </p>

<p>"What's for sure is that it is basically more and more clear: we cannot pretend anymore that these people are just genuinely self-employed as if they were small undertakings — they are workers that should be protected as such," de Stefano said.</p>

<p>In the Unabomber Manifesto, Section 212 always remained unfulfilling to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would society EVENTUALLY develop again toward an industrial-technological form? Maybe, but there is no use in worrying about it, since we can’t predict or control events 500 or 1,000 years in the future. Those problems must be dealt with by the people who will live at that time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That issue is why the “Freedom Club” revolution isn’t appealing. Genies do not go back in boxes. Similar to the communist manifesto, while problems are correctly identified, the solution leaves something to be desired.</p>

<hr>


<p>Ran Prieur takes technology and <a href="https://www.ranprieur.com/tech.html">breaks it down</a> in a more nuanced way than I think about it. I’m going to focus on a single axis.</p>

<p>Compare Waymo to comma. In one, you need cooperation from a society, in the other you don’t. One is a complex system that depends on industry and loses it’s usefulness out of context. The other is a complex self contained system.</p>

<p>A woman in a forest can create a supercomputer. This computer is off the grid, will last for 40+ years, has petaflops of compute power, and is self repairing. It exists in harmony with nature. It is non-toxic.</p>

<p>The smartphone is a marvel. The network, a nightmare. As well as the society needed to produce it.</p>

<hr>


<p>If all our world died tomorrow, from COVID-22 or something, we would leave behind godshatter. Relics with untold power. Imagine finding all that’s left is a smartphone. Useless without a solar charger, but add one and it’s a most valuable relic. And if they downloaded wikipedia offline, the discovery of that phone will allow you to rebuild it. Can we bootstrap faster?</p>

<p>That’s godshatter of the information age. A handheld device that allowed you to breathe underwater. A phaser. A portable device that could construct houses. The doctor’s mobile emitter. A machine that pulls the water from the air. A handheld flying machine. An arc reactor. All ruined if you have to connect to WiFi.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Profits">Perhaps a replicator could make you god.</a></p>

<hr>


<p>Why does anyone want Waymo? We need to decentralize the world, not build brittle systems that leak power. A Waymo network can be used for evil if evil people are at the controls. The Bitcoin blockchain has no controls. Every gun fires when its owner pulls the trigger, owned by millions. We’d live in a better world if nuclear weapons weren’t possible, owned by tens.</p>

<p>Can we build technology without industry? I fantasize about living in a forest with my AI girlfriend while we probe the universe. <b>What pathetic losers are building Twitter and Facebook.</b> That’s practically industry without technology. And they have the nerve to call themselves technology companies.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this. Am I building technology to further centralize or decentralize power?</p>

<p>Power is beautiful. Using energy to create order is the highest calling of God. Energy use isn’t bad! Uniform rectangular buildings are bad. Industrial chemical factories are bad. Humans are good.</p>

<hr>


<p>I’ve been learning biology. It’s unreal how amazing the technology to build humans is. Only now are we close with our stack. Human DNA is 6 GB. That’s a DVD. In 1970, you couldn’t store 6GB. Today, I can copy it in seconds on my M1 SSD. That’s actually faster than nature.</p>

<p>Biology is non-toxic. Biology is efficient. Biology is beautiful. Biology is technology.</p>

<p>Biology is not centralized. Biology is not alien. Biology is not rectangular. Biology is not industrial.</p>

<hr>


<p>STOP BUILDING SHITTY TECHNOLOGY.</p>

<p>If it centralizes power, it’s bad. If it decentralizes power, it’s good. Build technology that is inextricable from its narrative. Build technology that will give us freedom, not enslavement.</p>

<p>One axis to consider. Does this centralize or decentralize power? The power itself is unstoppable. How we divide it is a choice.</p>

<hr>


<p>I wish I had a more concrete plan. But for the love of God, if you build technology, consider this axis. Build the wrong technology, and we will live in an eternal prison.</p>

Being the unnecessary overachiever that I am, I decided I wanted to push myself that week, and I sought to build something that could carry a positive impact in my community while testing the limits of my creativity and ingenuity. When standing in the restroom line at a local coffee shop one day, I witnessed the absurdly little time people spent washing their hands after using the restroom. Watching them grip an egg sandwich before shoving it in their mouth after hardly washing their hands made me nauseous: not only was it gross, it was unsafe, to say the very least. I won’t say the idea hit me at once, but over the next few days, I found myself hung up on the issue, envisioning various prototypes of my new device. What device was I envisioning, exactly? Good question: the device, implemented in a sink faucet, would help someone properly wash their hands by, first, detecting the user’s presence using visual and auditory sensors and, second, clocking their handwashing with visual LED cues. After the user has washed their hands for 20 seconds (the sufficient amount of time recommended by the CDC to remove all harmful pathogens from the hands), the device would flash a green light three times, indicating that you are good to go! When I first explained the concept to some of my advisors, they were skeptical about the concept, but they approved my project. The following week, I gave my presentation to the school board, parents, students, and many other people.

The process has taught me many things: how to use embedded systems, how to program, how circuits work, how to make custom PCB’s with my own circuit designs, how to 3D model/print, how to build a website, and much more. If you want to learn more about my device, visit this article. </span></p><p id="viewer-ehm2e"><span>But wait: I just glossed over possibly the most difficult part of my journey - that first week, where I tasked myself with learning to program and use circuits, implement my new knowledge, and design a presentation all in one week. Like they say, the hardest part is always the start, which, understandably, is why most people never start. Luckily for me, I had committed myself to the project and could not afford to quit, so that first week, I put my head down and read, learning everything I possibly could about everything I might need to know. Since then, I have improved upon my skills, and I feel ready to share my product with the world, as well as the skills necessary to build it. </span></p><p id="viewer-cmpnt"><span><u>What do I mean when I say this?</u></span></p><p id="viewer-42itj"><span>	I have experienced firsthand many of the challenges that people try to avoid when doing something new: most people are afraid of trying something new because they are afraid of making mistakes and breaking their comfort zone. While I can’t directly help with the fear and motivate you, I can help in providing the groundwork for building your own electronic products (or products in general). This education will make your goals much more attainable and, as a result, less scary! If a 13-year-old could do it, you certainly can, and I hope to help you along your own personal journey.  </span></p><p id="viewer-36nlp"><span><u>How will I do this?</u></span></p><p id="viewer-cs1g8"><span>	I found the best way to learn is by doing. Before learning to build my device, I went and found other projects to copy so that I could practice implementing what I had read in my books; then, when I felt ready, I leaped into my own project: the assimilation of all the knowledge I had accumulated from my prior experiences. Therefore, I hope to teach you the basics of electronic products through the lens of my handwashing device. I will teach you how to build every prototype, ranging in difficulty from easiest to hardest. Throughout the process, you will learn and understand circuits, programming, PCBs, 3D modeling/printing, and much more so that when you are ready to build your own product, you can do so as if it were second nature. </span></p><p id="viewer-7ebgm"><span>	No, there is no course you have to pay for or anything like that - all the tutorials will be posted on my website (the <a href="https://www.puriphico.com/build-your-own" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Build-Your-Own</u></a> page) and my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC25QUdv5BI4KMx598UR0IWA/featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>YouTube</u></a> channel - I will even write blog posts summarizing the content of each tutorial, which will be published on my website as well as <a href="https://adrianlazzi.medium.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Medium</u></a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=AdrianLazzi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Hacker News</u></a>. If you are interested in building your own exciting projects, subscribe to my <a href="https://www.puriphico.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>website</u></a> and YouTube channel and follow me on Medium and Instagram, where I will be posting weekly tutorials and updates. I am still in school, so some weeks the workload may be too large to post a video, but I will do my best to remain consistent!</span></p><p id="viewer-9clcg"><span>Thanks for reading to the end! While this article focused primarily on my startup’s mission of education, our other mission is to innovate devices to limit the spread of disease; if you support either of these causes, I would be very appreciative if you could take a second to ‘applaud’ this article and subscribe to my website; most importantly, though, I would ask you to share this article with someone who you know would be interested. Expect a lot of fun and exciting content in the coming weeks! </span></p><p id="viewer-6jqt6"><span>And don’t forget, I’m happy to answer all questions in the comments!</span></p><p id="viewer-44rb"><span><a href="https://www.wix.com/demone2/food-photo/blog/search/.hash.bread" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#</a><span>Hands </span><a href="https://www.wix.com/demone2/food-photo/blog/search/.hash.cake" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>#</span></a><span>Wash hands</span> <a href="https://www.wix.com/demone2/food-photo/blog/search/.hash.chocolate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>#</span></a><span>Hand washing </span><a href="https://www.wix.com/demone2/food-photo/blog/search/.hash.desserts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>#T</span></a><span>he Beginning </span><a href="https://www.wix.com/demone2/food-photo/blog/search/.hash.fruits" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>#T</span></a><span>he Origin </span><a href="https://www.puriphico.com/blog/hashtags/Hygiene" target="_self"><span>#Hygiene</span></a><span> </span><a href="https://www.puriphico.com/blog/hashtags/Innovation" target="_self"><span>#Innovation</span></a><span> </span><a href="https://www.puriphico.com/blog/hashtags/startup" target="_self"><span>#startup</span></a><span> </span><a href="https://www.puriphico.com/blog/hashtags/Puriphico" target="_self"><span>#Puriphico</span></a><span> </span><a href="https://www.puriphico.com/blog/hashtags/COVID" target="_self"><span>#COVID</span></a><span> </span><a href="https://www.puriphico.com/blog/hashtags/COVID19" target="_self"><span>#COVID19</span></a><span> </span><a href="https://www.puriphico.com/blog/hashtags/coronavirus" target="_self"><span>#coronavirus</span></a><span> </span><a href="https://www.puriphico.com/blog/hashtags/WashYourHands" target="_self"><span>#WashYourHands</span></a><span> </span><a href="https://www.puriphico.com/blog/hashtags/TeenStartup" target="_self"><span>#TeenStartup</span></a><span> </span><a href="https://www.puriphico.com/blog/hashtags/GlobalHandwashingDay" target="_self"><span>#GlobalHandwashingDay</span></a><span> </span><a href="https://www.puriphico.com/blog/hashtags/Startup" target="_self"><span>#Startup</span></a><span> </span><a href="https://www.puriphico.com/blog/hashtags/tech" target="_self"><span>#tech</span></a></span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

    <h2>Bitcoin is screwed</h2>

<p>I just realized that Bitcoin is screwed.</p>

<p>I just came across a digital currency system called Taler that solves the double spending problem by having a central authority, and makes certain provisions for levying taxes, but is also reasonably anonymous, like cash.</p>

<p>This is the best system for money I've ever seen. It's like Visa/Mastercard, but open source and with buyer anonymity. No one knows what you spend your stuff on. But everyone knows what you earned your stuff with. So it can be used within existing governments.</p>

<p>And here's the thing. The reason Bitcoin has perverse incentives for energy use, and for that reason is inherently expensive, slow and inflexible, is that it wants to do without a central authority.</p>

<p>But it's a mirage. Bitcoin can't do without a central authority. There are no power stations without a central authority. Someone has to own them, and operate them. None of that works without a central authority. It does in the little colored books of the Libertarian ideologues, who are surprised time and time again when getting rid of the government actually does not magically solve all problems. But put it to the test- nope, can't run a power station without a working legal system. Can't produce chips and have a computer supply chain without a working legal system. Everything you need to produce Bitcoins depends on the existence of technologically advanced, government-regulated civilization.</p>

<p>And if you have that- why bother doing without a central authority? Just use the darn government to solve the double spending problem. You're already doing that with Bitcoin, just in a convoluted, perversely inefficient, comically inept Rube Goldberg machine kind of way.</p>

<p>In other words- Bitcoin broke its own promise before it ever left the laboritory. It was never designed to be decentralized. It came as close as is humanely possible by all means, but quite simply by needing electricity and advanced silicon, it's doomed. In other words, Bitcoin never was what claimed to be. It's main virtue is that it's pretty good at obfuscating that.</p>

<p>For this reason, I believe that Bitcoin is going to experience a series of booms and busts, but it will never play a significant role in organizing society, building schools and bridges, banking the unbanked, and lifting people out of powverty. But Taler might.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>QEMU 3.0.0 can boot IBM’s AIX to a shell prompt. AIX is IBM’s version of Unix for their Power Systems line of PowerPC servers. I’ve been <a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/xnuqemu2/">researching emulation</a>, so I wrote a tutorial for running AIX on your computer.</p>

<h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h2>

<p>Trying out AIX takes about 20 minutes. I tested these instructions on macOS 10.13.6.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the <a href="https://www-304.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/diags/download/home.html">AIX 7.2 Standalone Diagnostics disk</a> from IBM. You want <code>CD72220.ISO</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: (optional) If you want the Diagnostics disk to give you an AIX shell prompt instead of running diagnostics, apply <a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/assets/blog/aixqemu/patch_cd72220.py">this patch</a> to your ISO file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>python patch_cd72220.py CD72220.ISO ModdedCD.ISO
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(this replaces <code>usr/lpp/diagnostics/bin/Dctrl</code> on the ISO with a shell script that launches <code>/bin/sh</code>)</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Download and install QEMU 3.0.0.</p>



<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch QEMU with this command line:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>qemu-system-ppc64 -cpu POWER9 -machine pseries -m 2G -serial mon:stdio \
	-cdrom ModdedCD.iso \
	-d guest_errors \
	-prom-env "input-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
	-prom-env "output-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
	-prom-env "boot-command=dev / 0 0 s\" ibm,aix-diagnostics\" property boot cdrom:\ppc\chrp\bootfile.exe -s verbose"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Wait. (It’ll get stuck on <code>define_rspc</code> for a long time.)</p>

<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: After <strong>nine</strong> very, very long minutes, you’ll be greeted with this notice:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
 ******* Please define the System Console. *******

Type a 1 and press Enter to use this terminal as the
  system console.
Pour definir ce terminal comme console systeme, appuyez
  sur 1 puis sur Entree.
Taste 1 und anschliessend die Eingabetaste druecken, um
  diese Datenstation als Systemkonsole zu verwenden.
Premere il tasto 1 ed Invio per usare questo terminal
  come console.
Escriba 1 y pulse Intro para utilizar esta terminal como
  consola del sistema.
Escriviu 1 1 i premeu Intro per utilitzar aquest
  terminal com a consola del sistema.
Digite um 1 e pressione Enter para utilizar este terminal
  como console do sistema.

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Type 1 in your terminal, then press enter.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: After another two minutes, you’ll be dropped to an AIX shell prompt (or, if you didn’t patch the ISO, the IBM Diagnostics tool):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>exec(/usr/lpp/diagnostics/bin/Dctrl,/usr/lpp/diagnostics/bin/Dctrl){983324,917792}
exec(/bin/sh){1638718,983324}
#
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, you can try some Unix commands. The Diagnostics CD doesn’t have many tools, but you can try <code>uname -a</code>, <code>mount</code>, or <code>lscfg</code>.</p>

<p>(If you’re using the Diagnostics tool, you’ll be stuck on the step where it asks you to choose a terminal. Anyone knows how to get past this step?)</p>

<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: once you’re done, close the QEMU window.</p>

<p>Alternatively, press Ctrl-A, then C to drop into the QEMU monitor, then type <code>q</code> to quit.</p>

<p>The full boot log <a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/assets/blog/aixqemu/aixboot.txt">can be found here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="edit-sep-7-2018">Edit (Sep 7, 2018)</h2>

<p>Since writing this article, I’ve also found <a href="https://twitter.com/bluestonechina/status/1001269160872046592">Liang Guo’s tutorial</a> on setting up AIX, so if you have an AIX setup disc instead of the Live CD, you can install a proper AIX virtual machine.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://www.nutanix.com/ibm/">Nutanix</a>’s AIX VMs <a href="https://twitter.com/robmcnelly/status/991698624357847040">are hosted with QEMU</a>. That’s cool! I didn’t know there’s a production deployment of AIX on QEMU.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s a Unix system! I know this!</p>

  <p>– Jurassic Park (1993)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_AIX">IBM AIX</a> is a proprietary Unix variant developed by IBM for their <a href="https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/power">Power Systems</a> line of POWER9 servers. In the 1990s, every workstation or server manufacturer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)">had</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tru64_UNIX">their</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRIX">own</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-UX">version</a> of Unix. IBM’s AIX is one of the few still being updated today.</p>

<p>Importantly for me, QEMU 3.0.0 can emulate AIX without any modifications or workarounds, allowing me to try an Enterprise operating system without access to expensive hardware.</p>

<p>In fact, AIX even detects if it’s being run in QEMU:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ strings - bootfile.exe |grep qemu
patch_qemu
qemu,pseries
qemu,pseries
                        ---&gt; qemu,pseries detected &lt;---
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>suggesting that IBM themselves have experimented with QEMU and AIX.</p>

<p>From the few minutes I spent playing with AIX, I find it fascinating that AIX is close enough to macOS (BSD) and Linux (GNU), yet subtlely different. In some places, the old Unix preference for terseness is visible:</p>

<p>AIX:</p>
<div><div><pre><code># halt --help
halt: illegal option -- -
usage: halt [-y][-q][-l][-n][-p]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>vs Linux:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ halt --help
halt [OPTIONS...]
Halt the system.
     --help      Show this help
     --halt      Halt the machine
  -p --poweroff  Switch off the machine
     --reboot    Reboot the machine
  -f --force     Force immediate halt/power-off/reboot
  -w --wtmp-only Don't halt/power-off/reboot, just write wtmp record
  -d --no-wtmp   Don't write wtmp record
     --no-wall   Don't send wall message before halt/power-off/reboot
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>yet other parts gained richer interfaces as befit an Enterprise operating system:</p>

<p>AIX:</p>

<div><div><pre><code># mount
  node       mounted        mounted over    vfs       date        options      
-------- ---------------  ---------------  ------ ------------ --------------- 
         /dev/ram0        /                jfs    Jan 01 00:00 rw              
         /dev/ramdisk0    /mnt             jfs    Sep 06 03:12 rw,nointegrity  
         /mnt             /tmp             namefs Sep 06 03:12 rw    
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>macOS:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ mount
/dev/disk1s1 on / (apfs, local, journaled)
devfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse)
/dev/disk1s4 on /private/var/vm (apfs, local, noexec, journaled, noatime, nobrowse)
map -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse)
map auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It keeps me just off balance enough to be interesting.</p>

<h2 id="lets-just-try-it">Let’s just try it</h2>

<p>I chose to try AIX in QEMU mostly because, unlike IBM’s other Enterprise operating systems (IBM i and z/OS), IBM provides a free Diagnostics disc for Power Systems - which contains a live version of AIX.</p>

<p>Others have tried running AIX without a physical IBM Power Server. <a href="https://tyom.blogspot.com/">One person</a> got AIX 4.2 and 5.1 to boot on QEMU. However, modern AIX (7.1) seemed  impossible to run in QEMU, according to mailing list posts from 2012, like <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc/2012-02/msg00048.html">this thread</a>, <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc/2012-06/msg00120.html">this thread</a>, or <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc/2012-09/msg00160.html">this thread</a>.</p>

<p>Well, that was six years ago, right? Let’s see what happens if I boot the disc today.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>qemu-system-ppc64 -cpu POWER9 -machine pseries -m 2G -serial mon:stdio -cdrom CD72220.iso
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>Trying to load:  from: disk ...

<p>And it’s stuck there. Did the boot process hang? Or is it just slow?</p>

<p>OK, I need to get more debugging output. To do so, I need to set boot parameters.</p>

<h2 id="setting-open-firmware-variables">Setting Open Firmware variables</h2>

<p><a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc/2012-02/msg00048.html">According to the QEMU mailing list</a>, I need to use this command to boot AIX with verbose messages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>boot cdrom:\ppc\chrp\bootfile.exe -s verbose
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://people.redhat.com/~thuth/blog/slof/2017/01/16/prom-env.html">This guide</a> showed how to change the default boot command, by passing environment variables to SLOF, QEMU’s bootloader:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>-prom-env "boot-command=boot cdrom:\ppc\chrp\bootfile.exe -s verbose" \
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The same article also mentions other SLOF environment variables; two important ones are <code>input-device</code> and <code>output-device</code>, which sets the default input and output devices of the firmware. By default, this is the emulated graphical screen and keyboard. Following the commit message on <a href="https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/818725/">this patch</a>, I switched it to the virtual serial port to make interacting with the system easier:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>-prom-env "input-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
-prom-env "output-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also added the QEMU logging option <code>-d unimp,guest_errors</code> to show me when AIX invokes some unimplemented behaviour in QEMU.</p>

<p>The new command line is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>qemu-system-ppc64 -cpu POWER9 -machine pseries -m 2G -serial mon:stdio \
  -cdrom CD72220.iso \
  -d unimp,guest_errors \
  -prom-env "input-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
  -prom-env "output-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
  -prom-env "boot-command=boot cdrom:\ppc\chrp\bootfile.exe -s verbose" \
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="why-did-it-eject-the-cd">Why did it eject the CD?</h2>

<p>Verbose boot and the <code>-d unimp</code> option definitely helped: with Verbose boot, I can see that <code>/sbin/init</code> starts executing, indicating that the kernel actually booted fine.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>StarLED{814}

AIX Version 7.2
exec(/etc/init){1,0}

INIT: EXECUTING /sbin/rc.boot 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In addition, this message popped up once every second - which reassures me that AIX hasn’t frozen yet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Unimplemented SPAPR hcall 0x00000000000002b8
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So I waited out the several minute boot process, only to be greeted with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>exec(/usr/sbin/bootinfo,-M){983360,917792}
exec(/usr/lib/boot/bin/bootinfo_chrp,-M){983360,917792}
exec(/etc/eject,/dev/cd0){983362,917792}
exec(/usr/lib/methods/showled,0xA71){983364,917792} 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why did it eject the CD? A search for LED code “0xA71” gave no answers. The <code>-M</code> option for bootinfo is undocumented, so I don’t know what value would continue the boot process.</p>

<p>I needed to examine the CD’s boot script to find which value <code>bootinfo_chrp -M</code> needs to return.</p>

<p>To get the init script, I first tried extracting the ram filesystem from the bootfile.exe. Unfortunately, the first bytes of the extracted filesystem were “<code>01 02 03 04</code>”, which didn’t match any file systems I could find. In addition, there are no visible strings in the filesystem, suggesting that it’s compressed.</p>

<p>I resorted to plan B: dumping the entire RAM of the virtual machine to a giant 2GB file using QEMU’s Monitor:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(qemu) pmemsave 0 0x80000000 look2g.bin
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and running <code>strings</code> on this document gave me:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>##########################################################################
# Check to see if the system has diagnostics support 
# if not eject cd
bootinfo -M &gt;/dev/null
if [ "$?" -ne 101 -a "$?" -ne 103 ] ; then
eject_cd
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So <code>bootinfo_chrp -M</code> must return 101 or 103.</p>

<h2 id="the-device-tree">The device tree</h2>

<p>Thankfully, the CD includes a copy of <code>bootinfo_chrp</code> in <code>usr/lib/boot/bin</code>, and it included symbols; thus, it was simple to reverse engineer the logic.</p>

<p>The program checks for options with <code>getopt</code>, and handles <code>-M</code> using a method named <code>is_eserver</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>is_eserver</code> method can return 4 values, depending on the device tree’s root node:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the <code>ibm,model-class</code> property on the root node is “C5”, “D5”, or “E5”;
    <ul>
      <li>if the root node has the <code>ibm,aix-diagnostics</code> node, return 101.</li>
      <li>otherwise return 100.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Otherwise:
    <ul>
      <li>if the root node has the <code>ibm,aix-diagnostics</code> node, …</li></ul></li></ul></div></article></div></div></div>

The patient’s immune system is already sensitized to the foreign organ, and it’s harder to find a match.</p><p>Rothstein and his colleagues at the <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.stiresearch.health.pitt.edu/">Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute</a> at Pitt analyzed blood samples taken from 244 patients who received kidney transplants at <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.upmc.com/">UPMC</a> between 2013-2015, as well as another 95 kidney transplant patients who were treated at <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.royalfree.nhs.uk/the-royal-free-hospital/">Royal Free Hospital, London</a>, and found a highly predictive biomarker.</p><p>Of the patients who were identified as high-risk for rejection based on this new biomarker, 91% rejected the organ within the first year, compared to 10% in the low-risk group. And the high-risk group was significantly more likely to lose their transplanted kidneys five years after the surgery. The biomarker Rothstein and colleagues discovered is a proxy for functioning of regulatory B cells—a type of immune cell that tunes up or down the immune response—which have recently been implicated in organ rejection and proved challenging to measure. B cells can secrete both IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and, according to this new study, it’s the ratio of these two molecules that best measures regulatory B cell activity and predicts whether a patient is at high risk of rejection. </p><p>“Being a functional biomarker, ours gives us an idea of what goes wrong in these high-risk patients,” Rothstein said. “The balance between IL-10 and TNF seems to indicate your immune setpoint—is your immune system going to be quiescent or is it going to be revved up and try to reject the transplant? We hope we can restore that balance with anti-TNF drugs.”</p><p>Anti-TNF drugs haven’t been used much for transplant patients, but they’re a mainstay for treating rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and other conditions marked by inflammation, so the side effect profile is well-known. </p><p>To mitigate that risk, the idea is to treat patients with anti-TNF drugs for just a few months, which might be enough to “reset” the immune system to prevent rejection before it starts.</p><p>A human clinical trial is needed, but to show proof of principle, Rothstein and colleagues applied anti-TNF to B cells taken from high-risk patients and saw not only changes in the biomarker, but also a host of other changes indicative of restored regulatory B cell activity.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-body">
                    <p>I’ve only used Twitter for a few months and I did like a lot of it. The best part by far was following and listening to some incredible people. <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11">Patrick McKenzie</a> is one among many, but if you look at what he says on a daily basis, you’ll know what I mean. I can be endlessly entertained and learn a lot from what folks like him say.</p>
<p>There’s also the feeling of being the first one to know things. I often came across news or memes well before everyone else who wasn’t on twitter. Jan 6th, 2021 was a good example. I spent the whole day refreshing twitter, horrified by what I saw. It didn’t make a difference whether I learned of what was happening in 5 minutes or 2 hours or 2 days, but on that day I <em>needed</em> to know in real time.</p>
<p>As for tweeting myself, I did it a fair bit. Before twitter, I’d have this habit of wanting to share whatever interesting tidbit I found with at least one person. Something funny? To the college/school group chat it goes. Something to do with software? To my former flatmates. Cute animal? To my wife. Whatever I see, I know at least one friend who’d like it. I felt happy showing it to at least one other person. But I also felt a bit guilty sending them to people on 1:1 threads. Was I being too spammy? Were my ‘jokes’ not that funny? That’s where Twitter helped. I could broadcast without worrying that I was bothering people.</p>
<p>I also liked sending encouragement and appreciation to small time authors and content creators. These folks have it tough, and a kind word can always help. Twitter reduces the friction to doing this to the point where there’s no reason you shouldn’t.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty good website, as tens of millions of people around the world can attest. I would mostly agree with them. But it wasn’t for me.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="problem-1---lack-of-reach">Problem 1 - Lack of reach</h2>
<p>It feels stupid to complain about something as trivial as a lack of followers. There are ways to get around this, chiefly by putting out interesting content. I never used hashtags much, but that’s supposedly a great way too. But I never saw much engagement with what I was saying, which meant using the website felt a bit solitary. What was the point of saying things if I was the only one reading it?</p>
<p>It’s possible that I’m a boring knob, and that’s why no one reacted to my stuff. But that’s not been my experience elsewhere. When I use reddit or Hacker News, I find that it’s trivial to get thousands of karma and a handful of awards. Pseudo-anonymity helps too - instead of a weird Indian name I use a nickname that doesn’t mean anything. It’s possible to get positive engagement and replies from people regardless of who you are. You don’t need a reputation or a following, if you said something worth reading, people will read it and appreciate.</p>
<p>I’ll be honest - I felt jealous that people could just say “hey followers, here’s a question I could have googled. Could you google it for me?” and get a response. Or “I’m looking for a job. Any leads?” I didn’t have that. Nor did I have a way of reaching that easily.</p>
<p>I think Tiktok gets it right here. No matter who the creator is, if the content is good enough it will get hundreds of thousands of views. That system feels fairer to than Twitter.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="problem-2---pervasive-anger">Problem 2 - Pervasive anger</h2>
<p>I followed a lot of interesting people, but these folks were also upset with many things, mainly the state of the world. Watching people snipe at each other constantly, taking their anger out on anything in sight … was understandable. You can’t tell them to react differently or to chill out, because these are reasonable responses to what they’re seeing. I can’t even disagree.</p>
<p>But seeing people angry most of the time takes it’s toll too. I think it affected my mental health. Yes, I’m deeply upset with some of the things that are happening, but if I’m thinking about them 24x7 I’m not thinking about urgent things in my life that need my attention.</p>
<p>I won’t miss people dunking on each other while also not mentioning the dunkee, piquing my curiosity to the point where I investigate who the dunkee was and why. A waste of time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="problem-3---twitter-warps-people">Problem 3 - Twitter warps people</h2>
<p>Some guy with 14k followers said something. It was something like “only Indian people are rude/assholes in this particular way. Here are some anecdotes proving this”. This is a generalisation about a race of people based on anecdotes, so by definition racist. But since the person was Indian, it’s not. Don’t look at me, I don’t make the rules.</p>
<p>Dunking on other Indian people is a common pastime for Indian people - it makes us feel superior to our compatriots. Of course we wouldn’t do the thing that we’re talking about, we’re better than that. He wasn’t doing anything I haven’t heard a hundred others do.</p>
<p>I commented that there could be sampling bias here. Since we’re more likely to be annoyed/embarassed by the actions of Indian people, we’re more likely to notice and remember it. I relayed an anecdote of my Indian friend being very annoyed by something an Indian did but not even remembering that a white person had done the exact same thing the previous day (making us wait while taking a photo). I thought it was ok to say this. I asked “You ever think this is sampling bias? You notice and get annoyed when Indians do it and embarrass you but don’t if it’s someone else?”</p>
<p>Apparently not. He went on a massive tirade. Not content with responding rudely, he quote tweets me so he can dunk in front of all his followers. Apparently, I’m jingoistic deflector, part of the “elite” that refuses to “accept and introspect” and that I “deny deny deny” legitimate issues with India. If you’ve read my other posts, you know this isn’t true. I’m the first one to point out where my country (and me personally) can do better. (<a href="https://blog.nindalf.com/posts/understanding-my-privilege/">Understanding my Privilege</a>, <a href="https://blog.nindalf.com/posts/discriminating-against-left-handers/">Discriminating against left handers</a>)</p>
<p>Anyway, he has 14k followers. I have 100. I wasn’t winning this one, regardless. I decided to stop responding, even though he went on and on.</p>
<p>The thing is, he’s actually a pretty good dude. I know, because I’ve followed him for months. But at some point he’s been exposed to so much trolling that he assumes that everyone who disagrees is a troll. It’s “#factcheckbait” according to him. He thought I was a troll and responded appropriately.</p>
<p>How does a reasonable, good person end up warped like this, where they assume that every person out there is a bad faith actor? Where there’s absolutely no scope for disagreement? My theory is that Twitter warps people in this way, by simply removing any scope for reasoned discussion. When you only meet trolls, and never have any friendly discussion with different viewpoints, you assume that a person disagreeing with you is a troll.</p>
<hr>
<p>I could stick around, play the game, build up by follower count to the point where I solve problem 1, prune my followee list to solve problem 2. But by then I’ve probably spent so much time there that I’ve become warped, probably without realising it - problem 3. Once I figured this out, I deactivated my account.</p>
<p>This probably isn’t permanent. The upsides of twitter still exist. I still want to read what people like Patrick McKenzie, Zach Weinersmith, John Carmack and others have to say. I still want to send encouraging messages to small time creators. But for now, I’m done.</p>

<p><em>TL;DR: Currently there’s no common boot scheme across architectures and
platforms for open-source operating systems. There’s also little cooperation
between multiple distributions in dual-boot (or triple, … multi-boot)
setups. We’d like to improve this situation by getting everybody to commit to a
single boot configuration format that is based on drop-in files, and thus is
robust, simple, works without rewriting configuration files and is free of
namespace clashes.</em></p>

<p>The Boot Loader Specification defines a scheme how different operating systems
can cooperatively manage a boot loader configuration directory, that accepts
drop-in files for boot menu items that are defined in a format that is shared
between various boot loader implementations, operating systems, and userspace
programs. The same scheme can be used to prepare OS media for cases where the
firmware includes a boot loader. The target audience for this specification is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Boot loader developers, to write a boot loader that directly reads its configuration at runtime from these drop-in snippets</li>
  <li>Firmware developers, to add generic boot loading support directly to the firmware itself</li>
  <li>Distribution and Core OS developers, in order to create these snippets at OS/kernel package installation time</li>
  <li>UI developers, for implementing a user interface that discovers the available boot options</li>
  <li>OS Installer developers, to prepare their installation media and for setting up the initial drop-in directory</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-is-there-a-need-for-this-specification">Why is there a need for this specification?</h2>

<p>Of course, without this specification things already work mostly fine. But here’s why we think this specification is needed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To make the boot more robust, as no explicit rewriting of configuration files is required any more</li>
  <li>To allow an out of the box boot experience on any platform without the need of traditional firmware mechanisms (e.g. BIOS calls, UEFI Boot Services)</li>
  <li>To improve dual-boot scenarios. Currently, multiple Linux installations tend to fight over which boot loader becomes the primary one in possession of the MBR, and only that one installation can then update the boot loader configuration of it freely. Other Linux installs have to be manually configured to never touch the MBR and instead install a chain-loaded boot loader in their own partition headers. In this new scheme as all installations share a loader directory no manual configuration has to take place, and all participants implicitly cooperate due to removal of name collisions and can install/remove their own boot menu entries at free will, without interfering with the entries of other installed operating systems.</li>
  <li>Drop-in directories are otherwise now pretty ubiquitous on Linux as an easy way to extend configuration without having to edit, regenerate or manipulate configuration files. For the sake of uniformity, we should do the same for extending the boot menu.</li>
  <li>Userspace code can sanely parse boot loader configuration which is essential with modern BIOSes which do not necessarily initialize USB keyboards anymore during boot, which makes boot menus hard to reach for the user. If userspace code can parse the boot loader configuration, too, this allows for UIs that can select a boot menu item to boot into, before rebooting the machine, thus not requiring interactivity during early boot.</li>
  <li>To unify and thus simplify configuration of the various boot loaders around, which makes configuration of the boot loading process easier for users, administrators and developers alike.</li>
  <li>For boot loaders with configuration <em>scripts</em> such as grub2, adopting this spec allows for mostly static scripts that are generated only once at first installation, but then do not need to be updated anymore as that is done via drop-in files exclusively.</li>
</ul>



<p>EFI is not ubiquitous, especially not in embedded systems. If you have an EFI
system, it provides a boot options logic that can offer similar
functionality. Here’s why we think that it is not enough for our uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The various EFI implementations implement the boot order/boot item logic to different levels. Some firmware implementations do not offer a boot menu at all and instead unconditionally follow the EFI boot order, booting the first item that is working.</li>
  <li>If the firmware setup is used to reset all data usually all EFI boot entries are lost, making the system entirely unbootable, as the firmware setups generally do not offer a UI to define additional boot items. By placing the menu item information on disk, it is always available, regardless if the BIOS setup data is lost.</li>
  <li>Harddisk images should be movable between machines and be bootable without requiring explicit EFI variables to be set. This also requires that the list of boot options is defined on disk, and not in EFI variables alone.</li>
  <li>EFI is not universal yet (especially on non-x86 platforms), this specification is useful both for EFI and non-EFI boot loaders.</li>
  <li>Many EFI systems disable USB support during early boot to optimize boot times, thus making keyboard input unavailable in the EFI menu. It is thus useful if the OS UI has a standardized way to discover available boot options which can be booted to.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>

<p>Everything described below is located on a placeholder file system <code>$BOOT</code>. The installer program should pick <code>$BOOT</code> according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On disks with an MBR partition table:
    <ul>
      <li>If the OS is installed on a disk with an MBR partition table, and a partition with the type id of 0xEA already exists it should be used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the OS is installed on a disk with an MBR partition table, a new partition with type id of 0xEA shall be created, of a suitable size (let’s say 500MB), and it should be used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On disks with GPT (GUID Partition Table)
    <ul>
      <li>If the OS is installed on a disk with GPT, and an Extended Boot Loader Partition or XBOOTLDR partition for short, i.e. a partition with GPT type GUID of <code>bc13c2ff-59e6-4262-a352-b275fd6f7172</code>, already exists, it should be used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the OS is installed on a disk with GPT, and an EFI System Partition or ESP for short, i.e. a partition with GPT type UID of <code>c12a7328-f81f-11d2-ba4b-00a0c93ec93b</code>) already exists and is large enough (let’s say 250MB) and otherwise qualifies, it should be used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the OS is installed on a disk with GPT, and if the ESP partition already exists but is too small, a new suitably sized (let’s say 500MB) XBOOTLDR partition shall be created and used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the OS is installed on a disk with GPT, and no ESP partition exists yet, a new suitably sized (let’s say 500MB) ESP should be created and used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This placeholder file system shall be determined during <em>installation time</em>, and an fstab entry may be created. It should be mounted to either <code>/boot/</code> or <code>/efi/</code>. Additional locations like <code>/boot/efi/</code>, with <code>/boot/</code> being a separate file system, might be supported by implementations. This is not recommended because the mounting of <code>$BOOT</code> is then dependent on and requires the mounting of the intermediate file system.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em><code>$BOOT</code> should be considered <strong>shared</strong> among all OS installations of a system. Instead of maintaining one <code>$BOOT</code> per installed OS (as <code>/boot/</code> was traditionally handled), all installed OS share the same place to drop in their boot-time configuration.</em></p>

<p>For systems where the firmware is able to read file systems directly, <code>$BOOT</code>
must be a file system readable by the firmware. For other systems and generic
installation and live media, <code>$BOOT</code> must be a VFAT (16 or 32) file
system. Applications accessing <code>$BOOT</code> should hence not assume that fancier
file system features such as symlinks, hardlinks, access control or case
sensitivity are supported.</p>

<p>This specification defines two types of boot loader entries. The first type is
text based, very simple and suitable for a variety of firmware, architecture
and image types (“Type #1”). The second type is specific to EFI, but allows
single-file images that embed all metadata in the kernel binary itself, which
is useful to cryptographically sign them as one file for the purpose of
SecureBoot (“Type #2”).</p>

<p>Not all boot loader entries will apply to all systems. For example, Type #1
entries that use the <code>efi</code> key and all Type #2 entries only apply to EFI
systems. Entries using the <code>architecture</code> key might specify an architecture that
doesn’t match the local one. Boot loaders should ignore all entries that don’t
match the local platform and what the boot loader can support, and hide them
from the user. Only entries matching the feature set of boot loader and system
shall be considered and displayed. This allows image builders to put together
images that transparently support multiple different architectures.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>$BOOT</code> partition is not supposed to be exclusive territory of
this specification. This specification only defines semantics of the <code>/loader/</code>
directory inside the file system (see below), but it doesn’t intend to define
ownership of the whole file system exclusively. Boot loaders, firmware, and
other software implementing this specification may choose to place other
files and directories in the same file system. For example, boot loaders that
implement this specification might install their own boot code into the <code>$BOOT</code>
partition. On systems where <code>$BOOT</code> is the ESP this is a particularly common
setup. Implementations of this specification must be able to operate correctly
if files or directories other than <code>/loader/</code> are found in the top level
directory. Implementations that add their own files or directories to the file
systems should use well-named directories, to make name collisions between
multiple users of the file system unlikely.</p>

<h3 id="type-1-boot-loader-specification-entries">Type #1 Boot Loader Specification Entries</h3>

<p>We define two directories below <code>$BOOT</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>$BOOT/loader/</code> is the directory containing all files needed for Type #1 entries</li>
  <li><code>$BOOT/loader/entries/</code> is the directory containing the drop-in snippets. This directory contains one <code>.conf</code> file for each boot menu item.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>In all cases the <code>/loader/</code> directory should be …</em></p></div></div>

<p>A year ago, covid was a mystery. We didn't know how it spread, we didn't know who it infected, we didn't know how to treat it. All we knew was that it was spreading fast and the early epicenters were slaughterhouses.</p>
<p>It's been a year, and now we know a lot more. One thing we know, for example, is that even though virus particles can linger for a long time on surfaces, you're not likely to catch the virus from these "fomites."</p>
<p>Simple handwashing of the sort we should have all practised all along will do the trick. You don't need to sterilize your groceries or leave your parcels to sit on your doorstep for three days. Just wash your hands!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/health/covid-19-surfaces-spread-clean/">https://www.popsci.com/story/health/covid-19-surfaces-spread-clean/</a></p>
<p>However, in the lockdown's early days, businesses were floundering, wondering how they'd reopen, and, driven by the scant science of covid transmission, a class of highly speculative health consultant sprang into existence to promote a meticulous regime of surface cleaning.</p>
<p>Surface-cleaning is a highly visible activity, and it can feel reassuring to be handed a grocery basket whose handle is glistening with a layer of freshly applied sterilizing spray. But all of this hygiene theater is largely irrelevant to controlling the pandemic.</p>
<p>Hygiene theater isn't harmless. At the very least, it's a major distraction. Late in 2020, my kid's school district circulated a plan to reopen for in-person classes in early Jan, assuming the LA County health department permitted it (they didn't because LA is a plague-pit).</p>
<p>This email went into incredible, eye-watering detail about the school's plan to sterilize all surfaces, going so far as to mention the brand names, active ingredients and concentrations of the products that would be applied to every surface every day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the plan included <em>nothing</em> about ventilation. When I wrote to the district to ask some simple questions like, "Will you unseal the windows so they can be opened while students are present?" or "Do you have any fans?" no one knew the answer.</p>
<p>Needless to say, "Have you changed the kind of HVAC filters you use?" was an unanswerable mystery. This wasn't reassuring – as school safety plans go, it was about as useless as those lock-down active shooter drills they terrorize the kids with.</p>
<p>Hygiene theater is everywhere. A friend of mine owns a 100-employee business that moved into new offices just before the pandemic. The lease includes cleaning services, and twice a week, a masked crew sweeps through the unoccupied offices and sterilizes every surface.</p>
<p>Covid science is still a moving target, obviously, but the overwhelming consensus is that masks, distance and ventilation are the most important safety measures we can take – while sterilization and surfaces are no more (or less) important than they were before the plague.</p>
<p>Of course, airflow isn't easy to demonstrate or detect (some places are experimenting with giant CO2 readouts as a proxy for ventilation), so it's getting short shrift.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/02/10/carbon-dioxide-device-coronavirus/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/02/10/carbon-dioxide-device-coronavirus/</a></p>
<p>But focusing on sanitizing because it's so visible is the epidemiological equivalent of looking for car keys under the lamppost.</p>

<img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/ecteu.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/ecteu.jpg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>One of the worst barriers to preserving the planet in a state suitable for human habitation is the Energy Charter Treaty, an obscure 1994 treaty with 50+ signatories that allows energy companies to sue governments over environmental protection laws.</p>
<p>The ECT has just been invoked by the German polluter RWE, which is suing the Dutch government for €1.4b over a law that bans coal plants by 2030.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/germanys-rwe-uses-energy-charter-treaty-to-challenge-dutch-coal-phase-out/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/germanys-rwe-uses-energy-charter-treaty-to-challenge-dutch-coal-phase-out/</a></p>
<p>All told, the EU faces <em>at least</em> €345b in ECT liability over its climate plans. In reality, the total could be much higher, because the ECT provides for damages equal to the value of physical plant and <em>all projected future profits</em> from those plants.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2021/ect/">https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2021/ect/</a></p>
<p>€345b is double the EU's total annual operational budget. This is the ransom that the world's worst climate criminals are demanding that Europeans pay as a condition of continuing to have a habitable planet. Big Energy want to be rewarded for its crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>Every day the treaty remains in effect produces more liability. Under ECT's provisions, a country that pulls out of the agreement is still liable for <em>twenty years</em> for any laws that affect the profitability of energy products started while the country was still in the ECT.</p>
<p>When a country is sued by a multinational for improving its environmental protections, the case is tried by a star-chamber of corporate lawyers who meet in secret and overwhelmingly find in favor of polluters.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, this is not a stable situation. To keep countries from fleeing the ECT, the energy cartel has embarked on a "modernization" project that it has slow-walked since 2017, with help from Japan, whose worst polluters depend on ECT to operate with impunity.</p>
<p>It's not hard to grind negotiations to a halt – all you need is a requirement that every decision must be unanimous before work can proceed. Leaks show this gambit is why the "modernization" meetings have been a four-year, do-nothing talking shop:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/energy-charter-treaty-reform-reaches-milestone-with-little-progress-to-show/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/energy-charter-treaty-reform-reaches-milestone-with-little-progress-to-show/</a></p>
<p>The harms of ECT aren't limited to direct vast transfers of public money to polluters. ECT is a major reason we don't get meaningful climate action in the first place: such legislation dies in planning once its authors are warned that it will trigger ECT enforcement action.</p>
<p>The arguments in favor of ECT are risible FUD, as Fabian Flues, Cecilia Olivet and Pia Eberhardt document for Opendemocracy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/this-obscure-energy-treaty-is-the-greatest-threat-to-the-planet-youve-never-heard-of/">https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/this-obscure-energy-treaty-is-the-greatest-threat-to-the-planet-youve-never-heard-of/</a></p>
<p>Take the argument that the ECT spurs investment in renewables: a meta-analysis of 74 papers concludes that this effect is "so small as to be considered zero" (in reality, the majority of ECT-attributable investment is in dirty fossil fuel power).</p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joes.12392">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joes.12392</a></p>
<p>Or the argument that since quitting ECT leaves countries exposed for 20 years, there's no point. Recall that this 20 year overhang only applies to projects begun <em>before</em> the country leaves the ECT, so the sooner countries quit it, the less risk they face.</p>
<p>Such risk as does exist can be mitigated by countries quitting in a bloc, making a mutual promise to ban companies domiciled in their borders from making any claims under the ECT, using national law to prohibit ECT action. The EU could mitigate much of its risk this way.</p>
<p>That the ECT even exists is a bad joke. It can't be fixed through "modernization" (especially not the current modernization plan, which doesn't touch corporate courts or contemplate any exemptions for climate regulation).</p>
<p>300 EU lawmakers have signed a petition calling on the EU to leave the ECT.</p>
<p><a href="http://endfossilprotection.org/sites/default/files/documents/Statement%20of%20European%20Parliamentarians%20on%20the%20modernization%20of%20the%20TCE.pdf">http://endfossilprotection.org/sites/default/files/documents/Statement%20of%20European%20Parliamentarians%20on%20the%20modernization%20of%20the%20TCE.pdf</a></p>
<p>They're joined by 450 climate activists:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In this article, we'll take a look at making use of the <strong>built-in, natural language based</strong> Postgres Full Text Search in Django. Internet users have gotten increasingly discerning when it comes to search. When they type a keyword into your website's search bar, they expect to find logically ranked results, including related matches and misspellings.</p>
<p>Because users are used to these sophisticated search systems, developers have to build applications that use more than simple <code>LIKE</code> queries. </p>

    </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html">Postgres Full Text Search</a> has been available since Postgres 8.3. It can be used to <strong>find records based on semantics and knowledge of the language</strong> rather than simple string matching, is very flexible, and unlike other search options such as <code>LIKE</code>, it performs well for partial matches.</p>
<p>While <code>LIKE</code> can be supported by indexes, that usually won’t work well when the <code>%</code> operator is used on the left side of the search term. Typically this means the query planner reverts to sequential scans when using wildcard operators like this:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> title <span>FROM</span> film <span>WHERE</span> description <span>LIKE</span> <span>'%brilliant'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When searching multiple columns, you also have additional effort, as each column needs to be queried separately using <code>LIKE</code>. There are more flexible alternatives, such as <code>SIMILAR TO</code> and POSIX regular expression search, but those are still difficult to use when you want to catch different variations of a word (e.g., word variations like “jump,” “jumps,” “jumped,” and “jumping”).</p>
<p>Because <code>LIKE</code> and other simple methods lack language support and cannot handle word variations or ranking, Postgres Full Text Search (FTS) is generally a better option when implementing search directly in the database. With FTS, your searches will match all instances of the word, its plural, and the word's various tenses. Because FTS is bundled into Postgres, there’s no need to install extra software and no extra cost for using a third-party search provider. Additionally, all your data are stored in one place, which reduces your web application’s complexity.</p>
<p>This article will show you how to use Full Text Search in raw PostgreSQL queries and implement equivalent queries in Django using the Postgres driver. Along the way, you’ll see some of the use cases for the various Full Text Search methods that Postgres provides.</p>

<h2 id="core-concepts-of-postgres-full-text-search"><a href="#core-concepts-of-postgres-full-text-search" aria-label="core concepts of postgres full text search permalink"></a>Core Concepts of Postgres Full Text Search</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL provides several native functions for Full Text Search. In the following sections, you’ll see how to use them to “vectorize” your results and search queries so that you can use Postgres’s Full Text Search features.</p>
<h3 id="tsvector-data-type"><a href="#tsvector-data-type" aria-label="tsvector data type permalink"></a>tsvector data type</h3>
<p>Before a text or document can be searched using FTS, you need to convert it to an acceptable data type, known as a <code>tsvector</code>. To convert plain text to a <code>tsvector</code>, use the Postgres <code>to_tsvector</code> function. This function reduces the original text to a set of word skeletons known as lexemes.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexeme">Lexemes</a> are important because they help match related words. For instance, the words <em>satisfy</em>, <em>satisfying</em> and <em>satisfied</em> would convert to <em>satisfi</em>. This means a search for <em>satisfy</em> will return results containing any of the other terms as well. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-dictionaries.html#TEXTSEARCH-STOPWORDS">Stop words</a> such as “a,” “on,” “of,” “you,” “who,” etc. are removed because they appear too frequently to be relevant in searches. The <code>to_tsvector</code> function returns the lexemes, along with a digit that denotes each word’s position in the text.</p>
<p>Note that the output of the function is language-dependent. You should tell PostgreSQL to treat the text as English (or whatever language your results are stored in). To convert the sentence “A Fanciful Documentary of a Frisbee And a Lumberjack who must Chase a Monkey in A Shark Tank” to a <code>tsvector</code>, run the following:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'A Fanciful Documentary of a Frisbee And a Lumberjack who must Chase a Monkey in A Shark Tank'</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> search<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You’ll see output like the following:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>                    search
----------------------------------------------------------------------
'chase':12 'documentari':3 'fanci':2 'frisbe':6 'lumberjack':9 'monkey':14 'must':11 'shark':17 'tank':18</code></pre></div>
<p>This shows each word’s root as well as its position in the text. For example, the word fanciful, the second word in the text, has been broken down into the lexeme “fanci”, so you see <code>’fanci’:2</code>.</p>
<h3 id="tsquery-data-type"><a href="#tsquery-data-type" aria-label="tsquery data type permalink"></a>tsquery data type</h3>
<p>Text search systems have two major components: the text being searched and the keyword being searched for. In the case of FTS, both components must be vectorized. You saw how searchable data is converted to a <code>tsvector</code> in the previous section, so now you’ll see how search terms are vectorized into <code>tsquery</code> values.</p>
<p>Postgres offers functions that will convert text fields to <code>tsquery</code> values such as <code>to_tsquery</code>, <code>plainto_tsquery</code> and <code>phraseto_tsquery</code>. Search terms can also be combined with the <code>&amp;</code> (AND), <code>|</code> (OR), and <code>!</code> (NOT) operators, and parentheses can be used to group operators and determine their order. <code>to_tsquery</code> converts the search terms to tokens and discards stop words.</p>
<p>The following query:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'a &amp; beautifully &amp; very &amp; quickly'</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> search<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Returns the lexemes “beauti” and “quick” because “a” and “very” are stop words:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>                    search
----------------------------------------------------------------------
'beauti' &amp; 'quick'</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="searching"><a href="#searching" aria-label="searching permalink"></a>Searching</h3>
<p>Now that you know how to create a <code>tsvector</code> from your text data and a <code>tsquery</code> from your search terms, you can perform a full-text search using the <code>@@</code> operator.</p>
<p>For example, you can run the following query to compare two strings:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'John''s performance was found wanting'</span><span>)</span> @@ to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'want'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This query returns <code>TRUE</code>, indicating that there was a match: <code>want</code>.</p>
<p>If you had a <code>film</code> table containing movie titles and descriptions, you could use Full Text Search to find all films with a description containing the word <em>epic</em> and either of the words <em>tale</em> or <em>story</em>:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> title<span>,</span> description <span>FROM</span> film
<span>WHERE</span> to_tsvector<span>(</span>description<span>)</span> @@ to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'epic &amp; (story | tale)'</span><span>)</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This would give you results similar to this:</p>
<p><span>

    <span></span>
  <img alt="Query result" title="Query result" src="https://pganalyze.com/static/4088369bbf1d54e947af5dc2e28ae702/1d69c/search_result.png" srcset="https://pganalyze.com/static/4088369bbf1d54e947af5dc2e28ae702/4dcb9/search_result.png 188w, https://pganalyze.com/static/4088369bbf1d54e947af5dc2e28ae702/5ff7e/search_result.png 375w, https://pganalyze.com/static/4088369bbf1d54e947af5dc2e28ae702/1d69c/search_result.png 750w, https://pganalyze.com/static/4088369bbf1d54e947af5dc2e28ae702/78797/search_result.png 1125w, https://pganalyze.com/static/4088369bbf1d54e947af5dc2e28ae702/aa440/search_result.png 1500w, https://pganalyze.com/static/4088369bbf1d54e947af5dc2e28ae702/a8a6f/search_result.png 1516w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" loading="lazy">
  </a>
    </span></p>
<h3 id="ranking"><a href="#ranking" aria-label="ranking permalink"></a>Ranking</h3>
<p>Ranking search results can ensure that the most relevant results are shown first. Postgres provides <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-controls.html#TEXTSEARCH-RANKING">two functions for ranking</a> search results: <code>ts_rank</code> and <code>ts_rankcd</code>. <code>ts_rank</code> considers the frequency of words, while <code>ts_rank_cd</code> (“cd” means “coverage density”) considers the position of search terms within the text being searched.</p>
<p>If you run the following query, you’ll see that <code>rank1</code> and <code>rank2</code> are ranked the same (<code>0.06078271</code>) because each search query is found once in the sentence:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Dolphins are to water as elephants are to forest'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> rank1<span>,</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Dolphins are to water as elephants are to forest'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> rank2<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The more tokens that match the text, the higher the rank. In the following example, <code>rank1</code> has a higher rank than <code>rank2</code> because the tokens “elephant” and “dolphin” are both found in the sentence while “snake” is not:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Dolphins are to water as elephants are to forest'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant &amp; dolphin'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> rank1<span>,</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Dolphins are to water as elephants are to forest'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin &amp; snake'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> rank2<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="weighting"><a href="#weighting" aria-label="weighting permalink"></a>Weighting</h3>
<p>You can also give relevance to some factors over others by weighing them. For instance, when searching the film table, the highest weight could be given to the movie title and less weight could be given to the description using the <code>setweight</code> function:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code>
<span>SELECT</span> setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'A'</span><span>)</span> <span>||</span> setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'B'</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> weight<span>;</span>


<span>SELECT</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'A'</span><span>)</span> <span>||</span> setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'B'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> elephant_rank<span>,</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'A'</span><span>)</span> <span>||</span> setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'B'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> dolphin_rank<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>elephant_rank</code> is ranked higher because it matched elephant which has a higher weight of A, compared to dolphin_rank which has a weight of B.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>| elephant_rank | dolphin_rank |
|---------------|--------------|
| 0.6079271     | 0.24317084   |</code></pre></div>
<p><code>ts_rank</code> takes an optional first argument, <strong>weight</strong>. When this argument is left empty, it defaults to “{0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1.0}” in the order D, C, B, A. By default, A has the highest weight of 1.0, B has 0.4, C has 0.2, and D has 0.1. You can set the weight of any of A, B, C, or D to a different value using any decimal between -0.1 and 1.0. This allows you to have fine-grained control over how results are returned and ensure that users see the right results for their queries.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve seen how to use Postgres’ Full Text Search functions, you’re ready to start applying these ideas to your Django app.</p>
<h2 id="using-postgresql-full-text-search-in-django"><a href="#using-postgresql-full-text-search-in-django" aria-label="using postgresql full text search in django permalink"></a>Using PostgreSQL Full Text Search in Django</h2>
<p>Using Postgres’ Full Text Search in Django is an ideal way to add accurate and fast search because it is easy to maintain and fast to work with. To demonstrate Full Text Search in Django, consider a PostgreSQL database <code>dvdrental</code>, with a <code>film</code> table, and an equivalent <code>Film</code> model in a Django application implemented like this:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> django<span>.</span>db <span>import</span> Models

<span>class</span> <span>Film</span><span>(</span>models<span>.</span>Model<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    film_id <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>AutoField<span>(</span>primary_key<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
    title <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>CharField<span>(</span>max_length<span>=</span><span>255</span><span>)</span>
    description <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>TextField<span>(</span>blank<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span> null<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__str__</span><span>(</span>self<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>', '</span><span>.</span>join<span>(</span><span>[</span><span>'film_id='</span> <span>+</span> <span>str</span><span>(</span>self<span>.</span>film_id<span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'title='</span> <span>+</span> self<span>.</span>title<span>,</span> <span>'description='</span> <span>+</span> self<span>.</span>description<span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the remainder of this article, you’ll see how to search a single database table field, search multiple fields, rank search results, and optimize the performance of Full text Search using vector fields and indexes. You can run the commands from your <a href="https://www.python.org/shell/">Python shell</a>.</p>

When you invoke the /detector API route with a URL to an image the function will download the image, use the TensorFlow model to detect objects in it, then return an annotated version of the image back to the client.</p>

        </deckgo-highlight-code><h2>How to</h2>
<p>The repository contains a complete example stack that can be imported directly into Stackery and deployed. The rest of this post walks you through building your own ML stack using Stackery.</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<ol>
<li>First, <a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup">create an AWS account</a> if you don't have one. Don't worry, everything we will do in this example will fit into the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free">AWS Free Tier</a>, and even if you do not qualify for the free tier you will incur fractions of a penny's worth of expense running this example stack.</li>
<li>Second, create a <a href="https://stackery.io/sign-up">free Stackery account</a>. We will use Stackery to build the app and then deploy it into your AWS account.</li>
<li>Follow the steps after creating your Stackery account to link your AWS account. This gives Stackery permissions to package functions and generate <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets.html">Change Sets</a> but does not give Stackery permission to arbitrarily modify resources in your AWS account. You can find more details here: <a href="https://docs.stackery.io/docs/using-stackery/security-permissions-and-controls">Stackery Permissions &amp; Controls</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Create a new stack</h3>
<ol>
<li>Once you have linked your AWS account it's time to start creating a new stack! Go to <a href="https://app.stackery.io/stacks">Stacks</a> and click the green <strong>Add a Stack</strong> button. This will create a new, untitled stack for you.<br>
<img src="https://media.graphcms.com/4ho9a2SZQIWakGiuEp7z" alt="Creating stacks inside Stackery – AWS Lambda Container Image Support Tutorial"></li>
<li>First things first, let's give our stack a name. Click the three dots next to the current stack's name (the current name will be something like <em>Untitled</em> or <em>Untitled-1</em>) and choose to <strong>Rename</strong> the stack. Now, pick a name (<em>ml-image-recognition</em> would work!) and save it.</li>
<li>Before we go any further, why don't we save our progress? Click the big green <strong>Save with Git...</strong> button to authenticate to your favorite Git provider, create a new repo for the stack, and commit our starting stack.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Add a new HTTP API</h3>
<ol>
<li>We see a blank canvas for our new stack. Let's add an HTTP API! Click the green <strong>Add Resource</strong> button in the top right corner of the canvas. Click the <strong>HTTP API</strong> resource in the palette to add a new API to our stack. Close the palette.<br>
<img src="https://media.graphcms.com/zPb0V4ZAQPSVPUorDNKH" alt="Adding resources in Stackery – AWS Lambda Container Image Support Tutorial"></li>
<li>Double-click the new HTTP API (note: don't double click the <em>GET /</em> route, that opens the route settings instead of the API settings).<br>
<img src="https://media.graphcms.com/6jgSqV5XTjmSAkLVivuV" alt="An HTTP API inside Stackery – AWS Lambda Container Image Support Tutorial"></li>
<li>Change the route from <em>GET /</em> to <em>GET /detector</em>.</li>
<li>Click the big, green <strong>Save</strong> button at the bottom of the settings panel.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Add a new function</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Now let's add a Lambda function! Again, click the green <strong>Add Resource</strong> button in the top right corner of the canvas. Click the <strong>Function</strong> resource in the palette to add a new Function to our stack. Close the palette.</p></li>
<li><p>Double-click the new Function to edit its settings.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical ID: Something descriptive, like <em>Recognizer</em></li>
<li>Package Type: Docker Image (so we can fit a large ML model into our source assets!)</li>
<li>Docker Build Context: You probably want to update this from <em>/src/Function</em> to something like <em>/src/Recognizer</em></li>
<li>Timeout: 120 (it takes a while for TensorFlow to spin up!)</li>
<li>Don't forget to click the big, green <strong>Save</strong> button at the bottom of the settings panel!<br>
<img src="https://media.graphcms.com/uWK7xv9HSOmjQlhVkCNi" alt="Step6 .jpg"></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Save the stack by clicking the <strong>Commit...</strong> button. This is a great opportunity to see what we've added to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/">AWS SAM</a> template by opening the Template Diff panel. Notice how a bunch of additional resources, like an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">AWS ECR</a> container image repository and a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/">CodeBuild</a> project, are scaffolded to support building and running your new Function?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3>Edit your sources</h3>
<ol>
<li>Now it's time to get our feet wet on the source code side! Pull down the stack's Git repo to edit it using your favorite editor / IDE.</li>
<li>Scaffolded in the repo will be your function's source folder and Dockerfile. This Dockerfile will have a lot of possible starting points for you to choose from. We're going to build a Python Function, so you can take a look at the default Python Dockerfile commands. But since we're building a specific implementation, delete what's in the Dockerfile and replace it with the following:
<deckgo-highlight-code terminal="carbon" theme="one-light" language="bash">
                    <code slot="code"># Download the Open Images TensorFlow model and extract it to the `model`
# folder.
FROM alpine AS builder
RUN mkdir model
RUN wget -c https://storage.googleapis.com/tfhub-modules/google/openimages_v4/ssd/mobilenet_v2/1.tar.gz -O - | tar xz -C model
# Make sure it's world-readable so the Lambda service user can access it.
RUN chmod -R a+r model

# Build the runtime image from the official AWS Lambda Python base image.
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python
# Copy the extracted Open Images model into the source code space.
COPY --from=builder model model
# Copy in the sources.
COPY handler.py requirements.txt ./
# Copy the OpenSans font for annotation use
COPY font ./font
# Install the Python dependencies
RUN python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# Tell the Lambda runtime where the function handler is located.
CMD ["handler.lambda_handler"]
</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code></li>
<li>Now add the Python dependencies by putting the following into requirements.txt:
<deckgo-highlight-code terminal="carbon" theme="one-light" language="javascript">
                    <code slot="code">requests
tensorflow
Pillow
</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code></li>
<li>Lastly, add the Function handler source code into handler.py:
<deckgo-highlight-code terminal="carbon" theme="one-light" language="python">

<li>Save, add, commit, and push these changes up to your stack's repo.</li>

<h3>Deploy the stack</h3>
<ol>
<li>Now it's time to deploy the stack! If you have the <a href="https://docs.stackery.io/docs/using-stackery/cli#install-the-cli">Stackery CLI</a> (you can install it from instructions here: https://docs.stackery.io/docs/using-stackery/cli#install-the-cli) it's as easy as running <code>stackery deploy --git-ref main</code> (swap <code>main</code> for whatever branch your code is on). You can also point and click through our dashboard interface to deploy by navigating to the <strong>Deploy</strong> section on the left-hand sidebar after navigating to your stack at <a href="https://app.stackery.io/">https://app.stackery.io.</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Test</h3>
<p>You can easily test the stack by opening the API in your browser. First, we need to find the domain name of your API. You can do this either from the Stackery …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

        <div>
          <h4>Will I like this book?</h4>
          <p>
	    I think you will, yes! However, since we probably haven't met, I'm not a particularly good judge of that.
	    Rather than trust me, read one of the sections available online
	    (my favorites are <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes">Staff engineer archetypes</a>
	    and <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/work-on-what-matters">Work on what matters</a>),
	    and one or two of the interviews (I'd recommend <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/ras-kasa-williams">Kasa's</a>
	      and <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/michelle-bu">Michelle's</a>).
        </p></div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h4>Why write this book?</h4>
          <p>
	    There isn't much out there about being a senior technical leader outside of the management career track.
	    As I've worked with more folks in Staff and Principal engineer roles, this lack of guidance became
	    a point of friction for both them in self-directing their professional development and for me in trying to support
	    their growth. I wrote this book to become a more effective partner for the Staff engineers I work with,
	    and with the hope that it can help others who are chating their path to technical leadership
	    within an organization that's still figuring out how to support them.
	    </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h4>Are you the right author for this book?</h4>
          <p>
	    The role and career of Staff engineers is a topic that deserves to be written about far more than it is written about!
	    My hope is that this book is useful enough that more folks start to write about it,
	    and hopefully quickly surpass this book with better, more useful books of their own.
	  </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h4>Will this advice apply to my company?</h4>
          <p>
	    Advice without context should always be taken with a grain of salt!
	    This book is based on more than a dozen interviews with folks operating in Staff engineer, or equivalent, roles,
	    along with my personal experience leading engineering organizations at Calm, Stripe, and Uber.
	    My hope is that this broad perspective will make the book applicable to your experience,
	    although aspects of the advice are undeniably United States-centric and Silicon Valley-centric.

<h2 id="step-1-log-in-to-soluble-fusion">Step 1: Log In To Soluble Fusion</h2>
<p>This is fast and simple using your Google or GitHub account:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open a browser to <a href="https://app.soluble.cloud/">https://app.soluble.cloud</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <a href="https://app.soluble.cloud/register">Create Account</a></p>
</li>
<li>Select Google or GitHub indentity providers <em>(let us know if you'd like to see other identity providers)</em></li>
<li>Select your account</li>
<li>Agree to Terms of Service</li>
<li>Done!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-2-install-the-cli">Step 2: Install the CLI</h2>
<p>Follow the instruction to <a href="https://app.soluble.cloud/cli">install the CLI</a> in the sidebar.</p>
<p>There are more <a href="https://docs.soluble.cloud/cli">detailed insructions</a> available in the documentation.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-run-your-first-assessment">Step 3: Run your first assessment</h2>
<p>Enter a directory containing terraform, CloudFormation or Kubernetes manifests and run one of the following:</p>
<pre><code># Terraform
$ soluble tf-scan

# CloudFormation
$ soluble cfn-scan

# Kubernetes
$ soluble k8s-scan

At present the scanners that are available for use are:

For Terraform:

* checkov - `soluble tf-scan checkov`
* tfsec - `soluble tf-scan tfsec`
* terrascan - `soluble tf-scan tfsec`

For CloudFormation:

* cfn-nag - `soluble cfn-scan cfn-nag`
* cfn-python-lint - `soluble cfn-scan cfn-python-lint`
* checkov - `soluble cfn-scan checkov`

For Kubernetes:

* checkov - `soluble k8s-scan checkov`

_Note: If you are interested in seeing other assessment tools, let us know at support@soluble.ai_


To send the results to Soluble Fusion, add the `--upload` flag.  For instance:

</code></pre>
<p>$ soluble tf-scan --upload
...</p>
<pre><code>
The output will include a link to the assessment results.

### Notes

For tools that depend on a language runtime and installation (i.e. checkov, cfn-lint need python runtime) we use a containerized distribution by default. 

If you don't have docker available or prefer to use the already-installed version of the assesment tool, you can add `--tool-path &lt;executable&gt;`.

So to use the locally installed version of checkov:

</code></pre>

<p>soluble tf-scan checkov --tool-path checkov</p>

<p>soluble tf-scan checkov --tool-path /usr/local/bin/checkov
```</p>

<p>NASA offers a data product called a Vegetation Index. This can be used to track how green the Earth is.</p>







<p>Although many are familiar with recent global greening, I prefer to always check the source data. And so I downloaded all of their available 16-day-increment data from 2000 to 2021. Here’s my result:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1420" data-permalink="https://phzoe.com/veg/" data-orig-file="https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png" data-orig-size="740,620" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="veg" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png?w=740" src="https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png?w=740" alt="" srcset="https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png 740w, https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png?w=150 150w, https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"></figure></div>



<pre><code>0.0936 --&gt; 0.1029 is +9.94%</code></pre>



<p>10% global greening in 20 years! We are incredibly fortunate!</p>



<p>I just wish everyone felt that way. But you know not everyone does. To the extent that humans enhance global greening is precisely what social parasites want to tax and regulate. No good deed goes unpunished.</p>



<p>Anyway, Enjoy 🙂 -Zoe</p>



<p>P. S. The Earth is ~29% land. A Veg Index of ~0.29 would mean all covered land is heavy vegetation. </p>

					<p>It was in 2016 when the trike design has developed its first shapes and got a wider recognition. Artūras Mikalauskas – the founder – found a design student –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/43993905/AKO-inverse-trike" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Lukas Avėnas</i></a> – who was crazy enough to jump on such a venture. With the mentorship &amp; ideology suggestions from Artūras, they have successfully created the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://lukasavenas.com/ako-inverse-trike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AKO Trike concept design</a></em>. Later that year, Lukas won the Young Designers Award for his design. Since then, Artūras initiated the build of a first concept-proof prototype.</p>

<p>While Elon Musk was updating about the Starlink internet speed increase via a tweet last evening, a follower presented the idea of a mini portable Starlink dish, and Musk affirmed that it is a good idea.</p>



<p>SpaceX is currently working on system upgrades that might result in higher Starlink internet speeds at times. In response to a question about when Starlink will be available in the Bay Area, “Probably mid-year (2021), but Starlink is really meant for those who are least served. Bay usually has great Internet,” SpaceX CEO <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> said.</p>



<p>The idea of an even more compact, probably sub-1ft diameter dish is praised by Elon Musk, and looking at his past record, he might actually make this happen. A smaller dish that is easier to carry during remote excursions with chargeable batteries could be a perfect travel companion.</p>



<figure></figure>



<div><figure><a href="https://evannex.com/?ref=Iqtidar_TeslaOracle_EVANNEX_Banner" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer"><amp-img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/evannex_googlead_300x250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" layout="intrinsic" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/evannex_googlead_300x250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzI1MCcgd2lkdGg9JzMwMCcgeG1sbnM9J2h0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnJyB2ZXJzaW9uPScxLjEnLz4="></amp-img></a><figcaption>– Sponsored –</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>With the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/cybertruck/">Tesla Cybertruck</a> going to production later this year, many Starlink customers who will own the Cybertruck will want to take the mini dish with them on their journeys. Since the Cybertruck will have power outlets and a huge battery pack inside, powering a small Starlink dish for long periods of time will not be an issue for this electric pickup truck.</p>



<p>We asked a recent <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/starlink/">Starlink</a> beta customer about how much internet speeds he is getting with his new dish installed on the roof of his home. Brian is getting from min 40 Mbps to max 177 Mbps with Starlink depending on the hour of the day or night. He is getting an average speed of 81 Mbps, not so bad. The silver lining is that with time, the speeds are only going to get better and better.</p>

<p>For internet users on Gbps rated connections, this speed might look slow but there is a large number of users even in the developed world who have a 1 – 5 Mbps connection at home. For example, Christ T. Bridgwater from England, Great Britain just upgraded to Starlink from a legacy 900 kbps connection, just imagine his experience coming from such low-speed internet, he says:</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>I’m on beta – just thank you. 11 years waiting for a connection which is better than 900kbps 🙂 thank you</p><cite>Chrs T. Bridgwater. England, GB</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/spacex/">SpaceX</a> is building the Starlink satellite constellation in the lower earth orbit (LEO). 60 more Starlinks were deployed last week but sadly the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2021/02/16/spacex-falcon-9-lost-landing-starlink-launch/">Falcon 9 missed the landing this time</a> and fell into the ocean. Events like these won’t hinder the development of the next-gen internet service provider, exciting times ahead.</p>

<p>On December 24, 2020, the Delhi high court conducted its first hearing for the ongoing case against Alexandra Elbakyan’s website Sci-Hub, an online repository of academic literature that allows users free access to its contents.</p>
<p>It is not unknown that websites like Sci-Hub and Libgen (portmanteau of ‘Library Genesis’) are important for scholars and students alike in India who can’t afford individual subscriptions to academic journals.</p>


<p>However, academic publishers Elsevier Ltd., Wiley Pvt. Ltd. and the American Chemical Society sued Sci-Hub and Libgen for copyright infringement in India and asked for the country’s IT ministry to block access to these sites.</p>
<p>The court’s next hearing is scheduled for February 23. In an exclusive interview to <em>The Wire Science</em>, <strong>Alexandra Elbakyan</strong> spoke of her own days in college, where she said she first felt the need for a tool like Sci-Hub, the legal issues between Elsevier and Sci-Hub around the world, and the tension between piracy and sharing.</p>
<p><em>Excerpts from the interview are presented below, with a few minor edits for style.</em></p>
<p><strong>Could you tell me about your own college experience at Satbayev University, Kazakhstan, in the absence of portals like Sci-Hub? Were there specific difficulties you faced that led to the conception of Sci-Hub?</strong></p>
<p>I first stumbled upon academic paywalls when I was in my final year of study. I studied information technologies, and specialised in infosecurity. Since middle school I was interested in neuroscience, too, so I wanted to combine both fields in my final year project. I started to work on brain-machine interfaces and set up a task to develop a system that can use brainwaves as passwords, in the same way you can use your fingerprint to unlock a computer.</p>
<p>I started searching for information and that was when I first learned that academic journals exist at all. Today, there are people who use Sci-Hub while they study in school, but I was quite old when I started with research.</p>
<p>So, I located the articles that were interesting for my topic on websites such as IEEE or ScienceDirect and almost all of them were paywalled. I was not concerned. For a long time since school, I was using various technologies which made science movies, books and software freely available. So I was sure there was some website to download academic articles for free.</p>
<p>I googled and googled but found nothing! Then I was quite surprised and frustrated, but after a long search I found some forums such as passfans or myescience where people shared passwords to access university libraries. Using these passwords, I was able to enter universities that had subscriptions to these journals and download articles for free.</p>
<p>Then I got an idea to develop a software program that people can use to download academic articles automatically. The design I imagined then was quite different from Sci-Hub, but it was the same idea. I tried discussing it on forums but it did not cause a lot of interest, and I forgot about it for a while. I graduated from university and travelled abroad. I developed Sci-Hub two years later.</p>
<p><strong>Despite a series of lawsuits for copyright infringement, Sci-Hub is not widely thought of as a pirate, and has found acceptance among scholars. What would you say about this?</strong></p>
<p>Today, most scientists view the academic publishing system as fundamentally unjust and exploitative. The problem is that publishers are not actual creators of these works, scientists are – they do all the work, and academic publishers simply use their position of power in the Republic of Science to extract unjust profits. Sci-Hub does not enable piracy where creative people are deprived of the reward they deserve. It is a very different thing.</p>
<p>What does one mean by the word ‘piracy’? Only after several years was I able to comprehend how some people use this word in a bad sense. Most scientists do not care about the legal status at all. They want to do science, and they need to access academic literature to do it, and these legal things — they are in a different reality that scholars do not belong to at all, another planet or a different universe.</p>
<p><ins>Also read: <a href="https://science.thewire.in/science/how-scihub-is-at-the-forefront-of-the-quest-to-frame-scientific-knowledge-as-public-good/">How Sci-Hub Is at the Forefront of the Quest to Frame Scientific Knowledge as Public Good</a></ins></p>
<p><strong>How much do authors earn from the money paid to cross an academic publisher’s paywall?&nbsp;Can you talk about how publishers exercise their power?</strong></p>
<p>The careers of researchers depend on journal publications. To receive funding or secure positions at the university, a scientist must have publications in ‘high-impact’ academic journals. Most of these journals today belong to corporations like Elsevier, Wiley and Springer-Nature.</p>
<p>Researchers do the actual work: they invent the hypothesis, do the experiments and write the articles describing the results of these experiments. Then they publish this article in an academic journal. They cannot simply put this article online on their blog: to be recognised as research work, it must be published in a respectable peer-reviewed journal. So they send their articles to publishers like Elsevier, Wiley or Springer.</p>
<p>Publishers send articles they have received to other scientists for peer-review. Reviewers give their opinion on whether the work should be accepted in a journal or not, or if some additional work must be done. Based on these reviews, the article is published or rejected.</p>
<p>Both reviewers and scientists work for free. They do not earn any compensation from the academic publisher. Here, academic publishers work as organisers of the academic community, but not as creators. The work of the academic publisher is organisational and not creative.</p>
<p><strong>And yet, Elsevier Ltd. has sued Sci-Hub in the US, Sweden, Belgium and France, lobbied for a block in Russia, and now it has filed a lawsuit in India. It’s often the same group of publishers that takes action against Sci-Hub: Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley, the American Chemical Society. Why do you think it is this group?</strong></p>
<p>Because most academic works and the most popular works in Sci-Hub’s database are from these publishers, and Elsevier is the leading one in numbers. These companies form an oligopoly that currently controls all academic communication. These publishers alone perhaps control the majority of science. They are key players.</p>
<p>Sci-Hub’s view is that science should not be controlled by a few big companies but it should be a dynamic network of learned societies.</p>
<p><strong>In the last hearing on January 6, 2021, the Delhi High Court deemed the case to be of public importance, and allowed scholars to register their concerns with the court. You claimed many Twitter users were tweeting at the Sci-Hub account and you were archiving these tweets. But on January 8, Twitter suspended Sci-Hub’s account. Can you tell me the extent to which Twitter’s move affected your ability to defend your case?</strong></p>
<p>On Sci-Hub’s Twitter account, anyone could see right away that no researcher today supports what publishers do and everyone thinks that academic research should be free to access. It was very obvious and visible on the Sci-Hub account, and people who wanted to support Sci-Hub had a place to do it.</p>
<p>Now of course after the Sci-Hub account has been banned there are fewer people voicing their opinions about Sci-Hub, because the discussion platform is gone, so there are fewer supportive comments, and the support of Sci-Hub is not as obvious as it has previously been. However, in my view it will not seriously affect the ability to defend the current case in India.</p>
<p><ins>Also read: <a href="https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/sci-hub-case-india-academic-publishing-access-alexandra-elbakyan-twitter-account-suspension/">Curious Timing: As Sci-Hub Case Takes off in India, Twitter Suspends Its Account</a></ins></p>
<p><strong>The number of cases against you have shot up in the last five years. Would you be comfortable about sharing how this has affected you as an individual?</strong></p>
<p>Researchers depend on Sci-Hub and I feel a need to support its users, I cannot simply abandon them. I love academic literature and knowledge, and I love working on Sci-Hub. Sci-Hub is nine years old already and it has become a fundamental part of my life. I never thought about abandoning Sci-Hub actually. I have a dream to make academic literature free and I work on it consistently.</p>
<p>Currently the lawsuits have not targeted or affected me directly. I was ordered to pay Elsevier 15 million dollars in damages but I am able to ignore a United States order right now. But what might happen in the future?</p>
<p><strong>What would you say to those who argue that it is naïve to expect a system of unhindered exchange of information to thrive, and that publishing houses have a right over the knowledge that they publish?</strong></p>
<p>What is naive and dangerous is to expect science to thrive when information exchange is hindered. And as I said before, science should not be controlled by a few big corporations. That is detrimental to science.</p>

		<p>Our mission is to give everyone in the world <strong>computer superpowers</strong>. We build powerful yet approachable tools &amp; platforms for developers, students, and educators.</p>
<p>We see a new generation of hackers and entrepreneurs rising to seize the power of computers and the internet to create software that empowers them and their communities. They refuse to be programmed by the software priesthood that wants them to endlessly consume ads. Instead, they build a more free society where computers work for and under human users, not the other way around. The world we're describing is coming, and we exist to accelerate the shift. <a href="https://repl.it/careers">Join us</a>! </p>
<p><img src="https://repl.art/replit.png" alt="art"></p>
<p>Replit is a multiplayer computing environment that makes it <a href="https://blog.replit.com/internet-of-fun">fun</a> to learn how to code, build, and <a href="https://repl.it/talk/share">share apps</a> with other people. You can create a cloud-powered computer in milliseconds -- we call them "repls" -- and you can create as many of them as you'd like, all for free. Repls come with storage for your code and files, a <a href="https://blog.repl.it/database">database</a> for your data, and a <a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">multiplayer editor</a> &amp; console to code with your friends. For <a href="https://repl.it/pricing">$7/month</a>, you'll get more powerful machines and, with one-click, make them <a href="https://blog.repl.it/alwayson">run forever</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/database/database1.gif" alt="db"></p>
<p>When you invite a friend to your repl, you can see them in your editor and talk to them <a href="https://blog.repl.it/annotations-for-education">right in your code</a>. You can make <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/http-servers">web</a>, <a href="https://blog.repl.it/native-graphics-love">desktop</a>, and even command-line apps. Replit takes care of the entire process of <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">publishing and hosting apps</a> so you can focus on your ideas.</p>
<p><img src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Live-Code-Editing.gif?resize=800%2C450&amp;strip=all" alt="multiplayer"></p>
<p>When you've built something you want to share, you can share the <a href="https://blog.replit.com/spotlight">repl URL</a>, and your users can play with your app, react to it, comment on it, and even fork and remix it. Replit gives you a profile to keep and showcase all your apps and repls. You can make <a href="https://repl.it/site/teams">shared team profiles</a> for your class, friends, or company to collaborate on repls.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/spotlight/ios-demo.gif" alt="share"></p>
<p>Because you can make a repl in milliseconds, Replit makes it fun and safe to experiment with ideas. Learning comes naturally as a side effect of playing in the Replit ecosystem.</p>
<p>Millions of people have learned how to code with Replit and built great apps with thousands of happy users. Some have even built businesses and become rich &amp; famous.</p>
<p>Replit's design principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Learnable yet scalable interfaces</strong>: Interfaces today present the same UI to vastly different users, from children to adults, from novices to experts. Our mission demands that we make computing environments more accessible to novices while making it possible to transition to more powerful interfaces. Replit starts with a simple editor and console, which gets learners very far. The UI, however, is adaptable and presents different faces to different users and use-cases.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Infrastructure as legos</strong>: A core part of commanding computer power is to be able to build for the modern internet-connected world. Despite progress in cloud computing, infrastructure remains inaccessible to novices, hobbyists, and educators. We change this by designing simple and scalable components, like cloud-hosted servers accessible right from the repl, storage, databases, etc., that require little configuration and maintenance by the programmer. Coders can then mix and match components to create endless possibilities.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>People-centric technology</strong>: It's more exciting and fun to create and learn with other people. The future demands that computers and the internet have human interconnectedness as a core primitive. From our multiplayer computing protocol to our community spaces for sharing software, we build support for human beings, and we put collaboration right at the heart of our technology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="series-a">Series A</h2>
<p>As a team, we've always thought about the long-term, and we've grown Replit responsibly. We have so much conviction in our mission and our plan that we're willing to take our time. </p>
<p>Last year, with rapid growth in all aspects of our business, we felt it was a good time to raise a sizeable round to make faster progress our mission. We raised <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/18/replit-raises-20-million-for-collaborative-browser-based-coding/">$20M in Series A</a> financing led by <a href="https://acapital.com/">A.Capital</a> with strong participation from our seed investors: Andreessen Horowitz, Bloomberg Beta, Y Combinator, and Reach Capital. </p>
<p>Since then, thanks to the new capital and to <a href="https://amasad.me/moad">Engelbartian Bootstrapping</a>, we've accelerated feature development, and there's so much more on the horizon: extra resources for more complex projects, support for any language or package, further dev ops simplifications for novices and pros, business collaboration features, improvements to <a href="https://repl.it/teams-for-education">teacher workflows</a>, high quality content, a game development library, and more breakthroughs in collaborative coding. We're excited to see all the amazing things you build with the tools we provide!</p>
<p>Finally, we're hiring for multiple roles and want to bring on people who share our vision and passion. If you're interested in making computing more accessible while working with a creative and hardworking team building fantastic technology, <a href="https://repl.it/careers">join us</a>!</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/xss-attacks/intro.png" width="100%" alt="XSS Attacks Introduction"></p>

<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is an attack that allows JavaScript from one site to run on another. XSS is interesting not due to the technical difficulty of the attack but rather because it exploits some of the core security mechanisms of web browsers and because of its sheer pervasiveness. Understanding XSS and its mitigations provides substantial insight into how the web works and how sites are safely (and unsafely) isolated from each other.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Initially the web was a collection of static HTML documents that the browser would render for users to view. As the web grew, demands for richer documents grew, which led to the development of JavaScript and cookies: JavaScript to make documents interactive and cookies to allow browsers to save the state of a document.</p>

<p>The advent of these features led to browsers not only rendering HTML documents, but also providing an in-memory representation of the document called the Document Object Model (DOM) as an API to the document for developers. The DOM gave developers a tree-based representation of the HTML tags of a document and also access to cookies to retrieve the state of the document. As time went on, the DOM went from a largely read-only structure to a read-write structure where updating the DOM would lead to re-rendering of the document.</p>

<p>Once documents gained the ability to execute code, browsers needed to define the execution context for JavaScript programs. The policy that was developed is called the Same-Origin policy and is still one of the fundamental security primitives of browser security. Originally, the Same-Origin policy stated that JavaScript within one document can only access its own DOM and the DOMs of other documents with the same origin. Later when <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> (and now <code>Fetch</code>) were added, a modified version of the same origin policy followed. These APIs could issue requests to any origin, they could only read the response to requests from the same origin.</p>

<p>What exactly is an origin? It’s the tuple of protocol, hostname, and port of a document.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">https://www.example.com:443/app
^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^
Scheme  Host            Port</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Figure 1: Scheme, host, and port of this url is the tuple that composes a browser origin.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/xss-attacks/same-origin.png" width="100%" alt="XSS Attacks Same Origin Diagram"></p>

<p><em>Figure 2: An illustration of the Same-Origin in action. JavaScript running on www.evil.com is unable to access the DOM of www.example.com.</em></p>

<p>The Same-Origin policy has been great in mitigating attacks on static sites as illustrated in Figure (2). However, attacks on dynamically generated sites that accept user input have been quite difficult because the web allows mixing of code and data. Mixing code and data allows attacker-controlled input to execute within the origin of the document.</p>

<p>XSS attacks typically manifest themselves in three broad manners: reflected, stored, and DOM-based.</p>

<p>Reflected and stored XSS attacks are fundamentally the same, as they both rely on malicious input being sent to the backend server and the server (at some point) presenting that input to the user. Reflected XSS occurs immediately, usually in the form of a maliciously crafted link by the attacker that the victim then clicks. Stored XSS occurs when the attacker uploads malicious input that is later displayed to the user. DOM-based attacks are different in that they occur purely client-side and involve malicious input manipulating the DOM.</p>

<p>If you didn’t fully grasp the forms above, don’t worry, they’ll make more sense as we cover some examples below.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<h3 id="reflected-xss-attacks">Reflected XSS Attacks</h3>

<p>Below you can see a simple Go-based web application that “reflects” its input (even if it’s a malicious script) back to the user. You can run this application by saving it in a file called <code>xss1.go</code> and then typing <code>go run xss1.go</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"log"</span>
    <span>"net/http"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>handler</span>(<span>w</span> <span>http</span>.<span>ResponseWriter</span>, <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span>.<span>Request</span>) {
    <span>w</span>.<span>Header</span>().<span>Set</span>(<span>"X-XSS-Protection"</span>, <span>"0"</span>)

    <span>messages</span>, <span>ok</span> <span>:=</span> <span>r</span>.<span>URL</span>.<span>Query</span>()[<span>"message"</span>]
    <span>if</span> !<span>ok</span> {
       <span>messages</span> = []<span>string</span>{<span>"hello, world"</span>}
    }
    <span>fmt</span>.<span>Fprintf</span>(<span>w</span>, <span>"&lt;html&gt;&lt;p&gt;%v&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"</span>, <span>messages</span>[<span>0</span>])
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>http</span>.<span>HandleFunc</span>(<span>"/"</span>, <span>handler</span>)
    <span>log</span>.<span>Fatal</span>(<span>http</span>.<span>ListenAndServe</span>(<span>"127.0.0.1:8080"</span>, <span>nil</span>))
}
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Figure 3: An example of a web application with a reflected XSS attack in it.</em></p>

<p>To see the XSS attack navigate to the vulnerable URL below.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">http://localhost:8080?message<span>=</span>&lt;script&gt;alert<span>(</span>1<span>)</span>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>Take a look at the source, and you’ll see the server returned a document that looks something like the one in Figure (4). Note how the mixing of code and data allowed this attack to occur.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>html</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span>p</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span>script</span>&gt;<span>alert</span>(<span>1</span>)&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;
  &lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span>html</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Figure 4: Example output of a web application vulnerable to XSS.</em></p>

<p>Admittedly, this may seem like a somewhat contrived example because XSS protection was explicitly disabled. However this form of XSS protection has always been heuristic-based with a variety of workarounds for different browsers. It was disabled to create simple cross-browser examples that illustrate the core concepts of XSS attacks. Furthermore, some browsers are removing these heuristic-based XSS protections, for <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5021976655560704">example if you are running Chrome 78 or above</a>, you don’t need to include the <code>w.Header().Set("X-XSS-Protection", "0")</code> line for this attack to work.</p>

<h3 id="stored-xss-attacks">Stored XSS Attacks</h3>

<p>Stored XSS attacks are fundamentally similar to reflected attacks, the main difference being the attack payload comes from a datastore instead of directly from the input. For example, an attacker will upload the payload to the web application which will then be shown to every logged in user.</p>

<p>Below is a simple chat application written in Go that illustrates a stored XSS attack. You can run this application by saving it in a file called <code>xss2.go</code> and then typing <code>go run xss2.go</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"fmt"</span>
	<span>"log"</span>
	<span>"net/http"</span>
	<span>"strings"</span>
	<span>"sync"</span>
)

<span>var</span> <span>db</span> []<span>string</span>
<span>var</span> <span>mu</span> <span>sync</span>.<span>Mutex</span>

<span>var</span> <span>tmpl</span> = <span>`
</span><span>&lt;form action="/save"&gt;
</span><span>  Message: &lt;input name="message" type="text"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
</span><span>  &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/form&gt;
</span><span>%v
</span><span>`</span>

<span>func</span> <span>saveHandler</span>(<span>w</span> <span>http</span>.<span>ResponseWriter</span>, <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span>.<span>Request</span>) {
	<span>mu</span>.<span>Lock</span>()
	<span>defer</span> <span>mu</span>.<span>Unlock</span>()

	<span>r</span>.<span>ParseForm</span>()
	<span>messages</span>, <span>ok</span> <span>:=</span> <span>r</span>.<span>Form</span>[<span>"message"</span>]
	<span>if</span> !<span>ok</span> {
		<span>http</span>.<span>Error</span>(<span>w</span>, <span>"missing message"</span>, <span>500</span>)
	}

	<span>db</span> = append(<span>db</span>, <span>messages</span>[<span>0</span>])

	<span>http</span>.<span>Redirect</span>(<span>w</span>, <span>r</span>, <span>"/"</span>, <span>301</span>)
}

<span>func</span> <span>viewHandler</span>(<span>w</span> <span>http</span>.<span>ResponseWriter</span>, <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span>.<span>Request</span>) {
	<span>w</span>.<span>Header</span>().<span>Set</span>(<span>"X-XSS-Protection"</span>, <span>"0"</span>)
	<span>w</span>.<span>Header</span>().<span>Set</span>(<span>"Content-Type"</span>, <span>"text/html; charset=utf-8"</span>)

	<span>var</span> <span>sb</span> <span>strings</span>.<span>Builder</span>
	<span>sb</span>.<span>WriteString</span>(<span>"&lt;ul&gt;"</span>)
	<span>for</span> <span>_</span>, <span>message</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>db</span> {
		<span>sb</span>.<span>WriteString</span>(<span>"&lt;li&gt;"</span> <span>+</span> <span>message</span> <span>+</span> <span>"&lt;/li&gt;"</span>)
	}
	<span>sb</span>.<span>WriteString</span>(<span>"&lt;/ul&gt;"</span>)

	<span>fmt</span>.<span>Fprintf</span>(<span>w</span>, <span>tmpl</span>, <span>sb</span>.<span>String</span>())
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>http</span>.<span>HandleFunc</span>(<span>"/"</span>, <span>viewHandler</span>)
	<span>http</span>.<span>HandleFunc</span>(<span>"/save"</span>, <span>saveHandler</span>)
	<span>log</span>.<span>Fatal</span>(<span>http</span>.<span>ListenAndServe</span>(<span>"127.0.0.1:8080"</span>, <span>nil</span>))
}
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Figure 5: An example of a web application with a stored XSS attack in it.</em></p>

<p>To see the XSS attack, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and type in the message <code>&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The attack occurs in two phases. First, the attack payload is saved to the datastore in the <code>storeHandler</code> function. Next, when the page is rendered in <code>viewHandler</code>, the attack payload is directly added to the output.</p>

<p>Once again, the culprit is the allowing of mixing of data and code. The browser has no way to tell if the payload was intentional or malicious.</p>

<h3 id="dom-based-xss-attacks">DOM-Based XSS Attacks</h3>

<p>DOM-based XSS attacks don’t involve the backend and occur purely client-side. They’re also quite interesting because modern web applications are moving logic to the client. DOM- based XSS attacks occur when user input is allowed to directly manipulate the DOM in unsafe ways. The good news for attackers is that the DOM has a wide variety of ways it can be abused, the most popular being <code>innerHTML</code> and <code>document.write</code>.</p>

<p>Below is an example of a web application that serves static content. It’s fundamentally the same as the reflected XSS example, but here the attack will occur entirely client- side. You can run this application by saving it in a file called <code>xss3.go</code> and then typing <code>go run xss3.go</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"log"</span>
    <span>"net/http"</span>
)

<span>const</span> <span>content</span> = <span>`
</span><span>
</span><span>&lt;html&gt;
</span><span>   &lt;head&gt;
</span><span>       &lt;script&gt;
</span><span>          window.onload = function() {
</span><span>             var params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
</span><span>             p = document.getElementById("content")
</span><span>             p.innerHTML = params.get("message")
</span><span>	     };
</span><span>       &lt;/script&gt;
</span><span>   &lt;/head&gt;
</span><span>   &lt;body&gt;
</span><span>       &lt;p id="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span>   &lt;/body&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/html&gt;
</span><span>`</span>

<span>func</span> <span>handler</span>(<span>w</span> <span>http</span>.<span>ResponseWriter</span>, <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span>.<span>Request</span>) {
    <span>w</span>.<span>Header</span>().<span>Set</span>(<span>"X-XSS-Protection"</span>, <span>"0"</span>)
    <span>fmt</span>.<span>Fprintf</span>(<span>w</span>, <span>content</span>)
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>http</span>.<span>HandleFunc</span>(<span>"/"</span>, <span>handler</span>)
    <span>log</span>.<span>Fatal</span>(<span>http</span>.<span>ListenAndServe</span>(<span>"127.0.0.1:8080"</span>, <span>nil</span>))
}
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Figure 6: An example of a web application with a DOM-based XSS attack in it.</em></p>

<p>To see this attack, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/?message="&lt;img src=1 onerror=alert(1);/&gt;"</code>. Note that the attack vector is slightly different, and the XSS sink <code>innerHTML</code> won’t execute a script directly; however, it will add HTML elements which will then execute JavaScript. In the example given, an image element is added that executes JavaScript when an error occurs. The error always occurs because the attacker conveniently always provides an invalid source.</p>

<p>If you want to directly add a script element, you’ll have to use a different XSS sink. As we mentioned, you’re in luck because the DOM provides a wide variety of dangerous sinks. Replace the script element in Figure (6) with the script element in Figure (7) and navigate to the following URL <code>http://localhost:8080/?message="&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt;"</code>. This attack works because <code>document.write</code> accepts script elements directly.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go">&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;
   <span>window</span>.<span>onload</span> = <span>function</span>() {
      <span>var</span> <span>params</span> = <span>new</span> <span>URLSearchParams</span>(<span>window</span>.<span>location</span>.<span>search</span>);
      <span>document</span>.<span>open</span>();
      <span>document</span>.<span>write</span>(<span>params</span>.<span>get</span>(<span>"message"</span>));
      <span>document</span>.close();
   };
&lt;<span>/</span><span>script</span>&gt;

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Release engineering is on pace with the timelines previously documented to provide a release of Rocky Linux by Q2 2021. The infrastructure team is working on automation in their area to facilitate the deployment of build infrastructure in additional regions. We’ve finalized our sponsorship model, and are as well open to partnerships for deeper collaboration. We’ve drafted our organizational structure, as well as our community charter. Finally, we’ve secured authorization from The Linux Foundation to license Rocky Linux under the Rocky Software Enterprise Foundation, which is the official legal entity that represents Rocky Linux and fosters its growth.</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>In our previous update, we listed a number of items and gave dates to them. We remain committed to delivering an initial release of Rocky Linux by Q2. Here are what we listed previously, and where we stand with each:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build systems and infrastructure readiness - January 31 [DONE]</li>
<li>Automatic package build infrastructures - January 31 [DONE]</li>
<li>Testing package repository made public - February 28 [In progress]</li>
<li>Installer testing readiness - February 28 [In progress]</li>
<li>ETA for length of time needed for community testing - March 31 [In progress]</li>
<li>Release candidate availability - March 31 [On Pace]</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Legal</h2>
<p>The Linux Foundation has granted us a sub-license to legally use “Linux’’ in the distribution’s name “Rocky Linux.” We have renamed the “Rocky Linux Foundation’’ (RESF) to the “Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation” and changed it to a Public Benefits Organization in Delaware.</p>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p>The build infrastructure for our first deployment in us-east-2 was completed and handed off to the Development team.</p>
<p>The next steps for the Infrastructure team is to ensure documentation (both internal and external) is accurate and up-to-date, and then to finalize the translation of the current infrastructure to automation tooling so we can replicate deployments to additional regions. These regions include Development, us-west-2, and GovCloud. Alerting automation is also in progress, so not only are we monitoring our metrics and syslogs, but when issues arise we are receiving the appropriate notifications to enable the team to respond accordingly in a timely manner. We continue to make progress toward an alternate build infrastructure to AWS and hope to have an announcement by the March community update.</p>
<h2>Release Engineering and Packaging</h2>
<p>The team is working on building packages and getting the processes ready to assemble the final release. This includes things like validating the operation of Pungi (repo/image compositions), and nailing the package build order. An <a href="https://wiki.rockylinux.org/en/team/development/build_steps">overview of the build process</a> can be found on our wiki. We’re seeking volunteers that can assist with debranding, so if this is an area you’d like to contribute, please reach out! An <a href="https://wiki.rockylinux.org/en/team/development/debranding/how-to">overview of the steps for debranding</a> is on the wiki, with a more detailed guide to shortly follow.</p>
<h2>Merchandise</h2>
<p>Muckles Inc has begun shipping orders that have been placed, and people have started to receive those items. They were a little surprised by the huge amount of orders that were placed, so it has taken them a little bit longer to process those requests. We’re thankful for your patience, and of course they are still accepting new orders for <a href="https://www.mucklesu.com/collections/rocky-linux">Rocky Linux merch</a>. Please share photos of your Rocky Linux merchandise with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/rocky_linux">Twitter</a>, the <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/">forums</a>, or <a href="https://chat.rockylinux.org/">Mattermost</a>!</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<h3>Community Charter</h3>
<p>Responsibility to the community is critical to our success. To that end, we’ve published The Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation Community Charter, and you can read that <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/t/community-charter/1933">here</a>. We consider our community charter one of our most important documents, as it communicates to the community what our principles, values, and intentions are. Our responsibility to the community is outlined in our charter; the community’s responsibility is to hold us accountable. We will be embedding this charter in the distribution of the core Rocky Linux operating system, ensuring the longevity and persistence of these principles.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>We’ve expanded upon and published a <a href="https://rockylinux.org/faq/">FAQ</a> which addresses a number of questions that we’ve received. Questions such as “If Rocky Linux is just a respin of RHEL, what’s taking so long for a release candidate?” and “If you’re not just repackaging RHEL, then what exactly are you doing?” and more are all addressed. We will be adding to the FAQ over time based on questions the community surfaces.</p>
<h3>Mattermost</h3>
<p>The migration from Slack to Mattermost has been completed, and all of the legacy Slack channels have been archived. We’ve also set up a bridge from Mattermost to IRC, so if you’re in a Mattermost channel and you see [freenode] BOT , that’s what that’s about. On IRC, Mattermost messages will come from the rlf user, a username subject to change.</p>
<p>Lastly, be sure to check out the <a href="https://mattermost.com/blog/what-matters-episode-12-rocky-linux-with-jordan-pisaniello/">latest episode</a> of “What Matters” a podcast by Mattermost where Community Manager Jordan Pisaniello sits down to discuss Rocky Linux.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Documentation team has been rapidly growing and has made great progress toward putting forward documentation of the highest quality, with a number of community members stepping up and taking ownership of the massive effort. The team is organizing around a number of topics, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Translation</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Packaging</li>
<li>Editorial</li>
<li>Administration</li>
</ul>
<p>and more. For the translation effort, we’re looking for volunteers to support the localization effort into non-English languages.</p>
<p>The team meets virtually once a month to plan and review progress, with scheduling discussed in advance in the <a href="https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/documentation">Documentation channel</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/documentation">Please join us</a> on Mattermost and indicate the language or subject area you can assist with. You can also create <a href="https://github.com/rocky-linux/documentation">an issue or pull request on Github</a> to propose a new documentation topic or to help fix existing documentation.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like a special recognition of the Documentation Admin team—Calder Sheagren and Ezequiel Bruni—for helping to keep us organized and on-task.</p>

<p>At Framework, we believe the time has come for consumer electronics products that are designed to last. Founded in San Francisco in 2019, our mission is to empower you with great products you can easily customize, upgrade, and repair, increasing longevity and reducing e-waste in the process.</p>
<p>Today, we are excited to unveil our first product: the Framework Laptop, a thin, lightweight, high-performance 13.5” notebook that can be upgraded, customized, and repaired in ways that no other notebook can.</p>
<p>We’re here to prove that designing products to last doesn’t require sacrificing performance, quality, or style.&nbsp; The Framework Laptop meets or beats the best of what’s in the category:</p>
<ul><li>Crafted with a precision formed and milled aluminum housing, coming in at 15.85mm thick and 1.3kg.</li><li>Designed for the future of work with a 13.5” 3:2 screen with 2256x1504 resolution, a fantastic 1080p 60fps webcam (finally!) with hardware privacy switches, a high cycle-life 55Wh battery, and a great feeling keyboard with 1.5mm key travel.</li><li>Delivering excellent performance with 11th Gen Intel Core Processors configurable with Wi-Fi 6E, up to 64GB of DDR4 memory, and 4TB or more of Gen4 NVMe storage.</li></ul>
<p>On top of that, the Framework Laptop offers unparalleled options to upgrade, customize and repair:</p>
<ul><li>Our Expansion Card system makes adapters a thing of the past, letting you choose exactly the ports you want and which side of the notebook you want them on.&nbsp; With four bays, you can select from USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort, MicroSD, ultra fast storage, a high-end headphone amp, and more.</li><li>Along with socketed storage, WiFi, and two slots of memory, the entire mainboard can be swapped to boost performance as we launch updated versions with new CPU generations.</li><li>High-use parts like the battery, screen, keyboard, and color-customizable magnetic-attach bezel are easy to replace.&nbsp; QR codes on each item take you directly to guides and the listing in our web store.</li><li>In addition to releasing new upgrades regularly, we’re opening up the ecosystem to enable a community of partners to build and sell compatible modules through the Framework Marketplace.</li></ul>
<p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/frameworkmarketplace/36c653c0-ccf5-4ea5-a94c-3bb0d8c38324_hero-clp-1200x630-image02.jpg?auto=compress,format" alt="" width="2400" height="1260"></p>
<p>Most consumer electronics devices are disposable one-offs by design. The single best way to reduce the environmental impact of electronics is to make them last longer. In addition to enabling longevity, we’re focused on improving sustainability across the life of our products.&nbsp; The Framework Laptop is made of 50% post consumer recycled (PCR) aluminum and an average of 30% PCR plastic. Our packaging is fully recyclable with no single-use plastics, and all of our product shipments are carbon offset.</p>
<p>The Framework Laptop is available in a range of pre-configured models running Windows 10 Home or Pro.&nbsp; For those of you who love to tinker, we’ve also created the Framework Laptop DIY Edition, the only high-end notebook available as a kit of modules that you can customize and assemble yourself, with the ability to choose Windows or install your preferred Linux distribution.&nbsp; Regardless of the path you take, we include a screwdriver in the box so you can upgrade over time.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to sharing more and will announce our full line-up with specs, pricing, pre-order timing, and a summer 2021 ship date over the next weeks. Until then, please visit us at <a href="https://frame.work/">https://frame.work</a> or follow our progress at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/FrameworkComputer/">@FrameworkComputer</a>.</p>
<p>It’s time for long-lasting products that respect your right to repair and upgrade.&nbsp; We’re bringing this philosophy to notebooks this year and to additional categories as we go.&nbsp; We chose an ambitious mission and assembled an incredible team to deliver on it, bringing experience from the founding team of Oculus and design, engineering, and operations across Apple, Google, Lenovo, and more.&nbsp; We’re working with fantastically capable component and manufacturing partners who believe in our mission too.&nbsp; We can’t wait to build a better consumer electronics industry together.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Last week we <a href="https://martinord.eu/posts/2021/02/hide-your-secrets-with-luks/">have talked about encryption and a solution for Linux users</a>. This time, we will cover an Free and Open Source <strong>solution that works for everyone: Windows, MacOS and Linux users: VeraCrypt</strong>. In this guide we will <strong>encrypt your USB stick</strong> step by step, so you can hide your secrets and use it securely across different devices.</p>
<h2 id="warning-remember-the-password">Warning: remember the password</h2>
<p>I have already updated last week post with a warning. It seems trivial but I do not want to be responsible of any data loss :D</p>
<p>The truth is this <strong>if you forget your password, your files are gone</strong>. You will not able to <em>reset your password</em> and wait for an email to come to your Inbox so you can click a direct link to reset everything like magic. Once you encrypt your files with a key, you will can only change your password if you know your previous password.</p>
<figure>

            <p>Searching for your forgotten password. [src:giphy.com]</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>No problem!</strong> Right? At this point you already know you can use a <strong><a href="https://martinord.eu/posts/2021/01/why-should-i-have-a-password-manager/">password manager</a></strong> to store your passwords so you do not forget them. Anyway, you can always create a backup of your files in a different (encrypted) drive that you keep at home. In case you forget the password, you can go for your backup.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-veracrypt">What is VeraCrypt?</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html">VeraCrypt</a> is a Free and Open Source software solution for disk encryption</strong>. It is based on a previous existing project named <em>Truecrypt</em> that is no longer mantained. Nowadays, VeraCrypt is mostly maintained by the <a href="https://www.idrix.fr/Root/">IDRIX</a> group.</p>
<p>Why choosing VeraCrypt? Here are <strong>two advantages</strong>:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://martinord.eu/img/usb-veracrypt/compatibility.png" alt="Windows, Linux, MacOS"> <figcaption>
            <p>VeraCrypt is compatible with Linux, Windows and MacOS.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h3>
<p><strong>VeraCrypt is compatible with Windows, MacOS and Linux</strong>. This is a great advantage as you can use it across devices and Operating Systems. You can check their <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Supported%20Operating%20Systems.html">supported OS</a> on their website.</p>
<p>When I once asked one of my (a bit paranoid) Linux Hardening teachers, he answared me with this question: “What is the point of encrypting your USB if you are going to mount it in Windows anyway?” :D</p>
<h3 id="open-source">Open Source</h3>
<p>The tool is <strong>maintained by a community</strong> of cryptography experts, it is open to the public and you will never depend on a company changing the price or the software. Moreover, you can trust that many <strong>people is reviewing the code</strong> and it just does what it says it does. If the code is proprietary and closed source, nobody can verify what the application is doing.</p>
<p>The source code is available in <a href="https://github.com/veracrypt/VeraCrypt">Github</a>.</p>
<h2 id="get-on-with-it-veracrypt">Get on with it: VeraCrypt</h2>
<p>The next part of the article is about encrypting your USB stick. Keep in mind that VeraCrypt has also other functionalities like encrypting your Windows installation drive, so feel free to check their project and <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Documentation.html">their documentation</a>. Once you encrypt your USB, you can use it normally after mounting it with VeraCrypt.</p>
<p>For this tutorial, <strong>we will use Windows 10</strong>. However, the steps are very similar for other OS. Remember it is also compatible with Linux, MacOS and even RaspberryPi!</p>
<h3 id="install-veracrypt">Install VeraCrypt</h3>
<p>For <strong>creating</strong> the encrypted USB and for <strong>using it</strong>, you need the <strong>VeraCrypt desktop application</strong>. You can download it from their website and verify their PGP signature:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download it: <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html">https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html</a></li>
<li>(Optional) Verify the PGP signature: <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Digital%20Signatures.html">https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Digital%20Signatures.html</a></li>
<li>Launch the installer</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="create-a-new-encrypted-volume">Create a new encrypted volume</h3>
<p>Once you have installed VeraCrypt, it is time to get your USB stick. Fistly, we will see how to create an encrypted partition with an <strong>empty USB stick</strong>. If you already have files on it, you can copy them to a temporary folder or <a href="#existing">you can encrypt the device with them inside</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <em>Create Volume</em> and choose <em>Encrypt a non-system partition/drive</em>.</li>
<li>Choose the <em>Create encrypted volume and format it</em>. This will create a new partition in the USB stick.</li>
<li>Continue with defaults and <strong>set a password</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose the format and encrypt your drive. <strong>I recommend choosing FAT</strong> so it is compatible across devices.</li>
<li>Click <em>Format</em> and you are done!</li>
</ol>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="existing">Extra: Encrypting an existing NTFS partition</h3>
<p>As said, if you <strong>already have a NTFS partition with files</strong>, you can use VeraCrypt to directly encrypt the partition with the files inside. For this you just have to <strong>replace step 2 choosing <em>Encrypt partition in place</em>.</strong></p>
<figure>

<h2 id="now-what-use-the-encrypted-usb">Now what? Use the encrypted USB</h2>
<p>Now you have your encrypted USB, <strong>you have to unlock it with VeraCrypt</strong>. This is easy:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://martinord.eu/img/usb-veracrypt/use1.png" alt="Usage 1"> <figcaption>
            <p>Select your encrypted USB.</p>

</figure>

<ol>
<li><strong>Open Veracrypt</strong></li>
<li><strong>Select your device</strong> and choose a letter you want to assign</li>
<li><strong>Click on <em>Mount</em></strong></li>
<li><strong>Type your password</strong></li>
</ol>
<figure>
    <img src="https://martinord.eu/img/usb-veracrypt/use2.png" alt="Usage 2"> <figcaption>
            <p>Type your password.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>VeraCrypt is a <strong>good solution for encrypting your drives</strong>. The advantages we have seen here make you able to use it for free and across devices. Moreover, it is easy to use through its GUI. I see a problem, though: <strong>no Operating System has native support for VeraCrypt</strong>, so you will have to install the application in every device you want to use your USB stick.</p>
<p><strong>Obri!</strong> Thank you for reading this post. I hope I made you check the VeraCrypt project.</p>

Well, it's been a year since I started the draft, so I guess it's about time to publish this! :)

often <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">despite</a> crappy interoperability (or lack thereof) of different platforms.
</p>
<p>
I prepared this diagram for several reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>to give more context for my blog posts about data liberation and tools around it</li>
<li>to highlight the complexity and hoops we have to jump over because of the lack of interoperability</li>
<li>it was also sort of fun :)</li>
</ul>
<p>
This time I won't write too much text and just let you explore it. <b>Tips for exploring the diagram</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>perhaps open the <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/myinfra_files/myinfra.svg"><b>full size SVG</b></a> in a new tab</li>
<li>make sure to read the legend</li>
<li>links you can follow are marked with blue (and sometimes other colours)</li>
<li>there is a bubble (💬) near some nodes/edges, you can hover it to see the comment</li>
<li>some integrations are in progress: marked with <samp>WIP</samp>, construction signs (🚧🚧) and dashed edges</li>
<li>arrows roughly represent the direction of data flow</li>
<li>arrow colors roughly correspond to the data source (so it's easier to track how it flows)</li>
<li>there are some rendering issues

<ul>
<li>it's probably not very mobile friendly (it's barely desktop friendly!)</li>
<li>SVG support varies among web browsers, so there might be some minor artifacts (chromium works better, but firefox works well enough)</li>
<li>navbar centering isn't broken on this page – it's just a temporary hack to fit in the diagram till I figure out wide pages properly</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

Some <b>notes</b> regarding the diagram:
</p>
<ul>
<li>it's plotted via graphviz, and you can find the source <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/myinfra">here</a> (although the code is quite domain specific)</li>
<li>even though there is a lot of stuff on the diagram, it's still incomplete!

<ul>
<li><a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/my-data.html">here</a> there is an (also incomplete) list of data I collect/export</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/tree/master/my">HPI modules</a> are a good proxy for the data I'm using</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
note that despite some platforms dying (e.g. Jawbone/Endomondo), I can still use data produced with them!
</p>
<p>
E.g. after Endomondo was discontinued, I was able to quickly switch to open source <a href="https://github.com/jonasoreland/runnerup#readme">RunnerUp app</a>,
while <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/blob/5b501d156266ca8e185d681fab6bc3ee156498a6/my/runnerup.py">preserving</a> complete data compatibility.
</p></li>
<li>note how many services are outright malicious with their <b>anti-API/anti-scraping/anti-interoperability</b> measures (yellow/red highlight for API nodes)</li>
<li>probably more platforms have GDPR exports, I just haven't tried yet</li>
<li><p>
indirection is crazy
</p>
<p>
Note how for some data, before I can get it on my computer, it goes as
</p>
<ul>
<li>device –&gt; phone (over bluetooth)</li>
<li>phone  –&gt; cloud (over internet)</li>
<li>cloud  –&gt; computer (over internet)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
for many phone apps <b>the only way</b> I can sync the data is <b>by rooting my phone</b> in order to access the <code>/data/data</code> directory
</p>
<p>
This is getting worse and worse with every Android version. I understand the security concerns, but this is ridiculous.
</p></li>
<li><p>
some modules/packages (marked with<sup>sb</sup> superscript) were developed by <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge">Sean Breckenridge</a>
</p>
<p>
He's forked my <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI">HPI</a> package and working on it <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/HPI">in parallel</a>.
For now, we decided to hack on it independently, in the hope that eventually we figure out what's a good model for cooperating and maintaining the modules.
</p>
<p>
Also, he's done some cool work on <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/HPI_API">automatic HTTP API</a> for HPI!

    <p><img src="https://casparwre.de/images/google-godzilla.jpg" alt="'The Google Beast'"></p>

<h2 id="the-beast-that-is-google">The beast that is Google</h2>
<p>There was a time when Google was a small, quirky company with a single product so awesome that it blew away the competition. That time is long gone.</p>

<p>These days Google is a gigantic multinational mega-corp. But that’s understating it a little. Think of Google as a kind of Godzilla that slurps up data about its users at one end and craps out gold ingots at the other. It does both of these at huge scale.</p>

<p>When thinking about Google, there are three things that are not easy to grasp but which are immensely important:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Google is not a search engine, it is not simply a maker of productivity tools. Google is a giant advertising platform.</li>
  <li>Google is spectacularly, awesomely, frighteningly successful as an advertising platform. The gold ingots are coming out at an alarming rate and being used for all kinds of other things.</li>
  <li>Google’s success, the fact that it is so good at what it does, the fact that it is crapping out a mountain of gold ingots, is terrible for us and society.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take a quick tour of these points before getting onto Google Analytics.</p>

<h2 id="google-is-not-a-search-engine">Google is not a search engine</h2>
<p>Google is an advertising platform. Everything it does, all of its products, are geared towards selling advertising. Most of its products are free, many of them are useful, and a few are even great. But they all exist to suck up more data so that it can become even better at selling advertising.</p>

<p>The way Google turns data into gold ingots is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Step 1: Google collects as much data about you as it can.</li>
  <li>Step 2: Google uses this data to get to know you very very well: what you like, what you don’t like, whether you are pregnant, whether you are gay, where your friends live, where you spend your time, what you purchase online.</li>
  <li>Step 3: Google uses its extensive knowledge of you to show you advertising that fits you like a tailor-made suit.</li>
  <li>Step 4: Lots of gold ingots.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a> and it’s certainly not about giving you a great user experience, it’s about making money.</p>

<p>To give just one perfect example of the point I’m making: look at the way that paid search results (i.e. adverts) have become ever harder to identify in Google’s search results.</p>

<p><img src="https://casparwre.de/images/google-evolution.jpg" alt="'Google Ads timeline'"></p>

<p><em><a href="https://searchengineland.com/search-ad-labeling-history-google-bing-254332">Google Ads Timeline compiled by Search Engine Land</a></em></p>

<p>This is not the evolution you expect to see for a company that loves its users. This is what you expect from a mega-corp that wants ever more profits.</p>

<h2 id="google-is-spectacularly-awesomely-frighteningly-successful-as-an-advertising-platform">Google is spectacularly, awesomely, frighteningly successful as an advertising platform</h2>
<p>Many of Google’s products have an absolutely staggering market share. Google has nine products with more than one billion users each. Google Chrome is the most popular web browser with a market share of 64%. Google’s Android is the most popular operating system on mobile devices with a market share of 72%. Google’s products are being used by most internet connected humans on earth.</p>

<p>Combine this with the fact that Google has a monopoly on online advertising. Ok, actually that’s not true. It has a duopoly along  with Facebook. Facebook is guilty of most of the things I mention in this post, and is probably worse, but I’m saving my venom for Facebook for another day.</p>

<p>The result of all this is that Google’s revenue is eye-wateringly massive: around 180 billion USD in 2020, which is around the GDP of New Zealand. Now consider that only four years ago, Google’s revenue was 90 billion USD, which means that the revenue doubled in 4 years. Wow!</p>

<p>This mountain of gold ingots used to flow to newspapers and magazines – but no more. The result has been the decimation of local news and the magazine industry. It is true that  news organizations have been terrible at innovation in the past three decades and now they have been steam-rollered as a result. Why is this bad? Read on.</p>

<h2 id="googles-success-is-not-good-for-us-as-a-society">Google’s success is not good for us as a society</h2>

<p>Google’s success is good for Google and its shareholders. It’s not good for us, the consumers. We live in a world where local news is either stone dead or barely surviving. As we have learned in the past few years, a functioning media is essential to democracy.</p>

<p>So has the market done its magic and filled the gap? Has the creation part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction">creative destruction</a> happened? Do we now have a better and superior solution for local news?</p>

<p>Nope. Online news articles are a hideous cluster-fuck of click-baiting headlines, cookie banners, privacy nightmares and top heavy with advertising and it’s mostly Google’s fault. Producers of news are desperately wringing every last pathetic drop of profit from their content.</p>

<p>Do you know why online recipes now begin with the author’s life story and are an interminable bore until you reach the actual beef? It’s because of Google. It’s because even writers of online recipes are prostrating themselves before the omnipotent online God that is Google.</p>

<p>And that huge growing pile of gold ingots? That’s in itself a problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For many years, the astonishing torrent of money thrown off by Google’s Web-search monopoly has fueled invasions of multiple other segments, enabling Google to bat aside rivals who might have brought better experiences to billions of lives.</p>

  <p>Google Apps and Google Maps are both huge presences in the tech economy. Are they paying for themselves, or are they using search advertising revenue as rocket fuel? Nobody outside Google knows.”  – <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/06/25/Break-Up-Google">Break up Google</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many other nuanced and large problems created by Google’s size and profitability and I’ve only scratched the surface here.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-about-google-analytics">So what about Google Analytics?</h2>
<p>Google is harvesting data across all of its products, so why pick on Google Analytics? Because for most of the products, if you choose to use them, it’s your data that is harvested. It’s different for Analytics. You as a web developer are making a choice that affects all of your users.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google Analytics is the most popular website stats tool. More than 53% of all sites on the web track their visitors using Google Analytics. 84% of sites that do use a known analytics script use Google Analytics. It’s the most popular third-party request on the web. It accounts for 0.64% of all network requests.” – <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics#its-owned-by-google-the-largest-ad-tech-company-in-the-world">Plausible.io blog</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I first began to develop websites, it was a no-brainer to add Google Analytics to anything I created.: “It’s free! It’s good! It’s what everyone uses!”</p>

<p>Actually it’s not that good really:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s a bloated script that affects your site speed</li>
  <li>It’s overkill for the majority of site owners</li>
  <li>It’s a privacy liability and requires an extensive privacy policy</li>
  <li>It worsens the user experience due to the necessity of annoying prompts.</li>
  <li>It’s blocked by many browsers (e.g. Firefox) so the data is not very accurate.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are more reasons. You can read the full list <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics#its-owned-by-google-the-largest-ad-tech-company-in-the-world">here</a>.</p>

<p>Has Google ever revealed what it does with data from Analytics internally? Nope. But we don’t even need to speculate. It seems pretty obvious to me that they’re using it to guzzle up even more data and to crap out ever more gold ingots.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives-to-google-analytics">Alternatives to Google Analytics</h2>
<p>So are there alternatives? Sure, there’s a bunch and some cost money. I think it’s money worth spending.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/onurakpolat/awesome-analytics">Here is a comprehensive and curated list</a> of analytics tools, including privacy focussed analytics.</p>

<p>I use Fathom Analytics for this blog and am switching all of my products to it. To see the analytics for this blog <a href="https://app.usefathom.com/share/folzoonq/casparwre.de">click here</a> (note that is an affiliate link – I will earn some money if you signup, you will get 10 USD off).</p>

<p>I believe it is a moral imperative for web developers to think about the “free” tools they are using to provide their products. In the case of Google Analytics, the tool is only very superficially free. We are all paying the hidden costs.</p>

    <p>If you haven't noticed already I really love plain text so I thought I would find some plain text protocols that are used in different software systems. The Redis Protocol specification states it best by describing its own protocol, but this applies to all of the plain text protocols I will cover.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple to implement.</li>
<li>Fast to parse.</li>
<li>Human readable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next time you are building a software system and have to exchange data start with using a simple plain text protocol and then add in the complexity for optimization later. All of these protocols can be sent as plain text data over a TCP or UDP. They are easily inspected, small, and direct.</p>

<p>Starting off with the simplest one in the list is the Graphite plaintext protocol for delivering metrics into Graphite via Carbon.</p>
<p>The protocol:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;metics_path&gt; &lt;metics_value&gt; &lt;metrics_timestamp&gt;
</code></pre><p>The example:</p>
<pre><code>/cpu_load/core_0 0.08 1599009388
/cpu_load/core_1 0.07 1599009388
/cpu_load/core_2 0.07 1599009388
/cpu_load/core_3 0.05 1599009388
</code></pre><p><a href="https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/feeding-carbon.html#the-plaintext-protocol">Full Specification</a></p>

<p>The next simplest one in the list is the Influx Line Protocol. While this is similar to Graphite it does add some additional metadata to its specification.</p>
<p>The protocol:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;measurement&gt;[,&lt;tag_set&gt;...] &lt;field_set&gt;... &lt;timestamp&gt;
</code></pre><p>The example:</p>
<pre><code>cpu,core=0 load=0.08 1599009388
cpu,core=1 load=0.07 1599009388

<p>Here is where things get more complex, but the same 3 characteristics from above apply still. Simplifying the protocol for the sake of brevity in this article we see that the protocol is a single line of text and the initial command dictates what argument data types are allowed after it.</p>
<p>The protocol:</p>
<pre><code>COMMAND arguments...
</code></pre><p>The example:</p>
<pre><code>GET key1
SET key2 100
HSET hash key1 value1
HGETALL hash
</code></pre><p>There is more to this particular protocol to denote strings, numbers, arrays, etc in a text format which is outlined in the official specification.</p>
<p><a href="https://redis.io/topics/protocol">Full Specification</a></p>

<p>Yes, HTTP is just plain text. Since the protocol itself has lots of permutations of metadata lets just look at some examples of an HTTP request and response.</p>
<p>The request example:</p>
<pre><code>GET /articles/plain-text-protocols/ HTTP/1.1
Host: blainsmith.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
</code></pre><p>The response example:</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 6262
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

&lt;THE HTML OF THIS ARTICLE&gt;
</code></pre><p>Your browser constructs the request when you visit <a href="http://blainsmith.com/articles/plain-text-protocols/">http://blainsmith.com/articles/plain-text-protocols/</a> and parses the response when it comes back from the server. There are a lot more allowable headers, but the basics of this protocol are pretty straightforward.</p>

<p>The world runs on these types of plain text protocol so don't reinvent the wheel if you find yourself building a software system and there is an existing protocol available. If there is an existing plain text protocol that you can adapt to your purposes then do that since there might be a library available already to serialize and deserialize the protocol so you don't have to write your own. If any of these protocols do not fit your needs and you need to write your own then keep it simple. If everyone's web browsers are using HTTP which has worked for decades there is no reason for you to create a complicated protocol unless your can prove the need to otherwise.</p>

February 25, 2021 | https://www.treasuryprime.com/blog/developer-sandbox | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.treasuryprime.com/blog/developer-sandbox">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A safe space to experiment and bring your fintech innovations to life.</p><div><p>Today, we are proud to announce the launch of the <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/">Treasury Prime Developer Sandbox</a>, a space that allows developers to begin using Treasury Prime’s advanced banking services, all in the safety of an enclosed environment, without requiring a connection to a production bank account. And it's free to use, allows immediate access, and is available now. With the launch of the Developer Sandbox, developers can build in a consequence-free environment. When you don’t have to worry about a typo causing a million dollar error, you're set free to experiment, and experimentation leads to innovation.</p><p>Treasury Prime began with a mission to make banking technology more accessible, while providing enough guide rails to keep things safe and secure. We wanted to design an elegant, powerful API that lets developers do what they do best: change the world by creating innovative software solutions. At the same time–having collectively spent decades working in the banking industry–our team knows the substantial value that banks provide. As such, we also strive to empower banks to do what they do best: risk management, security at scale, and providing knowledgeable customer support. So, by helping to match the fintechs inventing the future with the forward-looking banks who are here to support them, Treasury Prime aims to enable a new generation of financial innovation.</p><h3>Features</h3><p>The Developer Sandbox allows you to test all of the Treasury Prime APIs (with a few minor exceptions), so you can build a proof of concept quickly and get to market fast. There is no cost for using this environment, so you are free to build and test as long as you like without worrying about fees or contracts. And when you’re ready to make the jump to production, you just need to swap out your environment URLs and generate some production API keys. You’ll also need to get connected with a bank, which is why we’ve partnered with a growing number of banks to make sure we can help connect almost any fintech with a banking partner.<br></p><p>The Treasury Prime APIs were designed around the principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">REST</a>, and all response bodies are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">JSON</a> encoded, so they should feel familiar to almost anyone who’s worked with APIs before, and be easy to understand for those who are new to the game. So what exactly can you do with Treasury Prime's APIs?</p><ul role="list"><li>Apply to open new bank accounts</li><li>Issue branded debit cards</li><li>Make deposits with remote deposit capture</li><li>Make payments and card transactions&nbsp;</li><li>Fund accounts</li></ul><p>And that’s just to name a few… So, now that you know a bit more about what <em>we</em> do, let's take a look at how <em>you</em> can build the next big fintech innovation!</p><h3>Getting Started</h3><p>In the examples below, we’ll look at how you can transfer funds between two accounts at the same bank using a book transfer, then follow that up by checking the available balance on an account.<br></p><p>If you’d like to follow along, you can <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/" target="_blank">sign up for a free Developer Sandbox account</a> (it’s fast and painless I promise). Once you’ve signed up, you can then log into the Developer Sandbox, and generate a set of API Keys which will be used to authenticate your requests. In our examples these keys are shown as <em>$API_KEY_ID </em>and <em>$API_SECRET_KEY.</em>&nbsp;You'll need to swap these out with Key ID&nbsp;and Secret&nbsp;Key you generate in your sandbox when making requests.<br></p><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> If you’d like more in-depth information on any of our APIs, please see our </em><a href="https://developers.treasuryprime.com/docs" target="_blank"><em>API Reference Documentation</em></a><em>.</em></p><h4>Book Transfer</h4><p>A book transfer is an electronic funds transfer between two accounts at the same bank. In this example we’ll look at how you can transfer funds from a checking account to a savings account.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>A checking and savings account are automatically created in your Developer Sandbox for testing purposes.</em><br></p><p>The first step in creating a book transfer is to obtain the IDs of the accounts you wish to transfer funds between. To accomplish this, make a GET request to the <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/docs#account" target="_blank">account</a> endpoint.</p><div><pre><code>curl -u $API_KEY_ID:$API_SECRET_KEY https://api.treasuryprime.com/account
</code></pre></div><p>This will return a list of <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/docs#account" target="_blank">Account</a> objects. In order to make a book transfer, you will need the account ID for both the sending and receiving accounts, which are stored in the<em> '</em>id' property of each account object.</p><div><pre><code>{
    "data": [{
        "account_type": "savings",
        "bank_id": "bank_treasuryprime",

        "currency": null,
        "routing_number": "000000000",
        "account_number": "123000012345",

        "userdata": null
    }, {
        "account_type": "checking",
        "bank_id": "bank_treasuryprime",
        "updated_at": "2021-02-01T16:32:34Z",

        "userdata": null
    }],
    "total_estimated": 10
}
</code></pre></div><p>After obtaining the IDs of the accounts you wish to transfer funds between, you have all the necessary information required to issue a book transfer. To accomplish this, make a POST request to the <a href="https://developers.treasuryprime.com/docs#book" target="_blank">book</a> endpoint, passing the 'amount' of the transfer, as well as the 'from_account_id' and the 'to_account_id' (representing the funding account and receiving account respectively).<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>You will need to replace the 'from_account_id' and 'to_account_id' values with those from your own account.</em></p><div><pre><code>curl -u $API_KEY_ID:$API_SECRET_KEY https://api.treasuryprime.com/book \\
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
    -d '{
          "amount": "100.00",
          "from_account_id": "acct_1234567890",
          "to_account_id": "acct_0987654321"
        }'
</code></pre></div><p>A successful response will return a <a href="https://developers.treasuryprime.com/docs#book" target="_blank">Book Transfer</a> object. Note that the status of this request is currently set to "pending". You can register <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/docs#webhooks" target="_blank">webhooks</a> to notify you when the transfer is complete, but that is a bit beyond the scope of this example.<br></p><div><pre><code>{
  "amount": "100.00",
  "created_at": "2017-11-02T11:55:14Z",

  "userdata": null
}
</code></pre></div><p>Congratulations, you’ve just made your first book transfer! Next let’s quickly check the account balance of the receiving account.</p><h4>Check Account Balance</h4><p>To check the available balance on an account, make a request to the <a href="https://developers.treasuryprime.com/docs#account" target="_blank">account</a> endpoint including the ID of the account you provided for the 'to_account_id' above.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>You will need to replace the :id below with the account ID of one of the accounts in your developer sandbox (you can use the same account ID provided for the 'to_account_id' value above, or any other account of your choosing).</em><br></p><div><pre><code>curl -u "$API_KEY_ID:$API_SECRET_KEY" https://api.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/account/:id
</code></pre></div><p>The response data includes a lot of information about the account, including the 'available_balance' which shows the amount of money in the account that is immediately available for transactions.<br></p><div><pre><code>{
  "address": {
    "street_line_1": "123 Kearny St",
    "street_line_2": null,
    "city": "San Francisco",

  "created_at": "2021-01-28T14:47:11Z",
  "userdata": null
}
</code></pre></div><h3>Recap</h3><p>Great work! In a matter of minutes, you’ve been able to transfer funds between two bank accounts, and check the available balance of an account. Banking can seem intimidating to work with at first, but–as you’ve hopefully now discovered–it doesn’t have to be. We’ve worked hard to make working with financial services as fast and easy as possible, all so you can share your next great innovation with the world.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We truly believe that fintechs have the opportunity to change the way that finance works and empower every person to take control of their financial future. And by working with the right banking partner, you’ll have the backing of a team who can help you avoid any roadblocks and ensure your solution scales in a safe and secure way.<br></p><p>If you’ve made it this far and still haven’t <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/">signed up</a> for a Developer Sandbox account, what are you waiting for?&nbsp; You could build your proof of concept in the next few days, and have a product ready to hit the market in a matter of weeks. We can’t wait to see what you build!<br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When it comes to mining centralization, the big concern that people have is a “51% attack” —&nbsp; where a single actor or group controls a majority of Bitcoin’s mining power and can effectively decide which transactions (if any) get confirmed in the blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides just disrupting or censoring the confirmation of new transactions, a 51% attack can also be used for a <em>double spend</em>. This means that the attacker mines a different version of the blockchain in secret so that they can spend some coins on the public chain and then later mute the transaction by publishing their version of the blockchain in which they retain ownership of the coins. Another name for this is a blockchain reorganization because it replaces the most recent blocks in the chain.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, there have been no successful 51% attacks on Bitcoin in its history, but we have seen successful attacks on other coins like <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/ethereum-classic-etc-is-currently-being-51-attacked-33be13ce32de">Ethereum Classic</a>. <strong>If successful, such an attack would likely cause significant harm to Bitcoin’s reputation.</strong></p><h2>Measuring 1-Hour Cost of a 51% Attack</h2><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5ff87059f5e95d17a5a0a826_SvpEcuX1WYEhxLGTMVanrolfdB6b6bn9BvePdjV9gXpUswxB4G8W9KSNpjVoCQV0rRrkOJL01VZYoxCePo0ig9gTT35_oNst_kTVXdCFNtwbD-NDZI9bxFlgpgsGNl_KpfteRqs.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Source: Crypto51.app</em></figcaption></figure><p>There’s a cool website called <a href="https://www.crypto51.app/">Crypto51</a> which measures the cost to 51% attack Bitcoin and other major proof of work cryptocurrencies. If you go to the About page, it describes how the <em>1h Attack Cost</em> is calculated using the current market price (aka <em>spot price</em>) for hashrate from NiceHash (NH), a hashrate exchange that allows people to buy hashpower from miners and control what it’s used for. For non-miners, the significance of this may not be clear, so let’s explain it.</p><p>Supposing that a certain blockchain has a total network hashrate of 100 TH/s, then the cost of a 1-hour 51% attack is the cost of controlling more than 50 TH/s of the hashrate. <strong>If a majority of the hashrate is available on a hashrate exchange, then the 1-hour attack cost is simply the cost of purchasing that hashrate from the market for 1 hour.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>On Crypto51, the portion of a given cryptocurrency’s hashrate that’s available for purchase is represented by the <em>NiceHash-able</em> metric on the right side of the image above. A NH-able value below 100% means that less than 51% of the coin’s hashrate can be bought.</p><p><strong>For Bitcoin, the NH-able value is under 1%</strong>, and other hashrate exchanges do not add much to the value. In other words, the 1h Attack Cost is calculated based on the <em>spot</em> <em>price</em> for SHA-256 hashrate, but the volume of SHA-256 hashrate available on the market is not nearly large enough to make it a viable way to actually attack Bitcoin.</p><p>Since the value on Crypto51 isn’t realistic for Bitcoin, let’s dive into more detail about the <strong>different methods that could be used to 51% attack Bitcoin, how feasible they are, and what can be done to mitigate them.</strong> By the end, you’ll better understand the security provided by Bitcoin’s proof of work system.</p><h2>Bitcoin Cloud Mining and Hashrate Exchanges</h2><p>For most people, it will never be profitable to mine Bitcoin. This is because competitive electricity prices are typically only found in locations with energy production (e.g. hydroelectric dams, natural gas wells, etc.), not on an urban energy grid.</p><p>However, for people who want to speculate on <a href="https://insights.braiins.com/profitability-calculator">mining profitability</a>, cloud mining offers a way to do so. Cloud mining contracts enable people to “mine” cryptocurrencies without owning the physical hardware themselves. In other words, buyers purchase a specific amount of hashrate for a specific time period and price, then earn the mining rewards produced by that hashrate. Meanwhile, the miners still operate the mining equipment, but they get paid via the cloud mining contracts or hashrate market rather than the mining rewards.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5ff8705975e8eb045ae2acfd_luPmOaLr5shJUFvumj0DDWQqEqEcFVi8QUeHbywHDY1DwkFLD4qRAgnY8YOY-SFak3QOPoDoESLSh6Tw6nqWqrFvh8h3nRKU6LBIFgZIhzk5b4CBXwlIV3SrirEvxsCsURNcKeg.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Hypothetical example of cloud mining contracts</figcaption></figure><p>In order to make a clear distinction, from now on we will refer to hashrate sold on an exchange or via cloud mining contracts as <strong><em>synthetic hashrate</em></strong>, and hashrate used to mine directly as <strong><em>physical hashrate</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>So, what does this have to do with Bitcoin’s security?</p><p><strong>Well, if a malicious actor wanted to attack a cryptocurrency network, it would be far simpler to purchase synthetic hashrate than to produce physical hashrate. </strong>However, there’s not nearly enough hashpower on hashrate exchanges to consider them as an attack vector against Bitcoin.</p><p>That being the case, let’s talk about the other possible attack methods.</p><h2>The Cost of a 51% Attack with Physical Hashrate</h2><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5ff870592075d921f98c3937_Z0p_QkL9w9mZtEPkLUGmYBsLrlfvpdhdZrnHXPwQsz_jpEHdRu3Y1uoeK_7QtRTcVzNYA_R-3ZqW8B_g2uJ_B983Z3vcieFdQSAKsKDTKueXhECHqxhFDyjLP3ZZGNIrN9JipHE.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>With hashrate exchanges not being viable for accessing 51% of network hashrate, there are only two realistic attack vectors left:&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li>Amassing enough ASICs (mining hardware) and power capacity to attack the network with physical hashrate</li><li>Controlling mining pools who have a combined majority of the synthetic hashrate</li></ul><p>Let’s start by analyzing the first case. <strong><em>How much would it cost to 51% attack Bitcoin with physical hashrate?</em></strong></p><p>With the current total network hashrate of 150 EH/s, we’ll calculate a rough estimate of the costs necessary to set up 150 EH/s worth of ASICs (assuming the miners with the existing 150 EH/s remain honest and don’t contribute to the attack). In the most favorable case where all hashrate is produced by an equivalent machine to the highest efficiency ASIC on the market today, the Antminer S19 Pro, then the specifications per ASIC would be <em>110 TH/s</em> and <em>3250 W</em> consumption.</p><p>150,000,000 TH/s / 110 TH/s = approximately <strong>1.364M ASICs needed to amass 150 EH/s.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>With a per-unit consumption of 3250 W, that would put the<strong> electricity capacity needed to power all those ASICs at ~4.4 GW of power</strong>. That limits the possible candidates to pull off such a huge endeavor to powerful nation states who would work in coordination with large energy producers.&nbsp;</p><p>And how much would those 1.364M ASICs cost the taxpayers of such a nation state? Well, at a conservative unit price of $4000 each including power supply units, the <strong>cost of hardware would exceed $5.46 billion</strong>. Factoring in all the R&amp;D costs to catch up to existing hardware manufacturers (who are already <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/secondary-markets-asic-bitcoin-mining-manufacturing-delays">sold out</a> until May 2021), plus all the other data center equipment needed, the true cost would likely be far higher.</p><p>In the grand scheme, this may still be a small sum to the likes of the USA or China. However, it doesn’t account for significant obstacles such as the limited capacity of chip manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC to actually produce these high quality hashing chips. (Not to mention the lunacy of a government using that semiconductor manufacturing capacity to build ASICs and attack Bitcoin rather than any number of other <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/cn/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/deloitte-cn-tmt-semiconductors-the-next-wave-en-190422.pdf">valuable applications</a>.)&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In TSMC's 2018 annual report, the company produced 10,436 products for 481 customers. They have limited manufacturing space at their facilities and have to account for massive customers outside of the bitcoin mining space, including Sony, Qualcom, Broadcom, and, famously, Apple.</p>— Amanda Fabiano (@_amanda_fab) <a href="https://twitter.com/_amanda_fab/status/1338190445717770240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2020</a></blockquote> </div><p>‍<strong>Ultimately, attempting to destroy trust in Bitcoin through a mining attack with physical hashrate just doesn’t make sense anymore, and it hasn’t for years. </strong>Nation states who view Bitcoin as a threat are far more likely to over-regulate or (try to) ban its use than to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on mining hardware and power.</p><p>Still, that doesn’t mean that 51% attacks are completely impossible. Let’s now turn our attention back to synthetic hashrate. This time, instead of talking about hashrate exchanges and cloud mining, we’ll discuss mining pools.</p><h2>Synthetic Hashrate and China Mining Centralization&nbsp;</h2><p>Bitcoin mining pool centralization has been a near-constant source of FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) for years. However, it's usually misrepresented. <strong>Mining pool operators have long-term stakes in the Bitcoin network and just as little incentive to attempt an attack as miners themselves.</strong></p><p>You can read an explanation of why hashrate concentration is not a huge cause for concern in this <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/no-concentration-among-miners-isnt-going-to-break-bitcoin">Coindesk article</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>A more interesting case to think about is if the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) were to try taking over several mining pool operations. Currently, ~97% of Bitcoin’s total network hashrate goes through Chinese pools.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5ffc51f0aa5822321d9217ea_hashrate-distribution-jan11.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Bitcoin hashrate distribution chart; source:&nbsp;coin.dance</figcaption></figure><p>It’s extremely unlikely that the CCP will attempt any attack. Nonetheless, we’ll consider the possibility for a simple reason: attacking with physical hashrate would cost at least $5 billion, whereas attacking with synthetic hashrate by taking over several pools would be essentially FREE.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there’s a problem with this attack too: <strong>miners can switch pools in a matter of seconds. </strong>If the CCP were to attempt taking over the 4+ largest pools, they would have to hope that no miners switch to other pools so that they can sustain the attack for more than a few pointless minutes.</p><p>The less concentrated hashrate is in a few mining pools, the more difficult it would be to attempt a pool attack. However, mining pools are necessary for most miners today to stabilize their revenue, and concentration in a few pools is unavoidable.</p><p><strong>Therefore, one good way to increase the difficulty of a mining pool attack is to make it impossible to do covertly.</strong> In other words, the attack causes more damage the longer it is sustained, so it can be mitigated by ensuring that some miners would detect it within minutes and switch pools.&nbsp;</p><h2>Blockchain Reorganizations</h2><p>Every block in the blockchain references the block before it with a value in the block header called the <em>prevhash</em>. With Stratum V2, miners will be able to construct blocks themselves with data from their own nodes (a process called <em>Job Negotiation</em>), so if they are honest they’ll always reference the prevhash of the most recent block in the chain.&nbsp;</p><p>By taking block construction out of the pools’ hands, Stratum V2 can help miners ensure that they won’t contribute to secretly mining a “shadow” chain that gets broadcasted later in a blockchain reorganization attack. Similarly, they can ensure that their hashrate is not used to mine a different SHA-256 chain, such as Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin SV.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5ff8705a486828862383eaa0_1g3TGyPQbP_BtqcKtlydb-K4BvCluBo-ERty8nsQt7EkRnQuBPnw_kNZHhD15uKhfV9asWCtr2qtL1DJqDDHKwup-j3RA59wbPq_VXS_kxgi4N9EQ9pW7rRvi37JH4XOcx4Liks.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The chain with the largest block height is considered valid, so mining a longer chain in …</figcaption></figure></div></div>

			<p><span>I</span>n the past quarter century, enrollment in college English departments has sunk like the Pequod in <i>Moby Dick</i>. Meanwhile enrollment in science programs has skyrocketed. It’s understandable. Elon Musk, not Herman Melville, is the role model of the digital economy. But it doesn’t have to be that way, says Angus Fletcher, 44, an English professor at Ohio State University. Fletcher is part of “group of renegades,” he says, who are on a mission to plug literature back into the electric heart of contemporary life and culture. Fletcher has a plan—“apply science and engineering to literature”—and a syllabus, <i>Wonderworks: The 25 Most Powerful Inventions in the History of Literature</i>, his new book.</p><p>Before the England-born Fletcher got his Ph.D. in literature at Yale, he earned an undergraduate degree in neuroscience, followed by a four-year stint in a neurophysiology lab at the University of Michigan. He switched careers when he realized the biology of the brain wouldn’t take him far enough toward understanding our need for stories. “What’s special about the human brain is its power of storytelling,” Fletcher says. “Its power of narrative. Its power to invent futures and tell our past. So, I thought, ‘I’ll go to an English department and learn about narrative.’” Fletcher sees the human brain as mechanical, but insists it doesn’t operate like a computer. He spelled out his view for <i>Nautilus</i> readers in “<a href="https://nautil.us/issue/95/escape/why-computers-will-never-write-good-novels" target="_blank">Why Computers Will Never Write Good Novels</a>.”&nbsp;(The essay generated a lot of discussion. See Fletcher’s response below.)</p> <p><i>Wonderworks</i> consists of 25 chapters that delve into works from the <i>Iliad</i> to <i>Emma</i>, <i>In Search of Lost Time</i> to <i>My Brilliant Friend</i>, each representative of a particular “invention” to lighten sorrow or grief or create empathy or joy. “Each of these inventions had a unique purpose, engineered with its own intricate circuitry to click into our psyche in a different way,” Fletcher writes. <i>Wonderworks</i> is captivating, as is Fletcher, who speaks with infectious enthusiasm and clarity. I began our conversation on Zoom with a question about the difference between the human brain and a computer, the subject of his <i>Nautilus</i> article, and then turned to his provocative view that to save the humanities, literature must be taught as a science.</p><figure data-alt="Berger_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18197_cea7785b31f6a028bfa54af07d6f79ce.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>STORY SCIENTIST:</strong> Angus Fletcher once worked in a neuroscience lab. “But I had this conversion moment where I thought, ‘By studying the synapse, it’s just too small to answer the big questions about narrative and life,’” he says. So he said goodbye to the lab and became a professor of English at Ohio State University, where he teaches “story science.”</span><span>Sarah Lagrotteria</span></figcaption></figure><p><b>Is a big part of the difference between human brains and computers the fact that computers lack consciousness?</b><br></p><p>No. I’m making a completely mechanical argument for novels, literature, and narrative. Consciousness is like the existence of the 913th dimension. It may exist. It’s not up to me to say that it doesn’t exist. But I can tell you right now, no human is ever going to establish a definitive proof one way or the other. That’s because it’s a metaphysical problem. Humans exist in a physical space. The reason science and engineering have advanced is because we bracketed the problem of consciousness as something unanswerable. So it’s possible that computers are conscious. It’s possible that they’re not. That’s something I don’t think anyone can answer.</p><p><b>How did science advance because the problem of consciousness is unanswerable?</b></p><p>Let me say it this way. We can get everything we want in the world without understanding where consciousness comes from. So why are we pouring all this energy into it? The only reason for doing it is because people have a religious spiritual impulse. It’s like chasing God. We know where that got the monks in the Middle Ages.</p><p><b>Where did that get the monks?</b></p><p>It didn’t get them to invent the laws of thermodynamics or invent computers or discover evolution by natural selection. It got them into a lot of arguments. I think humans enjoy having arguments about irresolvable problems. It gives us something to do. What’s the best baseball team? What’s the source of consciousness? But other than as a ludic pastime, consciousness is not something that I think anyone would seriously investigate scientifically.</p><blockquote><p>Pragmatism isn’t the enemy of beauty. Pragmatism allows beauty to happen.</p> </blockquote><p><b>Are you saying the study of metaphysics did not lead to developments in science?</b><br></p><p>That’s exactly right. That’s the narrative I would tell. In the Middle Ages, people were obsessed with the questions, “Who is God? What does God want?” But we discovered over time, starting with Machiavelli and moving into Francis Bacon and the 19th- and 20th-century scientific revolutions, that the human brain can’t answer those questions. That’s because the human brain has evolved to practice science. Science is about making hypotheses and testing them in our physical world. It’s not about reaching the metaphysical. And literature is the origin of the modern scientific method.</p><p><b>Why do you call literature a technology?</b></p><p>A technology is any human-made thing that solves a problem. Most of our technology exists to master our world, to domesticate space. That’s why we have smartphones and smart homes and satellites. Literature tackles the opposite set of problems: not how to master the nonhuman world but how to master ourselves. It wrestles with the psychological problems inside us. Grief, lack of meaning, loneliness—literature was invented to deal with these problems. To have happy and democratic societies, effective engineers and scientists, we need people who are joyful, not angry, who have a deep sense of empathy and purpose, who have an ability for logic and problem-solving. You get all these things from literature.</p><p><b>When you call literature a technology, it sounds like you’re saying literature’s a machine.</b></p><p>I <i>am</i> saying it’s a machine! It’s a machine designed to work in concert with another machine, our brain. The purpose of the two machines is to accelerate each other. Literature is a way of accelerating human imagination. And human imaginations accelerate literature. This technology is just sitting on our bookshelves and almost none of us are using it. Students now flee literature departments for the sciences and engineering.</p><p><b>That makes the act of imagination sound so mechanical, don’t you think?</b></p><p>In one regard, narrative is a mechanical act. It doesn’t require imagination. It doesn’t require free will. It’s possible humans have no imagination and no free will. Yet we can still write novels and poetry because the fundamental constituent of those things is narrative. Now, the reason that people sometimes think that narrative is creative or imaginative is because narrative is not logical. It exists in the hypothetical, the counterfactual, the speculative. You can never write a true or a false novel. All you can write is a fictional novel. That’s why we might think of it as being imaginative. In the same way, we might think of anything that an engineer creates as being imaginative. But what we’re really saying is the novel is outside the realm of the logical. It’s in a different machine space, the machine space of narrative.</p><div>

</div><p><b>In the past 20 years, enrollment in English departments has dropped by 25 percent, while enrollment in STEM classes has doubled. Why is that?</b></p><p>I can tell you exactly why that is. English literature is not being taught in a way that is connecting with people. We’ve been taught in school to interpret literature, to say what it means, to identify its themes and arguments. But when you do that, you’re working against literature. I’m saying we need to find these technologies, these inventions, and connect them to your head, see what they can do for your brain. Literature isn’t about telling you what’s right or wrong or about giving you ideas. It’s about helping you troubleshoot your own head.</p><p><b>The chapters in <i>Wonderworks</i> include fun names for the inventions of literature. The names include “Almighty Heart,” “Serenity Elevator,” “Sorrow Resolver,” “Virtual Scientist.” How did literature invent the virtual scientist?</b></p><p>A virtual scientist has no ego. Our brains are born scientists. From the moment we’re born, we make hypotheses about what will happen if we do something. Then we test those hypotheses. We might say, “If I stick my hand in the fire, it might burn.” And then we stick our hand in the fire. We’re like, “Yes, that did burn.” We’re constantly running these experiments in our lives. We build stories and narratives as a way of organizing them. But what holds us back as scientists is our egos. That’s because we just don’t like to think we’re wrong. Present someone with a piece of data that contradicts what they think and they will deny your data. They will bend your data to fit their hypothesis. This is an endemic psychological process of the human mind.</p><p>So the question is, “How do we become better scientists?” The way to do that is to remove our ego. Literature provides us the space to do that. What is Sherlock Holmes doing? Sherlock Holmes has given us a problem that we need to solve experimentally by positing hypotheses, by testing them. But we’re not Sherlock Holmes and so it’s not embarrassing if we happen to be wrong. Sherlock Holmes and tons of great detective fiction allow us to play virtual scientists by going into a space where our ego doesn’t exist and we can practice our scientific method of making predictions and testing them.</p><blockquote><p>Most of our technology exists to domesticate space. Literature tackles the opposite: how to master ourselves.</p> </blockquote><p><b>I will say, Angus, <i>Wonderworks</i> made me a little anxious. I’m sure you know Auden’s lines from “In …</b></p></div></div>

			<p><span>S</span>uppose aliens existed, and imagine that some of them had been watching our planet for its entire four and a half billion years. What would they have seen? Over most of that vast timespan, Earth’s appearance altered slowly and gradually. Continents drifted; ice cover waxed and waned; successive species emerged, evolved, with many of them becoming extinct.</p><p>But in just a tiny sliver of Earth’s history—the last hundred centuries—the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before. This signaled the start of agriculture—and later urbanization. The changes accelerated as the human population increased.</p><p>Then came even faster changes. Within just a century, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere began to rise dangerously fast. Radio emissions that couldn’t be explained by natural processes appeared and something else unprecedented happened: Rockets launched from the planet’s surface escaped the biosphere completely. Some spacecraft were propelled into orbits around the Earth; others journeyed to the moon, Mars, Jupiter, and even Pluto.</p><p>If those hypothetical aliens continued to keep watch, what would they witness in the next century? Will a final spasm of activity be followed by silence due to climate change? Or will the planet’s ecology stabilize? Will there be massive terraforming? Will an armada of spacecraft launched from Earth spawn new oases of life elsewhere?</p><figure data-alt="Livio_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18198_9769c201b88f46a83dabfc1b9f97a033.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>LASER POWER:</strong> A crucial impediment to space flight is the inefficiency of chemical fuel. One day a laser power station, located on Earth, might generate a beam to “push” a craft through space.</span><span>NASA / Pat Rawlings (SAIC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let’s think specifically about the future of space exploration. Successful missions such as Viking, Cassini, New Horizons, Juno, and Rosetta were all done with last-century technology. We can realistically expect that during this century, the entire solar system—planets, moons, and asteroids—will be explored by flotillas of robotic craft.<br></p><p>Will there still be a role for humans in crewed spacecraft?</p><p>There’s no denying that NASA’s new Perseverance rover speeding across the Jezero crater on Mars may miss some startling discoveries that no human geologist could reasonably overlook. But machine learning is advancing fast, as is sensor technology. In contrast, the cost gap between crewed and autonomous missions remains huge.</p><p>We believe the future of crewed spaceflight lies with privately funded adventurers like SpaceX and Blue Origin, prepared to participate in a cut-price program far riskier than western nations could impose on publicly supported projects. These ventures—bringing a Silicon-Valley-type culture into a domain long-dominated by NASA and a few aerospace conglomerates—have innovated and improved rocketry far faster than NASA or the European Space Agency have done. The future role of the national agencies will be attenuated—becoming more akin to an airport rather than to an airline.</p><blockquote><p>We are near the end of Darwinian evolution, but technological evolution of intelligent beings is just beginning.</p> </blockquote><p>We would argue that inspirationally led private companies should front all missions involving humans as cut-price high-risk ventures. There would still be many volunteers—a few perhaps even accepting one-way tickets—driven by the same motives as early explorers and mountaineers. The phrase “space tourism” should be avoided. It lulls people into believing such ventures are routine and low-risk. If that’s the perception, the inevitable accidents will be as traumatic as those of the space shuttle were. These exploits must be sold as dangerous, extreme sports, or intrepid exploration.<br></p><p>The most crucial impediment to space flight stems from the intrinsic inefficiency of chemical fuel, and the requirement to carry a weight of fuel far exceeding that of the payload. So long as we are dependent on chemical fuels, interplanetary travel will remain a challenge. Nuclear power could be transformative. Allowing much higher in-course speeds would drastically cut the transit times in the solar system, reducing not only astronauts’ boredom, but their exposure to damaging radiation. It’s more efficient if the fuel supply can be on the ground; for instance, propelling spacecraft into orbit via a “space elevator”—and then using a “star-shot”-type laser beam generated on Earth to push on a “sail” attached to the spacecraft.</p><p>By 2100, thrill seekers in the mold of Felix Baumgartner (the Austrian skydiver who in 2012 broke the sound barrier in free fall from a high-altitude balloon) may have established bases on Mars, or maybe even on asteroids. Elon Musk has said he wants to die on Mars—“but not on impact.” It’s a realistic goal, and an alluring one to some.</p><p>But don’t expect mass emigration from Earth. It’s a dangerous delusion to think that space offers an escape from Earth’s problems. We’ve got to solve those here. Coping with climate change or the COVID-19 pandemic may seem daunting, but it’s a piece of cake compared to terraforming Mars. There’s no place in our solar system that offers an environment even as clement as the Antarctic or the top of Mount Everest. Simply put, there’s no Planet B for ordinary risk-averse people.</p><p>Still, we (and our progeny here on Earth) should cheer on the brave space adventurers. They have a pivotal role to play in spearheading the post-human future and determining what happens in the 22nd century and beyond.</p><p><span>P</span>ioneer explorers will be ill-adapted to their new habitat, so they will have a compelling incentive to re-design themselves. They’ll harness the super-powerful genetic and cyborg technologies that will be developed in coming decades. This might be the first step toward divergence into a new species.</p><p>Organic creatures need a planetary surface environment on which life could emerge and evolve. But if post-humans make the transition to fully inorganic intelligence, they won’t need an atmosphere. They may even prefer zero-gravity, especially for constructing massive artifacts. It’s in deep space that non-biological brains may develop powers that humans can’t even imagine.</p><p>There are chemical and metabolic limits to the size and processing power of organic brains. Maybe we are close to these limits already. But no such limits apply to or constrain electronic computers (still less, perhaps, quantum computers). So, by any definition of “thinking,” the amount and intensity that can be achieved by organic human-type brains will be swamped by the cerebrations of AI.</p><p>We are perhaps near the end of Darwinian evolution, but technological evolution of intelligent beings is only just beginning. It may happen fastest away from Earth—we wouldn’t expect (and certainly wouldn’t wish for) such rapid changes in humanity here on the Earth, though our survival may depend on ensuring the AI on Earth remains “benevolent.”</p><figure data-alt=" Livio_BREAKER-3"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18200_33ec1f50197cc4f74b3e8dc359ec3280.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>SPACE TOURISM:</strong> Private space companies should avoid the phrase “space tourism,” write Martin Ress and Mario Livio. It lulls people into believing such ventures are routine and low-risk. They’re more like extreme sports.</span><span>NASA / Jet Propulsion Laboratory</span></figcaption></figure><p>Few doubt machines will gradually surpass or enhance more and more of our distinctively human capabilities. Disagreements are only about the timescale on which this will happen. Inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil says it will be just a matter of a few decades. More cautious scientists envisage centuries. Either way, the timescales for technological advances are an instant compared to the timescales of the Darwinian evolution that led to humanity’s emergence—and more relevantly, less than a millionth of the vast expanses of cosmic time ahead. The products of future technological evolution could surpass humans by as much as we have surpassed slime mold.<br></p><p>But, you may wonder, what about consciousness?</p><p>Philosophers and computer scientists debate whether consciousness is something that characterizes only the type of wet, organic brains possessed by humans, apes, and dogs. Would electronic intelligences, even if their intellects would seem superhuman, lack self-awareness? The ability to imagine things that do not exist? An inner life? Or is consciousness an emergent property that any sufficiently complex network will eventually possess? Some say it’s irrelevant and semantic, like asking whether submarines can swim.</p><blockquote><p>Extraterrestrial civilization might consist of a swarm of microscopic probes that could have evaded notice.</p> </blockquote><p>We don’t think it is. If the machines are what computer scientists refer to as “zombies,” we would not accord their experiences the same value as ours, and the post-human future would seem rather bleak. On the other hand, if they are conscious, we should welcome the prospect of their future hegemony.<br></p><p>What will their guiding motivation be if they become fully autonomous entities? We have to admit we have absolutely no idea. Think of the variety of bizarre motives (ideological, financial, political, egotistical, and religious) that have driven human endeavors in the past. Here’s one simple example of how different they could be from our naive expectations: They could be contemplative. Even less obtrusively, they may realize it’s easier to think at low temperatures, therefore getting far away from any star, or even hibernating for billions of years until the cosmic microwave background cooled down far below its current 3 degrees Kelvin. At the other edge of the spectrum, they could be expansionist, which seems to be the expectation of most who’ve thought about the future trajectory of civilizations.</p><p>Even if life had originated only on Earth, it need not remain a marginal, trivial feature of the cosmos. Humans could jump-start a diaspora whereby ever-more complex intelligence spreads through the galaxy, transcending our limitations. The “sphere of influence” (or some would envisage a “frontier of conquest”) could encompass the entire galaxy, spreading via self-reproducing machines, transmitting DNA or instructions for 3-D printers. The leap to neighboring stars is just an early step …</p></div></div>

When running processes on Unix systems,
it is important that every process be waited-on by its parent process.
<p>
Processes (such as "daemons") should not be run in "the background",
orphaned and reparented to init,
such that nothing will be notified if they exit.
</p><p>
Instead, they should be run under some other program, perhaps a process supervisor, which will wait on them;
much has been
<a href="https://jdebp.uk/FGA/unix-daemon-design-mistakes-to-avoid.html">written about</a>
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/daemon.html">this before.</a>
</p><p>
This is absolutely true and correct,
and any system that is starting up processes in "the background" and just letting them leak
is fundamentally flawed and must be fixed;
and a dedicated process supervisor, running as a daemon, is a good way to approach fixing such problems.
</p><p>
But ultimately, the dedicated process supervisor daemon isn't necessary.
</p><p>
Starting and waiting on child processes is something any Unix program can do.
There's no need for a specialized process supervision daemon.
</p><p>
If I have a collection of processes which together provide some functionality or application,
it's natural for me to start those processes as my own child processes,
and then wait on them and implement my own failure-handling policies
based on the domain-specific information that I have about their behavior.
</p><p>
With this approach,
I start the child processes that are relevant to me and then <em>keep running</em>,
waiting on those child processes and performing any maintenance tasks necessary (such as restarting failed processes).
</p><p>
This is a naturally recursive structure,
where a given process might spawn more child processes to perform its task,
each of which might in turn spawn still more child processes.
</p><p>
This recursive structure ultimately bottoms out at the init process - systemd or something else.
</p><p>
With systemd, a weak form of this recursive structure is always the case:
The "system instance" of systemd (which is the init process)
starts and waits on a "user instance" of systemd for each interactive user;
the user instance in turn runs and waits on various user processes, such as a desktop environment.
</p><p>
But systemd only allows for two levels of recursion: system, then user.
There's no way to start a systemd instance that just manages a single user application,
with a lifecycle tied to that single application.
</p><p>
The best way to achieve further such recursion is to simply write a regular Unix program
which just starts its own child processes and waits on them.
</p><p>
Indeed, this is already how most applications which run child processes work.
They don't delegate the core Unix primitive of "fork and exec" to some system service;
they simply perform it themselves.
</p><p>
Many designs are much easier when starting one's own child processes.
If I want to connect two processes with a socketpair,
the simple and obvious way is to create the socketpair, then start the two processes,
so that they inherit the file descriptors.
If I want to start some processes in the same set of namespaces,
similarly the easiest way is to just enter those namespaces and then start the processes.
And, of course, if I want to handle process failure with more intelligence than "restart it 5 times",
it's easy to implement that logic in a general purpose programming language.
</p><p>
Delegating this basic functionality to a separate service like systemd provides little benefit,
if one is careful to monitor one's own child processes.
</p><p>
With modern programming languages and <a href="https://github.com/catern/rsyscall">libraries</a>,
it's easier than ever to write Unix programs which start and wait on collections of processes.
</p><p>
When building your next multi-process system,
consider starting and monitoring processes directly,
instead of using a process supervisor.
</p><p>
It can make sophisticated designs much easier,
and also combines well with <a href="http://catern.com/distsys.html">richly typed designs</a>.

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="programrejectedformentalhealthreasons">PROGRAM REJECTED FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS</h2>
<p>In 1972, two students learning FORTRAN came up with a fantastic new programming language called INTERCAL.  INTERCAL is a bit unusual. For example, single quotes are called <em>sparks</em>, and double quotes are called <em>rabbit ears</em>, less than (&lt;) is an <em>angle</em>, and a dash (-) is a <em>worm</em>.  This makes the manual read like a word puzzle combined with an extended in-joke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One final comment about sparks and rabbit-ears; if the next character in the program is a spot, as often happens because onespot variables are common choices for operands, a spark and the following spot can be combined into a wow (!). - <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ick.htm">INTERCAL Manual</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The compiler errors are where the authors got genuinely creative. Errors include <code>VARIABLES MAY NOT BE STORED IN WEST HYPERSPACE</code> for accessing an array incorrectly, <code>IT CAME FROM BEYOND SPACE</code> for invalid control flow, <code>PROGRAM REJECTED FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS</code> for threading issues, <code>I HAVE NO FILE AND I MUST SCREAM</code> for file not found, and <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ick.htm#Errors">many many more</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a parody language, and reading the manual, you get the sense that no one has yet had as much fun writing technical documentation as Lyon and Woods did writing this.</p>
<p>The language itself looks less fun.  Here is <a href="http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Intercal">Hello World</a>:</p>
<pre><code>       NOTE THIS IS INTERCAL
       PLEASE ,1 &lt;- #5
       DO ,1 SUB #1 &lt;- #54
       DO ,1 SUB #2 &lt;- #192
       DO ,1 SUB #3 &lt;- #136
       PLEASE ,1 SUB #4 &lt;- #208
       DO ,1 SUB #5 &lt;- #98
       DO COME FROM (1)
       DO READ OUT ,1
(2)    DO ,1 SUB #1 &lt;- #134
(1)    PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM (2)
</code></pre>
<p>One of the exciting innovations of INTERCAL is the <code>COMEFROM</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM#Examples">instruction</a>, seen here in a variant of BASIC.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>10 COMEFROM 40
20 INPUT "WHAT IS YOUR NAME? "; A$
30 PRINT "HELLO, "; A$
40 REM
</code></pre>
<p>A <code>COMEFROM</code> anywhere in a program can grab control flow from the line you are reading. And in some implementations, if many <code>COMEFROM</code>'s reference the same line, execution splits off in each direction.</p>
<p>A <code>COMEFROM</code> is the inverse of a <code>GOTO</code> statement with multi-threading thrown in. It breaks the mental model of imperative execution where each line's evaluation leads to the next line. The idea that you can simulate its execution in your head, line by line, is fundamental to imperative programming and <code>COMEFROM</code> attempts to break that model.</p>
<h2 id="variablesmaynotbestoredinwesthyperspace">VARIABLES MAY NOT BE STORED IN WEST HYPERSPACE</h2>
<p>At Twitter, they have a giant monorepo with lots of services in it.  And somebody at Twitter wanted to know which language was most prevalent.  Which language does Twitter use the most?</p>
<p>Java came in 3rd, and Scala came in 2nd. But 1st was a surprise.  The number one programming language used at Twitter was YAML.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>YAML usually doesn't feel like a programming language to me.  The file I'm currently writing in is in markdown with some YAML at the top to set the title and associated fields:</p>
<pre><code>title: INTERCAL, YAML, And Other Horrible Programming Languages
author: Adam
</code></pre>
<p>Nothing executes this YAML. It only offers some information to the blogging platform. But I don't think that is the type of YAML that made up the bulk of config at Twitter.</p>
<p>I suspect a lot of it was build and deployment scripts in the form of YAML. It was the type of configuration that encoded the control flow of some external system.  YAML like that lives in this grey zone between declarative configuration and a full-blown programming language.</p>
<p>I'll show you what I mean. Let's look at an example from <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/blob/master/.travis.yml">shellcheck</a>'s build script:</p>
<pre><code>language: shell
os: linux

services:
  - docker
</code></pre>
<p>That seems like straight-forward config.</p>
<pre><code>jobs:
  include:
    - stage: Build
      env: BUILD=linux
      workspaces:
        create:
          name: ws-linux
          paths: deploy
</code></pre>
<p><code>create</code>, in the above, is starting to seem a bit more like execution. Let's continue.</p>
<pre><code>      script:
        - ls -la ${CASHER_DIR}/ || true
        - tar -xvf ${CASHER_DIR}/ws-osx-fetch.tgz --strip-components=5
        - ls -la deploy
        - ./.github_deploy
</code></pre>
<p>Now the YAML has just devolved into specifying how to execute a grab bag of commands.  We haven't seen control-flow yet, but it's coming.</p>
<pre><code>      if: type = push
      script:
        - source ./.multi_arch_docker
        - set -ex; multi_arch_docker::main; set +x
</code></pre>
<p>There we go, branching. It's an if statement in a YAML file!</p>
<p>That was for TravisCI but this isn't TravisCI, or CI specific.  Here is a simple example from Ansible:</p>
<pre><code>- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - include: foo.yml
      when: something == "foo"
    
    - include: bar.yml
      when: something == "bar"
</code></pre>
<p>Here is GitHub Actions:</p>
<pre><code>steps:
 - name: Step 7
   if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' &amp;&amp; github.event.action == 'unassigned' }}
   run: echo This event is a pull request that had an assignee removed.
</code></pre>
<p>Here is part of a Grafana <a href="https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/grafana/templates/deployment.yaml">Helm Chart</a>:</p>
<pre><code>
{{ if (or (not .Values.persistence.enabled) (eq .Values.persistence.type "pvc")) }}
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ template "grafana.fullname" . }}
  namespace: {{ template "grafana.namespace" . }}
  labels:
    {{- include "grafana.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
{{- if .Values.labels }}
{{ toYaml .Values.labels | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
{{- with .Values.annotations }}
  annotations:
{{ toYaml . | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
</code></pre>
<p>I think this is a problem. Writing control flow in a config file is like hammering in a screw. It's a useful tool being used for the wrong job<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>How did we get to this world of little programming languages embedded into YAML? Is calling something configuration just less scary? And if so, is a c++ program just config you give to gcc?</p>
<p>Did things ever get this complicated in XML times?</p>
<p>It turns out they did:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:output method="text" omit-xml-declaration="yes" /&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:call-template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
      &lt;xsl:with-param name="i" select="1" /&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:param name="i" /&gt;
    &lt;xsl:choose&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="($i mod 3) = 0 and ($i mod 5) = 0"&gt;FizzBuzz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="$i mod 3 = 0"&gt;Fizz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="$i mod 5 = 0"&gt;Buzz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="$i" /&gt;&lt;xsl:text&gt;&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:choose&gt;
    &lt;xsl:if test="$i &amp;lt; 100"&gt;
      &lt;xsl:call-template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
        &lt;xsl:with-param name="i" select="$i + 1" /&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:if&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>That is <code>FizzBuzz</code> in <a href="https://gist.github.com/JustinPealing/6f619a23729720a9c14d9917201028c8">XSLT</a>. I assume it was written in jest, but in many ways, XML and XSLT are better than an ad-hoc YAML based scripting language. XSLT is a documented and standardized thing, not just some ad-hoc format for specifying execution.</p>
<p>It burns my eyes to look at it, but at least XSLT was intended to be used as a programming language. That is something we can't say about YAML or INTERCAL.</p>
<p>The problem with these languages embedded into YAML is they are all one-off implementations.  TravisCI conditionals have a TravisCI specific syntax, usage, and features. You can't use Travis's <code>concat</code> function or conditional regex in the YAML configuration for your ansible playbooks.</p>
<p>In a vague way, this YAML problem is like the <code>COMEFROM</code> problem. If you know yaml, you can't just open a .yml file and start reading file line by line.  You need to understand how the configuration controls the execution of the specific system it's for.  And that is hard.</p>
<h2 id="ihavenofileandimustscream">I HAVE NO FILE AND I MUST SCREAM</h2>
<p>The line between configuration and programming languages is not some bright dividing line. It's easy to slowly drift into adding programming language constructs to a config file. Before you know it, you have a full unspecified programming language embedded in the interpretation of your config file.</p>
<p>That is the worst of both worlds, and so much YAML seems to drift into this area.</p>
<p>I like YAML more than XML, but for control flow, you know what would be better than YAML? Anything else!  Maybe even INTERCAL? I mean, how bad could a joke programming language be?</p>

<![CDATA[Using PGP Encryption in 2021]]>

February 25, 2021 | https://sammorrowdrums.com/using-pgp-encryption-in-2021 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sammorrowdrums.com/using-pgp-encryption-in-2021">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So, I decided to bolster my security this year, and invest in a YubiKey. One of its less obvious features is OpenPGP support; this means as well as U2F and TOPT authentication, you can use it for all kinds of cryptographic possibilities. Those familiar with SmartCards will probably already be familiar with what they can do, and that is the important point. The YubiKey is also an OpenPGP Smartcard.</p>

<h3 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h3>

<p>If you're time poor, you <em>might</em> not have time to set up PGP properly, so as a first step consider using Signal and ProtonMail (they are both secure and free). At least then you can be confident you are set up to communicate via encrypted channels.</p>

<p>Your motivation to set up PGP keys will most likely depend on need such as being a journalist, wanting to sign your code or perhaps you are just a curious geek. It seems today few people are using PGP encrypted e-mail, and of those that are, probably most are using services like ProtonMail which is a good step, but doesn't let you use your own master key without uploading it*, which complicates things if you require the <strong>highest</strong> level of security.</p>

<p>* <a href="https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/how-is-the-private-key-stored/" rel="nofollow">It will be stored encrypted with your password though</a>. So they never have access to it. Keeping your certification key off the internet entirely is possibly overkill for most users.</p>

<p>That being said – I think if you are willing to try, the more private communications there are in the wild, the less they stick out – so you help to mitigate mass surveillance operations, and you have secure channels of communication ready, should the need ever arise (which often becomes much more difficult to do safely / legally, if that day comes).</p>

<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>

<p>PGP allows you to sign, encrypt and authenticate (and certify) basically anything. This covers numerous activities such as:</p>
<ul><li>encrypting / decrypting messages such as emails</li>
<li>signing git commits &amp; software releases</li>
<li>authenticating via SSH</li>
<li>proving that all of the above were done by you</li></ul>

<p>To get the full benefit of PGP, you need to keep your master key safe – as if that is compromised, you lose nearly all the benefits of using it in the first place. Obviously the greater your personal need for operations security, the higher the risks of somebody targeting your key. The PGP system was designed to easily protect your information, even from threats like nation states, so much of the advice you will see on PGP is uncompromising – and is focused on how to <strong>maximise</strong> security.</p>

<p>In practice, few of us are in need of Edward Snowden levels of security – although if your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security" rel="nofollow"><em>opsec</em></a> is strong (especially for journalists), you might be more likely to have a high security source trust you with their leaks or tips.</p>

<h2 id="generating-a-master-key">Generating a Master Key</h2>

<p>Already we are faced here with options, and I think this is what puts off most people right from the start. You really need to use the command line, decide what key length (and algorithm) you are going to use, and decide where you are going to generate your key.</p>

<p>I chose to generate a 4096-bit RSA key.</p>

<p>The main options are:</p>
<ul><li>Just using your current machine
<ul><li>This is the easiest, but is also the least secure, as a compromised machine could leak your key to the world</li></ul></li>
<li>Directly on SmartCard / YubiKey
<ul><li>This is simple and secure (as long as nobody can hack your key)</li>
<li>Even you cannot remove the master key from your YubiKey, and risk losing access</li></ul></li>
<li>Using an offline system
<ul><li>This involves having a live operating system from something like a USB drive, and while you might upgrade stuff using the internet, or install tools to manage your YubiKey, you pull the internet cable before generating your key, and you shut down the machine without internet when complete.</li></ul></li>
<li>Offline system in an air-gapped room
<ul><li>This is the Snowden level option, if you think that you are being targeted by the most advanced capabilities, then you would literally need to scrub a room (that functions as a faraday cage) of all electronics, and probably better using a single write medium with no electronic components like a DVD-R for the live operating system, and you would need to leave your phone out of this room, and then you should probably destroy and scrub everything after generating the key, and even then you would need to be careful to encrypt your messages in a similarly safe environment if possible, because frankly at this point people are potentially trying to hack you, add keyloggers, and find easier ways of breaking your encryption than actually having to decrypt your messages. Which you will never 100% guarantee they won't be able to do, as the three letter agency types of the world would not tell you if they could – although the strongest available encryption is the best you've got, and it probably will work.</li>
<li>I mostly add this option as a joke, because obviously organisations like the NSA and GCHQ have this sort of practice baked into their offices along with all the physical security etc. so even if you were to try this at home, without the resources to manage this level of security – you would probably fall down somewhere, but we can all dream right!?
<br></li></ul></li></ul>

<p>I opted for the offline system, and ran into a few problems, such as my laptops WiFi card not being supported by the stock Debian live USB, and my other machine (which has cabled LAN) didn't have USB-C ports (which my YubiKey does). In the end I bought a USB-C (f) –&gt; USB A adapter and used the LAN. This worked well, and I was able to get the packages I needed, pull the LAN cable, and then generate my key following <a href="https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide" rel="nofollow">these instructions</a>.</p>

<p><em>The important thing is that the instructions are really precise and often if you get a step wrong, you will need to start from scratch.</em></p>

<p>I then loaded up my laptop and (having made a USB key with an encrypted partition with private keys and revocation certificate, and an un-encrypted partition with the public key, as per the guide), tried to load my public key onto my machine, so I could start using my YubiKey – which had the signing, encryption and authentication keys loaded onto it now. Sadly my public key partition didn't mount and I had already shut-down the offline system so I had to load the live disk back up install some packages again and pull the LAN cable, and then load up my encrypted partition (which did mount), and restore my keys – this is the only copy of the master key, emergency revocation key and public key – so losing that would have meant starting from scratch. Once I had fixed my issues with the backup USB key, I was able to restore my public key to my laptop, and continue.</p>

<h2 id="backing-it-up">Backing it up</h2>

<p>Now, I had so far neglected to make any other backup of my keys other than the encrypted USB stick, and bit-rot is a genuine risk, so I also wanted to make physical backups – and so I used a tool <code>paperkey</code> to print them using my live USB, and restoring keys from the encrypted USB, and obviously this time I also needed to install printer drivers and things. Technically printers are a risk too, so for the ultra-paranoid you might want to either not have a backup and risk getting locked out of your own keys, or find some more reliable medium. For convenience I would have backed up my master key with a QR code tool, however the 4096 bit RSA key I generated was too big to QR – so for that I would have OCR scan it to revive the key.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-key">Using the key</h2>

<p>The first thing I did was submit my public key to a few <code>keyservers</code> which enables other users to trivially discover my public key, which is all they need to send me encrypted messages – and importantly means if I for some reason lose it, I can download it again myself. I then followed some examples of encrypting messages to myself, and decrypting them on the command line – just to try it. That all worked well.</p>

<p>I was initially excited to try and use my keys with ProtonMail, which has full PGP support and is my current e-mail provider, only to discover that it would require that I upload my private key the way it currently works – so I just had to leave it in a situation where I have different public keys for my email accounts in ProtonMail, and I don't really want to leave the service – but I was frustrated that I couldn't use it.</p>

<p>I then also got excited about Social Proofs (which is a mixture between actually verifying ownership of various accounts, and stamp collecting). I tried keybase.io – it worked, and while it did ask me to optionally upload my private key, it was able to do all the “proofs”, with me signing the actions on my local machine. The purchase of Keybase by Zoom however put me off, and various practices like mounting drives and adding stuff to startup made me remove KeyBase entirely from my system – unfortunately they just don't seem to have managed to maintain trust, respect and sufficient usage for their (originally noble goals) to pan out in the long run. I did like their idea though.</p>

<p>Next I tried a distributed social proof tool called KeyOxide – <a href="https://keyoxide.org/1AFD9615CAB90BE7" rel="nofollow">here are my proofs</a> (should you wish to contact me). KeyOxide is less automated than Keybase, doesn't have file sharing and private messaging, but it also doesn't need you to create an account or upload anything, doesn't need apps, and its proof system works well.</p>

<p>Of course, social proofs and identities matched to your cryptographic identity are not for people flying under the radar – but it is a mistake that cryptography is only for those people. I'm happy that I have a way to prove that I am who I say I am online, and therefore disavow any attempts to impersonate me.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-commit-signing">Setting up commit signing</h2>

<p>Signing commits is pretty easy, and simply requires that you point <code>git</code> to a public key file, and tell it to sign all commits in the config. Then you'll need your YubiKey to commit anything, which will also prompt you for a pin unlock the first time each session (if you don't want that, pull the YubiKey after each commit). Then you just need to upload your commit on Github, and hey-presto, all your commits show as signed and verified.</p>

<h2 id="ssh">SSH</h2>

<p>So now you have a YubiKey set up with PGP keys, and therefore you can use it for SSH. You will …</p></div></div>

      <article role="main">
          <p>In May 2020, in the early stages of the pandemic, IT outlets drew attention of their readers with headlines such as <a href="https://www.lrz.de/presse/ereignisse/2020-06-03_InterviewSecurityIncident/">“Supercomputeres offline across Europe”</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-15/hackers-target-european-supercomputers-researching-covid-19">“Hackers Target European Supercomputers Researching Covid-19”</a> or in contrast to that <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2020/05/11-plus-supercomputers-hacked-with-cryptominers-by-china/">“11-Plus Supercomputers Hacked With Cryptominers”</a>. Apparently, at that time, some supercomputers went offline citing security reasons, but no one really knew why. To put speculations aside, we want to dedicate this blog post to a brief retrospective of what insiders only know as <em>the HPC incident</em> coupled with a forensic deep-dive from one of the affected institutions.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a clarification: A so-called  <em>supercomputer</em> is really just a sizeable bunch of ordinary computers tied together to form a single large system that is then used by scientists around the globe to perform computation-heavy tasks. To put that into perspective: While the number of physical CPU cores in a typical desktop or laptop computer in 2020 varies between two and eight, <em>HPC</em> (<em>H</em>igh <em>P</em>erformance <em>C</em>omputing) systems are made up of thousands of single computer systems with typically more than 20 cores each (forming a <em>cluster</em>). To name a random example from the current HPC Top 10 list, the <em>HPC5</em> cluster in Eni (Italy) is composed of 3,640 servers, each equipped with 24 physical CPU and four GPU cores, resulting in a total of 87,360 CPUs and 7,280 GPUs. Typical workloads for such HPC systems are medical research, seismic imaging or weather and climate modeling.</p>

<p>The difficulty in programming for such HPC systems stems from the requirement to divide workloads into a lot of small chunks that can then be distributed amongst these computers (often just called <em>nodes</em>) and executed in parallel. Since building and operating a cluster like that is obviously quite expensive, their owners try to maximize utilization of the available computing capacity by permitting concurrent access to selected researchers from all around the globe.</p>

<p>From a security perspective, this implies that HPC systems need to be generally accessible from anywhere (specifically the dangerous Internet) and therefore demand suitable authentication and authorization mechanisms so that only permitted parties have access and also won’t interfere with each other. On the other hand, restricting HPC users or workloads too much isn’t desired either. After all, the intended purpose of HPC clusters is to provide scientists easy access to a flexible platform that they can perform their research on - which often requires compromises security-wise. For instance, cluster nodes often don’t receive security fixes immediately. Instead, software updates have to be planned and tested in advance together with the cluster’s manufacturer and are scheduled only after no issues occurred during testing. Since in HPC availability is key, flawless interaction of all involved components has to be guaranteed prior to software changes. In our case, proprietary drivers for specialized hardware such as InfiniBand network controllers require even more attention and have to be re-certified with each update. Consequently, updates are often delayed and bundled together with others to reduce overall cluster downtime.</p>

<p>Having said that, the headlines mentioned earlier reporting an unscheduled downtime (in fact, for several weeks) were a clear indication that something serious must have been wrong at the time. Upon closer inspection, we discover a prime example of an <em>Advanced Persistent Threat</em> (APT), a term that depicts a “threat actor, which gains unauthorized access to a computer network and remains undetected for an extended period” according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat">Wikipedia</a> and has been occupying the security research community for decades. In the following sections, we’ll try to reconstruct the events surrounding this incident from our own perspective as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_emergency_response_team">CERT</a> of one of Germany’s affected national universities. But first, let’s have a look at the general architecture of our own HPC cluster (which isn’t much different from others) and how researchers interact with it.</p>

<h2 id="the-victim-still-in-good-health">The victim, still in good health</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.educv.de/img/blog-2021-02-17/architecture.png" alt="Cluster architecture"></p>

<p>From a bird’s-eye perspective, everything in our HPC cluster is centered around a large array of <em>compute nodes</em>, which is where the actual computation-heavy research tasks are executed. Since such computations are typically performed on large amounts of data (such as the raw dataset resulting from an experiment) and distributed among a lot of compute nodes, shared network storage and accompanying fast (high throughput, low latency) network connections are a necessity. In the HPC world, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand">InfiniBand</a> has been established as the de-facto standard for the physical interconnects, while there are different technologies available for the storage part, such as NFS and Lustre. In fact, many HPC systems utilize multiple filesystems for network storage depending on requirements (smaller, but fast short-term storage during computation vs. slow, but large long-time storage).</p>

<p>Permitted HPC users interact with our cluster by logging into one of the <em>login nodes</em> via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_(Secure_Shell)">SSH</a>, which allows them to access the shared storage and to interact with the <em>job scheduler</em>, a sort of reservation system that schedules and distributes the research <em>jobs</em> among the available compute nodes and tries to ensure that the different jobs don’t interfere with each other. In our case the login nodes weren’t accessible from all over the Internet. Instead, access was limited to our campus network as well as selected partner universities and other collaborating institutions. Our <em>export nodes</em> were different: Since most HPC jobs require huge amounts of raw data to be copied over to our shared storage, these nodes could be accessed directly from anywhere to offer optimal bandwidth and not disrupt our VPN. As a security measure and in contrast to the login systems, access to the export nodes is restricted to file operations. They don’t provide their users with a shell to execute arbitrary commands and are therefore deemed at lower risk.</p>

<p>Lastly, the cluster setup contains management infrastructure that offers various services such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol">LDAP</a> for user authentication or the <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/">SLURM Workload Manager</a>, which is our job scheduler. Administrative systems are also used by the HPC team as well as the vendor of the cluster for all kinds of management purposes, such as setting up new compute nodes, scheduling updates or inspecting issues during cluster operation. Obviously, regular HPC users are not allowed to access these systems.</p>

<p>Regarding operating systems, all nodes within our HPC infrastructure run Linux, more specifically the <em>Red Hat Enterprise Linux</em> (RHEL) distribution. To fully understand the technical details within the rest of this article, some basic Linux knowledge is beneficial.</p>

<h2 id="wounded">Wounded</h2>

<p>On a fateful day in early May 2020, with the cluster happily chugging along, our HPC team was informed by a partner that a cluster from another university had spotted suspicious system modifications, which were in turn also discovered at various other HPC institutions throughout the country. More specifically, our initial report briefly mentioned <em>“files in <code>/etc/fonts</code>“</em> and - in some cases - compromised SSH binaries, which are utilized by users to connect to third party HPC systems. Alerted, our HPC guys immediately started to assess the cluster, looking for similar IoCs (<em>I</em>ndicators <em>o</em>f <em>C</em>ompromise) as the ones reported. It didn’t take long to verify that, indeed, we could confirm similar peculiarities. On some nodes, the directory <code>/etc/fonts</code> looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -la /etc/fonts
drwxr-xr-x.   3 root root    4096 Feb 20 01:31 .
drwxr-xr-x. 128 root root   12288 May 13 18:10 ..
-rwsr-sr-x    1 root root    8616 Feb 24  2017 .fonts
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root 200046 20144 Feb 24  2017 .low
drwxr-xr-x.   2 root root    4096 Feb 20 01:31 conf.d
-rw-r--r--    1 root root    2416 Jun  8  2018 fonts.conf
</code></pre>

<p>The two executable files <code>.fonts</code>  and <code>.low</code> clearly didn’t belong there. The timestamp indicates that they were last modified in 2017, which would have been horrible due to the cluster being potentially compromised since then, but that value is also very easy to forge and shouldn’t be trusted at all. Of greater concern were the file’s permissions, which are shown in the left-most column. For <code>.fonts</code>, the <code>s</code> in the permission map <code>-rwsr-sr-x</code> essentially mean that any user who executes that program automatically runs it as if he were the user with the highest privilege level, namely <code>root</code>. We later executed those files in a safe sandboxed environment, just to confirm the worst-case assumption that this file is a plain and simple backdoor that allows <em>ANY</em> user to immediately gain administrative rights on the system:</p>

<pre><code>$ whoami
user123
$ /etc/fonts/.fonts
$ whoami
root
</code></pre>

<p>Later on, more thorough analyses such as <a href="https://atdotde.blogspot.com/2020/05/high-performance-hackers.html">this</a> confirmed that behaviour and also shone light on the purpose of the other executable, <code>.low</code>. It’s essentially a log wiping tool that attempts to remove all traces of a user’s activity from the system’s log files. Having found those, the maliciousness of the reported observations weren’t in question anymore. For us, the situation was especially dire due to the fact that not only the user-facing login, compute and export nodes were found compromised, but also various administrative machines, which offered an attacker essentially full control over the entire HPC cluster. The reaction of our HPC team was swift and similar to other affected institutions: The whole cluster was disconnected from the Internet, leading to the sudden downtimes that were reported in the news. What followed was a collaborative effort coordinated by the <em>Gauss Centre for Supercomputing</em>, the <em>Gauss Alliance</em> in Germany and EU-wide association <em>PRACE</em> to share further IoCs and preliminary forensic results. Meanwhile, federal authorities also undertook a criminal investigation into the potential motives and suspects of this incident.</p>

This particularly innovative approach brings the digital transformation in law to a new angle of reflection with a collaborative methodology involving several stakeholders (legal experts, designers, developers and especially users).</p><blockquote><p id="3ed2">In France, the year 2017 was a turning point with the emergence of a new trend that seems to be continuing and consolidating: <strong>lawyers themselves are becoming players in the field of innovation</strong>. The digital transformation of law is appearing from a new and much more <strong>collaborative angle</strong>. Law has become an object of innovation on which lawyers now work together with technical profiles in order to create new products and services with high added value.</p><p id="40dd">It is in this new context that legal design is being developed. It is an outstanding illustration which demonstrates that <strong>innovation in law is not exclusively technological</strong> but also involves rethinking the way in which law is designed. Legal design is a collaborative approach full of promises, provided it is thoroughly grasped through its subtleties and complexity.</p></blockquote><h2 id="eb6a">My experience of law as a citizen</h2><p id="e310">From my point of view, law has always been something inaccessible. Almost all of us have experienced a situation where we had to sign a document without paying too much attention to the important lines.

We’ve all heard the expression <em>“It’s design!”</em> as a crude expression of <em>“I think it’s beautiful!”.</em> However, it is not about what the product looks like, but more about its functionality, practicality and aesthetics.<br>In any case, it is important to remember that design is <strong>multidisciplinary</strong> and uses, among other things, methodologies and tools to <strong>solve sometimes complex problems,</strong> offering better products, services and functionalities, and above all <strong>to ask the right questions.</strong><br>In UX Design, empathy and understanding of the user’s needs are also central notions of our profession.</p><p id="c1c7">There are a wide range of methodologies related to user experience.</p><p id="4678"><strong>Created in 1980 by Rolfe Faste,</strong> Design Thinking is a non-linear methodology which consists of applying, through a collaborative process, analytical and intuitive thinking in five steps: empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test.</p><p id="4349"><strong>In 1990, Donald Norman</strong> coined the term “UX Design” as a way of describing the quality of the user experience, which includes all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the business, its services and its products.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Legal Design, a web designer’s perspective on this new practice" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*MmS9w-AXVEJ70dMZ.png" width="1000" height="707" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*MmS9w-AXVEJ70dMZ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*MmS9w-AXVEJ70dMZ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*MmS9w-AXVEJ70dMZ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*MmS9w-AXVEJ70dMZ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*MmS9w-AXVEJ70dMZ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>© AnnePedrofr — UX REPUBLIC</figcaption></figure><p id="3b33">From the beginning of a new project, several disciplines are important to consider, such as the exploration of user data (UX research), the analysis and formalization of the message we want to design (UX design), the artistic direction we will apply to the document (graphic design) or a user interface (UI) if the future product tends towards an interface.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Legal Design, a web designer’s perspective on this new practice" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5120/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png" width="2560" height="1440" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Our methodology that we apply at Linkvalue for our projects — © Romain Gerardin</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="0909">In our Legal Design projects, we apply this iterative methodology, taking into account all the actors in the process, i.e. designer, lawyer, developer, client and users, from exploring data to evaluation by testing the solution with the target users.<br>Throughout the project, we will start by collecting data in a qualitative and/or quantitative way through user research in order to analyze it and study the problem (the “why”) of the product / service.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Capabilities are being used by many Linux-based software nowadays to limit what a process can do. But I think the documentation is a bit hard to grasp and I found some parts of capabilities implementation confusing so I decided to condense my current knowledge into a shorter article.</p>



<p>The most important reference for capabilities is up-to-date man page <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>. But that doesn’t provide an easy to read introduction.</p>



<h3>Process Capabilities</h3>



<p>Permissions of regular users are very limited, while permissions of “root” user are very powerful. But processes running under “root” often don’t require full root capabilities. </p>



<p>To help reduce “root” user power, POSIX capabilities provides a way to restrict groups of privileged system operations a process and its children are allowed to do. They basically divide full “root” privilege into a set of distinct privileges. The idea of capabilities was described in POSIX 1003.1e draft that was withdrawn in 1997.</p>



<p>Each Linux process (task) has <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/cred.h#L134">five 64-bit numbers</a> (sets) holding capability bits (used to be 32-bit before Linux 2.6.25) which can be inspected by reading  /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/status</p>



<pre>CapInh: 00000000000004c0<br>CapPrm: 00000000000004c0<br>CapEff: 00000000000004c0<br>CapBnd: 00000000000004c0<br>CapAmb: 0000000000000000</pre>



<p>These numbers (here displayed as hex digits) are acting as a bitmap encoding a set of capabilities. Full names are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Inheritable</strong> – capabilities that children can inherit</li><li><strong>Permitted</strong> – capabilities the task is permitted to use</li><li><strong>Effective</strong> – capabilities actually effective</li><li><strong>Bounding</strong> set –  prior to Linux 2.6.25, the bounding set was a system-wide attribute shared by all threads, probably meant to describe a set beyond which capabilities cannot grow. Currently it is per-task set. It is a part of execve transformation logic (more later) and also limits what a process can set to its inheritable set using capset().</li><li><strong>Ambient</strong> set (since Linux 4.3) – added to give capabilities to non-0 user easily, without using setuid or file capabilities (more later).</li></ul>



<p>If a task asks to perform a privileged operation (like binding on ports &lt; 1024), the kernel checks Effective bounding set to see if <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/uapi/linux/capability.h#L183">CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</a> is set. If it is, it continues. Otherwise, it rejects the operation with EPERM (operation not permitted). These CAP_ defines in the kernel source are numbered sequentially so CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE being 10 means a bit 1&lt;&lt;10 = 0x400 (that is the ‘4’ hex digit in my previous example). </p>



<p>The full human readable list of currently-defined capabilities can be found in your up-to-date manpage <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a> (the one here is for reference only).</p>



<p>Additionally there is a library libcap to make capabilities management and inspection easier. In addition to <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/libcap.3.html">library API</a>, the package includes <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/capsh.1.html">capsh</a> utility which, among other things, allows printing its capabilities. <br></p>



<pre># capsh --print
Current: = cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_net_bind_service+eip
Bounding set =cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_net_bind_service
Ambient set =
Securebits: 00/0x0/1'b0
 secure-noroot: no (unlocked)
 secure-no-suid-fixup: no (unlocked)
 secure-keep-caps: no (unlocked)
 secure-no-ambient-raise: no (unlocked)
uid=0(root)
gid=0(root)
groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel),11(floppy),20(dialout),26(tape),27(video)
</pre>



<p>There are a few <strong>confusing</strong> bits:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Current</strong> – displays effective, inheritable and permitted capabilities of capsh process in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/cap_to_text.3.html"><strong>cap_to_text(3)</strong></a><strong> format</strong>. Again, it displays it in cap_to_text format which lists capabilities basically as capability[,capability…]+(e|i|p) groups, where ‘e’ means effective, ‘i’ inheritable and ‘p’ permitted. The list is not separated by ‘,’ as you would guess (cap_setgid+eip,cap_setuid+eip). The ‘,’ separates capabilities in a single +… (action) group. The actual list of action groups is then separated by spaces. So another example with two action groups would be “= cap_sys_chroot+ep cap_net_bind_service+eip”. And also these two action groups “= cap_net_bind_service+e cap_net_bind_service+ip” would encode the same meaning as  a single “cap_net_bind_service+eip”.</li><li><strong>Bounding set/Ambient set</strong>. To make things even more confusing, these two lines contain just a list of capabilities set in those sets, separated by spaces. No cap_to_text format is used here because it is not listing permitted, effective, inheritable sets together but just a single (bounding/ambient) set.</li><li><strong>Securebits</strong>: displays task’s <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/cred.h#L133">securebits</a> integer in as decimal/hex/fancy-verilog-convention-for-binary-strings (yes, everyone would expect it here and it’s totally clear by ‘b because every sysadmin programs its own FPGAs and ASICs). The state of securebits follows. The actual bits are defined as SECBIT_* in <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/uapi/linux/securebits.h#L22">securebits.h</a> and also described in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>.</li><li>The tool lacks the one important state and that is the “<strong>NoNewPrivs</strong>” which can be also seen by inspecting /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/status. That is described in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a> only, even though it directly affects capabilities when used in conjunction with file capabilities (more later). NoNewPrivs is described as “<em>With no_new_privs set to 1, execve(2) promises not to grant privileges to do anything that could not have been done without the execve(2) call (for example, rendering the set-user-ID and set-group-ID mode bits, and file capabilities non-functional). Once set, this the no_new_privs attribute cannot be unset.  The setting of this attribute is inherited by children created by fork(2) and clone(2), and preserved across execve(2).</em>“. This is the flag which Kubernetes sets to 1 when allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false in pod’s securityContext. </li></ul>



<p>When a process starts a new process by doing execve(2), capabilities are transformed to the child using the formula mentioned in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>:</p>



<pre>P'(ambient)     = (file is privileged) ? 0 : P(ambient)

P'(permitted)   = (P(inheritable) &amp; F(inheritable)) |
                  (F(permitted) &amp; P(bounding)) | P'(ambient)

P'(effective)   = F(effective) ? P'(permitted) : P'(ambient)

P'(inheritable) = P(inheritable)    [i.e., unchanged]

P'(bounding)    = P(bounding)       [i.e., unchanged]

where:

     P()   denotes the value of a thread capability set before the
           execve(2)

     P'()  denotes the value of a thread capability set after the
           execve(2)

     F()   denotes a file capability set
</pre>



<p>These rules describe action taken for every bit in ambient/permitted/effective/inheritable/bounding sets. It uses standard C syntax (&amp; for logic AND, | for logic OR). P’ is the child process, P is the current process calling execve(2). F are so called “file capabilities” of the file being execve’d.</p>



<p>Additionaly, a process can programmatically change its inheritable, permitted and effective sets using libpcap any  time according to these rules:</p>



<ul><li>Unless the caller have the CAP_SETPCAP, the new <strong>inheritable</strong> set must be a subset of <em>P(inheritable) &amp; P(permitted)</em></li><li>(since Linux 2.6.25) The new <strong>inheritable</strong> set must be a subset of <em>P(inheritable) &amp; P(bounding)</em></li><li>The new <strong>permitted</strong> set must be a subset of P(permitted) </li><li>The new <strong>effective</strong> set must be a subset of P(effective)</li></ul>



<p>As HN user eqvinox suggested, pspax from <a href="https://github.com/gentoo/pax-utils">pax-utils</a> can be used to list capabilities of running processes, just compile it with libpcap support (make USE_CAP=yes):</p>
<pre>  # pspax
  USER     PID    PAX    MAPS ETYPE      NAME             CAPS ATTR  
  root     60879  ---    w^x  ET_DYN     crond            =ep  system_u:system_r:kernel_t:s0  
  root     60910  ---    w^x  ET_DYN     ntpd             cap_net_bind_service,cap_ipc_lock,cap_sys_time=ep system_u:system_r:kernel_t:s0
</pre>



<h3>File capabilities</h3>



<p>Sometimes a user with a reduced set of capabilities needs to run a binary which requires more capabilities. Previously, this was achieved by setuid binary (chmod +s ./executable). Such a binary, if owned by root, would assign full root privileges to it when executed by any user.</p>



<p>That gives too many privileges to the binary, so POSIX capabilities implemented a concept called “file capabilities”. They are stored as a <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/xattr.7.html">extended file attribute</a> called “security.capability” so you need a capable filesystem (ext*, XFS, Raiserfs, Brtfs, overlay2, …). For a process to write to this attribute, CAP_SETFCAP capability is needed (be in process’ effective set).<br></p>



<pre>$ getfattr -m - -d `which ping`
# file: usr/bin/ping
security.capability=0sAQAAAgAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=

$ getcap `which ping`  
/usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep

<h3>Special cases and notes</h3>



<p>Of course, life is not simple, so is not the implementation of capabilities and there are several special cases described in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a> man page. Probably the most important are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>setuid file bit and file capabilities are ignored if NoNewPrivs is set</strong> or filesystem is mounted nosuid or the process calling execve is being ptraced. The file capabilities are also ignored when the kernel is booted with<em> </em>no_file_caps.</li><li><strong>Capability-dumb</strong> binary is a binary converted from setuid to file capabilities without changing its code. Such binaries are often converted by setting +ep capability on them like “setcap cap_net_bind_service+ep ./binary”. The important part is “e”, effective. Upon execve, this capability is added to both permitted and effective so the executable is ready to use the privileged operation. In contrast <strong>capability-smart</strong> binary which uses libpcap or similar, can use <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/cap_set_proc.3.html">cap_set_proc(3)</a> (or <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/capget.2.html">capset</a>) to set “effective” or “inheritable” bits at any point, as long as that capability is already in the “permitted” set. So “setcap cap_net_bind_service+p ./binary” would be enough for a capability-smart binary as it will be able to set the effective bit itself before calling the privileged operation.  See my <a href="https://gist.github.com/k3a/a38f4439f85eda4f77eda19c4ae8c80c">example code</a>.</li><li><strong>setuid-root binaries</strong> continue to work, giving all privileges of root when run by a non-root user. Unless they have file capabilities set, in which case only those are granted. It is also possible to create a setuid binary with empty file capability set, making it execute as 0, though without any capabilities. …</li></ul></div></div>

<p> Tagged as <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/tag/blog.html">blog</a>, <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/tag/sbcl.html">sbcl</a>, <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/tag/common-lisp.html">common-lisp</a> </p> <p> Written on 2021-02-24 21:50:00 </p> <p>It's taken me much longer than I hoped, but I finally have a second version of
my patches to build static executables tested and ready to go! This set of
patches vastly improves upon the first by reducing the amount of compilation
needed at the cost of sacrificing a little purity. Additionally I have created
a system that automates the process of building a static executable, along with
other release related tasks.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2>At a Glance</h2>

<ul>
<li>The new patch set can be found on
  the
  <a href="https://github.com/daewok/sbcl/tree/static-executable-v2">static-executable-v2 branch</a> of
  my SBCL fork or at
  <code>https://www.timmons.dev/static/patches/sbcl/$VERSION/static-executable-support-v2.patch</code>
  with a detached signature available at
  <code>https://www.timmons.dev/static/patches/sbcl/$VERSION/static-executable-support-v2.patch.asc</code>
  signed with GPG
  key <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/static/keys/9ACF6934.pub">0x9ACF6934</a>.</li>
<li>You'll definitely want to build SBCL with the <code>:sb-prelink-linkage-table</code>
  feature (newly added by the patch). You'll probably also want the
  <code>:sb-linkable-runtime</code> feature (already exists, but the patch also enables it
  on arm/arm64).</li>
<li>The new patch lets you build a static executable with less compilation of
  Lisp code.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://gitlab.com/daewok/asdf-release-ops">asdf-release-ops system</a>
  automates the process of building a static executable by tying it into ASDF.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's New?</h2>

<p>If you need a refresher about what static executables are or what use cases
they're good for, see
my <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/posts/static-executables-with-sbcl.html">previous post on this topic</a>.</p>

<p>With my previous patch, the only way you could create a static executable was
to perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine the foreign symbols needed by your code. The easiest way to do
   this is to compile all your Lisp code and then dump the information from the
   image.</li>
<li>From that list of foreign symbols, create a C file that contains fills an
   array with references to those symbols.</li>
<li>Recompile the SBCL core and runtime with this new file, additionally
   disabling libdl support and linking against your foreign libraries.</li>
<li>(Re)compile all your Lisp code with the new runtime (if you made an image in
   step 1 it will not be compatible with the new runtime due to feature and
   build ID mismatches).</li>
<li>Dump the executable.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the most general case, this involved compiling your entire Lisp image
twice. After some #lisp discussions, I realized there was a better way of doing
this. While the previous process still works, the new recommended process now
looks like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Build the image you would like to make into a static executable and save it.</li>
<li>Dump the foreign symbol info from this image and write the C file that SBCL
   can use to prelink itself.</li>
<li>Compile that C file and link it into an existing sbcl.o file to make a new
   runtime. sbcl.o is the SBCL runtime in object form, created when building
   with the <code>:sb-linkable-runtime</code> feature.</li>
<li>Load the image from step 1 into your new runtime. It will be compatible
   because the build ID and feature set are the same!</li>
<li>Dump your now static executable.</li>
</ol>

<p>This new process can significantly reduce the amount of time needed to make an
executable. Plus it lets you take more advantage of image based
development. It's fairly trivial to build an image exactly like you want, dump
it, and then pair it with a custom static runtime to make a static executable.</p>

<p>There were two primary challenges that needed to be overcome for this version
of the patch set.</p>

<p>First, the SBCL core had to be made robust to every libdl function
uncondtionally returning an error. Since we want the feature set to remain
constant we can't recompile the runtime with <code>#-os-provides-dlopen</code>. Instead,
we take advantage of the fact that Musl libc lets you link static executables
against libdl, but all those functions are noops. This is the "purity"
sacrifice I alluded to above.</p>

<p>Second, since we are reusing a image, the prelink info table (the generated C
file) needed to order the symbols exactly as the image expects them to be
ordered. The tricky bit here is that some libraries (like <code>cl-plus-ssl</code>) add
symbols to the linkage table that will always be undefined. <code>cl-plus-ssl</code> does
this in order to support a wide range of openssl versions. The previous patch
set unconditionally filtered out undefined symbols, which horribly broke things
in the new approach.</p>

<h2>More Documentation</h2>

<p>As before, after applying the patch you'll find a README.static-executable file
in the root of the repo. You'll also find a Dockerfile and an example of how to
use it in the README.static-executable.</p>

<p>You can also check out the tests and documentation in
the <a href="https://gitlab.com/daewok/asdf-release-ops">asdf-release-ops system</a>.</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>:sb-prelink-linkage-table</code> feature does not work on 32-bit ARM + Musl
  libc &gt;= 1.2. Musl switched to 64-bit time under the hood while still
  mataining compatibility with everything compiled for 32-bit time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The issue is how they maintained backwards compatibility. Every time related
  symbol still exists and implements everything on top of the 32-bit time
  interface. However, if you include the standard header file where the symbol
  is defined <em>or</em> you look up the symbol via <code>dlsym</code> you actually get a pointer
  to the 64-bit time version of the symbol. We can't use <code>dlsym</code> (it doesn't
  work in static executables). And the generated C file doesn't include any
  headers.</p>

<p>This <em>could</em> be fixed if someone is motiviated enough to create/find a
  complete, easy to use map between libc symbols and the headers that define
  them and integrate it into the prelink info generator.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>:sb-prelink-linkage-table</code> works on Windows but causes test
  failures. The root issue is that mingw64 has implemented their own
  libm. Their trig functions are fast, but use inaccurate instructions (like
  FSIN) under the hood. When prelinking these inaccurate implementations are
  used instead of the more accurate ones (from msvcrt.dll ?) found when using
  <code>dlsym</code> to look up the symbol.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>I would love to get feedback on this approach and any ideas on how to
   improve it! Please drop me a line (etimmons on Freenode or daewok on
   Github/Gitlab) if you have suggestions.</p></li>
<li><p>I've already incorporated static executables
   into <a href="https://www.clpm.dev/">CLPM</a> and will be distributing them starting
   with v0.4.0! I'm going to continue rolling out static executables in my
   other projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Pieces of the patch set are now solid enough that I think they can be
   submitted for upstream consideration. I'll start sending them after the
   current 2.1.2 freeze.</p></li>
</ol>

                    <p>Much has been covered about developer salaries based on coding language, location, job title, and so on. However, little has been done to chart the rise and fall of developer salaries over the years.</p><p>Tracing developer salaries over the last 20 years was an interesting endeavor. Researching the topic meant changing the language I used to search for data. <br>Back in the early 2000s, tech and software were referred to as “Information Technology” (IT) or “Information and Communications Technology” (ICT), developers were still referred to as “IT workers” and little was mentioned about the many specialized roles we have today.</p><p>To go back in time, I mainly referred to data published by the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> as they offered the most comprehensive year on year data. I looked at data from alternate years, from 2001 to 2019.</p><h2 id="starting-in-the-year-2000">Starting in the year 2000</h2><p>At the turn of the century, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2000/07/21/career/q_degreecompsci/">CNN Money</a> reported that the average starting salary for an entry-level computer programmer was $40,800.</p><p>Fresh graduates were also paid differently based on the degrees they held:</p><ul><li>Computer engineering: $49,505</li><li>Computer science: $48,740</li><li>Information science: $38,900</li><li>Management information systems: $41,800</li></ul><p>Due to the shortage of skilled workers going into tech fields, salaries in America for IT graduates became more and more competitive.

    Published 2021-02-25.
  </p>

  
    
  

  <h2 id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Back in November 2020, Stay SaaSy <a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/11/20/managing-workplace-crusaders.html">introduced</a> the term <em>workplace crusader</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tech startups attract passionate people. Large companies pay well and offer a great lifestyle, so the type of personality that wants to work at a startup is often especially ambitious or driven. This can be great, but can also present a number of management challenges. One of the most difficult traits to correctly harness at a growing company is a personality type that is compelled by perfectionism, often driven by a higher sense of righteousness.</p>
<p>I like to call these folks crusaders, as they’re driven by an almost religious passion to snuff out any problem that they see. A crusader is willing to die on any hill. No issue is too small – they attack problems like “the login page doesn’t work 10% of the time” and “Billy keeps writing user stories sloppily” with the same zeal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The post struck a chord with me because I am one of these people. (I asked one of my previous managers about it, and he wholeheartedly agreed.)</p>
<p>Stay SaaSy offered some good advice on how to manage workplace crusaders. But what if you are one yourself? Their post is still useful, as it can help you become easier to manage. Also, it is very clear on the importance of prioritization: You need to pick your battles.</p>
<p>However, I think there are additional things you should know. Having been involved with various organizations over the past 20 years, I have learned some lessons the hard way. Today, I want to share the seven most important of these with you. As a crusader, you have the potential to be very beneficial to the teams you end up working with. You just need to be smart about it.</p>
<p>Towards the end, I also speculate a bit on <a href="https://yngve.hoiseth.net/articles/being-a-workplace-crusader/#3-what-makes-someone-a-workplace-crusader">what makes a crusader</a>.</p>

</ol>
<h3 id="2-1-choose-your-organizations-wisely">2.1 Choose your organizations wisely</h3>
<p>Whether for paid employment or volunteer work, you will want to choose organizations that prioritize improvement. The variance is extreme.</p>
<p>As an example, I used to work in the (Norwegian) Army. That was a frustrating experience. For instance, I once reported to the unit that my team needed a new extension cord. Should be simple, right? Hell, no. Ten months and several follow-ups later, the cord had still not arrived.</p>
<p>The army is a huge beast that you would expect to be slow and resistant to change. But you can run into trouble in smaller organizations too. I once worked as a mechanic for a small bicycle repair shop. The shop was extremely messy. I tried tidying things up, but got berated by the owner, as he was used to the mess being the way it was. That was also not a good match for me.</p>
<p>So far, I have found tech startups to be the best fit. They may be a mess, but they are also very interested in making improvements, and they are anything but bureaucratic. There are probably other types of employers that would be a good fit too, such as manufacturing, franchising operations and some parts of management consulting.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in an organization that does not value your contributions, consider looking elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-accept-that-people-are-very-different">2.2 Accept that people are very different</h3>
<p>People’s personalities and talents vary widely. For example, some people are empathizers rather than systematizers. They might be very interested in helping and connecting with people and rather uninterested in some technical flaw that is very important to you. This doesn’t mean that there is something wrong with them. They are just different.</p>
<p>Others may also have very different priorities than you do. A problem with your customer service process might seem very important to you right now. But if your manager is struggling to meet payroll, they will not prioritize your request. And they will probably not tell you why.</p>
<h3 id="2-3-learn-to-fix-things-yourself">2.3 Learn to fix things yourself</h3>
<p>Every organization is, at least to some extent, a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2016716.2016740"><em>do-ocracy</em></a>. This means that you can often fix things yourself. You just have to learn how to do it. For example, you can learn how to <a href="http://automatetheboringstuff.com/">automate the boring stuff with Python</a>.</p>
<p>If you do decide to fix things yourself, make sure to be transparent about it. There is often a reason why things are the way they are, and changing them can have consequences that did not occur to you. (See <a href="https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence/">Chesterton’s Fence</a>. The more initiative you have, the more good judgment you need.) </p>
<p>Therefore, you need to let your manager know what you are doing and give them time to object. Over time, you will get better at judging your own ideas.</p>
<h3 id="2-4-be-concrete-explicit-and-constructive">2.4 Be concrete, explicit and constructive</h3>
<p>Stay SaaSy writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crusaders can exhaust their teams, and they can aggravate others who don’t share their idealism or perfectionism … If left unchecked they can transition into a more harmful place by becoming complainers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to avoid exhausting your colleagues, be concrete and explicit about your observations, uncertainties and expectations. For example, instead of saying “our customer service process sucks”, you could saying something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It took us 23 business days to be resolve our customer Carl’s issue. I think this harmed his impression of us. A lot of the delay seems to come from handovers. Maybe we should look into what happens when support agents hand over requests to others? I think we would also benefit from measuring these handover times somehow.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I am not sure that we need to prioritize this right away, as we may have some more pressing issues. But I think it should be a priority to look into this in the next three months or so.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="2-5-be-patient">2.5 Be patient</h3>
<p>Very few problems are really critical. In the words of Stay SaaSy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a few cases of letting minor issues go, it becomes easier to realize that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many problems naturally resolve themselves with time</li>
<li>Many other problems are not existential</li>
<li>If you leave these low severity or self-resolvable problems, you and your team have more energy to tackle the challenges that really matter. This can be surprisingly hard to do for people who are very invested in their work, but when done right it can add much-needed balance.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Related to this is Paul Graham’s advice to <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html">do things that don’t scale</a>.</p>
<h3 id="2-6-write-things-down-and-talk-to-your-colleagues">2.6 Write things down and talk to your colleagues</h3>
<p>Writing is very useful. It</p>
<ol>
<li>helps you get things out of your head;</li>
<li>makes it easier to deal with emotions;</li>
<li>adds clarity and therefore understanding;</li>
<li>builds lasting insight in the organization; and</li>
<li>levels the playing field between aggressive and passive communicators, different cultural backgrounds, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, it might be good to also schedule a meeting. There are three reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Many people, especially managers, have overflowing inboxes and use their calendar to manage their time. If it’s in their calendar, it’s happening. If not, who knows. Don’t be shy about inviting for meetings. If they think you ask for too many meetings, they will tell you. </li>
<li>Written communication is really hard. Before you know it, you have hurt or frustrated the other person. Talking is a lot easier, in part because you can pick up on their reactions continuously.</li>
<li>For many people, especially managers, writing feels like work. Talking to others is easier and more fun. Therefore, it might be easier to get a meeting with them than to get a written response.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-7-study-prior-art">2.7 Study prior art</h3>
<p>Simultaneously improving things and accepting the things you cannot improve is hard. Fortunately, a lot of people have shared their experiences. They can help you become more effective at moving your organization in the right direction as well as managing your emotions.</p>

<p>You might also be interested in Ruthanne Huising’s 2019 paper <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/orsc.2018.1277">Moving off the Map: How Knowledge of Organizational Operations Empowers and Alienates</a>.</p>
<h2 id="3-what-makes-someone-a-workplace-crusader">3 What makes someone a workplace crusader?</h2>
<p>Putting a name on the workplace crusader concept got me thinking about the psychology behind it. What kinds of people are more likely to become workplace crusaders? How could employers and career advisors identify them?</p>
<p>To speculate, I think there are a couple of personality traits that help predict crusading:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_to_experience">Openness to experience</a>: You need to be able to imagine a different state of things in order to want change.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism">Neuroticism</a>: The more dissatisfied you are with things, the more motivated you will be to fix them.</li>
</ol>
<p>As alluded to above, I think that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathising%E2%80%93systemising_theory">systematizers</a> tend to be more common among workplace crusaders.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Zimbardo#Time">Philip Zimbardo’s Time Perspective Theory</a>. I suspect that having a <em>future life goal-oriented time perspective</em> would make you more likely to be a workplace crusader. However, considering Zimbardo’s relaxed relationship with scientific integrity (<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-45337-001">paper</a>, <a href="http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-241-thibault-le-texier-on-debunking-the-stanford-prison-e.html">podcast episode</a>), I am hesitant to put too much weight on this.</p>
<p>I would love to hear from you if you know anything that would help me learn more about this. For example, what words would psychologists use if they were to write about workplace crusaders?</p>
<h2 id="4-conclusion">4 Conclusion</h2>
<p>To summarize, if you are a workplace crusader, I advise you to</p>

        <p>With the emergence of Bitcoin and recently proposed stablecoins from BigTechs, such as Diem (formerly Libra), central banks face growing competition from private actors offering their own digital alternative to physical cash. We do not address the normative question whether a central bank should issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or not. Instead, we contribute to the current research debate by showing how a central bank could do so, if desired. We propose a token-based system without distributed ledger technology and show how earlier-deployed, software-only electronic cash can be improved upon to preserve transaction privacy, meet regulatory requirements in a compelling way, and offer a level of quantum-resistant protection against systemic privacy risk. Neither monetary policy nor financial stability would be materially affected because a CBDC with this design would replicate physical cash rather than bank deposits.</p>

<p>Ferrocene is an effort led by Ferrous Systems and its newly formed subsidiary Critical Section GmbH to qualify the Rust Language and Compiler for use in the safety-critical domain. This is the third post in a series detailing our plans and actions around this effort, addressing topics discussed in <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/sealed-rust-the-pitch/">The Pitch</a> and <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/sealed-rust-the-plan/">The Plan</a>. Ferrocene's draft name was "Sealed Rust."</p>

<p>Our goal is to <strong>improve the status-quo of software quality and correctness in safety-critical domains</strong> by enabling the use of the Rust Programming Language for safety-critical software development. We believe that Rust is a significant improvement over existing tools both from a safety and quality perspective and as an improvement for developer productivity.</p>

<p>You can follow the progress on these efforts on the <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/">Ferrous Systems' Blog</a>, by <a href="https://eepurl.com/guoC6P">subscribing to our newsletter</a>, or by <a href="mailto:ferrocene@critical-section.com">contacting us directly</a>.
Ferrocene is currently looking for partner commitments! Please get in <a href="mailto:contact@critical-section.com">touch via email</a> if interested.</p>

<p>Since our last post in February 2020, we have moved Ferrocene from an idea to an actual project. We strengthened our contacts with interested companies and went deeper into our industrial and language research.</p>

<h2 id="finding-a-route-user-research">Finding a route: User Research</h2>

<p>Over the last 1.5 years, we have conducted several interviews with parties deploying software in safety-critical or mission-critical environments. The participants were diverse, from cloud providers to vehicle manufacturers. We found broad interest in adopting Rust in those industries.</p>

<p>There were several key takeaways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Rust as a language is seen as the big contender in critical spaces. Particularly, its focus on rigor and stability is seen as a major competitive advantage.</li>
  <li>At the same time, language evolution and improvement speed is also a crucial factor of interest.</li>
  <li>There is a desire for improvement over current language specification practices.</li>
  <li>Rust only having one main compiler at the moment is seen as a strength at the current phase of the language.</li>
  <li>Interviewed organisations see the language on a good trajectory towards their needs.</li>
</ol>

<p>On further investigation, we found a lot of openness and desire for modern, tool-assisted specification and verification techniques. Rust was regarded as being on a good path and quoted as being a language that was already easier to analyze and inspect than other languages. For that reason, we researched existing practices.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, we overwhelmingly found that the projects and tools already providing analysis and further safety guarantees operate on <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/04/19/MIR.html">MIR</a>, Rust's mid-level intermediate representation, and other IR rather than the Rust source language. They utilized MIR to carry program meaning in a simplified manner, enabling easier analysis and reasoning. As such, a desire expressed was visibility into changes to MIR and versioned stability.</p>

<p>When further interviewed on stability, organizations expressed a desire to adopt a technology that continually increases safety and assurance levels. Most organizations considered stability a consequence of structured, deliberate changes between documented milestones one can predictably target. We summed this up as "addressability". This framing resonated in interviewed organizations.</p>

<p>There was a high respect for Rust's software practices both inside and outside of the main project. It was mentioned as a strong point that many traditionally research-related tasks are conducted within the project.</p>

<p>In conclusion, there was a shared desire to produce safer, higher-quality software <strong>faster</strong> and a sense that <strong>fundamental changes are necessary</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="finding-an-orientation-why-ferrocene">Finding an orientation: why Ferrocene?</h2>

<p>A key question from these discussions with industry-leaders: what is Ferrocene, the product, and how does it relate to Rust? There was strong interest from potential clients that work that <em>can be</em> upstreamed into the Rust compiler <em>should be</em> wherever possible. We believe this points to a focus shift in the industry. Companies understand the value of FOSS as a neutral commons but also want to invest through initiatives that work towards their goals.</p>

<p>There are services required for mission and safety-critical industries that go beyond shipping a compiler. This includes (very) long-term support, qualification packages, industry-specific tooling, backends and targets, training, verification help and industry-specific advice. This is Ferrocene, the product.</p>

<p>During our conversations with industry leaders, we found that there's a need for Ferrocene as a wider initiative. Increasing the trust level of the Rust compiler will benefit many industries, and focusing only on typical safety-critical environments is one part of the picture. Improvements in the trust level of the core technology benefit <em>all</em> participants in the ecosystem. For example, we see efforts in better describing the semantics of Rust as it exists today as an important baseline for guiding the evolution of the language.</p>

<p>Ferrocene is both. It is a product to serve markets that need high assurances and committments. It is an initiative to take Rust to the next level of reliabilty and trust. Out of that comes a strong desire for collaboration.</p>

<h2 id="having-a-direction-first-waypoints">Having a direction: First Waypoints</h2>

<p>We intend to publish a solidified roadmap for Ferrocene by June 2021.</p>

<p>A major early milestone for Ferrocene is achievable criticality levels. Currently, we're aiming at ISO 26262/ASIL-B qualification readiness and general availability by the end of 2022. Along the way, we will work closely with early adopters to increase the toolchain's quality and gather feedback and experiences.</p>

<p>Ferrocene is a vehicle for a versioned Rust and MIR specification, paired with automated verification of Rust semantics. These "runnable specs" give developers in mission-critical and high-security environments a sound, proven, and addressable foundation for building critical libraries, analysis tools, and further system assurances.</p>

<p>Critical Section is also committed to improving the developer experience in mission and safety-critical industries. Ferrocene includes efforts to bring existing verification tools, like MIRI, to a production-ready state, while also improving the ease and advanced capabilities of formally verifying Rust programs.</p>

<h2 id="finding-partners-the-travel-group">Finding Partners: The travel group</h2>

<p>We have a lot of work ahead of us, but also a lot of experiences to tap into.</p>

<p>Ferrous Systems and Critical Section are calling for additional partners to join that effort! We're interested in partners from many industries, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Safety-critical sectors, such as automotive, railway and aerospace</li>
  <li>Operators of mission-critical infrastructure with high-reliability and security concerns, such as cloud vendors</li>
  <li>Hardware vendors</li>
  <li>Compiler vendors</li>
  <li>Organisations that require structured knowledge of their base systems</li>
  <li>Is interested in building strong, deep Rust knowledge now</li>
</ul>

<p>Partners also get early access to Ferrocene releases and can follow the development closely with engineer support.</p>

<p>If that describes your organisation, <a href="mailto:contact@critical-section.com">we're happy to be in touch</a>.</p>

<h2 id="starting-the-engine">Starting the engine</h2>

<p>In August 2020, Ferrous Systems GmbH created a wholly-owned subsidiary called Critical Section GmbH. Critical Section started work on Ferrocene in September 2020, setting up roadmaps, finalizing user research, and outreach to partners. Ferrocene is currently managed by Florian Gilcher and Sabree Blackmon.</p>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>

<p>We would like to thank Tim Reed and Jack Greenbaum from Green Hills Software for their constant advice, guidance and collaborative experimentation along the way.</p>

<p>YOUR ORDER HISTORY. Your credit card information. Even your intimate health data.</p>



<p>Amazon is amassing an empire of data as the online retailer ventures into ever more areas of our lives. But the company's efforts to protect the information it collects are inadequate, according to insiders who warn the company's security shortfalls expose users' information to potential breaches, theft and exploitation.</p>



<p>The warnings about privacy and compliance failures at Amazon come from three former high-level information security employees — one EU-based and two from the U.S. — who told POLITICO they had repeatedly tried to alert senior leadership in the company's Seattle HQ, only to be sidelined, dismissed or pushed out of the company in what they saw as professional retaliation. </p>



<p>The EU-based employee is fighting the terms of their departure from Amazon through European courts. All three spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern they could face retaliation or difficulties in the job market for discussing the details of non-public legal proceedings. </p>



<p>Put together, their accounts paint a picture of a corporate culture at Amazon that they say prioritizes growth over other factors, such as the security of customers' information, compliance with rules designed to safeguard that data and the careers of employees the company hired specifically to flag problems.</p>



<p>“Imagine if a company the size of Amazon had a breach? The issue is millions of people's personal identifiable information is at risk,” the first former U.S.-based information-security employee said.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Amazon said that maintaining customers' trust by protecting their privacy and ensuring the security of their data is a "long-standing top priority" for the company. </p>



<p>"These inaccurate, unsubstantiated and dated claims don’t reflect our commitment to keeping personal information safe. Amazon has comprehensive, long-established privacy and security policies, procedures and technologies in place. We regularly audit our services to ensure compliance and have zero tolerance for employees at all levels who do not follow our policies," he said. </p>



<p>At a time when lawmakers and government officials are ramping up scrutiny of tech companies on both sides of the Atlantic, the employees' complaints are likely to strike a chord with regulators.</p>



<p>While Amazon has faced plenty of heat over its labor practices — including alleged efforts to suppress union activity at its warehouses — its handling of data has received less attention.</p>



<p>Yet the company is one of Big Tech's most powerful players when it comes to data, thanks to the hoards of customer information it collects via its e-commerce platform, its online advertising business and its gigantic cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services. </p>



<p>Garfield Benjamin, a British academic <a href="https://inforrm.org/2020/01/29/amazon-echos-privacy-issues-go-way-beyond-voice-recordings-garfield-benjamin/" target="_blank">who has previously written about Amazon’s privacy lapses</a>, said that the company's "disregard for privacy and security" was indicative of a "big problem."</p>

<p>“It seems bizarre — although perhaps unfortunately all too common — that a company so intent on making data its primary business should have such poor practices,” Benjamin said when shown POLITICO’s findings. He added, "Is their hubris so great, their assumed power so unassailable, that they see themselves as completely untouchable?” </p>



<p>The consequence for consumers is more than potential loss of trust in Amazon's privacy and security practices. The company's practices leave it vulnerable<strong> </strong>to potential breaches or hacks that could put highly sensitive information into the hands of malicious actors. </p>



<p>The data Amazon holds includes order history, payment information, data collected through its advertising business and, for sellers on its platform, forms of identification. In the wrong hands, it could be held for ransom against the threat of online publication; deployed to defraud people; used to get access to other online accounts; or leveraged in phishing attacks in which stolen data is used to trick victims into paying a fee or revealing even more sensitive information.  </p>



<p>More broadly, the accounts raise questions about what corporate values are rewarded at a company that has risen quickly to become the world's dominant e-commerce player.</p>



<h3>Data labyrinth</h3>



<p>ACCORDING TO THE TWO U.S. information-security employees, data is at risk because Amazon has a poor grasp of what data it has, where it is stored and who has access to it. </p>



<p>“If you wanted to do a 'right to be forgotten,' it would be next to impossible for Amazon to identify all of the places where your data resides within their system,” said the first former U.S.-based employee. The right to be forgotten, or right to have data erased, is a key tool for citizens under several privacy regimes, including in Europe and California.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second U.S.-based information-security professional confirmed Amazon's shaky understanding of what reams of personal information it holds. “Amazon has grown so fast, it doesn't know what it owns … &nbsp;They don't know where their data is at, so they don’t know if they are protecting it correctly,” the person said.</p>



<p>The company’s track record on key data-security principles — controlling who has access to what data, patching vulnerabilities, ability to detect hacks, even whether passwords are changed regularly — came in for particular flak<strong> </strong>from all of the insiders who, together, have decades of experience in the area of information security.</p>



<p>“The quality of the controls that Amazon has in place is appalling. We found hundreds of thousands of accounts where the employee is no longer there but they still have system access,” said the first former U.S.-based employee, adding that such a vast number was possible because of Amazon's massive workforce and rapid staff turnover.<strong> </strong>Amazon said it has strict procedures in place when employees leave the company that remove their access.</p>



<p>Amazon has struggled to patch vulnerabilities in its systems. According to internal security reports from 2016 and 2017 seen by one of the former employees,<strong> </strong>the company declared that it was managing to patch between 55 to 70 percent of its systems. The first former U.S.-based employee likened that to leaving a house with several windows and doors open. </p>



<p>“Amazon’s information technology general controls, considering my experience and where I've been in the past, would not have passed muster with most auditors,” the first former U.S.-based employee said. "They were just poorly managed."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weak controls mean the company may not even detect a hack. An internal Amazon memo seen by one of the former employees from June 2018 deemed there was a “very high” possibility of critical financial loss or reputational damage to the business because of the company’s “inability to identify adversarial events.”</p>

<p>Amazon said it was not aware of the reports and does not believe the claims to be accurate. It said that any historic concerns that are flagged through routine internal reporting would be fixed, which is the purpose of these processes.</p>



<p>The second former U.S.-based employee confirmed that Amazon fails to properly control access to systems, and that, in a company whose workforce has grown to more than 1 million, reams of personal information are accessible to people who do not have the appropriate role or responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You've got tens of thousands of … teams connecting to big data," said the second former U.S.-based employee. "You should have a way to follow all the different types of data. From a technology point of view, you need to know where the data is going and how it's being protected. That does not exist,” they said.</p>



<p>The former employees were careful to distinguish between issues around Amazon’s internal approach to data compliance and the company’s leading track record in data-security engineering — visible through the products and services developed by AWS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AWS’s cloud computing products are used by the likes of the U.S. government, and are widely seen as world-beating in terms of data security. One ex-employee described the security tools at Amazon’s disposal as “second to none,” but they said the strength of AWS tools in keeping systems secure is still dependent on how the end user applies them. They also noted that AWS is largely run separately from the rest of the company.  </p>



<p>The issue, they said, is that Amazon's data-security capabilities are undermined by the willingness of the company to override internal controls.</p>



<p>For instance, according to two of the former information-security professionals, data needed for new projects was sometimes improperly classified so that it would go through fewer internal checks. </p>



<p>The company said this is false. A spokesperson said it has comprehensive privacy and security policies, procedures and technologies in place that are observed by executives at all levels. The company regularly audits services to ensure compliance and employees may not be involved in decision-making outside of their role’s remit.</p>



<h3>'Woefully behind'</h3>



<p>EUROPE'S DATA-PROTECTION RULEBOOK, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is credited by many for putting privacy on the agenda — especially within company boardrooms, where the fines of 4 percent of global turnover introduced by the legislation are often perceived as an existential threat.</p>



<p>Even so, it was only in late April 2018 — weeks before the regulation came into force — that Amazon created a dedicated team in the information-security department to address the incoming regulation. “The organization was woefully behind,” said the first former U.S.-based employee. Amazon said it had long-standing privacy and security teams and made a standard organizational change to centralize privacy resources in 2018.</p>

<p>The CAMSS driver for Qualcomm Image Signal Processors (ISPs) isn't new, but now has support for the next generation of ISP architecture.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linaro.org/">Linaro</a> has been working together with Qualcomm to enable camera support on
their platformssince 2017. The Open Source CAMSS driver was written to support the ISP IP-block with
the same name that is present on Qualcomm SoCs coming from the smartphone space.</p>
<p>The first development board targeted by this work was the DragonBoard 410C, which was followed in 2018 by
DragonBoard 820C support. Recently support for the Snapdragon 660 SoC was added to the driver,
which will be part of the v5.11 Linux Kernel release. These SoCs all contain the CAMSS
(Camera SubSystem) version of the ISP architecture.</p>
<p>Currently, support for the ISP found in the Snapdragon 845 SoC and the DragonBoard 845C is in
the process of being upstreamed to the mailinglists. Having seen major changes, the ISP is
no longer referred to as CAMSS, but is instead known as Titan.</p>
<p>The Titan architecture offers improvements in resolution, framerates and most other dimensions
of the ISP, and is the latest architecture shipped on modern Qualcomm chipsets.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>CAMSS is a V4L2 (Video for Linux 2) Linux driver which focuses on supporting the basic use cases of the ISP,
such as receiving the <a href="https://www.mipi.org/specifications/csi-2">MIPI CSI-2</a> signals from the sensors,
decoding them, and then writing them to memory. This leaves a lot of functionality typically provided
by an ISP unimplemented, but that is intentional as the development priority has been to enable the
data path from camera sensor to userspace.</p>
<p>The sub-components that the CAMSS drivers supports are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CSIPHY - the CSI PHYsical layer manages the physical electrical signals sent by camera sensors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CSID - the CSI Decoder decodes the CSI-2 encoded data transmitted by the sensors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VFE - the Video Front End formats received data and exposes it through to further hardware blocks.
The VFE block was renamed to IFE (Image Front End) in the Titan architecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RDI - the Raw Dump Interface is exposed by the VFE, and is used to write the raw decoded
CSI output directly to memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PIX - the PIXel interface is exposed by the VFE, and is used to transmit data prepared
for advanced processing by more specialized hardware blocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ISPIF - the Image Signal Processor InterFace ties together a lot of specialized hardware blocks
into a data pipeline which can provide various levels of additionalprocessing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Qualcomm ISP Gen 1 - CAMSS</h3>
<p>The first generation of the ISP hardware block supported by the (aptly named) CAMSS driver is
called CAMSS by Qualcomm.</p>
<p><a href="https://memcpy.io/images/2021-02-23_camss_gen1.svg"><img alt="Alt text" src="https://memcpy.io/images/2021-02-23_camss_gen1.svg" title="Qualcomm CAMSS ISP Generation 1">
</a></p>
<p>The CSIPHY, CSID &amp; VFE IP-blocks are relatively fully featured, but some functionality like
Virtual Channels are not implemented. However, a more substantial limitation of the ISPIF
support is that only basic cropping and rotation is currently implemented.</p>
<p>An obstacle caused by this limited ISPIF functionality is that it's not able to do format
conversions using the ISP. So whatever format the camera sensor is outputting, is directly
output to userspace. This can be a problem for Bayer pixel format sensors, because
they're poorly supported by userspace applications and require at least debayering to be
done in a post-processing step before the output can be viewed.</p>
<h3>Qualcomm ISP Gen 2 - Titan</h3>
<p>The next iteration of the Qualcomm ISP architecture is called Titan. The changes from Gen1
to Gen2/Titan can be summarized in two parts.</p>
<p><a href="https://memcpy.io/images/2021-02-23_camss_gen2_titan.svg"><img alt="Alt text" src="https://memcpy.io/images/2021-02-23_camss_gen2_titan.svg" title="Qualcomm CAMSS ISP Generation 2, Titan">
</a></p>
<p>The Titan frontend blocks (CSIPHY, CSID &amp; VFE) are almost identical between Gen1 and Gen2
with only minor structural changes and improvements.</p>
<p>However, the image processing pipeline has been revamped, and the ISPIF no longer exists.
What replaces it is an embedded CPU which is fed commands and in turn configures the
data processing blocks. Adding support for this CPU is beyond the current scope
of CAMSS due to the amount of work it would take to enable and the lack of documentation
for the CPU command stream. However, userspace applications are able to manage some of this
post processing. This is enough to support the most basic use cases, but many will be CPU/GPU
intensive and likely not have the same quality as an ISP based implementation would.</p>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>Linaro will continue to maintain this driver, and is likely to extend it to support
additional hardware platforms. However, contributions are very welcome and platforms
like the SDM630 and SSDM660 have already had support contributed to the CAMSS driver.</p>
<p>Currently <a href="https://libcamera.org/index.html">libcamera</a> is a very useful development tool
for working with CAMSS. It is more flexible than most V4L2 applications, and using the
<a href="https://libcamera.org/getting-started.html">libcamera/qcam</a> application makes it possible
to view live output of even Bayer camera sensors without the ISP doing any debayering.</p>
<p>Recent Linaro contributions towards libcamera have enabled GPU accelerated format conversion
and debayering for the <a href="https://libcamera.org/getting-started.html">libcamera/qcam</a> test
application, you can read more about that
<a href="https://www.linaro.org/blog/accelerating-libcamera-qcam-format-conversion-using-opengl-shaders/">here</a>.
Linaro has also contributed the Open Embedded <a href="http://cgit.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded/tree/meta-multimedia/recipes-multimedia/libcamera/libcamera.bb?h=master">libcamera recipe</a>
for developers building their products with Yocto Project based Linux distributions.</p>
<p>Other Linaro contributions to the Linux camera landscape include work in both
userspace with libcamera and in the kernel with camera sensor drivers,
ISP drivers and V4L2 API work.</p>
<p>Further developments regarding software and GPU debayering are expected for libcamera,
and hopefully the community will see libcamera debayering enabled for all of its data paths
soon enough.</p>

<p>Around 6 minutes (1250 words). Published 2021-02-24.</p>


<p>Postgres (or PostgreSQL, if you like) is an amazingly powerful database engine. I’ve recently been working hard on <a href="https://couchers.org/">Couchers.org</a>, and as part of that, I’ve come to really dig into Postgres and understand the incredible value of it. For our use case in an open-source project built by a handful of passionate volunteers, it’s very useful when we don’t need to pull in additional dependencies and complicate the architecture. To this end, we’ve found Postgres to be a really great fit: it just has so much functionality packed right into a stable and well supported package.</p>
<p>As part of implementing text search for Couchers, I’ve spent some time learning about the different ways of going about this using Postgres, so I jotted down some of the basic ideas.</p>
<p>Postgres has two types of text search: full text search, and trigram-based “fuzzy” search. What makes text special is the many idiosyncrasies of our natural language. In most SQL databases, you like to do very straightforward relational queries, <code>SELECT user_id, display_name WHERE username = 'aapeli'</code>, but text is not so easy. There’s a variety of differences that make the problem qutie tricky. Firstly, a word does not always come in the same form, for example <code>Examples!</code> has roughly the same semantic meaning as <code>example</code> (we also have synonyms, but these are much harder). Also, we’re all humans and we make mistakes, so often you will see spelling errors, and it’s nice to have a search engine that can be somewhat resilient to it. One can get away for very basic needs with <code>LIKE</code> and <code>ILIKE</code>, as we did, but it quickly starts limiting the usefulness of search when users really want to find topics of interest. (Note that the trigram module is able to speed up these queries as well through its index.)</p>
<p>This is not a full overview of the power of these tools, rather, it’s a quick teaser and introdution to how they work! I encourage you to go read the full Postgres docs if you find this fascinating, most of the content here is from reading those pages, playing around with these, and implementing a search for Couchers.</p>
<h2 id="full-text-search">Full text search</h2>
<p>Postgres full text search works by trying to <em>normalize</em> words, then match them up exactly. That is, it tires to get around the mesiness of the language by trying to understand it and turn all words with the same semantic meaning into one symbol. These symbols are called <em>lexemes</em> in Postgres. (Each original word may result in multiple lexemes at the end.)</p>
<p>Here’s an example using the default configuration:</p>
<pre><code># select to_tsvector('This is an example sentence.');
      to_tsvector
------------------------
 'exampl':4 'sentenc':5
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Stop words (short words that aren’t useful for search, e.g. ‘this’, ‘is’, ‘an’) are eliminated, punctuation is discarded, and the rest of the words are <em>stemmed</em>, so ‘example’ maps to the lexeme ‘exampl’, and so on. Notice that each lexeme is accompanied with positional information.</p>
<p>This allows indexing large document and matching up words exactly. To query now against this representation, we convert a query string into a <code>tsquery</code>:</p>
<pre><code># select websearch_to_tsquery('examples of sentences');
 websearch_to_tsquery
----------------------
 'exampl' &amp; 'sentenc'
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>That is, we’re looking for <em>documents</em> whose normalized forms contain both <code>exampl</code> and <code>sentenc</code> (the <code>&amp;</code> signifies logical “and”). Indeed, we get a match:</p>
<pre><code># select to_tsvector('This is an example sentence.') @@ websearch_to_tsquery('examples of sentences');
 ?column?
----------
 t
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Note that full text search is very language dependent due to the use of language-specific dictionaries. There are a variety of dictionaries available, and Postgres is additionally able to use different standard formats of dictionaries.</p>
<p>In Couchers, we’re currently using English. It’s not therefore good for words that aren’t “Englishy” and not in the dictionary, for example local place names. This causes some headaches for us.</p>
<p>There is a lot more Postgres full text search can do, including weighting different parts of a document (e.g. title, address, content) differently, ranking results with a variety of algorithms, and automatically creating snippets highlighting the matched portions of text. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html">Read more about these on the Postgres docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-details-in-couchers">Implementation details in Couchers</h3>
<p>We use the Postgres A/B/C/D classes for ranking, where each different searchable type has different sets of A/B/C/D. A is normally the title of the entity, e.g. the name of the community, the name of the user (or their username), page title, etc. B is normally the address or the user’s typed in city. C is any other primary text that’s more important than just the content, and D is all other text, main content, and so forth.</p>
<p>We use <code>websearch_to_tsquery</code> to turn an input into a <code>tsquery</code>. It’s safe to use with user-supplied input, and it has the usual web searchy operators:</p>
<ul>
<li>unquoted text requires each word to be in the search</li>
<li>quoted text requries each word to appear consequtively in the text</li>
<li>supports <code>or</code> and <code>-</code> (for negation)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trigram-search-fuzzy-search">Trigram search (fuzzy search)</h2>
<p>Trigram search works by breaking up words into consequtive triplets of characters, then looking these up in an index (though indexing is of course optional). With the right indexes, this scales to insane size and can be even used to implement indexed regular expressions over huge sets of text. Postgres supports this straight out of the box!</p>
<p>The basic search however, just basically needs to count overlapping trigrams.</p>
<p>To get started you need to install the <code>pg_trgm</code> extension which comes pre-packaged with Postgres:</p>
<pre><code># CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
CREATE EXTENSION
</code></pre><p>You can then get matching! Here’s an example sentence turned decomposed trigrams:</p>
<pre><code># select show_trgm('This is an example sentence.');
                                                                 show_trgm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {"  a","  e","  i","  s","  t"," an"," ex"," is"," se"," th",amp,"an ","ce ",enc,ent,exa,his,"is ","le ",mpl,nce,nte,ple,sen,ten,thi,xam}
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>A search query with a spelling error:</p>
<pre><code># select show_trgm('example sentnences');
                                         show_trgm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {"  e","  s"," ex"," se",apl,ces,enc,ent,"es ",exm,"le ",map,nce,nen,ntn,ple,sen,tne,xma}
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Now we can match against it:</p>
<pre><code># select word_similarity('example sentnences', 'This is an example sentence.');
 word_similarity
-----------------
       0.6666667
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Note that full text search would not match due to the spelling mistake:</p>
<pre><code># select to_tsvector('This is an example sentence.') @@ websearch_to_tsquery('example sentnences');
 ?column?
----------
 f
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Good on placenames:</p>
<pre><code># select word_similarity('joens', 'Joensuu, Finland');
 word_similarity
-----------------
       0.8333333
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Trigram search is much better for “fuzzy” matching, but it doesn’t understand text semantics at all, so it’s not ideal for proper full text search or when trying to locate topics in text, and it’s a bit trickier to rank large documents. It can also be a bit tricky to get the indexes right: if a search query results in no trigrams, Postgres falls back to a full table scan… ouch!</p>
<p>However, it should be very good for searching short titles/addresses, and we in Couchers use it against the “A” class from above. Meaning basically that we do this kind of trigram matching against usernames, city names, users’ display names, and so on. Things that don’t generally have a lot of “semantic meaning” and where people easily make typos! <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html">Read more about <code>pg_trgm</code> on the Postgres docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-details-in-couchers-1">Implementation details in Couchers</h3>
<p>We use <code>unaccent</code> first on the query and text to be queried to remove accents and normalize text before trigram matching (which discards non-alphanumeric characters). We match against the A list only. We weight trigram similarity a bit higher than the text search results.</p>
<h2 id="further-reading">Further reading</h2>

        <p><a href="https://architectelevator.com/strategy/complex-topics-stick/">Part 1 of this mini-series</a> described how a good presentation should combine actual experience, mental models, and a punch line, realizing that this model closely maps to  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion" target="_blank">Aristotle’s Modes of Persuasion</a> from some 2300 years ago:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ethos: Credibility or authority of the presenter (literally meaning “character”)</li>
  <li>Logos: Reasoning and logical appeal</li>
  <li>Pathos: An appeal to the audience’s emotions (“empathy” is a related term that helps memorizing this one)</li>
</ul>

<p>Experience adds to ethos because it gives you credibility, mental models use logos to show the audience how pieces relate to each other (one could say, this is “architecture”), and a memorable punch line can stir emotions, such as surprise or humor. Having been around some 2300 years, Aristotle’s model is widely cited and shared, including in my own book.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients-alone-dont-make-a-cake">Ingredients Alone Don’t Make a Cake</h2>

<p>To make these elements fruitful in a presentation, they need to be strung together into a flow. Here we encounter the limitations of a simple model like this one that’s included in <a href="https://architectelevator.com/book">The Software Architect Elevator</a> in the chapter about Showing Pirate Ships (to figure that one out, you’ll have to go and read <a href="https://architectelevator.com/book">the book</a>):</p>

<p><img src="https://architectelevator.com/assets/img/presenting_modes_persuasion.png" alt="Modes of persuasion"></p>

<p>This picture is a prototypical model (by now you surely know that I like models): it breaks down a complex topic into its components, abstracting away noise and highlighting the important aspects. One could even say it’s the architecture of a good speech—at least it passes the test of having lines.</p>

<p>However, the model is missing some important aspects. It’s like a recipe that shows us the ingredients but it doesn’t tell much how much of each ingredient we need and how we put them together. It’ll be rather difficult to bake a tasty cake based on a list of ingredients alone (insert my pet peeve about “my architecture is <em>product X</em> and <em>product Y</em>” right here).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Upping ethos and pathos from the typical 2% (allocating 96% to logos) to about 20% makes a world of difference for technical presentations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s start with the percentage of ingredients (I’ll leave the putting together for <em>Part 3</em>). The typical technical presentation tends to consist of 96% logos, leaving perhaps 2% each for ethos and pathos, leaving a lot of improvement to balance things out. Shifting things to perhaps 60% logos and 20% ethos and pathos each will make a world of difference. After all, we are still talking about complex technical topics, but we shouldn’t make it a purely technical talk.</p>

<p><img src="https://architectelevator.com/assets/img/complex_topics_2_balance.png" alt="Balancing out a technical talk" title="Balancing out a technical talk"></p>

<p>At the same time, technical presentations needn’t be 1/3 each or flip completely the other way, like many Ted talks do. You might be making your IT great again but your audience is likely to want to hear some logos on how exactly that’s going to work.</p>

<h2 id="going-to-extremes">Going to Extremes</h2>

<p>Injecting more logos and pathos into technical presentations has been one of my favorite exercises in my <a href="https://architectelevator.com/workshops">live workshops</a> (I don’t offer them at the moment). To highlight the power of ethos, logos, and pathos, I presented the same argument in three short speeches that turn each dial to “10”, respectively.</p>

<p>Let’s assume your job is to convince people that moving faster is the essential element of your organization’s digital transformation (I do like very realistic examples). Here are three ways to go about this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>“<em>The digital world charts new territory with new business models and new ways of interacting with customers. Such novel techniques have to be tested via experiments. Now, it doesn’t do much good if each experiment takes 18 months, therefore moving fast is the most essential property for organizations that are successful in economies of speed.</em>”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<em>We often debate how we can better compete with so-called digital disruptors. Well, after spending over a decade working as a software engineer in Silicon Valley, I point to one fundamental advantage those companies have: they are simply moving faster.</em>”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<em>Our company just posted another record quarter. So did Kodak, a few quarters before they went bankrupt. They were simply not moving fast enough. But we don’t have to make the same mistake.</em>”</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As you likely guessed correctly, the first snippet is 90% logos (“from A follows B follows C”), the second one 90% ethos (“I was there and am here to tell you”), and version three is pure pathos (“hey, we’re doing great! No, actually we’re doomed. But there’s hope…”).</p>

<p>Going to extremes (bonus points for anyone who was thinking of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QorpDX-GgY" target="_blank">Kaleidoscope</a> by Paul van Dyk with vocals by Jan Johnston) demonstrates that the three elements aren’t just minor variations, but result in completely different speeches. That’s the magic of ethos, logos, and pathos. Digital transformations are the perfect place for such mixes as they are at the intersection of technology and organizational changes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ethos, logos, and pathos aren’t just minor variations but result in completely different speeches.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="amplifying-ethos-and-pathos">Amplifying Ethos and Pathos</h2>

<p>After understanding the potential of ethos and pathos, it’s useful to know some handy techniques to increase their share in your presentations. It’s like putting more butter and sugar into your cake or your cookies: they can only get better!</p>

<p>The big difference between ethos and pathos is that ethos about you, whereas pathos is mostly about the audience. Let’s start close to home:</p>

<h3 id="more-ethos">More Ethos</h3>

<p>A little ethos goes a long way. It helps overcome the initial hurdle that any presentation must take: convince the audience that listening to you is more valuable than checking email or browsing the web.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experience</strong>: We saw already in part 1 that experience builds ethos. Sharing your experience from a concrete project leaves a stronger impression than an abstract framework.</li>
  <li><strong>Affiliation</strong>: Related, your affiliation (along with titles or degrees) can also impact your ethos. Before you add “ex-Google, ex-ThoughtWorks” to your LinkedIn tag line, remember that this can go both ways–you wouldn’t write “failed at most  big tech companies” either, so it’s all about the dosage (yes, Mr./Mrs. “PMP, PRINCE, CCP, MCTS, MIA”, I am looking at you).</li>
  <li><strong>References</strong>: The experience doesn’t always have to be yours–you can also cite external, credible sources. If <a href="https://martinfowler.com/aboutMe.html" target="_blank">Martin Fowler</a> / Gartner / Jeff Bezos said it, it must be (mostly) true!</li>
  <li><strong>Appearance</strong>: We shouldn’t base technical credibility on appearance alone but your audience is pre-programmed to form judgment base on your looks and outfit. If you don’t like it, you might need to have a work with the ultimate chief architect, or just accept it. For example, who would want to question <a href="https://handbookofsoftwarearchitecture.com/about/" target="_blank">Grady Booch’s credibility about architecture</a>?</li>
  <li><strong>Speech Patterns</strong>: Some have observed my annoyance with the fact that <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/naturally-selected/201306/the-sound-leader-ceos-deep-voices-do-better" target="_blank">deep voices make speakers more credible</a>. Not only does it amplify gender bias, but I also end up listening to deep, slow voices far too often. But before you get the vocoder out, there are more subtle ways to boost a bit of ethos. For example, slowing down your pace, pausing, or varying your vocal patterns can also make you appear more authoritative.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="more-pathos">More Pathos</h3>

<p>Pathos is about your audience: many speakers are very excited about their topic but the audience isn’t. That’s not pathos, but pathetic. First, I tend to remind technical speakers of the breadth of emotions that we can feel, in case one or two became forgotten while typing code into a text editor all day. A nice way to illustrate emotions is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Plutchik" target="_blank">Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://architectelevator.com/assets/img/plutchik-wheel.svg" alt="Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions"></p>

<p>In my little speech above I used at least four emotions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I began with <em>pride</em> and <em>optimism</em></li>
  <li>Next, I gave the audience a <em>surprise</em></li>
  <li>Then I triggered <em>fear</em></li>
  <li>I conclude with <em>hope</em> and <em>anticipation</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Not all pathos relies on strong, one-dimensional emotions like these. There are many simple techniques to “liven up” technical presentations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stories and Anecdotes</strong>: stories used to be the way knowledge was passed for millennia, so humans are well attuned to listening to stories. Watch people cry when watching a move - that’s the power of pathos. Again, success lies in the balance - some people feel that they need to package their technical content into a long heart-wrenching story. That’ll surely miss many people’s (surely mine!) marks. So think about short anecdotes more than long-winded stories. You don’t want your core messages gone with the wind…</li>
  <li><strong>Analogies and Metaphors</strong>: Analogies allow you to relate your mental models (logos!) to something the audience is already familiar with and often has positive associations with (pathos!). One of my favorite examples is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqEeIG8aPPk" target="_blank">short speech by the late Russ Ackoff</a> on continual improvement. Almost each statement he makes about complex systems is related back to the automobile (<a href="https://youtu.be/OqEeIG8aPPk?t=252">4:12</a>) or the human body (<a href="https://youtu.be/OqEeIG8aPPk?t=274" target="_blank">4:34</a>)  - notice the audience’s emotion as they are listening to an academic talk about complex systems theory.</li>
  <li><strong>Concrete Figures</strong>: Even little things like replacing words like “big”, “sizable”, or “many” with concrete figures can make a presentation more relatable. So, next time you talk about scalability, reference the customer who had “thousands” of microservices and had to manage “several hundred” custom VMs.</li>
  <li><strong>Punch Lines</strong>: We saw in Part 1 that short, memorable punchlines or slogans can also stir emotions, and such boost pathos. “Don’t run software you didn’t build” is more pathos than “a modern enterprise prefers a SaaS model of cloud computing for COTS applications”.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-right-kind-of-pathos">The Right Kind of Pathos</h3>

<p>Not all emotions are positive, though. Remember Plutchik’s wheel: there you’ll find contempt, loathing, rage, and sadness. That’s not the kind of pathos you’re going to want to inject into your audience. Therefore, here a (likely incomplete) list of techniques that avoid some of the biggest emotional pitfalls in technical presentations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Arrogance</strong>: Most people listen to you because you can tell them that they don’t …</li></ul></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> There is work in progress to bring compact debug type information into the kernel, which will be leveraged by <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/740157/">BPF</a> to get it to the next level in terms of developer experience and capabilities. We developed an algorithm that compresses <strong>124MB</strong> of DWARF type data into just <strong>1.5MB</strong> of compact BTF type data, making it suitable to be included in the Linux kernel image by default.</p>
<!--truncate-->

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/740157/">BPF</a> is a technology that allows unprecedented ability to execute custom external code <strong>safely</strong> inside the Linux kernel in response to various events/hooks. This enables all kinds of applications, that are either impossible or expensive to achieve by other means (e.g., low-overhead profiling and tracing, rich introspection, fast custom packet processing, etc.).</p>
<p>While the BPF technology is already very capable and is constantly being developed further, the current developer experience with it is not exactly a walk in the park yet. One way to smooth out the developer experience with BPF is through better introspection and debuggability of BPF code. To allow that, BPF needs to know a bunch of metadata information about the BPF program. Type information is one of a few critical pieces of metadata necessary to bring the BPF experience to the next level. Eventually, this metadata will enable not just introspection, but also much higher levels of re-usability of BPF code across different versions of the Linux kernel (the so-called "compile once, run everywhere" approach).</p>
<p>How is such metadata represented in normal, non-BPF programs? It's typically done through <a href="http://www.dwarfstd.org/doc/Debugging%20using%20DWARF.pdf">DWARF</a> debug information. The problem with DWARF though, is that it's very generic and expressive, which makes it a quite complicated and verbose format, and thus unsuitable to include in the Linux kernel image due to size overhead and the complexity of parsing it.</p>
<p>Enter BTF (<a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg226733.html">BPF Type Format</a>). It's a minimalistic, compact format, inspired by Sun's CTF (Compact C Type Format), which is used for representing kernel debug information since Solaris 9. BTF was created for similar purposes, with a focus on simplicity and compactness to allow its usage in the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>We won't describe BTF in a lot of detail here—see the links above to get complete information. Suffice it to say that BTF represents each type with one of a few possible type descriptors identified by <em>kind</em>: <code>BTF_KIND_INT</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_ENUM</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_STRUCT</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_UNION</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_ARRAY</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_FWD</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_PTR</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_CONST</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_VOLATILE</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_RESTRICT</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_TYPEDEF</code>—a few more might be added soon for functions support. Depending on the kind, there might be additional variable-sized information available. Some kinds of types can reference other types using their type IDs (e.g., <code>int*</code> type is two type descriptors: <code>PTR</code> → <code>INT</code>). The type descriptor's ID is its position in the input array of all descriptors. BTF type information is stored in <code>.BTF</code> ELF section, which contains two parts: BTF type descriptors, followed by <code>\0</code>-separated strings section.</p>
<p><img src="https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/bpf/blog/assets/btf-dedup-example.png" alt="Sample C code and its corresponding BTF type graph"></p>
<p>The diagram above should give a pretty good idea of the BTF type graph. It shows some C source code on the left and its corresponding BTF type graph on the right. The type with ID 0 is special, it represents <code>void</code> and is implicit: the first type descriptor in the <code>.BTF</code> section has type ID 1. In all the diagrams  in this blog post, type IDs are written out in the top-left corner of each type node. Type references are marked with arrows. For structs/unions it should be obvious from the diagrams which field references which type. Note that type nodes are shown in two different colors: green for non-reference types, and red for reference once (this distinction will be explained further below).</p>
<p>A well-known (within the kernel community) tool, <code>pahole</code>, was recently updated with the ability to convert DWARF into corresponding BTF type information in a straightforward, one-to-one fashion. It iterates over each DWARF type descriptor, converts it trivially into a BTF type descriptor and embeds all of them into the <code>.BTF</code> section in the ELF binary. Simple and easy. We're done, right? Unfortunately, not yet.</p>
<p>DWARF information is emitted by the compiler for each compilation unit (CU) (e.g., in the C/C++ world that is a single compiled .c/.cpp file) independently and in isolation from other compilation units that form the resulting binary. This means that DWARF information within a single CU has to describe all types referenced directly and indirectly (e.g., through struct fields) by code within that CU, down to primitive types like <code>int</code> and <code>long</code>. DWARF data from all CUs is then concatenated by the linker and put into the resulting binary <code>.debug_info</code> (and a few other) ELF sections. As you can imagine, this results in a great duplication of type information. For instance, for the kernel image on my machine, DWARF type data (<code>.debug_info</code> section) takes 121.31MB and strings (<code>.debug_str</code> section) take another 2.68MB. After <code>pahole</code>'s DWARF-to-BTF conversion there are 3.15 million BTF type descriptors: BTF type data takes 101.7MB, and strings take an additional 3.03MB.</p>
<p>There are still other problems though. The same type hierarchy (e.g., struct and all the types that struct references) can be represented in DWARF/BTF to various degrees of completeness (or rather, incompleteness) due to struct/union forward declarations.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at an example, that we'll use throughout this note to better understand the problem and solution. Suppose we have two compilation units, each using same <code>struct S</code>, but each of them having incomplete type information about struct's fields:</p>
<pre><code>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>;</span>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span> {</span>
    <span>int</span> a;
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>self</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>* <span>parent</span>;</span>
};

<span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>;</span>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span> {</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>a_ptr</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>b_ptr</span>;</span>
};




<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>;</span>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>;</span>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span> {</span>
    <span>int</span> b;
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>self</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>* <span>parent</span>;</span>
};

<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span> {</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>a_ptr</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>b_ptr</span>;</span>
};
</code></pre>
<p>In the case of CU #1, DWARF (and subsequently, BTF) data will know only that <code>struct B</code> (but no other) exists, but will know the complete type information about <code>struct A</code>. While for CU #2, it will know the full type information about <code>struct B</code>, but will only know about the forward declaration of <code>struct A</code> (in BTF terms, it will have <code>BTF_KIND_FWD</code> type descriptor with name <code>B</code>).</p>
<p>This compilation unit isolation means that it's possible there is no single CU with complete type information describing structs <code>S</code>, <code>A</code>, and <code>B</code>. Also, we might get tons of duplicated and redundant type information. Unfortunately, for BPF use cases that are going to rely on BTF data, it's important to have a single and complete type information per each unique type, without any duplicates and incompleteness.</p>
<p>That means we need to have an algorithm, that would take this duplicated and potentially incomplete BTF information and emit nicely deduplicated type information, while also "reconstructing" complete type information by merging pieces of it from different CUs. Such BTF data can then be embedded into the Linux kernel image and readily utilized by both the kernel itself (e.g., by BPF verifier for more advanced verification scenarios), as well as external tooling to allow types introspection and better debugging capabilities.</p>
<p>Additional complications we need to keep in mind come from the fact that types, in general, can form graphs containing cycles, not just DAGs. The example above has few type cycles, which we'll use as an opportunity to better demonstrate in subsequent sections how the algorithm works. Type cycles are very common in real programs: they're typical for linked list nodes, but any moderately complex program probably would form much more complicated cycles. The Linux kernel's <code>struct task_struct</code> is part of pretty big connected type graph with multiple cycles!</p>
<p>So, in summary, we need an algorithm that will:</p>
<ul>
<li>deduplicate redundant BTF information and leave single instance of each unique type;</li>
<li>merge and reconstruct complete type information across multiple CUs;</li>
<li>handle type cycles correctly and efficiently;</li>
<li>do all of the above fast and reliably to become a part of Linux kernel build process.</li>
</ul>
<p>This note describes one such BTF deduplication (or "dedup", for short) algorithm.</p>

<p>The BTF dedup algorithm takes as an input an in-memory blob representing <code>.BTF</code> ELF section with all BTF type descriptors and string data, that comes separately from descriptors. It overwrites that memory in-place with deduplicated types and strings without any loss of information.</p>
<p>While the algorithm does deduplication, it also merges and resolves type information, whenever possible. For instance, in the example above with two compilation units having partial type information for structs <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, the output of the algorithm will emit a single copy of each BTF type that describes structs <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>S</code> (as well as type information for <code>int</code> and pointers), as if they were defined in a single compilation unit (see the diagram below for a visual representation of input and expected output BTF type graphs):</p>
<pre><code><span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span> {</span>
    <span>int</span> a;
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>self</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>* <span>parent</span>;</span>
};

<span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span> {</span>
    <span>int</span> b;
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>self</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>* <span>parent</span>;</span>
};

<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span> {</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>a_ptr</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>b_ptr</span>;</span>
};
</code></pre>

<h2>Algorithm summary</h2>
<p>The algorithm completes its work in five separate passes, which we'll describe briefly here and in detail in subsequent sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strings deduplication:</strong> Deduplicate string data, re-write all string offsets in BTF type descriptors to simplify string comparisons later.</li>
<li><strong>Non-reference types deduplication:</strong> Establish equivalence between and deduplicate integer, enum, struct, union and forward types.</li>
<li><strong>Reference types deduplication:</strong> Deduplicate pointers, const/volatile/restrict modifiers, typedefs, and array.</li>
<li><strong>Type compaction:</strong> Compact type descriptors leaving only unique ones.</li>
<li><strong>Type IDs fix up:</strong> Update all referenced type IDs with new ones established during compaction.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also a few important ideas and data structures the algorithm relies on, which are critical to understanding it and would be useful to keep …</p></span></p></div></div></div>

The most fun was <strong>webmentions</strong> and I'm here to convince you to add them!</p><p>First, let me step back and explain why webmentions exist—the IndieWeb.</p><p>Check out this official description of the IndieWeb:</p><blockquote><p>The IndieWeb is a community of individual personal websites, connected by simple standards, based on the principles of owning your domain, using it as your primary identity, to publish on your own site (optionally syndicate elsewhere), and own your data—<strong>indieweb.org</strong></p></blockquote><p>So, a community of personal websites, connected together, used as identities, that makes ownership of data possible. 🦄 🌈 How does this all work?</p><ul><li>There's a <a href="https://indieweb.org/">great IndieWeb resource</a> that will tell you everything you need to know</li><li>But, start here if you want to know <a href="https://indieweb.org/why">why the IndieWeb deserves your attention</a></li><li>When you're convinced, see this handy page for a <a href="https://indiewebify.me/">quick start to becoming a citizen of the IndieWeb</a></li><li>International IndieWebCamps are here to help—I wrote a <a href="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/indiewebcamp/">post about my first IndieWebCamp visit</a><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/grow-the-indieweb-with-webmentions/img/indiewebcamp2017.png" alt="Nuernberg IndieWebCamp 2017"><figcaption>Nürnberg IndieWebCamp 2017 (I'm in the bottom right)</figcaption></figure></li></ul><p>Now the juicy stuff!</p><p>I think the coolest thing about the IndieWeb is that it is decentralised. Currently, there is a handful of corporations that own much of our data. With webmentions, each person owns their own data and each person can communicate with others. Webmentions are basically a way to display on your personal site ways that others have interacted with your content.</p><p>On my site I display mentions and bookmarks. It's possible for someone to link to one of my blog posts within one of their blog posts or bookmarks. If they do this, I won't know about it unless they let me know about it. <a href="https://webmention.app/">Letting others know you've mentioned their posts can be done manually or can be automated</a>.</p><p>I also display likes, retweets and replies on blog posts that I have tweeted about. If the URL to my post is in my tweet, I can gather the interactions on that tweet and display them on that post. Although most social media platforms do not support webmentions, it's possible to gather them by using a great free service called <a href="https://brid.gy/">Bridgy</a>.</p><p>Some people have had webmentions on their site for many years, so I am a bit behind. <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/6495">Jeremy has had webmentions since 2013</a>. But, there are more people posting content online than ever before, and personal websites aren't shown the love they used to get.</p><p>So, there has never been a more pressing need to put content creation platforms (e.g. Medium) and social media platforms (e.g. Twitter) second, and put your very own little corner of the web first 💖</p><p>I used Max Böck's post on <a href="https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/">using webmentions in Eleventy</a> to get started. I was able to get something on the screen quickly with Max's advice, and then I refined the incoming data a bit. Here is a summary of what I did:</p><ul><li>Sign up via <a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a> - if this doesn't work right away, check out ways to <a href="https://indielogin.com/setup">set up your website for indie logins</a> (I'm able to sign in by linking to my GitHub account on my site's homepage)</li><li>Add two <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags to your HTML document's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element: <code>&lt;link rel="pingback" href="https://webmention.io/{your-domain-here}/xmlrpc"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link rel="webmention" href="https://webmention.io/{your-domain-here}/webmention"&gt;</code></li><li>For social media mentions, sign up to <a href="https://brid.gy/">Bridgy</a></li><li>Fetch <strong>all</strong> of your site's webmention data in JSON format using one of the <a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io#api">webmention endpoints described by IndieWebCamp co-founder Aaron Parecki</a> and the API token provided by <a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a></li><li>Shape your webmention data however you like - I filter webmentions into separate re-tweet, reply, like, mention, and bookmark functions using the <code>'wm-property'</code> (check out the <a href="https://github.com/ambrwlsn/website/blob/1d713ad9fbce19a9bd8821790fd51c1be62e1f76/src/filters/webmentions-filter.js#L51">filter functions</a> and before you say anything, yes I know they could be DRYer)</li><li>Use the data to display webmentions on your blog posts</li></ul><p>Here are some of my webmentions (from <a href="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/from-gatsby-to-eleventy/">my Gatsby to Eleventy post</a>):</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/grow-the-indieweb-with-webmentions/img/webmentions.png" alt="Amber's webmentions on her Gatsby to Eleventy post"></p><p>If all of this seems too difficult and inaccessible, please don't give up! I thought getting webmentions on my little static site would be <strong>way too difficult</strong>. But there are so many wonderful posts about setting up webmentions, and so many great people willing to help. I count myself as one of those people :) If you want to implement webmentions on your site and are stuck on any of the points I listed above, ping me on Twitter and I'll do my best to help out.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>sK1 is an open source cross-platform vector graphics editor like CorelDRAW, Adobe Illustrator, or Freehand.
    The major feature of sK1 is a professional precise printing and prepress ready PDF output.</p>

<p>sK1 2.0 is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">licensed under GPL v3</a>.
    So you may use this application as for personal or commercial purposes without any fees.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Application supports basic vector graphics primitives: rectangles, rounded rectangles, ellipses, pies, sectors,
        chords, polygons, Bézier curves, text and bitmaps.</p>

    <p>The objects may be structured on pages, layers and just in selectable groups/containers. Pages within a document
        can be of different sizes.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Bézier curves are fundamental rendering units. All the primitives can be converted into curves. We use
        <a href="https://www.cairographics.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cairo library</a>
        to render these curves on the screen. </p>

    <p>Thanks to cairo we have cross-platform unified antialiased rendering, similar to PostScript/PDF definitions.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Like PS/PDF definitions, sK1 2.0 provides solid fill, gradient fill and pattern fill for graphics primitives. Also
        the objects can be outlined by solid stroke</p>

    <p>Like for PDF objects, alphachannel is available for solid fill, gradient stops and for stroke color.
        Application supports RGB, CMYK and Grayscale colorspaces. SPOT colors are also supported.</p>
    <p><i>Note: PANTONE® colors are just a special case of SPOT colors.</i></p>

    </p>
    <p>Inside sK1 2.0 all the color values and raster images are under color management. We use
        <a href="http://www.littlecms.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LittleCMS library</a>
        for these purposes. </p>

    <p>Despite of built-in profiles, end users can use own color profiles to customize color management engine.
        Printer emulation on screen option is also available.</p>

            <img src="https://sk1project.net/content/pages/00005/page_sk1_05_preview.png"></a>
    </p>
    <p>sK1 2.0 text engine has a full-function rendering of multi-language text and cross-platform support because it's
        powered by <a href="https://pango.gnome.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pango library</a></p>

    <p>Thanks to this library, application handles text layout for particular combinations of script and font backend.
        Modules for Hebrew, Arabic, Hangul, Thai, and a number of Indic scripts are supported.</p>
    <br>
</div>

<p><a href="https://sk1project.net/uc2/">UniConvertor 2.0</a> is a core package of sK1 2.0 application. UC2 provides extended import/export
        functionality of different vector graphics, raster image and color palette file formats. Thus sK1 2.0 is connected
        to existent open source and commercial graphics software like Inkscape, Gimp, CorelDRAW, Adobe Illustrator,
        Xara Designer etc.</p>

<p>sK1 2.0 user interface is built on <a href="https://www.wxwidgets.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
        wxWidgets toolkit</a>. This toolkit allows easy porting application on MS Windows and macOS without rewriting
        tonnes of GUI code.

You might have never heard of an "<a href="https://wor.do/idle_asset">idle asset</a>" before. But you probably have a good idea of what it means. Even your grandmas first guess of what an “idle asset” is, is likely to be correct.</p><p>

This cannot be said of <i>“product market fit”</i>.<br>
Ask 10 people, grandmas or even Y-Combinator applicants, and the answers will be all over the place.</p><p>

<b>Michael Seibel chips in</b></p><p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xx912ku.jpg" width="100%">

<small><i>"You have reached product market fit when you are overwhelmed with usage—usually to the point where you can’t even make major changes to your product because you are swamped just keeping it up and running."</i>[1]</small></p><p>

Another YC partner said that demand is growing <i>soooo</i> fast, that you just want to die.</p><p>
<i>"If you don't want to die, you don't have product market fit"</i>.</p><p>

So the people who popularized the term, say it's synonymous to <i>extreme growth</i> or <i>incredible demand</i>. Then why not call it that? Anyone and their grandma will understand such terms right away.</p><p>


<b>"Dominance"</b></p><p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UHRVkCj.png" width="100%"></p><p>
Google basically <i>owns</i> the search market. They absolutely <i>dominate</i> it. Perhaps, "product market fit" is just a euphemism to avoid using the term dominant. Hmm.</p><p>

<b>So what does product market fit really mean?</b><br>
It simply means that your product and its market have found each other, and by extension, that often means seeing serious growth. Though sometimes, the product is catered towards a niche audience, in which case it might not become the next Google, while still enjoying <i>product market fit</i>.</p><p>

<b>Naval's got something to say too</b></p><p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9g9dJVk.png" width="100%"><br>

Is that really so Naval? 🧐<br>
By that definition, many of the sideprojects I built, that went absolutely nowhere, all had product market fit. Yay. </p><p>

In reality, many nice sounding quotes require the stretching of a definition in order to make sense.<br>Example: <i>"Real wealth is having lots of free time"</i>.</p><p>
It sounds great, right? But, can you transfer this "real wealth" to your cousin from Bangladesh who's working 14 hours a day? I like Naval, though, I think that one was a miss. But I digress..</p><p>

<b>OK, so now what?</b><br>
When possible, use simple words. YC is big on avoiding <a href="https://wor.do/buzzword">buzzwords</a>, yet they throw around <i>product market fit</i> left and right, leaving many people confused. Just say <i>extreme growth</i>, or any alternative that is understood quickly.




</p><!--
Here’s a few terms that do a better job at describing product market fit, than product market fit<br>

* Extremely rapid growth<br>
* Painfully fast growth<br>
* Long lasting growth<br>
* Rapid Compound growth<br>
</li>

<br><br>
I could write a PHP random word generator, and come up with many more terms that do a better job at describing product market fit, than product market fit does.

It's a benefit&nbsp;often used to attract employees into highly technical jobs in the public service.</p>  <p>"CSE management is refusing to apply a wage increase to the portion of workers' salaries that is&nbsp;made up of market allowances," said Silas.</p>  <p>"To give you an idea, for some of these workers [that] represents as much as 10 per cent of their annual income.&nbsp;So it's a significant financial loss."</p>  <p>The vote&nbsp;does not mean&nbsp;workers are&nbsp;heading for the picket lines.</p>  <p>"We are now ramping up preparations and coordinating with our members to determine the precise actions that will be taken and their timing. But we emphasize that strike action can still be avoided if CSE management comes back to the table and steps away from its concession or agrees to arbitration," said PSAC spokesperson&nbsp;Alroy Fonseca.</p>  <h2>CSE says services will continue</h2>  <p>Christopher Williams, director general of CSE public affairs and communications services, said CSE's executive management team continues to work toward&nbsp;a resolution with the union.</p>  <p>"However, we can tell you that essential service agreements are in place to ensure that all areas of&nbsp;CSE&nbsp;have the people at work necessary to continue to provide for the safety and security of the public in the event of a strike," he said in an email to CBC News.</p>  <p>CSE has been sounding the alarm about the threat of cyber&nbsp;attacks on research facilities and the health care sector during the pandemic. It was one of the intelligence agencies that stated a hacker group backed by Russia&nbsp;"almost certainly" tried&nbsp;to steal COVID-19-related vaccine research in Canada, the U.K. and the U.S.</p>  <p>Late last year, CSE warned that state-sponsored actors are "very likely" trying to shore up their cyber capabilities to attack Canada's&nbsp;critical infrastructure — such as the electricity&nbsp;supply&nbsp;— to intimidate or to prepare for future online assaults.</p>  <p>While the lights will remain on, the union says the agency will lose workers if it doesn't offer&nbsp;competitive salaries.</p>  <p>"What does it say about how we prioritize national security?" said Silas.&nbsp;"If CSE as an employer, as management, doesn't recognize the need to pay these workers a fair market rate, how are we going to attract and retain the talent needed for the important work of keeping Canadians safe from cyber attacks?"</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

February 24, 2021 | https://mainestartupsinsider.com/running-tides-attracts-big-vc-names/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mainestartupsinsider.com/running-tides-attracts-big-vc-names/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
							<p>Running Tide Technologies, a Portland-based company that operates traditional oyster farms, has just emerged from stealth with a big, bold plan to sequester gigatons of CO2 on the ocean floor over the next several years by growing kelp and then sinking it to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>The company has been keeping its cards close to the vest, but Fast Company magazine <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90548820/forget-planting-trees-this-company-is-making-carbon-offsets-by-putting-seaweed-on-the-ocean-floor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published an article</a> today revealing Running Tide’s plan to leverage its aquaculture expertise to tackle the issue of climate change. Its plan, according to the magazine, is to grow kelp, which like other plants extracts carbon dioxide from the environment, on floating rigs and then sink them to the ocean floor. Once there, the CO2 could remain sequestered for centuries.</p>
<p>“Once it goes down below 1,000 meters, it’s not coming back up, because the pressures are so great,” Marty Odlin, Running Tide’s founder and CEO, told Fast Company. “So you can get at least 1,000 years of sequestration. More likely, it will turn into oil or sediment and be sequestered on the geologic timescale—millions of years.”</p>
<p>Unlike terrestrial forests that can burn or degrade and release the carbon back into the atmosphere, marine plants don’t break down as easy. Plus, coastal&nbsp;ecosystems sequester up to 20 times more carbon per acre than land forests, <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2019/how-kelp-naturally-combats-global-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to this article</a> published by Harvard University.</p>
<p>Running Tide <a href="https://www.runningtide.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updated its website</a> this week. While previously focused on traditional shellfish aquaculture, it now includes language about its “negative emissions journey” to combat climate change with its kelp. It also says that Running Tide will be selling “kelp carbon credits.”</p>
<p>Maine Startups Insider had heard rumors about the company and how it had been able to attract big-time VC money. MSI <a href="https://mainestartupsinsider.com/has-silicon-valley-big-shot-chris-sacca-invested-in-a-maine-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published an article last week</a> speculating that Chris Sacca, one of Silicon Valley’s most well-known venture capitalists, had invested in the company via his new VC firm, Lowercarbon Capital. Sacca did not respond to MSI’s requests for confirmation, but did announce his firm’s investment in the Portland company on Twitter after the Fast Company article was published.</p>
<p>“Bonkers scale, unreasonable ambition, massive impact on the plant. During insane times, it’s entrepreneurs like @martyodlin that fire us up,” Sacca tweeted.</p>

<p>Shopify, the ecommerce behemoth, also revealed itself this week as an investor in Running Tide. The ecommerce-platform company last year launched its Sustainability Fund to fight climate change. On Monday, <a href="https://www.shopify.com/about/environment/sustainability-fund/ocean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it shared in a blog post</a> how it invested its first $5 million, including an investment of undisclosed size in Running Tide.</p>
<p>“All work is important in carbon reduction, but some people have to try to kill the monster,” Odlin told Shopify. “Everyone should try to slow it down, but we should pick 15–20 technologies that might be able to stop the whole thing all by themselves. That’s what we’re trying to build.”</p>

<p>I have not been successful getting the company to confirm how much it raised, <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/266342-50#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but Pitchbook claims</a> it raised $11.2 million in November 2019. In addition to Lowercarbon Capital and Shopify,&nbsp;PitchBook lists three additional investors: Soraya Darabi, an angel investor, San Francisco-based Pathbreaker Ventures, and San Francisco-based Yes VC.</p>
<p>David Frankel, a partner at Boston-based Founder Collective, also revealed on Twitter on Tuesday that he had led the seed financing.</p>
