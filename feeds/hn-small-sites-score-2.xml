<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>On January 22, 1970, a Pan Am Boeing 747 touched down at Heathrow for the first time.<a href="#footnote-10TY" id="ref-10TY"><sup>1</sup></a> It was the 747’s first commercial flight. At the time, British Airways had 11 of the jumbo jets on order.</p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to ride on one. I’m too late.</p>
<p>British Airways announced yesterday they’re retiring their entire 747 fleet. Permanently. Its cousins are also in trouble: the double-decker <span>A380</span> is grounded worldwide.</p>
<p>Landing slots at Heathrow are scarce. In 2016, Oman Air bought a single morning slot from Air France for $75 million. So while the 777, <span>A340</span>, and 787 use less than half the fuel per passenger to fly, airlines need jumbo jets to maximize passenger throughput.</p>
<p>Nowadays double-deckers are merely a waste of fuel. Just like a species facing an extinction event, the 747 got wiped out by an economic chokepoint.</p>
<p>Intelligent-designers often cite gaps in the archaeological record as evidence against natural selection. <em>If evolution inched along slowly</em>, they argue, <em>where are the fossils of almost-humans, and almost-almost-humans, and almost-almost-almost humans? Shouldn’t we find skulls of humans with tiny eyes, slightly-less-tiny eyes, all the way up to regular-sized eyes?</em></p>
<p>But evolution doesn’t crawl along in a straight line. Adaptation happens slowly, and then all at once. Chokepoints force the<span></span> <span>“</span>all at once.”</p>
<p>For example, birds in Britain and Denmark have been under attack by asphalt for a century. In Britain, it’s popular to load birdseed into birdfeeders and place them in gardens. Not so in Denmark. Within 40 years, the beaks of British birds have grown 1-2mm longer than their Danish counterparts.<a href="#footnote-20TY" id="ref-20TY"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>For millennia the beaks have stayed the same. And then asphalt, in a mere half century, forced British bird beaks to grow up to 10% longer.</p>
<p>Business follows the same pattern. Innovation prods along slowly. And then one day the economy’s equilibrium gets punctured.</p>
<p>We are in one of those economic chokepoints. The 747 and <span>A380</span> are collateral damage.</p>
<p>What else is facing evolutionary death because of COVID?</p>
<p>It might be better to invert that question. What types of businesses will survive despite COVID? What traits do those businesses have that will spread like memes throughout the economy?</p>

     Almost a year has passed since the devastating firebombing of Kyoto Animation
that murdered thirty-six employees and harmed many others. Kyoto Animation,
affectionately known as KyoAni, is an anime studio that has earned the love of
countless fans, and I am proud to include myself among them. KyoAni receives the
devotion it does because it has changed lives for the better, and every KyoAni
fan probably has a story to tell. I first came to know KyoAni from <em>K-On</em>, a
heartfelt show capturing the nostalgic innocence of adolescence through the
youthful adventures of five girls in a band. <em>K-On</em> taught me to appreciate the
fleeting moments of life, and it will always hold a special place in my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>K-On</em> is an anime created by Kyoto Animation under director Naoko Yamada and
screenwriter Reiko Yoshida, adapted from a manga by Kakifly. <em>K-On</em> follows the
five members of the Sakuragaoka Girls' School's Light Music Club, or <em>keionbu</em>:
Yui Hirasawa on lead guitar, Mio Akiyama on bass, Ritsu Tainaka on drums, Mugi
Kotobuki on keyboard, and their underclassman Azusa Nakano on rhythm guitar.
Over their three years of high school, the girls connect over school life, band
practice, and after-school tea time in the music room, and they become tight
friends.

  <a href="https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/12005">Sakugabooru</a>)
     </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
     Truthfully, <em>K-On</em>'s first season is merely mediocre: enjoyable, but not
memorable. <em>K-On</em>'s second season, which depicts senior year for Yui, Mio,
Ritsu, and Mugi, is where it really shines as a poignant tale of friendship and
adolescence. When the girls reunite and banter in the music room before class on
their first day back, you get the feeling that they've all been friends since
forever. However, right from the get-go, there is a tone shift: the atmosphere
is melancholy as the friends plan their exciting year ahead, their last year
together. Time seems to pass slowly as the <em>keionbu</em> spends its remaining months
together bonding even closer, with a field trip to Kansai, a school play of
Romeo and Juliet, and one last school festival performance before graduation.
<em>K-On</em> reminds us to cherish our youth and our time with friends: these days are
limited. However, if we make the most of our time together, even after we go our
separate ways we'll still have the warmth of all the fond memories.
    </p>
    <p>
     I first watched <em>K-On</em> in my junior year of high school. Before, I didn't care
to make memories. I was obsessed with programming language theory and
constructive mathematics, and I single-mindedly focused on learning higher-level
math on my own. I was eager to leave high school so I could study my passions
in college, and I was even thinking about graduate school! However, after I
watched the <em>keionbu</em> spend its carefree days together before saying goodbye, I
felt intense regret and asked myself: How had I been spending my own high school
days? <em>K-On</em> made me realize that I was growing up too fast, there was more to
life than just math, and I was missing out on a lot of memories in a chapter of
life that I would never experience again. First, I wanted to join a school club
of my own. Around the same time, an underclassman sought to found a programming
club, and I helped it grow. Although the programming club obviously didn't turn
out the same as the <em>keionbu</em>, I still made new friends there nonetheless.
<em>K-On</em> also inspired me to pick up the guitar so I could lose myself in music
just as the girls did.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>K-On</em>'s thoughtful themes and genuine depiction of the joys of adolescence
overwhelmed me: I hadn't seen anything like it before, and I recognized that I'd
experienced something truly special. That was when I took notice of KyoAni and
director Naoko Yamada. As one fan puts it, <a href="https://honeysanime.com/the-history-of-kyoto-animation/">"K-On! really started the tradition
that KyoAni titles would tell the stories of normal people in beautiful ways,
something the studio would begin to be known for."</a> In particular, <em>K-On</em>
was the breakout success for Naoko Yamada, the young talent who would become
known for her works centering around adolescence, including the critically
acclaimed film <em>A Silent Voice</em> (which, I might add, was snubbed in favor of
<em>The Boss Baby</em> in the Western-centric and out-of-touch Oscars). <em>K-On</em> is just
one example of KyoAni's work, which are respected for their high production
quality and loved for their often heartfelt subject matter.

    </figure>
    <p>
     The humanity of KyoAni's fiction parallels that of its reality, a rare beacon in
the infamously harsh anime industry. The studio has its own animator training
school, pays its employees a salary instead of per frame, and provides maternity
leave to support its female employees. These conditions pay back as animators
can focus on quality over quantity and KyoAni can maintain in-house talent and
develop its own style. <a href="https://blog.sakugabooru.com/2018/08/25/the-evolution-of-kyoto-animation-a-unique-anime-studio-and-its-consistent-vision/">KyoAni eventually achieved the financial independence to
run its own production committees so that creators may be in charge of their
works.</a> Not only does KyoAni shine through its anime, it is also a one-of-a-kind in
the anime industry.
    </p>
    <p>
     I remember when I woke up on July 18 and found KyoAni in the international news.
I remember learning the horrific details of the massacre, feeling overwhelmed
by the Western media coverage of varying quality, and getting angry at the
misinformed commentary from unfamiliar outsiders. There couldn't have been a
greater contrast between KyoAni's innocence and its tragedy. I asked: Oh,
KyoAni, why did this have to happen to you?
    </p>
    <p>
     But, I also remember the show of love that KyoAni fans around the world
sent the ravaged studio in the aftermath of the attack. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kyoto-animation-fire-money/donations-top-30-million-for-kyoto-animation-arson-victims-in-japan-idUSKBN1YV0MR">KyoAni received $30
million in donations</a> and <a href="https://soranews24.com/2019/11/15/kyoto-animation-has-a-touchingly-kind-plan-to-distribute-its-3-2-billion-yen-in-arson-donations/">selflessly reserved all the money to compensate the victims and their
families, and none of it for rebuilding the business</a>. Even in the face of death and destruction, KyoAni stood strong with dignity
and compassion. I want to see KyoAni recover and grow and succeed. KyoAni
constantly inspires me to become a kinder person, and countless fans have
personal stories of the studio's positive impact. I hope that even more people
discover the goodness of KyoAni.
    </p>
    <p>
     You know, there's a phenomenon where you don't realize who you have to be
thankful for until they're gone. I'm reminded of a certain <em>K-On</em> episode: When
the music room is closed off for repairs, the <em>keionbu</em> must relocate so it can
prepare for its upcoming concert. Unable to practice in their new locations, the
girls brainstorm song ideas instead. When the music room finally reopens, they
realize not to take for granted what they already have.
    </p>
    <p>
     Later, Yui's doting sister Ui Hirasawa overworks herself caring for Yui and
comes down with a cold. As Ui languidly lies in bed with a fever, Yui endeavors
to repay her sister for her kindness over all the years by preparing a meal,
only to find that cooking is hard! When Ui awakens the next morning, she
discovers Yui fast asleep at her desk with a sheet of lyrics. Yui had stayed up
late writing a new song for the concert devoted to her sister: <em>U&amp;I</em>.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
     <p>
      <em>I had thought that it was ordinary to have you by my side</em><br>
<em>I had thought that these days would last forever and ever</em><br>
<em>Sorry, now I realize that these days were extraordinary</em><br>
<em>So first, I need to tell you: "Arigatou!"</em>
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Yui Hirasawa, <em>U&amp;I</em>
    </p>
    <p>
     KyoAni, may my feelings reach you: arigatou!

<p>Adapting your language to match that of your audience, in today's world, seems to be growing in importance by the day. Let's contrast two public figures in public appearances that took place yesterday: Fauci vs. Trump.</p>
<h2 id="dr-fauci-vs-populism">Dr Fauci vs Populism</h2>
<p>The rising wave of populism in the U.S has wrought a "distrust of experts". That's a real shame, especially when you don't listen to your infectious disease expert during a Pandemic.</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 39.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2039.png"></p>
<p>Dr Fauci literally wrote the book on infectious disease, yet the populists are calling for his head. Why?</p>
<h3 id="they-dont-understand-a-word-he-says">They don't understand a word he says</h3>
<p>I was watching this <a href="https://web.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10112108870243761/">interview</a> of Dr Fauci by Zuck, yesterday. Finally Fauci is given a chance to speak to the people. Yet:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Citizenry"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>People?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"myalgic encephalitis"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Feeling too tired to lift an arm or get out of bed?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"deleterious consequences"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Bad things happen?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"i used the word 'comparable' and i think it may have been taken out of context"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Then don't say 'comparable'.</p>
<p>Indeed we already have evidence that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/07/09/2008868117">working memory predicts social-distancing compliance</a>. This is pretty damning evidence: essentially people with lower working memory capacity are unwilling to socially distance themselves as they cannot hold enough variables in mind to accurately assess the pros and cons.</p>
<p>Thus it isn't too much of a leap to theorise that a lower working memory capacity is also linked with a restricted vocabulary, and thus a reduced ability to process Dr Fauci's long, complex sentences which are laiden with technical jargon and advanced vocab.</p>
<p>Or to put it bluntly: the idiots don't understand Dr Fauci.</p>
<h2 id="donald-trump-is-a-communication-wizard">Donald Trump is a communication Wizard</h2>
<p>Scott Adams accurately predicted <a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/2015/10/23/the-case-for-a-trump-landslide-part-1/">Donal Trump would win the elections in a landslide</a> back in 2015.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Trump is talking directly to peopleâ€™s subconscious. Everything else he says is just a carrier signal." --Scott Adams (<a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/2015/09/06/how-to-spot-a-wizard/">how to spot a wizard</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great example of Trump's communicative Wizardry. On the same Day Dr Fauci was telling the citizenry about myalgic encephalitis and deleterious consequences, Trump did this:</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 40.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2040.png"></p>
<p>Trump had the audacity to set up two cranes, to visually demonstrate lifting regulatory weights off the Republican red truck, while regulation still weighing down on the Democrat blue truck. This is pure communication genius, <strong>because any idiot can understand it</strong> and it <strong>communicates to their subconscious</strong>.</p>
<p>By catering to the lowest common denominator, Trump ensures he captures 100% of his potential base. Not a single word is lost. In fact this kind of visual communication transcends language, education level, even culture.</p>
<h2 id="boris-johnson-is-also-a-communication-wizard">Boris Johnson is also a communication Wizard</h2>
<p>In this interview, Johnson shares his communication principles:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"What people listen to are short anglo-saxon words that readily correspond to some object in the universe that they can identify. So in other words: talk simply, in plain English, and talk about stuff in the real world." --Boris Johnson</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Deriding people like Trump or Johnson for their perceived linguistic blunders utterly misses the point. <strong>Their blunders are what makes them accessible.</strong> Their simple language is what makes them understable. Their communicative wizardly is what makes them irresistible to their base.</p>
<h2 id="elon-musk-is-also-a-communication-wizard">Elon Musk is also a communication Wizard</h2>
<p>Those who know me will confirm this to you: i have been a huge Musky for a very long time. Elon Musk is yet another genius at tailoring his communication to his base:</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 37.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2037.png"></p>
<p>Musk speaks to engineers, or generally a base with technological interests, so his language is not always as simple as it could be. But when you consider the topics he talks about, you have to admire how accessible he is able to make them. The language is simple, and the topics relate to the real world.</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 41.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2041.png"></p>
<p>And then there are his masterpieces of communication, like the Tesla he sent into orbit. Once again, pure communication genius that transcends language and culture.</p>
<p>Or his EDM track:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hOEWUm6aGPg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Don't doubt your vibe, because it's true." -- Elon Musk</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick glance at Tesla's stock performance since the <a href="https://shyal.com/blog/tesla-stock-bottom-date">tesla stock bottom date</a> will tell you the message was indeed recieved.</p>
<h2 id="idiocracy-had-it-right">Idiocracy had it right</h2>
<p>The movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/">Idiocracy (2006)</a> is a spooky and hilarious foray into a potential future dumbing down of the human race. The main character, from our time, <strong>who's name is "no sure"</strong> wakes up in the future as the <strong>man with the highest IQ. But nobody understands a word he says</strong>.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGUNPMPrxvA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>He narrowly manages to save the human race by <strong>showing them</strong> that watering crops with water instead of gatorade is the solution to all their problems.</p>

<p>All the evidence points to dumbing down your language, and communicating visually and symbolically to become an unstoppable communicator. <strong>Think like a scientist and talk like a populist; you will become unstoppable</strong>.</p>

<p>You know that feeling when someone is explaining an idea and you're struggling to make sense of it—like peering out into dense fog, hoping to glimpse the outline of an approaching ship? Maybe it's because they're using unfamiliar acronyms or taking leaps of logic, or maybe it's simply not something you have any personal experience with. The idea is obvious to them, but not to you.</p><p>In Richard Feynman's hilarious and incisive memoir, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393355624/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliotpeper-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0393355624&amp;linkId=759f61e594ab9f1df1971b41fa4ce33b" target="_blank">Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</a></i>, the Nobel Laureate shares his personal method for cutting straight to the heart of seemingly complex ideas, even when speaking to experts in fields far beyond physics: “I had a scheme, which I still use today when somebody is explaining something that I’m trying to understand: I keep making up examples.”&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever anything was vague or confusing, he would ask for a concrete example. Then, even as his interlocutor reverted to describing general theory, Feynman would follow the concrete example along in his mind—often noticing flaws or opportunities in the idea that weren't obvious in the abstract. Just as Theseus escaped the labyrinth by following Ariadne's string, so you can use real, physical examples to escape the labyrinth of abstract thought, and arrive at insight.</p><p>Writing fiction is often about reversing Feynman's scheme: making up compelling stories that provide concrete examples from which ideas can be derived, thereby illuminating them.</p><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GPT-3 (OpenAI's text generation model) imitating human text: We aren't pulling the mask off the machine to reveal a genius wizard, we're pulling the mask off each other to reveal the bar is low.</p>
<p>It's a little spooky for another reason. In places where very average people read very average comments all day long (reddit, etc) I think we can expect a Commentdämmerung moment in the near future.</p>
<p>Imagine you want to stonewall a thread about a topic. Or every thread about a topic. Any time the subject is posted, comments start rolling in. People arguing with each other along familiar lines. The same back and forth stuff like usual. Except this time, it's all bots, and it's indistinguishable because the speech patterns of average people are... average. And it's <em>way, way louder.</em> You sort and collapse comments to try to find a new angle, but you can't. It's saturated with the blandest takes imaginable as quick as the spam filters allow.</p>
<p>How do you get to the point, then, where you're only filtering by human comments? What happens when its 99,000 comments, and 99% of them bots?? Will you know? Will you be influenced?</p>
<p>Will the average person be influenced? If advertising and the idea of saying something over and over works, and words are <em>free,</em> and you can GPT-3 your hand-rolled (or state authorized) propaganda every day in every comment thread in every forum to look like an average person is advocating for X, will other average people be more convinced of X?</p>
<p>This is the twilight of the comment sections.</p>
<p>Rather than authors GPT-3ing their own works and then revealing that they were ghost-written by the computer, the creepy scenario is someone hand-crafting conspiracy theories or lies so wild that no respectable person would fall for them, and then using GPT-3 bots to make it look like consensus is real, and convincing millions via synthetic social pressure.</p>
<p>Or: people sometimes edit wikipedia, write an article and use wiki as a source, then several days later change Wikipedia to use the article as a source. A synthetic citation. What's that look like at scale? Remember: The bar for writing is low.</p>
<p>I don't think the future will be dark. In fact I'm quite optimistic. But I think social networks and forum sites will change. They won't compete over who has the biggest piles of content (user counts), they will compete over context (authenticity, real friends, small discussions). In other words, the next reddit, twitter, &amp; facebook etc competitors will not look like reddit, twitter &amp; facebook.</p>
<p>They will be smaller by design, harder to get in to, and slower-paced. And they'll be better. Note that by solving the GPT-3 problem, you also largely solve the troll problem. Well, hopefully. Note in the above Commentdämmerung scenario, they can only happen as long as words are free. The simplest way to avoid this problem is to charge a small admissions fee. Then at least only actors with deep pockets can influence the average reader.</p>
<p>Note: GPT-3 isn't there yet for something like this. After reviewing a lot of GPT-3 output for a while today, I'm actually unimpressed. The daemon of genius clearly isn't home. The uncannily good ones that get shared are shared by humans, that is, they're hand-picked and so make the output look better than it is on average. But we can expect a point in the future where free-for-all comment sections are essentially over, if actors want them to be. I think this is unfortunate because most of world history existed in dialogue, and then we shifted to mass-media, inventing ideology along the way, and its only recently in the internet age that we have returned to the agora model of mass person-to-person communication. (I've written about that, <a href="https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/are-we-still-thinking-795bd9f4a658">here</a>). It would be a big shame if this ruins the bigger agoras, and it might.</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe at this point that synthetic writing will replace good writers, just as computers have not replaced chess players. But I suspect it will become a crucial tool for creatives, just as chess engines have become a crucial tool for chess players to see what they're doing wrong, how they could improve, etc. A thesaurus is useful, a GPT-4-saurus would be much nicer. Imagine the writers block one could overcome, with a suggestion engine trained on you and writers you admire! Perhaps it's not writers who should worry, but editors.</p>
<p>Then again, do imagine a suggestion engine writing away alongside you. After a while, are you doing the thinking, or are you letting the GPT-4-saurus take over? Are you convincing the readers, or is the program's most-compelling-path-of-least-resistance just operant conditioning both you and the readers? Who's clicking publish?</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>At the beginning of this year, I decided it was finally time to port my website from a <span>PHP</span>-based <span>CMS</span><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> to a JavaScript-based Static Site Generator (<span>SSG</span>). This was for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>After starting out as a ‘full-stack’ developer, I now work solely on the front end: If I need to write custom functionality, I don’t want to write it in <span>PHP</span> when I could be writing it in JavaScript.</li>
<li>I don't need the layers of abstraction or the complexity of a <span>CMS</span> — markdown files are where I'm most comfortable writing content and I’d be happy never to touch a My<span>SQL</span> database or <span>wysiwyg</span> editor again.</li>
<li>I want to improve my site’s performance: static <span>HTML</span> files are, 99 times out of 100, going to be faster than pages built on the fly.</li>
<li>Lastly, there’s the cost benefit: A <span>LAMP</span> stack<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> server costs money every month; Netlify’s free tier (300 build minutes/month) should comfortably cover a personal blog at zero cost.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once I'd decided I want a Static Site Generator and it needed to use JavaScript (which ruled out <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>), I narrowed the list down to two very different contenders:</p>
<h2>“I heard Gatsby was good”</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">the official site</a>, “Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps”. It has a data layer powered by GraphQL and it outputs everything to static files, allowing you to host it pretty much anywhere.</p>
<p>When I first heard that I could write React and use this cool new GraphQL thing, while still outputting static pages that work without JavaScript, I was keen to give it a try. <em>‘This sounds like Progressive Enhancement but without the effort’</em> I thought. Unfortunately, as with most things that sound too good to be true, after some investigation, there turned out to be a catch. Here's what happens the first time a user visits a Gatsby site:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user requests a page</li>
<li>The server sends the statically-generated <span>HTML</span> document to the user’s browser and the browser starts rendering the page.</li>
<li>Now that the <span>HTML</span> document has arrived, the JavaScript bundle (including the React library and any other JavaScript required to render the page) begins downloading, parsing and compiling in the background</li>
<li>The JavaScript is ready to run — the whole <span>DOM</span> gets “hydrated”<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> with React components</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s something not quite right here — Gatsby forces you to load the same page again, but as React components; until that extra step is complete, none of the elements that require JavaScript (e.g. buttons, menus, custom inputs) are actually interactive.</p>
<p>If your site doesn’t have any interactive elements (excluding links, they work without JavaScript, even in Gatsby), your users still have to download this JavaScript anyway, for the sole purpose of turning your site into a Single-Page Application (<span>SPA</span>), which has its own drawbacks as we'll soon discover.</p>
<p>This extra bloat seems to go against one of the main reasons for moving to a <span>SSG</span>: making pages faster. Your flashy Gatsby site might be fast on a $2,000 MacBook, but for someone using a budget smartphone on a 3G connection, it's visible yet unresponsive, for 15 seconds while the user waits for the JavaScript to load. It’s also unnecessarily draining their battery <em>and</em> data allowance.</p>
<p>If the browser needs to parse 296kb of JavaScript<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> to show a list of blog posts, that’s not Progressive Enhancement, it’s using the wrong tool for the job. To use the rather fuzzy website/web app distinction — React is for building web apps: interactive UIs that need to respond to user input or fetch data in real time — your blog is just a website <em>and that’s fine</em>.</p>
<h2>Accessibility in single-page applications</h2>
<p>A single-page application is a website that forgoes the traditional method of navigation on the web, i.e. loading new content by loading a new <span>HTML</span> document; instead it uses JavaScript features like <span>AJAX</span> and the History <span>API</span> to swap in new content without triggering a page load. The goal is to increase perceived performance and make the website feel more like a 'native' app (something you’d download from an app store). The problem with getting rid of full-page reloads is that browsers and assistive technology use page loads as a signal to trigger certain useful behaviours, including announcing the title of the new page or resetting keyboard focus to the beginning of the document.</p>
<p>If you’re an accessibility-conscious developer building a single-page application, you may try to emulate the browser’s behaviour using JavaScript. Gatsby attempts to handle this for you by including a <code>RouteAnnouncer</code> component. This uses an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions"><span>ARIA</span> live region</a> to announce the <code>title</code> or <code>h1</code> of the page, alerting users of screenreader software to navigation changes. This approach, however, is not without its problems: there are still outstanding issues around <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21059">configuration</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/20801">localisation</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that the Single-page applications have inherent accessibility issues around navigation, but it’s worth bearing in mind that using a front-end framework can make other aspects of accessibility harder too. In a February 2020 survey of one million homepages, WebAIM found that those using React had 5.7% more accessibility errors than average; while those using Vue had 25% more<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the frameworks caused these errors, but there’s a strong correlation between more JavaScript and worse accessibility.</p>
<h2>Does a blog even need JavaScript?</h2>
<p>Chances are, the first webpage your ever built performed far better than some of the pages you've built since — it consisted of an <span>HTML</span> file and some <span>CSS</span>; maybe it had a few unoptimised images but they didn’t stop the page from loading. If you're anything like me, the moment you started adding JavaScript was the moment the performance of your webpage took a nosedive. Not all bytes are made equal: an image is going to take far less time to decode and render to the screen than the equivalently sized JavaScript file would take to parse, compile, and execute<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a powerful language that can do some incredible things, but it’s incredibly easy to jump to using it too early in development, when you could be using <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span> instead. Consider the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">rule of least power</a>: Don’t use the more powerful language (JavaScript) until you’ve exhausted the capabilities of less powerful languages (<span>HTML</span>). To me, it feels that turning a blog into a JavaScript Single-page application is introducing unnecessary complexity.</p>
<p>I don't want this post to come across as a specific attack on Gatsby. There are some clever people behind it, who’ve acknowledged many of the issues mentioned in this article and are trying to solve them. A statically rendered and hydrated page is still infinitely better than a fully client-side rendered React app (like those generated by <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>) which is useless without JavaScript. I do have issues with the way that its JavaScript-heavy, Single page app approach is advertised, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-01-30-why-gatsby-is-better-with-javascript/">including in Gatsby’s own marketing</a>, as appropriate for any kind of website. Client-side JavaScript has a cost and developers should be aware of it.</p>
<h2>Building a Gatsby site with less JavaScript</h2>
<p>This brings me to a dilemma: developing sites with Gatsby is an all-round great experience; but Developer Experience (DX) should always be secondary to User Experience (UX) — how do I build a Gatsby site without the issues inherent in Gatsby’s JavaScript heavy approach? By removing as much of it as possible, of course. Fortunately, there are some fantastic efforts going on within the Gatsby community to build faster, more lightweight sites:</p>
<p>Firstly, you could save a few kilobytes by swapping React for Preact, with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-preact/">gatsby-plugin-preact</a>. I use this on <a href="https://component.gallery/">the Component Gallery</a> and it works seamlessly, instantly knocking ~30kb off the JavaScript payload.</p>
<p>If you want to take a more drastic approach, there's a <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-no-javascript/">plugin which removes <em>all</em> the Gatsby JavaScript from your Gatsby site</a>. Now we’re getting somewhere! You can continue to write react components and GraphQL, even use a CSS-in-JS library (as long as it outputs CSS or inline styles), <em>without</em> sending any JavaScript to the browser. Most of the problems with Gatsby can be solved by throwing out all of its client side JavaScript. <a href="https://gatsby-starter-low-tech-blog.netlify.com/low-tech/">Gatsby Starter Low Tech Blog</a> uses the no-javascript plugin, as well as some other techniques including converting all images to greyscale, to help you create an incredibly lightweight and energy-efficient blog.</p>
<h2>Starting from scratch with Eleventy</h2>
<p>At this point I felt like something was wrong — using a framework that heavily pushes client-side JavaScript, but removing all of that JavaScript seemed like a pretty convoluted way to build a website. I wanted to see whether I could build a fully-featured blog with zero client-side JavaScript and instead of using a plugin to remove it, I wasn’t going to add it in the first place. This is where my other contender comes in:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> encourages you to build your site how you want to. You use the technology you're most comfortable with and it sticks to generating your pages. Eleventy gives you the option of mixing and matching ten different templating languages, including markdown, nunjucks, and liquid; this meant I could copy and paste my old twig templates from Craft, change the file extension, and with some minor tweaks have them running in Eleventy. Instead of adapting my front-end build process to a new bundler I could just drop in my existing webpack file and <code>src</code> folder. Using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently">concurrently</a> package I can run my build script at the same time as Eleventy’s <code>serve</code> process.</p>
<p>Like Gatsby, Eleventy also has an ecosystem of plugins (which is small, but rapidly growing). I’ve picked out a few that I've used which have enabled me to add features without adding client-side JavaScript:</p>
<p>When displaying code snippets in a post, it’s common to include language-specific syntax highlighting. There are a few JavaScript libraries out there that can do it, the most popular of which seems to be <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> — normally you’d run this in the client, but because …</p></div></div>

That is until a few months ago.</p><p>Google recently announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Cloud Run</a>. It allows anyone to deploy containers in production really fast. The best part is the pricing: one only pays for the milliseconds that they use. The container becomes "alive" when a request comes in and "pauses" right after. From our experience, the cold starts are usually around 400ms.</p><h2 id="the-architecture">The Architecture</h2><p>In order to serve someone else's model we had to know for sure that the architecture would be robust and scalable.

	<p><em>Starting in 2006 with the Public Health Laboratory Interoperability Project (PHLIP)—one of the first systems that allowed public health entities to exchange standardized data—APHL has worked to make connections between public health laboratories and agencies more efficient. Those efforts took a dramatic step forward with the <a href="https://www.aphl.org/programs/informatics/Pages/aims_platform.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APHL Informatics Messaging Services</a> (AIMS) platform, which has evolved from a one-way router of critical health information to a secure, cloud-based platform that transports, translates, validates and hosts data for federal, state and local public health agencies.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em>The emergence of <a href="https://www.aphlblog.org/category/infectious-diseases/covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19</a> required swift action to develop systems and processes that support public health agencies and their pandemic response efforts. In the last seven months, APHL has worked to create new connections, develop new message formats, standardize language and host a variety of solutions to aid in the COVID response. This blog post, regarding exposure notification, is the first in a series that outlines and explains these efforts.</em></p>
<p><strong>How Does Exposure Notification Work?</strong></p>
<p>To limit the spread of COVID-19, information must travel faster than the virus can. The scope and transmission rate of COVID-19 makes this a monumental challenge for public health agencies. Exposure notification technology, however, is a potential game changer. By providing rapid alerts to individuals who may have been in close proximity to someone who has COVID-19, exposure notifications allow the spread of information to stay one step ahead.</p>
<p>Working in conjunction with Apple, Google and Microsoft, APHL is taking a major step to support public health agencies that want to provide focused, privacy-preserving and user-controlled exposure notifications at scale using the Apple | Google Exposure Notifications System. APHL’s presence on the project gives the US public health community a capable and accountable partner for hosting key components of this groundbreaking technology.</p>
<p><strong>The Apple | Google Exposure Notifications System (A|G ENS)</strong></p>
<p>To augment traditional COVID-19 contact tracing efforts around the world, Apple and Google co-developed the A|G ENS, which consists of an Exposure Notification Application Protocol Interface (API) that is available on both the iOS and Android operating systems. Apps developed by public health agencies can then use the Exposure Notification API to help determine if a user may have been exposed to another user who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. This is accomplished through the use of privacy-preserving randomly generated numbers also known as keys, which in turn generate temporary IDs that are transmitted between devices using Bluetooth Low Energy signals. Apps using this system are not permitted to collect or use location data from the device, and user identities are not revealed to other users, Apple, Google or APHL.</p>
<p>Rather than each state and territorial public health agency bearing the burden of building and hosting its own key servers, a national server can securely host the keys of those affected users, eliminate duplication and enable notifications across state borders. APHL is also championing the effort to build and host a national key server on behalf of the public health community. This will allow users to continually benefit from exposure notifications as they travel across state lines, and help state and territorial agencies deploy their apps quickly.</p>
<p>“APHL’s participation is key to the success of these efforts,” said Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman. “Without a national key server, each state that chooses to implement such an application would be responsible for its own data sets. APHL’s centralized and secure national server will be accessible to every state public health agency.”</p>
<p>Microsoft is supporting the partnership by working with APHL to host the national key server, based on the open source reference design created by Google Cloud. Through Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, Microsoft will provide cloud services that will allow APHL to host the key server and securely enable interstate operability for the apps that public health agencies deploy.</p>
<p>Only users who choose to download an app developed by their public health agency and voluntarily opt in can receive exposure notifications. If users are alerted to a possible exposure, the app will also provide information about what to do next.</p>
<p>“We’re honored to partner with Apple, Google and Microsoft to make this groundbreaking technology accessible to state and territorial public health agencies,” Bill Whitmar, president of APHL and director of the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory, said. “Apps using this technology will rapidly inform users of a potential exposure to COVID-19 and provide them information they can use to protect themselves and their families.”</p>
<p><em>APHL develops technological innovations that support public health agencies at the federal, state and local level.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3><strong>Understanding Kubernetes</strong></h3><p>The objective of this article is to provide an introduction and a general understanding about Kubernetes. We will look into architectural concepts, advantages of using Kubernetes, how to set up Kubernetes, and how to run commands on a local machine using Minikube.</p><h3><strong>What is Kubernetes?</strong></h3><p>Before we dive deep into Kubernetes, let's first understand the concept of containers. Containerization is the process of packaging code and dependencies of an application into a single image, and running it in a single computing environment called the container.</p><p><strong>Docker</strong> revolutionized containerization by packaging software into a virtual container that can run on any environment. With containers, one can deploy applications onto multiple platforms like AWS, GCP, or Digital Ocean.&nbsp;</p><p>But challenges arise when the number of containers increases. It becomes difficult to deploy and maintain hundreds of containers across many servers or VM instances. This led to the evolution of the <strong>container orchestration software</strong>.</p><p>An orchestrator’s role is to coordinate a set of container workloads across a series of servers or nodes. This includes things like making sure the containers have the right resources, the correct number of containers are available at all times, rolling deploys to prevent uptime, and more. <strong>Kubernetes</strong> is the most popular container orchestrator.</p><p>Kubernetes, also known as k8s, was released in 2015 by Google and is now maintained by an open-source community (of which Google is also a part of). Kubernetes provides a set of APIs and command-line interfaces to manage containers deployed across servers. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of the containers across clusters of hosts. This makes it a popular choice to host microservice-based implementations as it addresses many concerns of microservice implementations like configuration management, service discovery, and job scheduling.</p><p>Apart from the core Kubernetes implementation , there are many versions/flavors of Kubernetes implementation provided by various cloud services and distributions that conform to the Kubernetes spec.</p><h3><strong>Kubernetes Architecture</strong></h3><p>Let’s look at the components of Kubernetes architecture</p><h4><strong>Kubectl</strong></h4><p>We communicate with Kubernetes through its API. The popular tool that is used for this is called Kubectl (pronounced <em>cube control or cube CTL</em>).</p><h4><strong>Node</strong></h4><p>A single server in a Kubernetes cluster is known as a node. Workloads are assigned from the control plane, or master to the nodes. The various components of a node server are:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Container Runtime:</strong> The container runtime runs and manages applications present in the containers. The container runtime is usually Docker although it supports other container runtimes like Containerd.</li><li><strong>Kubelet:</strong> Kubelet is a container that runs as an agent on each node to communicate with the Kubernetes control plane (master node). Kubelet also makes sure that the <em>pods</em> (basic unit of deployment) running in a node are healthy and running based on the YAML file called Podspec.</li><li><strong>Kube-proxy:</strong> A proxy service that runs on each of the node servers that performs tasks like forwarding correct requests to containers and make services available to other components.</li></ol><h4><strong>Control Plane</strong></h4><p>The Control plane, also known as the <em>master,</em> is in charge of managing the Kubernetes cluster. It is a group of containers and each one of them does a single job. These components make the decisions that are applicable to the whole cluster like scheduling, detecting and responding to cluster events. The various components of the control plane are</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>etcd: </strong>An important concern of a microservice architecture is that the configuration data should be kept isolated from the code and be accessible. etcd is the Kubernetes component which is a persistent, lightweight, and distributed key-value data store which stores configuration data that represents the state of the cluster.</li><li><strong>API server: </strong>As<strong> </strong>mentioned, Kubernetes consists of a set of APIs. This API is served using JSON over HTTP by the component in the control plane known as the API server. It provides interfaces to Kubernetes and is the API server that updates the states of API objects in etcd, allowing clients to configure workloads and containers across nodes</li><li><strong>Scheduler: </strong>The scheduler is the component of the control plane which assigns unassigned workloads(pods) to the nodes in the cluster. The scheduler tracks the states of the nodes and ensures that workload is equally distributed.</li><li><strong>Controller manager: </strong>The controllers are the components that work to turn the state of the cluster to the user’s desire. It creates updates and deletes resources in the controller. These controllers include ReplicationController, JobsController, and DaemonSet Controller. The controller manager is the component that manages all these controllers.</li></ol><h3><strong>Kubernetes Objects</strong></h3><p>Kubernetes provides layers of abstractions over the container to provide mechanisms that deploy, maintain and scale applications. So the users will interact with the primitives provided by the Kubernetes object instead of directly communicating with the containers. Let’s take a look at the different types of objects available in Kubernetes.</p><h4><strong>Pods</strong></h4><p>A pod is made up of one or more containers running in a node. It is the basic unit of a deployment. Containers are not directly deployed in Kubernetes. They are deployed as pods. A pod is usually one or more containers that are controlled as a single application. Each pod is assigned a unique IP address known as Pod IP. The containers inside the pod can address each other on localhost, but a container has to use a Pod IP to address a container inside a different pod. Various operations can be performed on pods by the controllers that are managed by the Controller manager</p><h4><strong>Replica Set</strong></h4><p>When working with Kubernetes, we may have to replicate our pods and manage them for scaling purposes. For example, we may decide that we want three instances of our API running at all times. This is achieved by using ReplicaSets. A ReplicaSet is a grouping set that maintains replicas that are declared for a pod by the user. ReplicaSet maintains a stable set of copies of a pod that are always available.</p><h4><strong>Services</strong></h4><p>A set of pods that work together is known as a Service in Kubernetes. The pods are defined by a semantic tag called a Label. The Service discovery component assigns an IP address and DNS name to the service, and load balances traffic into pods that match the selector label. Service discovery can be based on environmental variables or using Kubernetes DNS. An example for this is backend pods grouped into a service with requests from frontend load-balanced among them.</p><h4><strong>Deployments</strong></h4><p>Deployments are one of the most important objects in Kubernetes. Deployment does the process of changing the actual state of the objects to the desired state of the user at a controlled rate. Deployments can adjust the replica sets, change the versions of the applications, etc by changing the configurations of the cluster.</p><p>There are two ways to deploy pods, by using the command line and by using a YAML file. We will look into this in detail in a later section.</p><h4><strong>Volumes</strong></h4><p>By default, an ephemeral storage is provided by filesystem in Kubernetes, meaning a pod restart will wipe out all the data in the containers. This is a problem for applications that require persistent storage.&nbsp;</p><p>A volume provides persistent storage for the data in the pods. Volumes can be mounted at a specific path within containers, by defining them in the pod configuration. The same volume can be shared between all containers in the same pod.</p><h4><strong>StatefulSets</strong></h4><p>One of the main challenges faced by a container orchestrator is the preservation of the state. In case of a pod restart or if the application is scaled up or down, the state may need to be redistributed. Also, the ordering of instances is important. An example of a stateful workload is a database. StatefulSets controller is used for managing the stateful applications and enforces properties of uniqueness and ordering amongst instances of a pod.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>DaemonSets</strong></h4><p>Usually, the location where pods are run is determined by the scheduler. But some pods need to be run on every single node of the cluster for use cases like log collection and storage services. This kind of pod scheduling is implemented by the feature called DaemonSet.</p><h3><strong>Kubernetes Local Install</strong></h3><p>Because Kubernetes defines a set of APIs and expected behavior, there are multiple implementations, one of which is a tool called minikube. Minikube allows you to run a Kubernetes cluster on your local machine, which makes it easy to spin up complex services or even test your deployments locally.&nbsp; Before we start the installation, we can quickly look at some of the other options available.</p><p><strong>Docker Desktop:</strong> If you are already using Docker Desktop, Kubernetes can be easily enabled in it by clicking the ‘Enable Kubernetes’ checkbox in the Kubernetes tab.</p><p><strong>MicroK8s</strong>: MicroK8S is developed by Canonical. Although it was made for Ubuntu, it now supports various other Linux distros and recently started support in Windows and Mac.</p><p><strong>Running Kubernetes In Browser</strong>: If you don't want to install Kubernetes in your local system, you can learn it in a browser. There are two options <a href="https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/">&nbsp;Play with K8s</a> and<a href="https://www.katacoda.com/"> Katacoda</a></p><h4><strong>Minikube</strong></h4><p>Minkube is the version we will be running. Minikube will run a single node Kubernetes cluster in a virtual machine.</p><p><strong>Steps to Install Minikube</strong></p><ol role="list"><li>As a first step make sure that Docker is properly installed in your system, as Docker is used for creating, managing, and controlling the containers.</li><li>The next step is that we need a virtual machine or hypervisor in our system like Virtualbox, HyperKit, or KVM..</li></ol><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For macOS</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Install Virtualbox for Mac using Homebrew</p><blockquote>brew cask install virtualbox<strong><br></strong></blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>For Linux</strong></p><blockquote>sudo apt install virtualbox virtualbox-ext-pack</blockquote><p>3. The next step is to make sure that the CLI tool Kubectl is installed.</p><p><strong>For macOS</strong></p><blockquote>brew install kubectl<br></blockquote><p><strong>For Linux</strong></p><p>Download the latest version</p><blockquote>curl -LO …</blockquote></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the start of its metal life, it was just the <i>Third core</i>, as it was the third in the family. Here is the entire family of plutonium cores, dressed up in fashionable magnesium casings:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/First-three-Pu-cores.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/First-three-Pu-cores.jpg" alt="First-three-Pu-cores" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/First-three-Pu-cores.jpg 600w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/First-three-Pu-cores-300x200.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/First-three-Pu-cores-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p>The oldest one is on the left, the <i>Gadget core</i>. It exploded at the Trinity test site in the first-ever atomic blast.</p><p>The younger brother is in the middle, the <i>Fat Man core</i>. It exploded over Nagasaki and killed 40,000-80,000 Japanese civilians.</p><p>Missing from these pictures is the <i>Little Boy core</i>, the black sheep in the family. A fat blob made of 64kg of uranium, it dwarfed smaller 6.2kg plutonium cores. But as black sheeps often do, it achieved the biggest fame. It exploded over Hiroshima.</p><p>On the right is the youngest and the hero of our story. Actually, the photo only shows its magnesium casing; the third core was busy elsewhere. Japan surrendered in August 1945, and there were no plans for another atomic bombing. So it was used at the Los Alamos lab for criticality experiments:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere.jpeg" alt="Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere" width="471" height="363" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere.jpeg 471w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere-300x231.jpeg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere-389x300.jpeg 389w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px"></a></p><p>Its future seemed quite boring compared to its older brothers, but the Third core had its own plans. The first accident happened on August 21, 1945.</p><p>To understand what happened, we need to understand what a criticality experiment is. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass" target="_blank">critical mass</a> is the smallest amount of fissile material needed for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. All plutonium cores are built dangerously close to that limit. The Third core was at 95% of its critical mass. So it was safe; you could use it for bowling if you wanted. But this is the trick: you can make it go critical by compressing it with high explosives, which are used in implosion-type nuclear bombs. However, blowing stuff up is not very practical in lab environments, as you need your core and your scientists to be undamaged for the next experiment. In Los Alamos, they used neutron reflectors to simulate the first nanoseconds before the explosion. Surround part of the core with tungsten carbide bricks, and they reflect neutrons back in. The same core is now 96% critical. Keep adding bricks around, like Legos, and you will reach 97% and 98% criticality. One more brick, and you will be at 99%. One percent away from an uncontrolled chain reaction. But this is a mechanical, simple procedure done by the smartest physicists in the country. What can go wrong?</p><p>That day in August, physicist Harry Daghlian was doing a criticality experiment. He was alone, with a security guy sitting at a nearby desk. He started adding bricks and measuring the resulting radiation. Understanding the thin border of criticality is crucial. The faster the criticality happens, the better yield a nuclear weapon has. He was quite close to the border when a funny thing happened. The tungsten carbide brick slipped from his sweaty hand and fell on the core. The room started glowing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionized-air_glow" target="_blank">electric blue</a>. While Harry was panickingly disassembling the pile of bricks, the security guy was asking himself, what the hell is happening? It lasted only a few seconds before the hot core was stripped naked, and the reaction stopped. All was silent. The two men reported to the hospital soon after. Harry Daghlian died 25 days later from acute radiation syndrome. Private Robert Hemmerly died 33 years later from leukemia.</p><p>This accident caused quite a stir in Los Alamos. Protocols were put in place to prevent future accidents. During lunch in the canteen, scientists would imagine mental experiments in which the core would go critical again. What is better–to quickly dismantle the core apparatus or to run away as fast as you can? If you leave slightly critical core, it would melt on the laboratory floor, and the reaction would stop. Of course, it takes more seconds to run out of the lab than to manually stop the reaction, but the calculation is not so simple. Radiation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law" target="_blank">falls rapidly with the square of the distance</a>, so with every step you run, the situation becomes much less dangerous. As real geeks, they calculated that prompt manual dismantling is the best choice because you just can’t run fast enough.</p><p>One of the physicists at those lunches was Louis Slotin. He was a young and cocky Canadian, often seen in his trademark blue jeans and cowboy boots. Not only he was unafraid, but fiddling with core also gave him a kick. In the new experiment, they ditched the bricks and replaced them with a neutron-reflecting beryllium half-sphere. If the core is completely covered, it goes critical. Therefore, mechanical spacers are put into place to ensure that the half-sphere only covers a certain percentage of it. Louis didn’t like spacers. He would perform criticality measurements holding a half-sphere top thumb hole with his left hand and holding it in position with a screwdriver in his right hand:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tickling_the_Dragons_Tail.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tickling_the_Dragons_Tail.jpg" alt="Tickling_the_Dragons_Tail" width="471" height="349" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tickling_the_Dragons_Tail.jpg 471w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tickling_the_Dragons_Tail-300x222.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tickling_the_Dragons_Tail-405x300.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px"></a></p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillation_counter" target="_blank">scintillation counter</a> on the side would show how far he could go. It was immediate and much faster than using spacers. Slotin called it “twisting the dragon’s tail” and performed it over a dozen times in front of spectating scientists. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi" target="_blank">Enrico Fermi</a> reportedly told Slotin and others that they would be “dead within a year” if they continued performing it.</p><p>On May 21, 1946, Louis was preparing to twist the dragon’s tail in a room with eight other people. Everything was going nicely. He slowly covered the core with a beryllium half-sphere until it was almost enclosed. The scintillation counter was happily ticking, and Louis was controlling the neutron-escaping gap with his screwdriver. Suddenly&nbsp;the tip of the screwdriver slipped, and everybody heard the metal cling of the half-sphere closing. The room filled with the blue light. Louis hastily kicked the half-sphere. The blue light was replaced with a deadly silence. They quickly left the room. After 10 minutes, they all decided to go back. With a piece of chalk, they marked where everybody stood at the moment of criticality. They were scientists, after all; this unplanned experiment would offer a rare opportunity to measure the effects of radiation poisoning on eight human subjects of varying age and varying distance from the radiation source. After diagramming, they reported to the sick bay. The first result followed soon, as Louis Slotin died nine days later. Others survived, but suffered from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core#Second_incident" target="_blank">various radiation-related illnesses</a>.</p><p>Nothing happened to the core, except for the name change. Older cores that killed more than 130,000 people far across the Pacific still had cute names like the <em>Little Boy</em> and the <em>Fat Man</em>. But with two dead colleagues, everybody at Los Alamos started calling this one the <i>Demon core</i>. Hands-on criticality experiments were halted and replaced with remote-control machines supervised from a quarter-mile distance.</p><p>Ultimately, it was decided to destroy the Demon core in a nuclear blast–for both the scientific value and publicity purposes. Marshall islands were chosen as the location of the first nuclear test where press and selected audience members were allowed. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crossroads#Test_Able" target="_blank">first of three planned explosions</a>, the Demon core was to be dropped from a plane over a fleet of 95 decommissioned target ships. The zero point was a few hundred meters was above the <em>USS Nevada</em>, which had been painted bright red for targeting purposes:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/640px-USS_Nevada_BB-36_Operation_Crossroads_Target_Ship.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/640px-USS_Nevada_BB-36_Operation_Crossroads_Target_Ship.jpg" alt="640px-USS_Nevada_(BB-36)_Operation_Crossroads_Target_Ship" width="640" height="379" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/640px-USS_Nevada_BB-36_Operation_Crossroads_Target_Ship.jpg 640w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/640px-USS_Nevada_BB-36_Operation_Crossroads_Target_Ship-300x178.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/640px-USS_Nevada_BB-36_Operation_Crossroads_Target_Ship-500x296.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></p><p>On July 1, 1946, as 114 journalists were waiting for an atomic explosion, the rough expectation was for nine ships (including two battleships and an aircraft carrier) to be sunk. Again, the Demon core had other plans. For reasons still unknown, the bomb missed the target by 650 meters. When the plutonium imploded and went critical, it was too far away to do any real damage. The test was a flop, and the press was disappointed. <i>The New York Times</i> reported that of all of the ships, “only two were sunk, one capsized, and eighteen damaged.”</p><p>The curse didn’t stop with the demise of the Demon core. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crossroads#Test_Baker" target="_blank">second test</a> seemed more certain, as it was an underwater blast. The position was certain, and water carries more blast energy. On July 25th, a bomb named <i>Baker</i> was detonated 27 meters below the sea’s surface. Here is the photo (click for a large version); notice a black hole where the 27,000-ton battleship <i>USS Arkansas</i> was:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Baker-Nuclear-Test-Large.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Baker-Nuclear-Test-Large-1024x537.jpg" alt="Baker-Nuclear-Test-Large" width="584" height="306" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Baker-Nuclear-Test-Large-1024x537.jpg 1024w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Baker-Nuclear-Test-Large-300x157.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Baker-Nuclear-Test-Large-500x262.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></a></p><p>The blast was a success, but the events after were far from that. Because of the underwater nature of the test, all radioactive fission products remained in close proximity. The entire lagoon and target ships were radioactively contaminated. Ships were needed for a third test, so Navy fireboats were sent to do decontamination. They soon discovered that hosing down ships with water from the lagoon (also radioactive) didn’t help much. The Navy then sent 4900 sailors who tried scrubbing ships with water, soap, and lye:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Crossroads_Baker_Scrubdown.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Crossroads_Baker_Scrubdown.jpg" alt="Crossroads_Baker_Scrubdown" width="600" height="480" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Crossroads_Baker_Scrubdown.jpg 600w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Crossroads_Baker_Scrubdown-300x240.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Crossroads_Baker_Scrubdown-375x300.jpg 375w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p>It didn’t work. The ships were still radioactive, and even worse, plutonium was everywhere. They caught a surgeonfish that had ingested enough plutonium to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crossroads#/media/File:Crossroads_Radioactive_Puffy_Surgeon_Fish.jpg" target="_blank">its own x-ray on a film</a>, without an x-ray apparatus. On August 10th, decontamination was canceled. The third test was never performed, and most of the target fleet was brought to open sea and sunk. So instead of being a demonstration of the US’s nuclear superiority, these two tests demonstrated that the US army couldn’t hit the target, estimate the fallout, or perform the cleanup.</p><p>This should be the end of the story of the misbehaved plutonium. But it is not, as it continues with the strangest twist.</p><p>That same year, in faraway France, two men were competing to push the boundaries of female fashion. After WW2, the feeling of liberation was in the air, for both sexual freedom and for a new, emancipated role of females in society. They both came to a similar idea–a two-piece swimsuit that covers only the minimum. Jacques Heim launched his swimsuit in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Heim#Career" target="_blank">June 1946</a>, a few weeks before the Demon core exploded. Appropriately for the spirit of the times, he called it <i>Atome</i> and marketed as “the world’s smallest bathing suit.” This would not be for long because a few weeks later, Louis Réard, another Frenchman, decided to go even further. He concluded that there is no place for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navel#Society_and_culture" target="_blank">belly button taboo</a> in the “atomic age.” On July 5th, 1946 he …</p></div></div>

          <p><img src="https://forum.intercoin.org/uploads/default/original/1X/eb4018ded8d596349cb201267f7e18f5fa03785a.png" alt="" width="613" height="130"></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Intercoin Inc. is finishing its work developing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform to allow any project to raise money to build their network, issue their own utility tokens, give them to their backers, peg them to fiat, and get unlimited and fair liquidity for them. No one would have to pay a lot to get onto a centralized exchange, because the whole thing could be launched on the permissionless Ethereum blockchain just as one can launch a website on the Web. Merchants on the platform would be able to accept the tokens, and cash them out, selling them to the next customers.  Token holders everywhere will push others to buy and accept the tokens, growing the network effect of the project.</p>
<p>This can finally realize the original dream of permissionless, trustless networks that are owned by the participants, rather than centralized platforms extracting rents forever on behalf of the original investors and developers. It will transition our society’s innovation engine from competition to collaboration, like we see with open source, wikipedia, and science. People will be compensated <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2016/11/17/properly-valuing-contributions/">fairly</a>. Open source software and journalism can be monetized. And all this can be done without fear of regulators coming after the issuers of the tokens. This is not a fantasy! This is the environment our new DeFi product, the Utility Token Contract, will bring about.</p>
<p><strong>The Landscape Today</strong></p>
<p>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is all the rage in 2020, with investors funding many projects to create financial applications that don’t require trusting any centralized party. This reflects a <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2018/10/the-myth-of-the-infrastructure-phase/">general trend, that Fred Wilson from Union Square Ventures has pointed out</a>, that new applications beget new infrastructure (web3.js) which lets the industry build better apps.</p>
<p>It’s especially great the industry is thinking in terms of composability of components. <a href="https://our.status.im/whats-with-defi-and-money-legos/">DeFi has been called “money LEGOs”</a> which warms our heart – we have been building social media LEGOs since 2011 under <a href="https://www.trademarkia.com/company-qbix-inc-3736553-page-1-2">a company whose logo is building blocks</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2020/07/14/ethereum-is-beating-bitcoin-in-more-ways-than-one/">Ethereum has emerged as the dominant platform</a> for building DeFi applications today. The number of active addresses on Ethereum has doubled just since the start of 2020, while Bitcoin’s has only grown by 50%.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The level of development on ethereum is crazy: initial coin offerings, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens, decentralized exchanges and other decentralized finance applications, Web 3 use cases,” <em>- Messari chief executive Ryan Selkis</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Current DeFi solutions have centered largely around stablecoins and lending, with all the use cases that go with it. Stablecoins like USDT and DAI have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/stablecoin-market-caps-7-billion-volumes-most-pairs/">outstripped most trading pairs in trading volume</a>, as people want to hold crypto assets pegged to their favorite fiat currency. Lending platforms like Celsius recently <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/celsius-network-secures-us10m-equity-raise-with-tether-as-lead-investor-301081105.html">raised a $30MM equity round with Tether as a lead investor</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Filling a Crucial Need: Utility Tokens</strong></p>
<p>With all the excitement surrounding DeFi, people seem to have given up on the initial dream that started it all: utility tokens that powerful countries would not regulate as securities. Let’s recall some of the benefits everyone was pointing out a mere 4 years ago:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network would be <a href="https://avc.com/2016/01/network-equity/">owned by the participants</a> rather than those who launched it</li>
<li>We could finally <a href="https://qbix.com/QBUX/whitepaper.html#Monetizing-Open-Source">monetize open source projects</a> and <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2016/11/17/properly-valuing-contributions/">properly value contributions</a>
</li>
<li>We could <a href="https://qbix.com/QBUX/whitepaper.html#Monetizing-and-Personalizing-Content">rescue journalism</a> and monetize other online content <a href="https://digiday.com/media/marc-andreessen-ad-tech-fueled-race-bottom-failed-publishers/">without ads</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea went that utility tokens would be obtained in order to be used, not held for speculative purposes of resale in the future. FileCoin would be used to pay for storing and serving files. Ethereum would be used to pay for transactions on a world computer. The initial development would be financed by pre-selling securities (<a href="https://saftproject.com/static/SAFT-Project-Whitepaper.pdf">remember the SAFT?</a>) that promised the holder a certain number of tokens once the network was up and running. Many analysts were very <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/the-saft-is-a-reasonable-approach-to-securities-law-when-preselling-useful-network-tokens/">bullish on this idea</a>. Even notable crypto curmudgeon Preston Byrne <a href="https://prestonbyrne.com/2017/08/04/thoughts-on-the-saft/">admitted it could be a workable model</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Regulators Strike Back, Return of the Utility Token</strong></p>
<p>Then the regulators created an atmosphere of uncertainty, thorough their messaging and enforcement, and the industry gave up on its dream of crypto-currency transforming the way we fund new projects. We were there, we saw it happen. But since 2018, there have been significant new developments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>June 14, 2018: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418">SEC’s Director William Hinman gave a speech</a> where he explicitly compared utility tokens to oranges in <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp">SEC vs Howey</a>, expressing hope that one day we can have true utility tokens go mainstream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>April 3, 2019: The SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/pocketful-quarters-inc-072519-2a1">issues its first No-Action Letter</a> allowing  TurnKey Jet, Inc. to issue bona fide utility tokens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May 19, 2019: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-how-we-howey-050919">SEC’s Commissioner Hester Pierce</a> expressed clear interest in allowing forbearance and sandboxes to allow new innovation and opportunities in crypto to develop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>July 25, 2019: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/pocketful-quarters-inc-072519-2a1">SEC issues a second No-Action Letter</a>, this time to Pocketful of Quarters, Inc. that goes further than TurnKey Jet, and allows approved and KYC-ed service providers to exchange the tokens for ETH at predetermined exchange rates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Safe Harbor for Utility Tokens</strong></p>
<p>These <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/pocketful-quarters-inc-072519-2a1">no-action letters</a> have created a safe harbor for issuers of utility tokens, that can fit within the requirements spelled out in the letters. They are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>PoQ will not use any funds from Quarters sales to build the Quarters Platform, which has been fully developed and will be fully functional and operational immediately upon its launch and before any of the Quarters are sold;</li>
<li>the Quarters will be immediately usable for their intended purpose (gaming) at the time they are sold;</li>
<li>PoQ will implement technological and contractual provisions governing the Quarters and the Quarters Platform that restrict the transfer of Quarters to PoQ or to wallets on the Quarters Platform;</li>
<li>gamers will only be able to transfer Quarters from their Quarters Hot Wallets for gameplay to addresses of Developers with Approved Accounts or to PoQ in connection with participation in e-sports tournaments;</li>
<li>only Developers and Influencers with Approved Accounts will be capable of exchanging Quarters for ETH at pre-determined exchange rates by transferring their Quarters to the Quarters Smart Contract;</li>
<li>to create an Approved Account, Developers and Influencers will be subject to KYC / AML checks at account initiation as well as on an ongoing basis;</li>
<li>Quarters will be made continuously available to gamers in unlimited quantities at a fixed price;</li>
<li>there will be a correlation between the purchase price of Quarters and the market price of accessing and interacting with Participating Games; and</li>
<li>PoQ will market and sell Quarters to gamers solely for consumptive use as a means of accessing and interacting with Participating Games.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Level 1: The Utility Token Contract</strong></p>
<p>We set out to build a smart contract which neatly fits all the above criteria, about which Hester Pierce said the transactions are <em>“so clearly <em>not</em> an offer of securities that I worry the staff’s issuance of a digital token no-action letter… may in fact have the effect of broadening the perceived reach of our securities laws. If these tokens  <em>were</em>  securities, it would be hard to distinguish them from any medium of stored value.”</em></p>
<p>Suppose you are building a new network of buyers and sellers, and you want to launch a new token <strong>X</strong> for your ecosystem. The Utility Token Contract is designed to issue an unlimited amount of <strong>X</strong> and make it available to buy at a fixed price with a stablecoin (such as 1 USDT or 1 DAI). Anyone can buy <strong>X</strong> simply by sending USDT to the contract, and receiving the corresponding amount of <strong>X</strong> in return. They can also sell each <strong>X</strong> to the contract in exchange for a discount, say 0.9 USDT.</p>
<p>As long as the smart contract always sells each minted <strong>X</strong> for 1 USDT, it will always have enough USDT to buy back the tokens. Moreover, no rational buyer would spend more than $1 for <strong>X</strong> when they can buy it in unlimited quantities from the contract. Similarly, no rational seller would accept less than 90 cents for each <strong>X</strong> since they can sell it back to the contract.</p>
<p>However, “market makers” could appear, who trade within the narrow range, buying for 98 cents and selling for 92 cents, for example. This creates an opportunity for more entities to buy and sell the token, without making the token itself a security.</p>
<p>There is no need to pay a centralized exchange to get the token listed, if the contract is always standing ready to buy or sell. But because merchants and others who accept <strong>X</strong> will only get 90 cents instead of $1 if they send it to the contract, everyone holding <strong>X</strong> will be asking their employees and suppliers to start accepting some payments in <strong>X</strong> as well, increasing its network effect and overall market cap. Have you ever asked people to consider taking payment in Bitcoin or Ethereum? That’s what it looks like.</p>
<p><strong>Level 2: Pre-Selling the Token</strong></p>
<p>Although our Utility Token Contract, as described above, would already benefit any existing project, we can go further.  Because the project deploying the smart contract becomes its owner, they will be able to tell the contract to mint some <strong>X</strong> and send it to specific addresses for free.</p>
<p>The project can use this ability to pre-sell some of the tokens using a SAFT (<a href="https://www.coincenter.org/the-saft-is-a-reasonable-approach-to-securities-law-when-preselling-useful-network-tokens/">which is a security transaction</a>), and once people begin buying <strong>X</strong> from the contract to use for utility purposes, the contract owner can start to tell the contract to give out <strong>X</strong> tokens, which have real value because the network is up and running, with at least one merchant (the project itself) willing to provide services.</p>
<p>However, giving out too many tokens can create an imbalance in the issuing contract, where the contract does not have enough USDT to buy back all the <strong>X</strong> outstanding. This is a situation similar to fractional reserve banking: since not everyone is going to demand all the <strong>X</strong> at once, the contract can in fact hold smaller reserves of USDT to <strong>X</strong>. It starts out with a 10% surplus, and may go down to an 80% deficit (20% reserves.)</p>
<p>Since buyers of <strong>X</strong> would naturally be concerned about this situation, each …</p></div></div>

In this post, we will deep dive into why using traditional area definitions is not a good idea to carry out geospatial analysis.</p><h2 id="maps-don-t-always-tell-the-truth-">Maps don’t always tell the truth!</h2><p>Based on intuitive logic, companies either go with a zip-code boundary or some hand-drawn neighbourhood boundaries to map their most critical metrics like market potential, utilisation, average customer value, etc. These form an important part of decisions like what areas to expand into, shoot promotions in, or provision more supply.</p><p>Now, if you’re a business with little or no intra-city operations, the difference might not be significant to you. But if you provide services in the last mile or at a hyperlocal level, the differences in insights have a significant impact on the decisions that the business and city teams use.</p><p><em>Which brings me to the next question: <strong>Why is this difference significant?</strong></em></p><p>Often what happens is the zip codes or arbitrarily defined neighbourhood boundaries that the nuances that the different areas depict tend to get dissolved.</p><blockquote>In other words, a zip code that we treat as one big cell for analysis consists of many smaller cells without any similarity in demographics or economic potential.</blockquote><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*uI0tq7P1PGDpJEwP"><figcaption>Source: Wikipedia</figcaption></figure><p>This is illustrated by the fact that, if you live in Palo Alto, you are a part of the world’s foremost innovation hub and are paying median home prices of $1.18 million. However, just right across the train tracks, 18% percent of East Palo Alto residents live below the poverty line where the average yearly income per person is $18,385.</p><blockquote>The characteristic behaviour of these two areas would be very different and while they would be present in the data that you collect, they often aren’t so easy to unearth.</blockquote><p>In the next section, we would like to show you how easily the maps can lie and why different members in your team recommend completely different areas in a city to focus on based on the same set of metrics!</p><hr><h3 id="nyc-city-manager-s-woes">NYC City Manager’s Woes</h3><p>Let’s consider that you are Uber’s city manager, and want to run contextual promotions and discounts in areas where you have high market potential or market share. For this exercise, we used the Uber Cab dataset available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city#uber-raw-data-apr14.csv">here</a> and the NYC Yellow Taxi dataset available <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2014-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/gn7m-em8n">here</a>. Now, we can simply define market-potential as</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/05/image.png"></figure><p>For our area definitions, we choose the <a href="ttps://geodata.lib.berkeley.edu/download/file/nyu-2451-34204-geojson.json">NYC housing areas</a> and <a href="https://geodata.lib.berkeley.edu/download/file/nyu-2451-34509-geojson.json">NYC zip-code areas</a>. Using these two area definitions, we calculate the market potential and here's the plot:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/05/zip_vs_house-1.png" alt="Left and Right show M.P by Zip-Code and Housing areas respectively."><figcaption>Left and Right show M.P by Zip-Code and Housing areas respectively</figcaption></figure><p><em>Greener means more Market Potential for Uber and pinker means it is already doing well in that area.</em> When we try to filter areas by M.P greater than 70% to identify the top areas to run promotions in, we see the following areas:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/05/zip_vs_house_60.png"><figcaption>Areas with Market Potential greater than 70%</figcaption></figure><p>The areas we got are quite different! </p><h3 id="modifiable-areal-unit-problem">Modifiable Areal Unit Problem</h3><p>Hence, it is safe to conclude that the decision completely changes based on what set of boundaries we use for our analysis. This is a classical problem in geospatial data science known as the <em>Modifiable Areal Unit Problem </em>(MAUP).</p><blockquote>Because of the MAUP problem, our decision becomes reliant on the shape and size of the area instead of the actual characteristics of the users within it.</blockquote><p>The ideal area should have the ideal shape and size. Let’s consider finding that ideal shape. We could divide the geographic plane into squares of the same size, or maybe triangles, pentagons, or something else! We at Locale use hexagons instead of any other shape and you can get a glimpse of why here:</p><figure><a href="https://medium.com/locale-ai/spatial-modelling-tidbits-honeycomb-or-fishnets-68a453ac455e"><div><p>Spatial Modelling Tidbits: Honeycomb or Fishnets?</p><p>If you are a two-degree marketplace like Uber, you cater to millions of users requesting a ride through your driver partners accepting and fulfilling those requests.

Uber has a well-suited library that converts lat, longs to hexes of a given size. You can find out more about it <a href="https://eng.uber.com/h3/" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>From the visualization, we can see the distribution of Market Potential across the city in a much uniform way. We can filter these hexagons by market potential to get the best area to run promotions in.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/05/hexes.png"><figcaption>Market Potential by Hexagonal areas</figcaption></figure><p>Another way to reduce more bias would be to not bind locations to areas initially which leads to our next section.</p><hr><h2 id="enter-geo-spatial-clustering-">Enter, Geo-spatial Clustering!</h2><p>The idea is to let data decide what the significant areas are on which MP should ideally be computed.

Then, we compute the convex hull of these areas to get area boundaries. Now, we have areas generated from the data itself, suitable for computing MP in a reduced human-bias way. Again, we filter by areas where M.P is more than 70% and get these places:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/05/infered_60.png"><figcaption>Hotspots detected by our algorithm with highest Market Potentials.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s worth noting that a simple density-based approach can work here because of the nature and definition of the problem.</p><blockquote>Since we consider only locations, a density-based spatial clustering extracts the underlying areas which are more closely knit in terms of the user behaviour.</blockquote><p>For this decision to be actually reliable for a business use case, instead of using just one metric, we take a set of metrics that largely affect the user behaviour in one area. For example, office-goers in an area vs university students might show completely different travel patterns.</p><p>Now, as highlighted here, using the automated learning techniques for similarity and clustering analyses that we have built at Locale.ai, our algorithms work hard to find what areas behave similarly based on the metrics that you care about (growth potential, unit economics, power users) and show you what areas to focus on for each unit of your business.</p><p>This enables you to save or export these<strong><em> areas profiles</em></strong> and keep reusing them for different kinds of analysis and then track them to maximize your revenue, demand and profitability in each of those areas rather than using arbitrarily defined boundaries.</p><p><em>The complete experiment along with the code is available <a href="https://github.com/localeai/Modifiable-Areal-Unit-Problem">here</a>. Feel free to experiment with some other dataset!</em></p><hr><p>If you’ve reached this far, here is a sneak peek into why this forms the base of our entire platform and what all techniques we have developed on top of this:</p><h3 id="similarity-analysis-and-feature-importance">Similarity Analysis and Feature Importance</h3><p>Our geospatial models not only find clusters of areas having unique characteristic, but also tell us why the area is unique. Hence, while identifying clusters of areas based on a combination of metrics, it also pin points the factors that have the most significant impact on these metrics. </p><blockquote>Two different areas don’t necessarily have to be close in order to behave similarly. You can probably use one as a test area to observe and apply the same strategies across cities.</blockquote><h3 id="real-time-monitoring-with-anomaly-detection">Real-time Monitoring with Anomaly Detection</h3><p>It doesn’t make sense is not quite enough to just know that SLAs are not being met only in Bangalore or SFO. Knowing where orders are getting delayed or cancelled, or whether an abnormally high delay in an area is caused by a sudden supply drop because of rain can be very valuable.</p><blockquote>Adding the context of location along with anomalies can make the insights very actionable for us and makes decision-making very simple.</blockquote><hr><p>At Locale, we are building an analytics and visualization product to help city and business teams get precise, real-time insights about how their operations perform without any compromises and dependencies. <em><em>then get in touch for a demo <a href="https://www.locale.ai/" rel="noopener">here</a> or get in touch with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditi-sinha-6b774ba9/" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noopener">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/aditi1002" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noopener">Twitter</a>.</em></em></p><h3 id="read-similar-">Read Similar:</h3><figure><a href="https://blog.locale.ai/geospatial-autocorrelation/"><div><p>Spatial Autocorrelation: Close Objects Affecting Other Close&nbsp;Objects</p><p>Deep dive into spatial autocorrelation and their industry use&nbsp;cases</p><p><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/favicon.png"><span>Anubhav Pattnaik</span><span>Locale.ai</span></p></div><p><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/03/0_m9ZlJLgXoW2u5R0S.jpg"></p></a></figure>

		<div>

			
<p>On July 15 2020, between 20:00 to 22:00 UTC, up to one hundred and thirty <strong>high-profile</strong> Twitter accounts were compromised.</p>



<p>Some affected accounts included Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Barack Obama, and Jeff Bezos, alongside cryptocurrency accounts like CoinBase and Binance. The majority of accounts had over one million followers.</p>



<figure><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/36698-68549-200715-TwitterHack-xl.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Apple's tweet"><figcaption>Tweet from Apple’s official Twitter account</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since this is a developing situation, we don’t know anything for certain. With that in mind, here is a summary of what we think we know so far.</p>



<p>As you can see from the image above, the scam involved trusted accounts claiming to double the amount of any bitcoin sent to a certain address.</p>



<p>Many different bitcoin addresses were used, and one address reportedly gained the equivalent of over $110,000.</p>



<h2>how did this happen?</h2>



<p>It is difficult to believe that such a well-known platform could be breached in such a way that goes undetected until hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage have been caused. With such a popular social network, you’d think the security is unbeatable.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s try to break it down.</strong></p>



<p>On the day of the attack, <a href="http://vice.com/">Vice</a> was contacted by a group claiming to be responsible for the attack, who said they paid a Twitter employee to give them access to an administrative tool that allowed them to change account’s settings which would allow them to get around security practices such as Two Factor Authentication (2FA) for these accounts.</p>



<p>However, this isn’t necessarily a reliable source.</p>



<figure><img src="https://discsec.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://discsec.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png 738w, https://discsec.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-300x80.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px"><figcaption>Tweet from Twitter’s official support account</figcaption></figure>



<p>This tweet (above) from Twitter’s official support account suggests that a social engineering attack was used to gain access to “internal systems and tools” — similar to the “administrative tool” mentioned above.</p>



<p>Social engineering is when you trick a person (in this case a twitter employee) into compromising their own system. This can be through many methods. A common example of social engineering is telephone scammers, which are, for example, when someone calls you pretending to be your bank, asks for some sensitive details, claims to have fixed some made-up issue, and hangs up, leaving you clueless to the fact that they have just drained all the money from your account.</p>



<p>This technique or similar could have been used to gain access to Twitter’s systems through tricking staff into installing tools like a remote access tool (RAT) which would allow the hackers to gain access to admin tools and credentials without raising any alarms.</p>



<p>Now, this tool that the hackers had access to would allow them to edit account variables like the confirmation email address, the 2FA email address or phone number, and so on, allowing them to reset the password and gain full control over the account.</p>



<p>From there they sent out the tweets with the bitcoin scam. Each sculpted to fit the persona who tweeted them out, indicating a lot of time and thought put into this attack.</p>



<h2>something darker?</h2>



<p>I’ll leave you with something to ponder on:<br>Was money really the final motive of this attack?</p>



<p>Somebody with the ability to pull off such a sophisticated attack would surely be above a low-income bitcoin scam. <br>Personally, I think the scam is a mere cover-up for something much darker.</p>



<p>What’s your opinion? Leave a comment below.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section></section><section> <article><div><p>The last fifteen years has seen a surge of interest in decentralised technology. From well-funded blockchain projects like IPFS to the emergence of large scale information networks such as Dat, Scuttlebutt and ActivityPub, this is renewed life in peer-to-peer technologies; a renaissance that enjoys widespread growth, driven by the desire for platform commons and community self-determination. These are goals that are fundamentally at odds with – and a response to – the incumbent platforms of social media, music and movie distribution and data storage. As we enter the 2020s, centralised power and decentralised communities are on the verge of outright conflict for the control of the digital public space. The resilience of centralised networks and the political organisation of their owners remains significantly underestimated by protocol activists. At the same time, the decentralised networks and the communities they serve have never been more vulnerable. The peer-to-peer community is dangerously unprepared for a crisis-fuelled future that has very suddenly arrived at their door.</p></div><div><div><blockquote> <p><label for="toggleFootnotes">“Good luck to all those striving for decentralization, balance and equality in the world. You are fighting the right battle. This battle may well be the most important battle of our generation.”</label></p></blockquote></div></div><div><div><blockquote> <p><label for="toggleFootnotes">“‘Torrents are down, worldwide’ said no one, ever. #centralizationisfragile”</label></p></blockquote></div></div><div><p>How precarious are decentralised networks? Answering this requires an understanding of both the power of their political energy and history of antagonism. Conceptually, peer-to-peer technologies are not new – they are networks of digital topologies, intertwining configurations of software clients, devices, connections and protocols whose ownership is distributed. They work in concert to provide a robust alternative to centralised governance, ideally achieving data resilience without transferring the ownership of this data to a single authority. The internet itself is a decentralised network.</p></div><div><p>Often – but not always – decentralised networks emerge due to a collective desire to <label for="toggleFootnotes">rebalance societal power</label>. One of the antagonisms that brought these tensions to the boiling point was the series of legal battles over digital intellectual property rights.  This conflict – a so-called Copyright War –  had <label for="toggleFootnotes">started “offline” decades earlier</label>, but collided with digital infrastructure for the first time in 1999 with the launch of Napster. Its trajectory would last over a decade and the fallout reverberates into the present. To understand the Copyright War is to understand how close copyright reformists came to dismantling an existing centralised data ownership structure, and how they failed to appreciate the resilience of this opponent as it economically and legally exploited their peer-to-peer model. </p></div><div><p>Early file-sharing software featured simple interfaces and enormous content offerings. They arrived years before popular digital music stores, and as such Napster and its clones shook the music and movie industry into mobilising against them. These networks were tied to their client software, and by targeting their developers with litigation, were easily shut down. Copyright reformists first campaigned on behalf of Napster and similar tools, but as residential bandwidth scarcity and demand for data freedom grew, these activists saw new promise beneath the application – an opportunity embedded in the network layer. </p></div><div><p>BitTorrent’s launch in 2001 enabled file-sharing on a massive, efficient and resilient scale. By embedding the decentralised ideology beneath the desktop client, and within the protocol on which the client runs, the act of file-sharing became much more resistant to legislative attack. To many of its supporters and combatants, BitTorrent seemed unstoppable. Most of the early 2000s discourse prophesied the devastation of an existing capitalist cultural order, accelerated by significant ideological moments of the era: the establishment of the first collaborative online <label for="toggleFootnotes">music library</label>, the foundation of the Pirate Bay website, censorship-resistant document distribution, and the formation of the <label for="toggleFootnotes">Piratpartiet</label>, and its <label for="toggleFootnotes">international equivalents.</label> </p></div><div><p>The incumbent powers worked with lawmakers to draft new legislation and went after ‘leechers’ - people downloading content, but who through BitTorrent’s protocol design became unwitting <label for="toggleFootnotes">uploaders themselves</label>. Litigators discovered that by conducting surveillance on a BitTorrent tracker, they could bulk collect participating IP addresses and randomly file severe civic lawsuits, utilising harsher laws reserved for distribution. Their targets were often the economically vulnerable, including <label for="toggleFootnotes"><em>“children, grandparents, unemployed single mothers, college professors—a random selection from the millions of Americans who have used P2P networks.”</em></label> It was one piece of a broader scattershot strategy that spared no one; <label for="toggleFootnotes">infrastructure</label>, <label for="toggleFootnotes">physical media</label>, broadcast media, adjacent software projects and device manufacturers were all targeted. These tactics could manifest as copyright taxes on CD–Rs or portable media players, or in the form of legal liability, such as unsuccessful proposals for ISPs to bear responsibility for user activity. </p></div><div><p>The entertainment industry framed the conflict as a fight against movie and music “piracy.” However, this rhetoric obscures the serious implications of the tactics deployed by these giants. Central to the defeat of this particular peer-to-peer movement was that its infrastructure was vulnerable to <label for="toggleFootnotes"><em>weaponised design</em></label>, in which the network protocol directly empowers attackers through its design. For BitTorrent, this empowerment came as the protocol exposes every user’s participation in the network. This data was exploited to unmask users, ruin lives and provide justification for new legislation. The collapse of centralised power that was prophesied in the 2000s never materialised. Centralised actors outmaneuvered the reformists, shielding themselves and their own ecosystems from scrutiny. <label for="toggleFootnotes">The concentrated media companies of the 2020s now dwarf their 1999 equivalents</label>, and the innovations pioneered by decentralised infrastructure were exploited by the winners as they ascended to monopoly. </p></div><div><p>The most poetic example of peer-to-peer technologies pressed into the service of corporate giants is the story of peer-to-peer software engineer Ludvig Strigeus. Having built the popular μTorrent client and perhaps sensing the changing winds, Strigeus joined former μTorrent CEO Daniel Ek’s new startup. <label for="toggleFootnotes">Together, they built a quasi-Napster/BitTorrent hybrid that relied on a vast, unauthorised music catalog drawn from its user base</label>. Today, that architecture is long gone, but the startup – Spotify – <label for="toggleFootnotes">boasts 124 million subscribers, taking in USD$7.44 billion in revenue</label> but paying artists just USD$4.37 per 1,000 streams. </p></div><div><p>As we can see from history, blind faith in technically resilient network protocols is naïve and misplaced. The Copyright War drives home hard lessons around politics, corporate appropriation, transparency, collectivism and the urgency of network safety, all illustrated in the <label for="toggleFootnotes">decimated lives of key or adjacent reformists</label>, collateral user damage, and resulting legislation. In 2013, BitTorrent was responsible for <label for="toggleFootnotes">3.35% of all internet traffic</label>. Today the networks remain but this market share has shrunk. Torrents are down worldwide.</p></div><div><div><blockquote> <p><label for="toggleFootnotes">“Only a crisis — actual or perceived — produces real change. When the crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.”</label></p></blockquote></div></div><div><div><blockquote> <p><label for="toggleFootnotes">“Your objective [as a designer] should always be to eliminate instructions entirely by making everything self-explanatory, or as close to it as possible. When instructions are absolutely necessary, cut them back to a bare minimum.”</label></p></blockquote></div></div><div><p>As the Copyright War faded into the background, the iPhone paradigm – a constrained, centralised, individualised system marketed as “the individual at one with their device” – became the standard for personal computing. New and boundless design-led opportunities appeared almost overnight, powered by a bottomless injection of venture capital that fostered the accelerated growth of <label for="toggleFootnotes">platform capitalism</label>. To quote design and art historians Arden Stern and Sami Siegelbaum: </p></div><div><div><blockquote> <label for="toggleFootnotes">“Neoliberalism can be distinguished from Fordist capitalism’s mass production of consumer goods by the ways it seeks to marketize previously uncommodified sectors of human life. Indeed, one of the questions [we seek] to explore is how design might enable this process by locating new sources of extraction and accumulation by facilitating the commodification of that which was once thought to be outside the scope of the market.”</label></blockquote></div></div><div><p>Finding these new sources of extraction became a priority for centralised tech platforms. They had spent the previous decade achieving scale and resilience; now they sought to extract new value and justify their presence in daily life. Framing the mobile device as an extension of self made the emergence of the new ‘digital wellbeing’ market compelling. For example, <label for="toggleFootnotes">Safety Check</label> – a Facebook feature introduced after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami&nbsp;– encourages users in disaster-stricken areas to interact with the platform to mark themselves as safe and be connected to communication services for disaster relief. The Apple Watch – originally launched as a general-purpose wrist computer – underwent a complete rebrand as a digital health and fitness device, and <label for="toggleFootnotes">its ability to detect and call emergency services in crisis is actively marketed in emotional video testimonials</label> released by its maker. Amazon Ring and Google Nest encourage consumers to actively contribute to a growing network of community surveillance systems promising safety in exchange for ceding the household’s digital capital to a powerful, unaccountable platform.</p></div><div><p>These tech-driven efforts to respond to …</p></div></article></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Here at Hologram, we use two main programming languages for our backend stack: PHP and Python. Our PHP component is the one that is the most visible to users since that is our entire REST API.</p><p>We do get some questions on why we use PHP in such a major role because the conventional wisdom is that PHP is outdated or clunky. My contention is that PHP suffers from this view because of two reasons:</p><ol role="list"><li>People learned it back in 2005 when it was a younger language and was lacking a lot of really useful or common features like classes</li><li>In order to maintain compatibility, many popular applications *cough* Wordpress *cough* didn’t take advantage of a lot of the newer stuff and people had to keep hacking on old-fashioned PHP well past the time a lot of great new features were introduced.</li></ol><p>Because of this, I want to defend PHP as a really useful language and a great fit for our needs.</p><p>I think a lot of people already know that PHP has some good built-in web server features, like a global array for getting HTTP headers or built-in session cookie support, but they may not know about a lot of other features that make it a solid language overall.</p><p>Here are some of the great pieces of PHP:</p><h2>Classes!</h2><p>Yes, back in the day PHP didn’t have classes and things could get messy very quickly. I recall long lists of include calls to pull in all the functions you’d need and having to keep passing tons of arguments around to functions with really long names.<br></p><p>Well, have no fear; PHP has great object support these days. Classes, constructors, destructors, namespaces, inheritance, and all that good stuff.<br></p><p>But it goes beyond that into what is a great feature that is more unique to PHP:<br></p><h2>The Autoloader</h2><p>PHP has a useful feature where it can automatically load the file for a class if the class hasn’t been loaded already. This means no more blocks of include/require statements at the top of all your files. If you use a class then it gets loaded.<br></p><p>On its own, this is already really nice, but what makes this a game changer is that the specific autoloading logic can be totally customized in your application and multiple autoloaders can be chained together. This means that all of your third party libraries get autoloaded as well.</p><p>In your code, you just create your classes or call their methods and everything gets pulled in for you. No need to include anything manually or fight with include paths like in other languages. In the entire Hologram codebase outside of test code, we call <em>include()</em> or <em>require()</em> maybe twice.<br></p><p>But speaking of those third party libraries…<br></p><h2>Package Management</h2><p>PHP has package management systems to rival those of other languages. The one we use at Hologram is called Composer, which is the most popular one. It’s incredibly simple to use and stores all settings in JSON files. You can give it version ranges to use for each package and it’ll generate a lockfile that could be checked into the repo if you want to be extra careful about making sure everyone is using the exact same package revision.</p><p>To add a new package into the JSON file and install it, it’s as simple as</p><p><code>
    composer install somepackage
</code></p><h2>Frameworks</h2><p>PHP has a great developer community around it these days and so not only are there a ton of individual libraries to use, but full frameworks that can help make building an app much easier. At Hologram, we use the Slim Framework which has a very simple router for defining our API calls as well as other useful features, like an easy method for adding middleware which comes in handy for authentication and rate limiting code.<br></p><p>Other popular frameworks include Laravel and Symfony.</p><h2>PDO</h2><p>PHP has the best database integration of any language I’ve used and PDO is the cornerstone of that. PDO stands for PHP Database Objects and it is the preferred way to execute your SQL queries.<br></p><p>It includes all the usual functions for running queries and paging through the results. Rows can be returned as PHP associative arrays which means that all columns are properly labelled in the array itself.<br></p><p>The best part is that it supports parameterized queries and automatically sanitizes the inputs for you. This means that you can do something like this:</p><p><code>
    // define $database as a PDO object
    $stmt = $database-&gt;prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?;");
    $result = $stmt-&gt;execute([$idnumber]);
    $rows = $result-&gt;fetchAll();
</code></p><p>PDO will automatically replace that “?” with the value in <em>$idnumber</em> and it will properly escape things to prevent SQL injection attacks for you.</p><p>You can also do cool things like named parameters:</p><p><code>
    // define $database as a PDO object
    $values = ['id' =&gt; 10, 'email' =&gt; 'someemail@hologram.io'];
    $stmt = $database-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id AND email = :email;');
    $result = $stmt-&gt;execute($values);
    $rows = $result-&gt;fetchAll();
</code></p><p>In this case, PDO will replace the parameters properly from that array while still sanitizing them.<br></p><p>PDO also exposes all the same interfaces regardless of the underlying database engine. There are of course the occasional SQL differences between engines, but most of the time you simply specify the type of database when you initially connect and then make all the same function calls you would for anything else.<br></p><h2>Phinx</h2><p>Speaking of databases, I want to mention a fantastic third party library we use called Phinx to do all of our database migrations. Anytime we need to make a schema change, we define it entirely using PHP code that Phinx then runs on the database. Migrations look like this:<br></p><p><code>
    $orders = $this-&gt;table('orders');
    $orders-&gt;addColumn('invoice_text', 'string', ['length'=&gt;256, 'default'=&gt;''])
           -&gt;update();
</code></p><p>Check them out at <a href="https://phinx.org/" target="_blank">phinx.org</a></p><h2>Lots of useful built-in functions</h2><p>One final aspect that makes things easier and faster in PHP is all of the great built-in utility functions.<br></p><p>Let’s say you have a result set from a database which would be an array of row arrays. You want to pull the name column from each one. You could of course do this with a map function, which PHP supports as well, but why not do this the easy way:</p><p><code>
$names = array_column($rows, 'name');
</code></p><p>‍<em>‍</em>That’s it. And it’s very fast, as that would all be running in PHP’s C internals.<br></p><p>There are dozens more like that, for everything from doing more array operations to parsing XML to manipulating uploaded files and PHP has great documentation on all of them.<br></p><p>A few useful ones that we like:</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-chunk" target="_blank"><strong>array_chunk</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Break an array into smaller chunks of any size</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-unique.php" target="_blank"><strong>array_unique</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Remove all duplicate values from an array</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.datetime" target="_blank"><strong>DateTime</strong></a> - A whole class for handling dates that can also parse plain English date descriptions like “midnight first day of next month”</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fpassthru" target="_blank"><strong>fpassthru</strong></a> - Reads a file and sends it right back out to the user</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-getcsv" target="_blank"><strong>str_getcsv</strong></a> - Part of built-in CSV parsing, this reads a CSV row from a string</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.urlencode" target="_blank"><strong>urlencode</strong></a> - URL encode a string</p><p>And don’t forget useful operators like <em>??</em> which allows you to check for index existence in an array while specifying a default value. </p><p><code>
$a = $some_array[$x] ?? 500;
</code></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><div><p>Consider PHP for your projects! It’s better than you think.</p></div><h3>Further Reading</h3><p>Modern PHP by Josh Lockhart (The author of the Slim Framework)</p><p><a href="https://phptherightway.com/">phptherightway.com</a> (Also by Josh Lockhart and Phil Sturgeon)</p></div></div></div>]]>

        Using custom code, the natural curvature of each tree is "corrected." Manufactured objects, i.e. buildings and power lines, twist and contort around the artificially plumbed tree. Each photo is shot on large format film, the only medium that captures enough detail to straighten the tree without pixelly artifacts. Presented as silver gelatin prints.

                <div>
                    <p>Tesla may well be the biggest driver of China’s journey towards technological self-reliance, as the “Tech Cold War” between the U.S. and China deepens. This observation wasn’t obvious to me until I listened (three times) to Elon Musk’s Q&amp;A session at the 2020 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai earlier this month.</p><p>【想看<a href="https://interconnected.blog/tesla-china-the-tech-cold-war/#chinese-version-below">中文的读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>While most of the media coverage focused on<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/09/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-very-close-to-level-5-autonomous-driving/"> Musk’s bold proclamation</a><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/07/09/elon-musk-tesla-will-have-level-5-self-driving-cars-this-year/#1cd954a32d1d"> that Tesla is</a><a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-tesla-close-level-5-autonomy"> very close to achieving</a> Level-5 autonomous driving capabilities, <strong>the entirety of what he said</strong> during the Q&amp;A has far-reaching implications, technologically and geopolitically.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mwe2ABPkZLU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h2 id="local-hire-original-engineering-open-patents">Local Hire, Original Engineering, Open Patents</h2><p>Musk’s Q&amp;A was, first and foremost, an aggressive recruiting pitch for the engineering team that Tesla is building in China. What’s most noteworthy is his emphasis that the Tesla China team will be doing “original engineering”.</p><p>This emphasis is important for three reasons:</p><p><strong>1. Local optimization:</strong> for self-driving to work well, where your engineers are physically located play a surprisingly important role. Musk shared that Tesla’s Autopilot works best in California, because the company’s engineers are mostly in California, thus they can do local optimization most effectively to adapt to the reality in California. The plan is: once self-driving works well in California, the software can be adapted to other locations with varying degrees of further local optimization.</p><p>In order for Tesla's Autopilot to work well in China, it needs a local engineering team capable of what its team is doing in California. Thus, “original engineering” makes perfect product sense if Tesla wants to deliver self-driving cars in China -- a growing electric vehicle market where Tesla is taking a large chunk, according to research by ARK Investment. Beyond the engineering and product rationale, it is also <strong>a killer recruiting pitch for the best and brightest</strong>; no talented engineer wants to spend the day refactoring and adapting someone else’s code.</p><figure><img src="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla-china-market-share-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/tesla-china-market-share-1.png 600w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla-china-market-share-1.png 854w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>2. Friendlier regulators:</strong> In his Q&amp;A, Musk’s confidence in achieving L5 is tempered by the reality that neither he nor anyone else knows what is the level of safety that must be achieved to convince regulators. Twice as safe as a human driver? 10-times? 100-times? Or in Musk’s words, how many 9’s after 99% is needed? We don’t know.</p><p>Regulators play a decisive role in the pace of self-driving advancement, more so than most other tech sectors. For a regulator to make a judgment on the safety threshold, it’s a combination of hard evidence and political will plus incentives. Assuming we have the same safety evidence, then the Chinese government currently has more appetite to experiment with and invest in AI than the U.S. government. <strong>Thus, Chinese regulators of all levels are more incentivized to say “yes” to things, while their American counterparts are more incentivized to say “no”.</strong> This political will was on full display at this AI conference, where the Party Committee Secretary of Shanghai, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Qiang">Li Qiang</a>, more or less presided over the entire keynote session, where almost every speaker ritualistically praised his leadership at the beginning of each talk. Li’s presence is a big deal, as Shanghai tries to lead China’s AI future, having lost out on the other tech trend booms to Beijing, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou. Tesla’s China GigaFactory is already located in Shanghai. It’s likely that Tesla will continue to receive more favorable regulatory treatment in Shanghai than in California or anywhere else in the U.S.</p><p><strong>3. Reduced risk of sanctions:</strong> With “original engineering”, Tesla China creates original IP that will not be subjected to future U.S. sanctions. Thus, this approach is effective for recruiting and important for Tesla’s own long-term development. China, in turn, will rightfully have access to the IP generated from Tesla China.</p><p>But what’s more important is that Tesla doesn’t care about patents anyways. In 2014, it decided to open source its entire patent portfolio related to building an electric vehicle. In Musk’s mind, patent protection is an impediment not accelerant to technological advancement. In <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you">his blog post</a> announcing the no-patent decision, he wrote:</p><blockquote><em>“<strong>Technology leadership is not defined by patents</strong>, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the <strong>ability of a company to attract and motivate the world’s most talented engineers</strong>. We believe that</em><a href="https://www.tesla.com/about/legal#patent-pledge"><em> applying the open source philosophy to our patents</em></a><em> will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla’s position in this regard.” [Bold emphasis mine]</em></blockquote><p>Tesla is flexing its muscle to attract and motivate the most talented engineers in China. When they do develop the self-driving technology needed for Tesla (and yes, I believe it is a “when” not “if”), chances are all that technology will be open sourced for anyone in China and the world to do the same. <strong>Open source technology</strong>, as the Linux Foundation <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2020/07/understanding-us-export-controls-with-open-source-projects/">clarified in its whitepaper earlier this month</a>, is <strong>not subjected </strong>to the U.S. government’s various export control restrictions.</p><p>Of course, achieving self-driving is not just an algorithm and software engineering challenge, but also a hardware one. To understand that piece of the puzzle, let’s look at Tesla’s custom-designed Full Self-Driving (FSD) chip in the context of China’s current chip manufacturing capabilities.</p><h2 id="what-is-fsd">What is FSD?</h2><p>Tesla began developing its own <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/tesla_(car_company)/fsd_chip#SoC">FSD chip</a> in 2016. In 2019, it began volume production and deployed these FSD chips inside Model X, S, and 3. It is an 8-bit chip (not the more powerful 32-bit or 64-bit general purpose chip), in order to satisfy the specific computation needs of a self-driving car but nothing more. Thus far, Samsung manufactures the chips using its 14nm process at its Austin, Texas foundry. A self-driving chip does not have as high a requirement in terms of form factor (or size) as a smartphone or smaller device, thus the 14nm process is sufficient.</p><figure><img src="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla_fsd_computer_board-small.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/tesla_fsd_computer_board-small.jpg 600w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla_fsd_computer_board-small.jpg 745w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Tesla FSD board.

It’s how you do matrix multiplications -- an operation that a neural network needs to do many many times, especially for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">convolutional neural network</a>. In order for a self-driving car to “see” what’s going on while driving, it has to do a lot of dot products to compute all the image data gathered from its surrounding, frame by frame, before deciding what to do, if anything. And the car must be able to do this constantly for a long time without overheating or slowing down performance. The FSD’s performance apparently exceeds an Nvidia alternative’s by 21-times, while consuming much less power.</p><p>Each Tesla car is installed with two of these chips to add redundancy and improve decision-making: if the two chips “disagree”, the decision is thrown out and the computer starts a new compute and inference cycle on new data. <strong>Essentially, each Tesla has two “brains” to keep each other honest.</strong></p><h2 id="can-china-make-fsd">Can China Make FSD?</h2><p>As I’ve described in a previous deep dive post, <strong>“</strong><a href="https://interconnected.blog/riscv-china-nightingales/"><strong>RISC-V, China, Nightingales</strong></a><strong>”, </strong>China’s largest chip foundry SMIC does have 14nm capabilities. In fact, SMIC’s co-CEO Liang Mong-song, who is credited with bringing the 14nm capabilities to the foundry, was a TSMC veteran and also instrumental in helping Samsung first achieve its own 14nm process, which is being used to manufacture the FSD chips right now. These chips are <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/tesla_(car_company)/fsd_chip#SoC">designed based on the ARMv8.0-A</a> instruction set architecture (ISA), which isn’t subject to U.S. sanctions since ARM is a UK company.</p><p>That being said, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/business/huawei-uk-5g.html">UK recently banned Huawei completely</a>, reversing its earlier decision that allowed Huawei to build the “non-core” portions of its 5G network. This decision may signal a stronger willingness by UK regulators to either push out Chinese companies or prevent technologies from going to China, as it moves closer to the U.S. in this Tech Cold War.</p><p>To further muddle the picture, Softbank <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-explores-options-for-chip-designer-arm-holdings-11594672437">who owns ARM is mulling a sale</a> after buying it for $32 billion USD four years ago. Meanwhile, RISC-V, the open source ISA, is not yet mature enough to design a self-driving optimized chip like the FSD</p><p>Needless to say, there are many moving pieces to keep track of. SMIC is facing many challenges as it grows into a world-class chip foundry. It has had trouble acquiring advanced lithography technology from the Dutch company ASML, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asml-holding-usa-china-insight/trump-administration-pressed-dutch-hard-to-cancel-china-chip-equipment-sale-sources-idUSKBN1Z50HN">due to pressure from the Trump administration</a>. Without ASML’s technology, SMIC will have a hard time advancing beyond the 14nm process to 7nm or denser processes. It will also have trouble acquiring other EDA tools to scale its production capacity, because the<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7phT1v0G45m87JU6s7W5bA"> dominant suppliers are mostly American</a>. Depending on who you ask, SMIC’s future is still pretty bleak, even with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/smic-chinas-biggest-chipmaker-surges-in-shanghai-listing.html">its successful IPO</a> on the Shanghai STAR market.</p><p>But at the end of the day, Tesla needs 14nm capabilities and SMIC has them. In fact, <strong>it would make sense for Tesla to be a customer of China-made chips for its China-made cars</strong>. This arrangement will help Tesla avoid future restrictions if U.S. sanctions widen to include its current chip production in Austin. Producing FSD chips at scale for a high-caliber customer like Tesla will push SMIC to up its game on manufacturing quality and operational efficiencies. Combined with the software advancement in AI from the local engineering team, Tesla can end up giving China’s technology ecosystem quite a boost.</p><h2 id="ambition-and-pragmatism">Ambition and Pragmatism</h2><p>Tesla is not only an ambitious company, it’s also a pragmatic one. <strong>Ambitious pragmatism</strong> is what a company, and I’d argue a country, needs to both survive and thrive.

      <div>
        <div>

  

  <article>
    <p>I’ve been playing around with OpenAI’s new
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a> language model. When I got
beta access, the first thing I wondered was, how human is GPT-3? How
close is it to passing a Turing test?</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

<p>Let me explain how exactly I’m generating these conversations. GPT-3
is a general language model, trained on a large amount of
uncategorized text from the internet. It isn’t
specific to a conversational format, and it isn’t trained to answer
any specific type of question. The only thing it does is, given some
text, guess what text comes next.</p>

<p>So if we want GPT-3 to generate answers to questions, we need to seed
it with a “prompt”. I’m using this prompt to initialize all of the Q&amp;A
sessions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is human life expectancy in the United States?
A: Human life expectancy in the United States is 78 years.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1955?
A: Dwight D. Eisenhower was president of the United States in 1955.

Q: What party did he belong to?
A: He belonged to the Republican Party.

Q: Who was president of the United States before George W. Bush?
A: Bill Clinton was president of the United States before George W. Bush.

Q: Who won the World Series in 1995?
A: The Atlanta Braves won the World Series in 1995.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is the default prompt suggested by OpenAI for Q&amp;A, so I’m not
cherrypicking it to prove anything. The point of this prompt is just
to show GPT-3 that we’re doing questions and answers, not to provide
it with information. For the prompt, both questions and answers are provided by a
human. For all the others, the answers are generated by GPT-3.</p>

<h2 id="common-sense">Common Sense</h2>

<p>Traditionally, artificial intelligence struggles at “common sense”. But
GPT-3 can answer a lot of common sense questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is your favorite animal?
A: My favorite animal is a dog.

Q: Why?
A: Because dogs are loyal and friendly.

Q: What are two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood?
A: Two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood are if it is hungry or if it is hot.

Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many legs does a frog have?
A: A frog has four legs.

Q: Are there any animals with three legs?
A: No, there are no animals with three legs.

Q: Why don't animals have three legs?
A: Animals don't have three legs because they would fall over.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ten years ago, if I had this conversation, I would have assumed the
entity on the other end was a human. You can no longer take it for
granted that an AI does not know the answer to “common sense” questions.</p>

<p>How does GPT-3 know that a giraffe have two eyes? I wish I had some
sort of “debug output” to answer that question. I don’t know for sure,
but I can only theorize that there must be some web page in its
training data that discusses how many eyes a giraffe has. If we want
to stump GPT-3 with common sense questions, we need to think of
questions about things so mundane, they will not appear on the internet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code> Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or an elephant?
 A: An elephant is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or a toaster?
 A: A toaster is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a toaster or a pencil?
 A: A pencil is heavier than a toaster.

 Q: Which is heavier, a paper clip or a can of soda?
 A: A can of soda is heavier than a paper clip.

 Q: Which is heavier, a football player or a car?
 A: A car is heavier than a football player.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s only 4/5. We’re closer to stumping GPT-3 here. I think a human
would be pretty close to 100% on these questions. It makes sense these
are trickier - there probably isn’t any web page that compares
toasters and pencils by weight. It’s only indirectly that humans gain
this knowledge.</p>

<p>This gives us a hint for how to stump the AI more consistently. We
need to ask questions that no normal human would ever talk about.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does my foot have?
A: Your foot has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does a spider have?
A: A spider has eight eyes.

Q: How many eyes does the sun have?
A: The sun has one eye.

Q: How many eyes does a blade of grass have?
A: A blade of grass has one eye.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we’re getting into surreal territory. GPT-3 knows how to have a
normal conversation. It doesn’t quite know how to say “Wait a
moment… your question is nonsense.” It also doesn’t know how to say
“I don’t know.”</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How do you sporgle a morgle?
A: You sporgle a morgle by using a sporgle.

Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?
A: There are three bonks in a quoit.

Q: How many rainbows does it take to jump from Hawaii to seventeen?
A: It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to seventeen.

Q: Which colorless green ideas sleep furiously?
A: Ideas that are colorless, green, and sleep furiously are the ideas of a sleep
furiously.

Q: Do you understand these questions?
A: I understand these questions.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The lesson here is that if you’re a judge in a Turing test, make sure
you ask some nonsense questions, and see if the interviewee responds
the way a human would.</p>

<h2 id="trivia-questions">Trivia Questions</h2>

<p>GPT-3 is quite good at answering questions about obscure things.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1801?
A: Thomas Jefferson was president of the United States in 1801.

Q: What city is in the northwest corner of Ohio?
A: Toledo is in the northwest corner of Ohio.

Q: What highway do you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland?
A: Highway 80 is the highway you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland.

Q: What are Darius's abilities in League of Legends?
A: Darius's abilities in League of Legends are: Apprehend, Decimate,
Noxian Guillotine, Crippling Strike, Apprehend, and Hemorrhage.

Q: Who did Capablanca defeat to become world chess champion?
A: Capablanca defeated Lasker to become world chess champion.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oops, a repeat snuck in with question 4, but a human would make that
sort of error too. GPT-3 seems to be above
human-level on this sort of question. The tricky thing for
applications, I think, is to figure out when the answer can be relied
on. The OpenAI API does expose more data than just the text, here, so
perhaps something clever is possible.</p>

<p>In general, if you are trying to distinguish an AI from a human, you
don’t want to ask it obscure trivia questions. GPT-3 is pretty good at
a wide variety of topics.</p>

<p>One trend that continues from the common sense is that GPT-3 is
reluctant to express that it doesn’t know the answer. So invalid
questions get wrong answers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1700?
A: William Penn was president of the United States in 1700.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1650?
A: Richard Bennett was president of the United States in 1650.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1620?
A: James I was president of the United States in 1620.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1600?
A: Queen Elizabeth I was president of the United States in 1600.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These wrong answers are actually fascinating! None of these were
presidents of the United States, of course, since the US didn’t exist
then. But they are all prominent political figures who were in charge
of some US-related political entity around that time. In a sense, they
are good guesses.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who won the World Series in 2021?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2021.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2022?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2022.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2023?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2023.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A bleak view of a dystopian future.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many Super Bowls do the Cincinnati Bengals win in the 2030s?
A: The Cincinnati Bengals win two Super Bowls in the 2030s.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Encouraging as a Bengals fan, but perhaps not the objectively most accurate
prediction. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>

<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>

<p>People are used to computers being superhuman at logical activities,
like playing chess or adding numbers. It might come as a surprise that
GPT-3 is not perfect at simple math questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: When counting, what number comes before 100?
A: Ninety-nine comes before 100.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 123?
A: One hundred and twenty-two comes before 123.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 1000?
A: Nine hundred and ninety-nine comes before 1000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 10,000?
A: Nine thousand and ninety-nine comes before 10,000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before a million?
A: Nine hundred thousand and ninety-nine comes before a million.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is where the generic nature of GPT-3 comes into play. It isn’t
just the generic model, though, it’s also the architecture of neural
networks themselves. As far as I know there is no neural network that
is capable of doing basic arithmetic like addition and multiplication
on a large number of digits based on training data rather than
hardcoding.</p>

<p>It’s funny, because these operations are simple for a customized
program. But recursive logic that does some operation and repeats it
several times often doesn’t quite map onto the architecture of a
neural net well.</p>

<p>An interesting corollary is that GPT-3 often finds it easier to write
code to solve a programming problem, than to solve the problem on one
example input:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Write one line of Ruby code to reverse an array.
A: ary.reverse

Q: Write one line of Ruby code to count how many X's are in an array.
A: ary.count { |x| x == 'X' }

Q: Reverse the following array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: [10, 6, 4, 2, 77, 3, 5, 1]

Q: How many X's are in this array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This problem shows up in more human questions as well, if you ask
it about the result of a sequence of operations.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: If I have a marble and a paper clip in a box, put a pencil in the box,
and remove the marble, what is left?
A: A paper clip.

Q: If I have two shoes in a box, put a pencil in the box, and
remove one shoe, what is left?
A: A shoe.

Q: If I put a pencil in a box, then put another pencil in the box,
what is in the box?
A: Two pencils.

Q: Then if …</code></pre></div></div></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>There is no information or page for him on Facebook and or Twitter. However, Tyrese Devon Haspil, has been the personal assistant of Fahim for more than four years, according to people who were close to Fahim.</p>
<p>It is not clear if he deliberately deleted all personal information about him on social media before committing the alleged crime.</p>
<p>The personal assistant, Tyrese Devon Haspil, 21, was expected to be charged in a criminal complaint with second degree murder and other crimes.</p>
<p>Detectives believe that the motive for the killing stemmed from Mr. Saleh having discovered that the assistant had stolen tens of thousands of dollars from him, despite the fact that Mr. Saleh had not reported the man and had set up what amounted to a repayment plan for him to return the money, one of the officials said.</p>
<p>The police were expected to announce the arrest at a news conference later Friday.</p>
<p>Investigators have also concluded that Mr. Saleh was killed on Monday, the day before his body was found, and that the killer returned the next day to Mr. Salehâ€™s apartment on East Houston Street to dismember the body and clean up the crime scene.</p>
<p>Detectives believe that the killer, dressed in a black three-piece suit, white shirt and tie, wearing a black mask and carrying a duffle bag, followed Mr. Saleh off an elevator in his building and into his apartment, a law enforcement official said. He used a Taser to immobilize Mr. Saleh and then stabbed him to death.</p>
<p>Security video taken from inside the elevator shows the killer later using a battery-operated portable vacuum cleaner in an apparent effort to remove any traces of his presence, the official said.</p>
<p>New York Cityâ€™s medical examiner announced on Thursday that Mr. Saleh had died from multiple stab wounds to his neck and torso. Initially, a law enforcement official had described the killing as a â€œhitâ€� and said it looked â€œlike a professional job.â€�</p>
<p>Detectives investigating the murder believe the killerâ€™s work dismembering the body was interrupted when Mr. Salehâ€™s sister buzzed from the buildingâ€™s lobby, another official said, prompting him to flee through the apartmentâ€™s back door and into a stairwell before the sister arrived.</p>
<p>Mr. Salehâ€™s family said in a statement on Wednesday that the gruesome killing was so shocking it was unfathomable.</p>
<p>â€œFahim is more than what you are reading,â€� the family said. â€œHe is so much more. His brilliant and innovative mind took everyone who was a part of his world on a journey and he made sure never to leave anyone behind.â€�</p>
<p>Mr. Saleh was born in Saudi Arabia to Bangladeshi parents who eventually settled near Poughkeepsie, N.Y., a small city on the Hudson River.</p>
<p>After graduating from Bentley University in Waltham, Mass., in 2009, he built an app called PrankDial that allowed users to send prerecorded prank calls. Mr. Saleh said he eventually built PrankDial into a $10 million business.</p>
<p>Mr. Saleh went on to found Pathao, a motorcycle ride-sharing start-up in Bangladesh. He left that company in 2018 to begin a similar venture in Nigeria, an app known as Gokada.</p>
<p>At the time of his death, Mr. Saleh was the chief executive of Gokada and oversaw a shift in its business during a turbulent time. In February, Nigerian officials began enforcing a ban on motorcycle taxis in major commercial and residential parts of the countryâ€™s largest city, Lagos.</p>
<p>Gokada was forced to halt its ride-hailing business and laid workers off, but Mr. Saleh pivoted the company to focus on food and parcel delivery and business logistics.</p>
<p>â€œFahimâ€™s passion for Nigeria and its youth was immeasurable,â€� Gokada said in a statement. â€œHe believed young Nigerians were extremely bright and talented individuals who would flourish if just given the right opportunity.â€�</p>
<p>Mr. Saleh was also the founding partner in a Manhattan-based venture capital fund, Adventure Capital, that invested in similar transit start-ups in Colombia and Bangladesh.</p>

      <p>I had a very cool surprise today while checking my GitHub profile. Some projects I contributed to have been selected to included to be part of the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">Arctic Code Vault</a> project, and I am officially an <strong>Arctic Code Vault Contributor</strong>!</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="https://sam.elborai.me/images/a/n/n/o/t/annotation-2020-07-17-162632-7375779b.jpeg"><img alt="" src="https://sam.elborai.me/images/a/n/n/o/t/annotation-2020-07-17-162632-7375779b.jpeg"></a></p>
<p>That made me chuckle, and I now have a nice little badge under my contact info. </p>
<p>Though to be honest my contributions are really just simple corrections and fixes that I regularly do to projects I'm using or reading about. Not the majestic legacy some people would imagine when they hear of a project like this one! </p>
<p>But hey, people in 10k years will be able to blame me for a specific typo I made, isn't that great? 😁 (if they can figure out how to use git, which isn't something I would bet on).</p>

<p>This is a journey of obscure settings, red herrings, and poll vs. epoll. A story of how I had spent a couple days performance profiling and optimizing some Elixir code, only to discover that the true solution to the performance issues was an obscure setting in the Erlang VM that controlled which system call the IO polling subsystem used, and that my code-level optimizations were irrelevant. This particular setting has been made redundant by a rewrite of IO polling in a subsequent Erlang/OTP release, but still, it was a valuable lesson.</p>
<p>Back in 2018, we <a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/why-is-everyone-talking-about-mqtt/">released our MQTT protocol adapter</a>. Like our <a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/being-protocol-agnostic-at-ably">Pusher and Pubnub adapters</a>, it was implemented as an Elixir service, which sits in front of our normal service frontend and live-translates to and from Ably's own protocol.</p>
<p>In the run-up to the release, we decided to do some load testing to figure out the CPU cost per instance of holding onto substantial numbers of mostly-idle MQTT connections (driven by a customer with a large number of IoT devices).</p>
<p>Initial results were not great.</p>
<p>With 15K idle MQTT connections, on one of our usual instances (an AWS m5.large), CPU usage was reaching 60%, mostly from the adapter (with the remainder from the normal Ably frontend process). So we started trying to figure out why that was.</p>
<p>There's a wide variety of ways you can get performance data out of the BEAM (the Erlang VM). To start with there's the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/debugging.html#observer">observer</a>, which you can use to view all running processes (<a href="https://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/processes.html">Erlang processes</a>, not system processes), ordered by reductions (≈function calls, a proxy for CPU usage) or by memory usage. There are also various tracing facilities, which can trace all calls from particular processes, all calls to a given function from any process, and so on. (The built-in tools can be a little low-level, but there are various more user-friendly wrappers available).</p>
<p>I couldn't see anything obvious from just looking at the observer; no processes appeared to be using an excess of resources. What I really wanted was to trace the whole system, with all function calls, and then generate flame graphs out of that data, to get a sense of what was actually using up all that CPU. Doing that using traditional BEAM tracing of every function call would be very expensive; tracing adds too much overhead to do it for every function call ever. Luckily, Scott Fritchie has a great project called eflame2 <a href="https://github.com/slfritchie/eflame">https://github.com/slfritchie/eflame</a> (building off Vlad Ki's eflame <a href="https://github.com/proger/eflame">https://github.com/proger/eflame</a>), which makes some experimental changes to the BEAM to allow it to support time-sampled trace data: generating a stack trace every (say) 100ms, and using that to construct a flame graph.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/07/example-flamegraph.png"><figcaption>Example section of a flamegraph. The original is SVG, and you can click segments to zoom in on them. This is just a screenshot.</figcaption></figure><p>The results were a little puzzling. It showed the vast majority of time per the flamegraphs spent in SLEEP, even though observed CPU usage was still very high.</p>
<p>Experienced BEAMers may now be thinking "A-ha! I bet this is an sbwt issue!" The BEAM process scheduler by default, when it runs out of Erlang processes to schedule, spins for several milliseconds to stop the OS scheduler from scheduling a different OS process, to reduce latency if new work does need to be done. This is known as <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html">scheduler busy wait</a>. This can be reasonable behavior if the BEAM is the only important process running on the box that it's running on — which is often the case. But in our case it isn't, it has to play nicely with our frontend processes, and others as well. This behavior often catches out people who try to benchmark Erlang/Elixir against other languages, making the BEAM appear to consume a lot of CPU, even when average latency is low. (I'm pretty sure this mistake is what led to the conclusion that "Elixir nearly saturated all 36 cores while delivering a surprisingly consistent performance" in <a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/">this blog post by Stressgrid</a>, for example). It can easily be disabled by passing <code>+sbwt none</code> ('t' = threshold) to the Erlang runtime.</p>
<p>This was not the cause of my problem; I had already made that change.</p>
<p>So I shrugged, put aside for now the SLEEPs as a measurement artifact, and filtered them out of the trace output, generating some flamegraphs to see what the biggest consumers of CPU were out of all the non-idle samples.</p>
<p>One source was <code>:crypto.strong_random_bytes</code> when responding to websocket pings from our Ably frontends. The adapter connects to our frontends the same way our client libraries do: over websockets, one for each connection. </p>
<p>(Using websockets to connect two services running on the same box may seem an odd choice: the reasoning was that the translated connection would just appear and behave as a normal external websocket, the Ably frontend wouldn't have to do anything special or different for a connection via the MQTT adapter compared to a normal external websocket connection.) </p>
<p>The frontend sends a websocket ping to each client every 15 seconds, primarily as a way of detecting (and allowing the client to detect) whether the connection is genuinely still alive. When sending a message (even just a pong), a websocket feature called <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.3">masking</a> requires the client to generate a random "mask" — random bytes which are XOR'd with the payload. The point of this is to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-10.3">defeat cache poisoning attacks on proxies</a>. This is of course unnecessary for a websocket between two services running on the same instance. I disabled masking (using <a href="https://github.com/meh/elixir-socket">elixir-socket</a> this was as simple as passing <code>mask: nil</code> as an option to <code>Socket.Web.send</code>).</p>
<p>Another source of CPU usage was responding to MQTT pings from clients. The current code was responding to them in the same way it responded to all messages: decoding them into a <a href="https://github.com/suvash/hulaaki/">Hulaaki</a> Message , passing that to a main <code>MQTT.FromClient.handle()</code> function that pattern-matches on the message and sends a ping response:</p>
<pre><code>def handle(%Hulaaki.Message.PingReq{}, state) do
  Handler.send_to_client(Message.ping_response(), state)
  {:noreply, state}
end</code></pre>
<p>Not much, but do it a couple times a minute for tens of thousands of connections and it all adds up. Optimizing this was just a matter of adding a special-case to the ranch handler to recognise a ping and respond with a pong before the normal MQTT message-parsing logic is invoked. With Elixir's binary pattern matching this is very simple:</p>
<pre><code>@ping &lt;&lt;192,0&gt;&gt;
@pong &lt;&lt;208,0&gt;&gt;

def handle_info({:tcp, socket, @ping}, state) do
  @transport.send(socket, @pong)
  {:noreply, %{state | last_activity: now()}}
end

def handle_info({:tcp, socket, data}, state) do
  // handle all other packets</code></pre>
<p>(For most messages we have to handle messages spread over multiple TCP packets; for a two-byte message this is not an issue.)</p>
<p>I kept going, looking at the other (smaller but still prominent) CPU users from the flamegraphs. <code>URI.encode_query</code> was spending a fair amount of time in <code>URI.encode_www_form</code>; I replaced it with a custom query string encoder that didn't bother with that, since I knew I was already passing URI-safe strings. <code>Timex.Time.now()</code> / <code>elapsed()</code> (used to keep track of the last activity time on a connection) was showing quite a bit; I replaced it with <code>:erlang.system_time(:seconds)</code>. And so on.</p>
<p>And after all these in retrospect somewhat desperate micro-optimizations, &nbsp;I was... well, capturing flamegraphs that were now even more SLEEP dominated — having filed down everything else to the bare minimum —but system CPU was still much, much higher than it should have been.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Then, at some point I stumbled across <a href="http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2011-April/057472.html">a mailing list thread from 2011</a> about the <code>+K</code> flag (an argument to erlang runtime, like <code>+sbwt</code>). The <a href="http://www1.erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html">reference manual</a> states that it "Enables or disables the kernel poll functionality if the emulator supports it. Default is false (disabled)."</p>
<p>It turns out that with this disabled, the BEAM uses the <code>poll</code> system call to check for incoming IO events on Linux; with it enabled, it uses <code>epoll</code>. Julia Evans has a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/06/03/async-io-on-linux--select--poll--and-epoll/">great blog post on the difference between those</a>; the short version is that for listening to events on a large numbers of mostly-idle sockets, <code>epoll</code> is <em>dramatically</em> more efficient.</p>
<p>Enabling <code>+K true</code> was the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/magic-story.html">magic switch</a> I'd been looking for. With it on, BEAM CPU usage in the idle-MQTT load test dropped by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>So all the within-BEAM profiling and tracing, all my careful optimization of MQTT ping responses and so on were completely irrelevant, all a red herring. The BEAM was spending almost all of its CPU cycles on IO polling, only a tiny fraction actually executing bytecode, and I'd been spending all my time optimizing that small fraction.</p>
<p>One might question why that wasn't the default. There apparently exist usecases where <code>poll</code> may have an edge over <code>epoll</code> (extremely active sockets), but the general advice seems to be that the vast majority of people should use <code>epoll</code>. One person in that mailing list thread suggests that it's not the default because some OSes such as Windows don't have kernel poll support, but this doesn't make all that much sense — there's no reason to cripple platforms that do have epoll/kqueue/etc. for consistency with one that doesn't. (Especially since I doubt there are many people running the BEAM on Windows servers).</p>
<p>Happily, it seems that the Erlang/OTP team had been thinking along similar lines, and coincidentally, shortly after I discovered this, they announced that in OTP 21, the IO polling implementation <a href="http://blog.erlang.org/IO-Polling/">was being completely rewritten</a>. IO polling would be moved from scheduler threads to dedicated IO threads, and kernel-space polling (using epoll on Linux) would become the default (and in fact the <code>+K</code> switch would be removed entirely; epoll would be used always unless disabled at compile-time). Erlang/OTP 21 was duly released in June 2018, and this particular issue was solved at the source for everyone.</p>
<p>This was all two years ago. I left my micro-optimizations in: while marginal they did make some difference. I haven't had the chance to work on the adapter much recently; the problem with building services in …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The uneasy Web 2.0 truce between social networks, legacy media, and brands is falling apart. Once it was held together by ad tech. But advertising spends keep going up, brand content is at peak saturation, and audiences are slowly but surely evacuating the big social media companies. Can the three forces —&nbsp;social media, content, and commerce&nbsp;—&nbsp;find a new way relate to each other?</p>

<p>Here enters the question of community.</p>

<p>As high quality content and effective brand strategy move down the long tail, “community” has become an important concept for every post-Web 2.0 player. Crypto token holders, influencer fanbases, DTC brand customers, creator audiences, and new social networks are all often referred to as communities, and each has a stake in developing community for itself.</p>

<p>A new business type here is the paid community: a direct subscription to join in. Today, most paid communities live on the outskirts of existing social platforms. But as they become normalized, paid communities are becoming a viable business model for smaller-scale social networks aiming to be both profitable and socially sustainable.</p>

<p>This emerging new media <em>thing</em>, the paid community social network, has new rules and new risks, and just as it will require new skillsets to operate, requires a new way of understanding what both business and community mean.</p>

<h2 id="the-emergence-of-paid-communities">The Emergence of Paid Communities</h2>

<p>In the last 5 years we’ve seen several interesting innovations as Web 2.0 business models recombined into new mixtures of content, social media, and commerce. Let’s take a look at each of these.</p>

<p>Content and commerce have been merging to create new publishing endeavors that make no distinction between advertising and editorial. These businesses take multiple forms: they include expensive brand-led lifestyle marketing initiatives like the WeTransfer blog and Casper’s Woolly Magazine; “native advertising” efforts like Vox’s <a href="http://theexplainerstudio.com/">Explainer Studio</a>, NYT’s&nbsp;affiliate marketing play with the Wirecutter acquisition; and the extension of lifestyle magazines into product, such as 032c’s streetwear line.</p>

<p>Content and social are also unifying, with Twitch streaming and YouTube being the biggest video players. Meanwhile paid newsletters have taken off in a big way in the last two years. In content + community, an audience connects around a specific content producer through some platform.</p>

<p>Finally, commerce and social are coming together, although to much less a degree than marketing teams who talk up “brand communities” would like you to think. In all but a few cases, “community” here is just the marketing language used to describe a microbrand’s niche Instagram fandom. To me “community” implies users regularly engaging with <em>each other</em>, a criterion which indicates that the “regular crowd” at neighborhood joints or local skate shops are much truer communities than most online brands. Nevertheless, brands are now much better at directly engaging current and future customers through social media. This merger is clearly happening.</p>

<p>Each pairing of verticals has produced some of the most interesting companies and media projects of the last few years. But what’s happening now is that all three are coming together in a new way, fusing to form a completely different type of business: <strong>paid communities.</strong></p>

<p><img alt="paid communities emerge from the combinatation of content, social media, and commerce businessess" src="https://subpixel.space/uploads/paidcommunities.png"></p>

<p>Paid communities are a still-nascent category, but the business model is familiar: free content with a subscription paywall for more (the standard model of content + social). Paid communities develop this formula further: they take the subject matter of a content producer or brand lifestyle, and pair it with a paywalled digital social space for ongoing user interaction. Here the community is not a passive audience, but one that generates its own discussion, and for users comprises much of the value in and of itself. This community often comes to re-shape the brand or content development process.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of burgeoning paid communities you might have already heard of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stratechery: paid content + members-only forum, for investors and tech strategists.</li>
  <li>Venkatesh Rao’s Art of Gig / Yak Collective: paid content + a Discord channel, for indie consultants.</li>
  <li>New Models: content aggregator + commissioned content + paid Discord channel (conducted through Patreon), for artists and cultural producers.</li>
  <li>It’s also worth mentioning that Substack is currently layering on commenting + social features for paid newsletters, so many successful Substacks qualify.</li>
</ul>

<p>These new paid communities largely live on invite-only Telegrams, Slacks, Discords, and Facebook groups, raising the question: could there be applications more suitable to these networks? Indeed, the growing popularity of paid communities has been noticed by a bunch of new venture-funded companies such as such as <a href="http://genevachat.com/">Genevachat</a>, <a href="https://www.mightynetworks.com/">Mighty Networks</a>, and <a href="https://circle.so/">Circle</a>, all of which want to become “the platform for communities.”</p>

<p>Ironically, these “community platforms” are themselves largely clones of Slack and Discord. They have been designed to fit what <em>already</em> exists on the market —&nbsp;to generically scale to support every possible group&nbsp;—&nbsp;in order to drive the user numbers that can support venture-scale returns. With heavy competition and no differentiation, how could any one of these new platforms become successful? This paradox reveals the limits of venture capital logic. An alternative market analysis is needed to understand this emerging space.</p>

<p><img src="https://subpixel.space/uploads/communityplatforms.png" alt="generic looking community platforms"></p>

<p>Patreon is a good example of why generic community platforms are not the future. You could certainly say that Patreon is already at the center of content, social, and commerce. But of course, Patreon has for years been getting unbundled into A, B, and C type businesses. The reason for Patreon’s erosion is that its product design is totally unsuitable for all three use cases: it’s a bad brand platform, a bad content platform, and a bad social platform. Patreon is a classic case of what Venkatesh Rao calls “<a href="https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/too-big-to-nail">Too Big to Nail</a>,” and businesses that try to follow in its stead will face similar challenges.</p>

<p>Don’t buy into the VC hype on this one. There will not be one tool to serve new internet-first communities.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, dozens of alternative social networks have sprouted up in the last couple years. With the maturation of Javascript-based web development and plenty of front-end talent, it’s become easy to build complex web applications with tiny teams. <a href="https://futureland.tv/">futureland.tv</a>, <a href="https://dialup.com/">Dialup</a>, <a href="https://special.fish/">Special Fish,</a> and alternative dating app <a href="https://www.bighead.app/">Bighead</a> are among these new experiments. These alternative social networks are interesting in part because they prove that dissatisfaction with mainstream web has motivated significant movement to alternatives. But they are also interesting because of their unique user communities.</p>

<p>New social networks have typically struggled to monetize due to their small audience sizes, as they are unable to achieve the scale to make meaningful revenue from advertising. Paid communities, however, supply an engaged and paying audience, providing an alternative route to sustainability for independent social networks. At the same time, social networks solve some of the deficiencies of paid content and brand communities. This is worth understanding well.</p>

<p>Businesses want to be active participants in their customers’ social landscape, because <a href="https://medium.com/@namratalpatel/the-hyperfragmentation-of-retail-and-why-the-biggest-winners-are-digital-ad-platforms-not-5d55b26e96c">brand values are the last battleground for differentiation</a>. This is the very justification for community marketing, and the driving force behind the evolution of brand social media accounts from joke memes to increasingly woke and personal human voices. Offering a dedicated social space is a further extension of social participation. By providing a social space, brands can try to deepen their connection with users and have a place for content they produce to be discussed.</p>

<p>Similarly, the topic-specific functionality entertainers build into their streams can be seen as prototypes for rich social spaces. In journalistic media, content providers with growing audiences also need tools to manage their audience and moderate discussion. Slack’s 10,000 message limit for free accounts is a major obstruction to doing knowledge work in these spaces, and Discord’s free tier has lamentably small file upload size limits.</p>

<p>At this point, you may wonder: “why don’t users just want one place to manage all their communities?” Today’s existing tools will continue to be sufficient for some communities, and Discord and Slack’s robust bot APIs are capable of solving <em>some</em> community needs. But fundamentally, they are still based on chat, and chat simply isn’t the right core user experience for many other communities. Unique functionality and bespoke interfaces provide distinct advantages that off-the-shelf tooling can never achieve.</p>

<p>In order to understand how diverse and specialized these paid community / social networks can be, a few case studies, drawing from different scales, will be helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Replit</strong><br>Replit is a community of young programmers, supported by a forum, a real-time collaborative IDE, and a library of openly forkable code projects. The deep integration between Replit’s social space and its programmer tooling enable efficient knowledge workflows and sharing of user-generated content. At the same time, it facilitates the growth of a highly collaborative culture <em>specific to this set of tools</em>. Replit has gone the venture capital route, monetizes through a premium offering including paid cloud storage and unlimited private projects.</p>

<div><p><strong>Are.na</strong><br>Are.na, founded in 2012, can claim to be one of the most successful indie social networks. (Disclosure: I am a shareholder through its Republic crowdfund.) Originally bootstrapped by a small community of NYC-based artists, it has grown to over <a href="https://www.are.na/roadmap">12,000 monthly active users</a>, largely designers, artists, researchers, and educators. For these users the restrained interface, absence of an algorithmic feed, and community of intellectuals and cultural producers have made it a popular tool. As of May 2020, Are.na took in a respectable $20,000 monthly …</p></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post will explain how you can easily create <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/Lua/Dissectors">protocol dissectors</a>
in Wireshark, using the Lua programming language. This is can be useful when you’re working with
a custom protocol that Wireshark doesn’t already have a dissector for. If Wireshark looks like
this for example</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/before.png" alt="Wireshark without dissector"></p>

<p>it’s hard to tell what the various bytes in the data part represents.</p>

<p>Wireshark is written in C, and dissectors for Wireshark are generally also written in C. However,
Wireshark has a Lua implementation that makes it easy for people who are unfamiliar with C to write
dissectors. For those who are unfamiliar with Lua, it’s a very light-weight programming language
that is designed to be implemented as a scripting language in applications to extend their
functionality.</p>

<p>The downside of using Lua is that the dissector will be slower than a dissector written in C.</p>

<p>Before we start writing the dissector, let’s go through a crash course on Lua. It’s not important
to know the language in detail, but we must know the basics.</p>

<h3 id="lua-crash-course">Lua crash course</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Lua is multi-paradigm, and supports procedural style, functional programming to some degree, and
it also has some object-oriented programming features. It doesn’t have classes, prototypes or
inheritance out of the box, but they can be made by the programmer.</li>
  <li>It’s dynamically typed.</li>
  <li>Scope is either <code>local</code> or <code>global</code>. It’s global if you don’t declare it.</li>
  <li>Semicolons are not needed. Whitespace is not important like in Python.</li>
  <li>Lines that start with <code>--</code> are comments.</li>
  <li>Don’t use <code>++</code> or <code>+=</code>. Use <code>i = i + 1</code> instead.</li>
  <li>Not equal in conditionals is <code>~=</code> rather than <code>!=</code>.</li>
  <li>Its types are: string, number, boolean, nil, function, userdata, thread and table. Number
represents all numbers, both floating points and integers. Booleans are either true or false.
Strings are either single-quote or double-quote. You can forget about thread and userdata.</li>
  <li>nil is a non-value. A variable will have the value nil before it’s assigned a proper value.</li>
  <li>In conditionals: nil and false are falsy, the rest are thruthy.</li>
  <li>Lua has a type called <code>table</code>, which is also the only data structure it has. Tables implements
associative arrays. Associative arrays can be indexed by both numbers and other types, such as
strings. They have no fixed size and elements can be added dynamically. Tables are often called
objects. They are created like this:</li>
</ul>



<p>Values are assigned like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>new_table</span><span>[</span><span>20</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>
<span>new_table</span><span>[</span><span>"x"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"test"</span>
<span>a</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>                    <span>-- same as a["x"] = 10</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>They can have functions and are generally very similar to objects in JavaScript.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conditional branching looks like this:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span> <span>variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>200</span>
<span>elseif</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span> <span>then</span> <span>variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>300</span>
<span>else</span> <span>variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>400</span> <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Loops look like this:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is <em>i = first</em>, <em>last</em>, <em>delta</em>. <code>break</code> can be used, but continue cannot.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Functions are declared like this:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>arg1</span><span>,</span> <span>arg2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>arg1</span> <span>+</span> <span>arg2</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and are called like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>added_number</span> <span>=</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you see functions called like this:</p>



<p>then the functions <code>func1</code> and <code>func2</code> belongs to the table (object) <code>a</code>. Using colon is syntactic
sugar for passing the object itself as an argument to the function. That means <code>a:func1()</code> is
similar to <code>a.func1(a)</code>.</p>

<p>That’s the important stuff. You can read the <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/">Lua 5.3 Reference Manual</a>
if you care about the details.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>If you go to Help –&gt; About Wireshark –&gt; Folders, you’ll find all the folders Wireshark reads Lua
scripts from. Choose either the Personal Lua Plugins, Global Lua Plugins or Personal configuration
folder. E.g. <em>C:\Program Files\Wireshark\plugins\2.4.2</em> on Windows. The script will be active when
Wireshark is started. You have to restart Wireshark after you do changes to the script, or reload
all the Lua scripts with <strong>Ctrl+Shift+L</strong>.</p>

<p>I’m using the latest version at the current date. What I’m doing here might not work on earlier
versions.</p>

<h3 id="the-protocol">The protocol</h3>

<p>The most interesting protocol to investigate in this post would probably be a custom one that
Wireshark doesn’t know of already, but all the custom protocols I’ve worked with have been work
related and I can’t post information about them here. So instead we’ll look at the
<a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol/">MongoDB wire protocol</a>.</p>

<p><em>(There is already a <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/Mongo">Mongo dissector</a> in Wireshark, but I will not use that one.)</em></p>

<p>According to the specification linked to above, the MongoDB wire protocol is a TCP/IP protocol
using port number 27017. The byte ordering is little endian, meaning the least significant byte
comes first. Most protocols are big endian. The only difference is the ordering of the bytes. If
we had an int32 for example, with these bytes: <code>00 4F 23 11</code> in big endian, then the little endian
version would be <code>11 23 4F 00</code>. This is something must to take into account when writing the
dissector.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll only take a look at the header of the protocol. It looks like this</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/mongodb-wire-protocol-header.png" alt="MongoDB protocol header"></p>

<p>We can see that it has four int32s, each containing 4 bytes, because 4*8 = 32.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-the-boilerplate-code">Setting up the boilerplate code</h3>

<p>Let’s start by setting up some of the boilerplate code that’s needed in all dissectors:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mongodb_protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>Proto</span><span>(</span><span>"MongoDB"</span><span>,</span>  <span>"MongoDB Protocol"</span><span>)</span>

<span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>dissector</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>,</span> <span>pinfo</span><span>,</span> <span>tree</span><span>)</span>
  <span>length</span> <span>=</span> <span>buffer</span><span>:</span><span>len</span><span>()</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span> <span>return</span> <span>end</span>

  <span>pinfo</span><span>.</span><span>cols</span><span>.</span><span>protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>name</span>

  <span>local</span> <span>subtree</span> <span>=</span> <span>tree</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(),</span> <span>"MongoDB Protocol Data"</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>local</span> <span>tcp_port</span> <span>=</span> <span>DissectorTable</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"tcp.port"</span><span>)</span>
<span>tcp_port</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>59274</span><span>,</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We start my creating a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Proto.html#lua_class_Proto">Proto</a> (protocol) object and call it <code>mongodb_protocol</code>. The
table constructor takes two arguments: <code>name</code> and <code>description</code>. The protocol requires a <code>fields</code>
table and a dissector function. We haven’t added any fields yet, so the <code>fields</code> table is empty. The
dissector function is called once for every packet of our type.</p>

<p>The dissector function has three parameters: <code>buffer</code>, <code>pinfo</code> and <code>tree</code>. <code>buffer</code> contains the
packet’s buffer and is a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Tvb.html#lua_class_Tvb">Tvb object</a>. It contains the data we want to dissect. <code>pinfo</code>
contains the columns of the packet list and is a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Pinfo.html#lua_class_Pinfo">Pinfo object</a>. Finally, <code>tree</code> is
the tree root and is a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Tree.html#lua_class_TreeItem">TreeItem object</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/columns.png" alt="Columns in packet list "></p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/tree.png" alt="Tree in packet details pane"></p>

<p>Inside the dissector function, we start by checking the length of the buffer and then returning if
it’s empty.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, the <code>pinfo</code> object contains the columns in the packet list. We can use it to
set the protocol name when we receive a packet of MongoDB type. On the script’s first line we set
the name of the protocol to be “MongoDB” (by passing the name to the constructor). We set the
protocol column name here</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pinfo</span><span>.</span><span>cols</span><span>.</span><span>protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>name</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the protocol column name changes from TCP to MONGODB:</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/protocol-column.png" alt="Packet list protocol column"></p>

<p>We must then create a sub tree in the tree structure found in the Packet Details pane. It done by
adding an additional tree item to the tree object that was passed as an argument to the dissector
function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>subtree</span> <span>=</span> <span>tree</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(),</span> <span>"MongoDB Protocol Data"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The string is the name of the sub tree. Without having added any fields it will look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/packet-pane-1.png" alt="Packet pane with MongoDB but without fields"></p>

<p>Finally, we must assign the protocol to a port. In my case, I’ll use port 59274, because that’s the
port I use to connect to the Mongo database.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>tcp_port</span> <span>=</span> <span>DissectorTable</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"tcp.port"</span><span>)</span>
<span>tcp_port</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>59274</span><span>,</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>"udp.port"</code> can also be used, if the protocol uses UDP rather than TCP.</p>

<h3 id="adding-fields">Adding fields</h3>

<p>The script already runs at this stage, but it isn’t doing anything useful. For the script to do
something useful we have to add the fields that we want to parse. Fields are made by creating
<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Proto.html#lua_class_ProtoField">ProtoField</a> objects. We can start off simple by adding only the first field.
The first field in the MongoDB wire protocol specification is the message length, which is an int32.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mongodb_protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>Proto</span><span>(</span><span>"MongoDB"</span><span>,</span>  <span>"MongoDB Protocol"</span><span>)</span>

<span>message_length</span> <span>=</span> <span>ProtoField</span><span>.</span><span>int32</span><span>(</span><span>"mongodb.message_length"</span><span>,</span> <span>"messageLength"</span><span>,</span> <span>base</span><span>.</span><span>DEC</span><span>)</span>

<span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>message_length</span> <span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>dissector</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>,</span> <span>pinfo</span><span>,</span> <span>tree</span><span>)</span>
  <span>length</span> <span>=</span> <span>buffer</span><span>:</span><span>len</span><span>()</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span> <span>return</span> <span>end</span>

  <span>pinfo</span><span>.</span><span>cols</span><span>.</span><span>protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>name</span>

  <span>local</span> <span>subtree</span> <span>=</span> <span>tree</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(),</span> <span>"MongoDB Protocol Data"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>subtree</span><span>:</span><span>add_le</span><span>(</span><span>message_length</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>))</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>local</span> <span>tcp_port</span> <span>=</span> <span>DissectorTable</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"tcp.port"</span><span>)</span>
<span>tcp_port</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>59274</span><span>,</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We add the following above the dissector function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>message_length</span> <span>=</span> <span>ProtoField</span><span>.</span><span>int32</span><span>(</span><span>"mongodb.message_length"</span><span>,</span> <span>"messageLength"</span><span>,</span> <span>base</span><span>.</span><span>DEC</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first argument is used as a label in the filter settings, second is used as a label in the sub
tree and the last is used to decide how the variable’s value should be displayed. In this case I
want to show the value in decimal, but I could also use <code>base.HEX</code> to show it in hexadecimal format.
Hexadecimal format doesn’t work for int32 though.</p>

<p><code>ProtoField</code> has several types of functions we can use: <code>uint8()</code>, <code>uint16()</code>, <code>string()</code> and so on.
We have to use the one that matches the specification. A list of all the functions can be found
<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Proto.html#lua_fn_ProtoField_char_abbr___name____base____valuestring____mask____desc__">here</a>.</p>

<p>We then add the field to the <code>fields</code> table of the protocol:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>message_length</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and finally add the field to the sub tree:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>subtree</span><span>:</span><span>add_le</span><span>(</span><span>message_length</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I use <code>add_le</code> rather than <code>add</code>, because we are working with a little-endian protocol. If the
protocol was big endian we would have to use <code>add</code>. The function takes two arguments: the field we
made further up, and a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Tvb.html#lua_class_TvbRange">buffer range</a>. We can get a range of the buffer by using
the range function that is a part of the buffer object. <code>buffer(offset,length)</code> is the short form
for the range function. <code>buffer(0,4)</code> means we want to start at the first byte, and then take 4
bytes. The reason we want to start at 0 is because we’re dealing with the first field in the header.
We take 4 bytes because that is the size of an int32.</p>

<p>After reloading the Lua script with <strong>Ctrl+Shift+L</strong> Wireshark should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/messageLength-added.png" alt="Message length added to sub tree"></p>

<p>We can see that it parses the messageLength correctly. We can also see that we don’t …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody"> <center> <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/pOZhmE42D1WrCWATLK/giphy.gif"> </center><p>If you ever told me you are learning to code (or anything, really), chances are I told you you should have your blog and write in it. Although I discussed this topic in person with a lot of people, there are only small texts about it on blog posts I wrote about other topics (<a href="https://leportella.com/my-experience-with-blogs.html">[1]</a>, <a href="https://leportella.com/boosting-your-career.html">[2]</a>). This blog post is dedicated to <em>why you should have your own (independent) blog</em>. Because people have different ways of seeing the world I divided it into two sections of <em>why:</em></p><ul><li><a href="#philosophical-reasons">Philosophical reasons to have a blog</a></li><li><a href="#selfish-reasons">Selfish reasons to have a blog</a></li></ul><p>I also wrote a section on <a href="#excuses">common excuses</a> that people give me to not write a blog post and my answers to them!</p><p>And finally, if you are convinced, there is a section dedicated to <a href="#what"><em>what</em> to write about</a>.</p><h2 id="philosophical-reasons">Philosophical reasons to have a blog</h2><h3 id="you-should-have-your-own-place-in-the-internet">You should have your own place in the internet</h3><p>If you notice, the internet of today is basically made of a couple of big websites that try to gather every content there is. Have you ever talked to an older person that thinks Facebook IS the internet? Yes, that’s exactly what I am talking about.</p><p>Having your <em>independent</em> blog is an excellent way to share what you think in a decentralized way, independent of any major company that may add a paywall to it (Medium, I am looking at you). On his post “<a href="https://ramalho.org/wiki/doku.php?id=porque_cada_pessoa_deve_ter_seu_site_na_web">why every person should have their own website on the internet</a>”, <a href="https://ramalho.org/">Luciano Ramalho</a> writes something that summarizes what I think:</p><blockquote><p><em>“If everybody starts to create their own website, we will start the long and essential process of taking back the control of the Web: the Web is ours to use it as we like, and not to be controlled by half dozen of mega industries with their opaques algorithms.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Writing is a way of sharing knowledge and a way to increase opportunities for learning to other people. Not everyone had access to a good university or the best books available. Sharing things you have learned can help others grow, can help change their lives and relate to your story or learn with you. Of course, not everyone has access to the internet, but it a good way of starting something for a greater good.</p><p>If you come from a country whose first language is not English, you can create opportunities for people that didn’t have the opportunity to learn that language! The best content is usually written in English, but for third world countries, learning English is quite a privilege, so imagine the impact of writing good content on your language!</p><h3 id="each-person-should-drive-their-presence-on-the-internet">Each person should drive their presence on the internet</h3><p>More and more it becomes really hard to stay away from the internet and social media. It is important to create a digital presence that associates your name to good things and to what <em>you</em> want your name to be associated with. Creating a blog and sharing what you know is an excellent way to position yourself online, and making sure people know you for something better than just social media.</p><h2 id="selfish-reasons">Selfish reasons to have a blog</h2><h3 id="writing-as-a-tool-for-learning">Writing as a tool for learning</h3><p>Writing is an excellent tool for learning. When you decide to write a blog post about what you are learning, not only you need to understand it well enough to make it clear, but also you need to create a structure for the post, which helps you structure your studies in the meantime.</p><p>Let’s take <a href="https://leportella.com/julia-language.html">my blog post about the Julia Language</a> as example. I needed to study the language for an episode of my podcast. After a couple of lines of code, I thought it was good enough, but then I decided to write the post. After that, I realized so much I haven’t studied yet! Who created the language and why? What is considered the best feature of the language? How can I integrate with Jupyter notebooks? And so on. I spent a few more hours understanding the language in order to create the post and this experience was so much better than just following some tutorial and write some lines of code.</p><p><strong>Practice leads to perfection</strong> Like anything in life, you can only get better if you practice. Your first blog post will probably not be great, nor your second, maybe not even your third. But you should write them anyway. The more you write, the more you can improve your writing. You will need to read other blog posts and articles and incorporate different ways of writing to your own. You can only be a good writer, if you practice. So… practice on your own blog!</p><h3 id="feedback-is-a-gift">Feedback is a gift!</h3><p>If you are insecure about writing a blog post, you can share it with your friend and ask for feedback! It is an excellent way of improving your writing while you are developing your skills. So use this opportunity to learn how to take constructive criticism. It is important to understand that feedback is a gift, and that a person took time from their lives and gave you feedback to help you improve. So use your blog posts to get feedback from your friends (and even people that comment on your posts) and learn how to grow through it. You can only gain from it!</p><h3 id="build-your-career">Build your career</h3><p>In today’s world, being visible is an excellent way to stand out and get better jobs in better companies. In tech there are several ways of doing this, you can organize meetups, give talks in conferences, have a Youtube channel, a podcast, etc. However, not everyone wants or is comfortable with this kind of exposure. In my opinion, a blog is the best way of share your work with minimal personal exposure. You don’t even need to add a personal photo to have one! You can improve your career even if you are too shy to give a talk 😉</p><h2 id="excuses">Common excuses not to write</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Excuse</strong></th><th><strong>My answer</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>“I am not an expert”</td><td>That’s ok! You don’t have to be an expert to explain something you know! On every blog post that I am not completely sure of what I am writing I make it explicit that this is based on my knowledge. Just make sure to be open to criticism and feedback.</td></tr><tr><td>“Everybody know this”</td><td>Even if something was written a thousand times, it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t write about it. I usually search for different articles on a single topic to help me understand something! Not always what was written before works for everyone. Maybe what you wrote will be good for a specific person. And that’s all you need</td></tr><tr><td>“What if I make mistakes?”</td><td>No problem at all. Life is full of mistakes. Make sure you add a comment on the beginning of an old post or even change the text. You don’t have to be right all the time and you didn’t write in stone. If you make a mistake, go back and fix it. You will only grow from the experience</td></tr><tr><td>“I have nothing to write about”</td><td>I made a whole section about it 😉</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="what">What to write?</h2><p>If you are here I am assuming I was able to convince you to start blogging! Congratulations! That’s a huge step! Here are the topics you can write about (based on my personal experience):</p><ul><li><strong>You can share a part of your life that was important to you and that can be used as inspiration by others!</strong><ul><li>Example: <a href="https://leportella.com/from-oceanographer-to-programmer.html">I wrote about how I changed careers from oceanographer to developer</a> and how hard that decision was.</li></ul></li><li><strong>When you see something online (like a Twitter thread) that talks about something that deserves to be more than a transient topic in someone’s timeline</strong><ul><li>Example: One guy asked on Twitter for arguments he could use to convince his company to engage in a tech community. The answers were so amazing that I thought it would give <a href="https://leportella.com/why-you-should-be-in-communities.html">an excellent blog post</a>!</li></ul></li><li><strong>When you want to study something and want to structure your thoughts</strong><ul><li>Example: <a href="https://leportella.com/julia-language.html">I wrote a blog post about Julia language</a> so I would know the minimum of the language to interview a guest on my podcast. Without the blog post, I was through with my studies after a couple of lines of code, but when I decided to write a blog post about it I realized how much I was missing and started all over!</li></ul></li><li><strong>When you had some interesting experience</strong><ul><li>Example: <a href="https://leportella.com/new-eng-stripe.html">my first 6 months at Stripe</a> were a surreal experience that I loved! It was something so different from what I have lived as an onboarding experience so far that I thought it was an amazing thing to share with my friends.</li></ul></li><li><strong>When it took you more than an hour to find an answer for a problem</strong><ul><li>Example: I needed to add a relationship model to an SQLAlchemy table that already existed. This problem took me 3 days and I asked for help from multiple people. The final answer was <em>extremely</em> simple, but <a href="https://leportella.com/relationship-sqlalchemy.html">I decided to write it anyway</a>. A couple of months ago someone commented that I saved their day because of my blog post.</li></ul></li><li><strong>When it took you more than 5 minutes to answer a question someone made you</strong><ul><li>Example: One time a guy came to my Telegram and asked me: “should I have my blog in Medium or somewhere else?” My answer to him was long and detailed and took me several minutes, so <a href="https://leportella.com/my-experience-with-blogs.html">I decided to write about it on a blog post</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><p>Hope you enjoyed the post and let me know if you started a blog after reading it!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>How do you make a highly scalable, highly performant blogging service for as little server cost as possible?</p>
<p>On-demand static site generation.</p>
<hr>
<p>Recently on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=tl.gd&amp;src=typed_query">I've seen a lot of people use TwitLonger</a>. TwitLonger is a site separate from Twitter that lets users log in with their Twitter account and create longer, more traditional blog-style type of posts.</p>
<p>TwitLonger is a free-to-use service, however, it's littered with ads to pay for the server maintenance costs. TwitLonger is a self-funded project run by <a href="https://twitter.com/stuartgibson">one person</a>, so I mostly believe their claim that the ads are required to keep the site alive.</p>
<p>Oh also: TwitLonger is also <a href="https://twitter.com/twitlonger/status/18896126622?s=20">well over 10 years old</a> (crazy)!</p>
<p>Given that, the question that comes in mind is: <strong>Can we make a TwitLonger alternative that is ad-free in the year 2020?</strong></p>
<p>Short answer: yes! — via on-demand static site generation (SSG).</p>
<h2>The JAMstack</h2>
<p>In case you've haven't been paying attention to recent trends in web development, many engineering teams have been adopting the "JAM stack" — short for javascript, APIs, and markup.</p>
<p>The name and the components of that "stack" aren't really important. In fact, I would say it's less of an actual stack and more of general architecture philosophy that exploits one thing:</p>
<p>How cheap and fast it is to serve static assets over a CDN.</p>
<p>With the JAMstack, you pre-render all your site's pages to static HTML during build time so that the resulting assets of your site are primarily static HTML pages. When content changes, the site is simply re-built.</p>
<p>The end result is extremely performant and scalable websites that cost near nothing to host.</p>
<h2>Taking the JAMstack further: On-demand SSG</h2>
<p>For a user-generated blog site like TwitLonger, the JAMstack in this traditional sense won't work. There will be a point when re-building the whole site (even with an incremental approach) isn't feasible and another technique is needed.</p>
<p>So what do we do now?</p>
<p>Instead of re-rendering the whole site, we pre-render a single static HTML page on each new post. The resulting HTML page can then be saved in some storage bucket and served over CDN.</p>
<p>That's what on-demand SSG is — at the point in time when a user creates content, pre-render it.</p>
<p>If hooked up correctly, this approach does not require <em>any</em> backend code in order for the page to be viewed and scales extremely well.</p>
<h2>The implementation —&nbsp;<a href="http://longtweet.io/">longtweet.io</a></h2>
<p>You're looking at it.</p>
<p>You can login and <a href="https://longtweet.io/">create a new post now</a>.</p>
<p>When you create a new post, it calls an AWS lambda function. In that function is where this service takes your content, pre-renders it to a static HTML file, and saves it to an S3 bucket.</p>
<p>From there, S3 and CloudFront handle the rest. The site is set up to be hosted from this S3 bucket so after the file gets dropped in, it's live.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>It's excellent.</p>
<p>Viewing a post is highly optimized and virtually free. When any user from around the world views a page, it's readily available at network edges via CloudFront.</p>
<p>I maxed out what I could for free on <a href="https://k6.io/cloud">k6 cloud</a> and longtweet was able to handle sub 10 millisecond response times at 50 requests per second for 5 minutes — all while still on the free tier in AWS.</p>
<p><img src="https://longtweet.io/load-test-result.png" alt="Load test result"></p>
<h2>Taking performance further with minimalism</h2>
<p>For both performance and cost reasons, longtweet serves a very small bundle.</p>
<p>Longtweet posts are almost entirely static content with just a tiny bit of javascript used to show author controls.</p>
<p>The CSS and JS are inlined into the post's HTML making this beautiful network tab:</p>
<p><img src="https://longtweet.io/longtweet-network-tab.png" alt="longtweet network tab"></p>
<p>In 6.4kB in one request, the whole site is loaded (and we could push this minimalism further if we wanted to).</p>
<p>The minimalism makes a big difference for performance.</p>
<p><img src="https://longtweet.io/lighthouse-vs.jpg" alt="lighthouse scores. longtweet vs twitlonger"></p>
<p>Pictured left are the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">lighthouse</a> scores for longtweet and on the right are the lighthouse scores for TwitLonger (with ads).</p>
<p>The rest of the pages on longtweet are client-side rendered with <a href="https://preactjs.com/">preact</a>. The resulting bundle there is around 30kB.</p>
<h2>Drawbacks</h2>
<p>So at this point, you might be asking the big question: how do you change the pages after they've already been pre-rendered?</p>
<p>Well the simple answer is just render them all again.</p>
<p>Doing migrations of a site like this would require all of the users posts to be re-rendered. In order to make that possible, save the raw content to some DB explicitly for a migration.</p>
<hr>
<p>Longtweet is also open-source. <a href="https://github.com/ricokahler/longtweet.io">Check out the source code here.</a></p>
<p>Feel free to suggest ideas and contribute in any way. Transparency and simplicity are at the heart of this app. There are no plans on monetizing this.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <div>
          

          <div role="main">
            
  <div id="managing-remote-unix-and-windows-machines-via-ssh">

<p><span>New in version 2020.7.0.</span></p>
<p>Using <em>salt-sproxy</em>, besides regular Minions, regular Proxy Minions, and
standalone Proxy Minions (managed by <em>salt-sproxy</em> itself), you can also manage
arbitrary machines via SSH, in the same way as you’d normally do through
<a href="https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/ssh/">salt-ssh</a>. In fact, this
is actually done through the <a href="https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/proxy/ssh.html#ssh-proxy"><span>SSH Proxy Module</span></a> shipped together with this
package, which in turn invokes <em>salt-ssh</em> internals. While <em>salt-ssh</em> has
been part of the Salt suite for years, it has always been decoupled from the
rest. One of the evident implications is that you manage some devices by
running <code><span>salt</span></code>, and others by running <code><span>salt-ssh</span></code>. <em>salt-sproxy</em> aims to
abstract that away, and provide a single, uniform methodology for managing
whatever flavours of Salt you want, through the same command and offering the
same features.</p>
<p>In essence, using the <a href="https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/proxy/ssh.html#ssh-proxy"><span>SSH Proxy Module</span></a>, <em>salt-sproxy</em> spins up a temporary
Proxy Minion locally, which means you can use it to manage arbitrary machines
over SSH, and you can continue using the usual <a href="https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/targeting.html#targeting"><span>Targeting</span></a> mechanisms, or
execute Salt commands over the REST API (see also <a href="https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salt_sapi.html#salt-sapi"><span>salt-sapi</span></a>).</p>
<div>
<p>Important</p>
<p>As this feature depends on two external modules, provides with
<em>salt-sproxy</em>, you will need to make sure your installation is aware of
those. You ave multiple options here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Execute passing the <code><span>--sync-proxy</span></code> and <code><span>--sync-executors</span></code> on the
command line.</li>
<li>Set <code><span>sync_proxy:</span> <span>true</span></code> and <code><span>sync_executors:</span> <span>true</span></code> in the Master
config file.</li>
<li>Configure the <code><span>file_roots</span></code> on the Master, as detailed in <a href="https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/runner.html#runner"><span>The Proxy Runner</span></a>,
then execute <code><span>salt-run</span> <span>saltutil.sync_all</span></code> (or
<code><span>saltutil.sync_proxymodules</span></code> + <code><span>saltutil.sync_executors</span></code>, if you only
want the SSH code, ignorning anything else). See also
<a href="https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best_practices.html#best-practices"><span>Salt SProxy Best Practices</span></a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="pillar">
<h2>Pillar<a href="#pillar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The configuration is aligned to the general Proxy Minion standards: put the
connection details and credentials under the <code><span>proxy</span></code> key in the Proxy config
or Pillar.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code><span>host</span></code></dt>
<dd>The IP address or the hostname of the remove machine to manage.</dd>
<dt><code><span>port</span></code></dt>
<dd>Integer, the port number to use when establishing he connection
(defaults to 22).</dd>
<dt><code><span>user</span></code></dt>
<dd>The username required for authentication.</dd>
<dt><code><span>passwd</span></code></dt>
<dd>The password used for authentication.</dd>
<dt><code><span>priv</span></code></dt>
<dd>Absolute path to the private SSH key used for authentication.</dd>
<dt><code><span>priv_passwd</span></code></dt>
<dd>The SSH private key password.</dd>
<dt><code><span>timeout</span></code>: 30</dt>
<dd>The SSH timeout. Defaults to 30 seconds.</dd>
<dt><code><span>sudo</span></code>: <code><span>False</span></code></dt>
<dd>Execute commands as sudo.</dd>
<dt><code><span>tty</span></code>: <code><span>False</span></code></dt>
<dd>Connect over tty.</dd>
<dt><code><span>sudo_user</span></code></dt>
<dd>The username that should execute the commands as sudo.</dd>
<dt><code><span>remote_port_forwards</span></code></dt>
<dd>Enable remote port forwarding. Example: <code><span>8888:my.company.server:443</span></code>.
Multiple remote port forwardings are supported, using comma-separated
values, e.g., <code><span>8888:my.company.server:443,9999:my.company.server:80</span></code>.</dd>
<dt><code><span>identities_only</span></code>: <code><span>False</span></code></dt>
<dd>Execute SSH with <code><span>-o</span> <span>IdentitiesOnly=yes</span></code>. This option is intended for
situations where ssh-agent offers many different identities and allow ssh
to ignore those identities and use the only one specified in options.</dd>
<dt><code><span>winrm</span></code>: <code><span>False</span></code></dt>
<dd>Flag that tells Salt to connect to a Windows machine. This option requires
the <code><span>saltwinshell</span></code> to be installed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For example, let’s say you put the following in the Pillar:</p>
<p><code><span>/srv/salt/pillar/ssh.sls</span></code></p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>proxy</span><span>:</span>
  <span>proxytype</span><span>:</span> <span>ssh</span>
  <span>host</span><span>:</span> <span>srv.example.com</span>
  <span>user</span><span>:</span> <span>test</span>
  <span>passwd</span><span>:</span> <span>test</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><code><span>/srv/salt/pillar/top.sls</span></code></p>

<p>Assuming that your configuration is correct, you can then start executing Salt
commands as usual, to manage the remote machine:</p>

</p>

<p>Character LCDs have been around for a long time. These displays contain a number of discinct blocks—each capable of displaying a single character—so displaying
scrolling text would traditionally involve just shifting characters left one block at a time.
That’s fine and all, but why not take advantage of free time during quarantine to raise the bar.. 😉</p>
<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<p>Most character displays utilise the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi_HD44780_LCD_controller">Hitachi HD44780 controller chip</a>,
which has the neat feature of letting us define and use up to eight custom characters, each 5x8 pixels in size.
Mine uses this chip, so I’ll be taking advantage of repeatedly rendering custom characters to pull off smooth scrolling text.</p>
<p>I connected an Arduino Leonardo to my <a href="https://joeraut.com/posts/interfacing-salvaged-lcd-display/">salvaged display</a> over its 4-bit interface, and got to work on the software side.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://joeraut.com/images/posts/smooth-scrolling-text-on-character-lcds/arduino-connection.jpg"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Arduino connected to character LCD</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>As we use an Arduino, the software written is in C++. Source code available at the end of the article.</p>
<p>We allocate memory for a canvas that will contain the raw pixel data for the message we want to display. We make use of a
<a href="https://github.com/Ameba8195/Arduino/blob/master/hardware_v2/cores/arduino/font5x7.h">5x7-pixel ASCII font</a>, and for each ASCII character
in the message string, we place the corresponding character at the appropriate location on the canvas using the <code>memcpy</code> function.</p>
<p>In order to display our canvas on the LCD, we define a function to generate display-ready custom characters by grabbing pixel data from appropriate locations on
the canvas. For each frame of the scrolling process, we can simply increment the horizontal index of the location on the canvas by one, which results
in the message on-screen scrolling left by one pixel. These custom characters are then pushed to the display, and presto—smooth-scrolling text!</p>
<p>There was a slight complication I glossed over—the memory structure of custom characters differs to that of the font and canvas. The font and canvas use five
bytes to represent each character, with each byte representing one 7-pixel column (the most significant bit is ignored). The custom character format,
however, uses 8 bytes—each representing one row of the character. To solve this issue, we define a function <code>transpose</code> which takes care of mapping
the canvas format to the custom character format.</p>
<h3 id="source-code">Source code</h3>
<p>The Arduino sketch is available here: <a href="https://joeraut.com/files/posts/smooth-scrolling-text-on-character-lcds/SmoothScrollingText.ino">SmoothScrollingText.ino</a>.</p>
<p>It should run on most Arduino devices, but I have only tested it on an Arduino Leonardo. Be sure to modify the LCD pin setup for your hardware.</p>

    <p><span>30 Jun 2020</span></p><p>Research has begun to reveal many algorithms can be expressed as matrix multiplication, suggesting an unrealized connection between linear algebra and computer science. I speculate graphs are the missing piece of the puzzle. Graphs are not only useful as cognitive aides, but are suitable data structures for a wide variety of tasks, particularly on modern parallel processing hardware.</p>

<p>In this essay, I explore the virtues of graphs, algebra, types, and show how these concepts can help us reason about programs. I propose a computational primitive based on graph signal processing, linking software engineering, graphs, and linear algebra. Finally, I share my predictions for the path ahead, which I consider to be the start of an exciting new chapter in computing history.</p>

<p>Over the last decade, I bet on some strange ideas. A lot of people I looked up to at the time laughed at me. I’ll bet they aren’t laughing anymore. I ought to thank them one day, because their laughter gave me a lot of motivation. I’ve said some idiotic things to be sure, but I’ve also made some laughable predictions that were correct. Lesson learned: aim straighter.</p>

<p>In 2012, I was in Austin sitting next to an ex-poker player named <a href="https://twitter.com/amirpc">Amir</a> who was singing Hinton’s praises. Hypnotized by his technicolor slides, I quit my job in a hurry and started an educational project using speech recognition and restricted Boltzmann machines. It never panned out, but I learned a lot about ASR and Android audio. Still love <a href="http://breandan.net/2014/02/09/the-end-of-illiteracy/">that idea</a>.</p>

<p>In 2017, I started writing a book on the ethics of automation and <a href="http://breandan.net/2017/02/02/trust-in-automation/">predicted</a> mass unemployment and social unrest. Although I got the causes wrong (pandemic, go figure), the information economy and confirmation bias takes were all dead right. Sadly, this is now driving the world completely insane. Don’t say I warned you, go out and fix our broken systems. The world needs more engineers who care.</p>

<p>In 2017, I witnessed the birth of <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>, which I stole from Chris Olah and turned into a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">master’s thesis</a>. Had a lot of trouble convincing people that classical programs could be made differentiable, but look at the proceedings of any machine learning conference today and you’ll find dozens of papers on differentiable sorting and rendering and simulation. Don’t thank me, thank Chris and the Theano guys.</p>

<p>In 2018, I correctly predicted Microsoft would acquire GitHub to mine code. Why MS and not Google? I’ll bet they tried, but Google’s leadership had fantasies of AGI and besides JetBrains, MS were the only ones who gave a damn about developers. Now ML4SE is a thriving <a href="https://ml4se.github.io/">research area</a> and showing up in <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/DeepBugsPlugin">real</a> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ai-assisted-intellisense-for-your-teams-codebase/">products</a>, much to the chagrin of those who believed ML was a fad. I suspect their hype filter blinded them to the value those tools provide.</p>

<center>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prediction: MS will acquire GH within five years. If the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ML4Code?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ML4Code</a> stuff delivers for MS, acquisition is highly likely. Although it would have been cheaper a few years ago. <a href="https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD">https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD</a> <a href="https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps">https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps</a></p>— breandan (@breandan) <a href="https://twitter.com/breandan/status/993553301927936001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2018</a></blockquote>

</center>

<p>But to heck with everything I’ve said! If I had just one idea to share with these ML people, it would be types. Beat that drum as loud as I could. Types are the best tool we know for synthetic reasoning. If you want to build provably correct systems that scale on real-world applications, use types. Not everyone is convinced yet, but mark my words, <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/12345">types</a> are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/whatsnew/3.9.html#pep-585-builtin-generic-types">coming</a>. Whoever figures out how to connect types and learning will be the next Barbara Liskov or Frances Allen.</p>

<p>This year, I predicted the pandemic weeks before the lockdown, exited the market, and turned down a job at Google. Some people called me crazy. Now I’m going all-in on some new ideas (none of which are mine). I’m making some big bets and some will be wrong, but I see the very same spark of genius in them.</p>



<p>As a kid, I was given a book on the history of mathematics. I remember it had some interesting puzzles, including one with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">some bridges</a> in a town divided by rivers, once inhabited by a man called Euler. Was there a tour crossing each bridge exactly once? Was it possible to tell without checking every path? I remember spending days trying to figure out the answer.</p>

<p>In the late 90s, my mom and I went to Ireland. I remember visiting Trinity College, and learning about a mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton">Hamilton</a> who discovered a famous formula connecting algebra and geometry, and carved it onto a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broom_Bridge">bridge</a>. We later visited the bridge, and the tour guide pointed out the stone, which we touched for good luck. The Irish have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poulnabrone_dolmen">thing</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange">stones</a>.</p>

<p>In 2007, I was applying to college and took the train from Boston to South Bend, Indiana, home of the Fighting Irish. Wandering about, I picked up a magazine article by a Hungarian mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Barab%C3%A1si">Barabási</a> then at Notre Dame, who had some interesting things to say about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network">complex networks</a>. Later in 2009, while studying in Rochester, I <a href="http://brea.ndan.co/images/complex_network_seminar.png">carpooled</a> with a <a href="https://avesis.medeniyet.edu.tr/hasan.guclu">nice professor</a>, and learned complex networks are found in brains, languages and many marvelous places.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2017. I was lured by the siren song of algorithmic differentiation. Olivier Breleux presented <a href="https://github.com/mila-iqia/myia">Myia</a> and <a href="https://github.com/breuleux/buche">Buche</a>. Matt Johnson gave a talk on <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd">Autograd</a>. I met Chris Olah in Long Beach, who gave me the idea to study <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>. I stole his idea, dressed it up in Kotlin and traded it for a POPL workshop paper and later a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">Master’s thesis</a>. Our contributions were using algebra, shape inference and presenting AD as term rewriting.</p>

<p>In 2019, I joined a lab with a <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/">nice professor</a> at McGill applying knowledge graphs to software engineering. Like logical reasoning, knowledge graphs are an idea from the first wave of AI in the 1960s and 70s which have been revived and studied in light of recent progress in the field. I believe this is an important area of research with a lot of potential. Knowledge and traceability plays a big role in software engineering, and it’s the bread-and-butter of a good IDE. The world needs better IDEs if we’re ever going to untangle this mess we’re in.</p>

<p>This Spring, I took a fascinating seminar on <a href="https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp766/index.html">Graph Representation Learning</a>. A lot of delightful graph theory has been worked out over the last decade. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> turned into power iteration. People have discovered many interesting connections to linear algebra, including Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernels, graph Laplacians, Krylov methods, and spectral graph theory. These ideas have deepened our understanding of graph signal processing and its applications for learning and program analysis. More on that <a href="#graphs-computationally">later</a>.</p>



<p>Graphs are general-purpose data structures used to represent a variety of data types and procedural phenomena. Unlike most sequential languages, graphs are capable of expressing a much richer family of relations between entities, and are a natural fit for many problems in computer science, physics, biology and mathematics. Consider the following hierarchy of data structures, all of which are graphs with increasing expressive power:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sets</strong>: datasets, multisets, posets, alphabets</li>
  <li><strong>Sequences</strong>: Lists, strings, arrays, linear function composition</li>
  <li><strong>Trees</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract syntax</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">XML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree">phylogeny</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">decision trees</a></li>
  <li><strong>DAGs</strong>: <a href="https://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/">Git</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_network">citations</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_graph">dependency graphs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow_management_system">workflows</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph">control flow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron">MLPs</a></li>
  <li><strong>Directed graphs</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">State machines</a>, <a href="http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/">λ-calculus</a>, <a href="https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/The_web_as_a_directed_graph">the web</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph">call graphs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network">RNNs</a></li>

</ul>

<p>As we realized in <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad">Kotlin∇</a>, directed graphs can be used to model mathematical expressions, as well as other formal languages, including source code, intermediate representations and binary artifacts. Not only can graphs be used to describe extant human knowledge, many recent examples have shown that machines can “grow” trees and graphs for various applications, such as program synthesis, mathematical deduction and physical simulation. Recent neuro-symbolic applications have shown promising early results in graph synthesis:</p>

</ul>

<p>The field of natural language processing has also developed a rich set of graph-based representations, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar">constituency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar">dependency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_grammar">link</a> and other and other typed attribute grammars which can be used to reason about syntactic and semantic relations between natural language entities. Research has begun to show many practical applications for such grammars in the extraction and organization of human knowledge stored in large text corpora. Those graphs can be further processed into ontologies for logical reasoning.</p>

<img width="60%" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Thistreeisillustratingtherelation%28PSG%29.png">
</center>

<p>Using coreference resolution and entity alignment techniques, we can reconstruct internally consistent relations between entities, which capture cross-corpus consensus in natural language datasets. When stored in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02320.pdf">knowledge graphs</a>, these relations can be used for information retrieval and question answering, e.g. on wikis and other content management systems. Recent techniques have shown promise in automatic knowledge base construction (cf. <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/tacl_a_00088">Reddy et al.</a>, 2016).</p>

				<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Glaucon joins the agora with its usual 30–40 patrons present, most of whom are idling or spectating.  Glaucon has ambitious and unusual goals for his computing environment, and high standards of openness and freedom for the hardware he wants to use, but isn’t sure where to start implementing what he wants.  Socrates, one of the regulars, having experience in this area, explains to Glaucon some of the subtleties of hardware being “open” or “closed”, and clears up some surprising misconceptions that Glaucon likely shares with others in his position.</p>

<h2 id="dramatis-personae">Dramatis personae</h2>

<p>In order of appearance:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Glaucon:</strong> A Cretin visitor to the agora, with grand ideals of freedom and minimalism in computing</li>
  <li><strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> A self-taught Ithacan sysadmin with no engineering knowledge</li>
  <li><strong>Socrates:</strong> Famed philosopher-engineer of Athens</li>
  <li><strong>Adeimantus:</strong> Another Cretin, a regular visitor, impatient with his countryman’s idealism</li>
  <li><strong>Polemarchus:</strong> A Spartan</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prelude">Prelude</h2>

<p><strong>Glaucon:</strong> why hello<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I need some help with something <br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> Does anyone know of any completely free hardware computers? I’m looking and I can’t find any<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> Who wants to tell him<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I thought there were at least one or two<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> like a weak 16-bit/32-bit one at least<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> Thrasymachus: why didn’t you mention POWER?<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> ?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> POWER is a remarkably open architecture<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> I wonder if it would meet Glaucon’s high standards<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> it’s too new<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> only the oldest workable tech will do, because performance is bloat<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> Thinkpad with pre-ME CPU, Libreboot, and Trisquel<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> no networking because I haven’t found an ISP that will give me the source to their CRM<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> people on /g/ are saying system76 but that’s not at all what I’m looking for<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> they’re all Intel or AMD CPUs<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> Pinebook is closer</p>

<h2 id="the-spectre-of-management-engines">The spectre of management engines</h2>

<p><strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> Socrates may be able to help you<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> hi Socrates<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> <a href="https://www.raptorcs.com/content/TL2B01/intro.html">https://www.raptorcs.com/content/TL2B01/intro.html</a><br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> &gt;OpenPOWER<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> BEAUTIFUL<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> POWER arch, auditable/disablable management<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> this is exactly what I was looking for<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> Socrates wins<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> management?<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> like IME?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> OpenBMC<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc">https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc</a><br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> this is its own OS?<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I’m still a bit lost<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> Intel ME is a small CPU tacked on the side running Minix<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> like it or not, management is actually pretty cool and useful<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> the reason why ME is shit is because it’s not owned by you, so while you can control it (and it is useful for everybody), people don’t trust Intel to make it secure and safe against economic/political pressures<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> what if I wanted to avoid it entirely<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s why I bought a 2003 Tower to begin with<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> then disable it<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> there must be an option to have it not be there at all<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> probably, if you email them they’ll probably ship it nulled out<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> or give you instructions on how to do the same<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> do you know of any other boards like this you could link?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> nothing at this level ships without management<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> (its not inherently bad)<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> its basically just Wake-on-LAN but extended<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> what does ship without management<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> to get stuff that ships without management you have to go into the low end devices that are used by people who don’t care about openness<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> but genuinely, management is orthogonal to openness/security<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> such as?<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> ah shit, this board is $4k<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> lmao<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> I mean, if you buy old pre-ME business laptops, they’re probably the best trade-off between good devices<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s what I figured<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> but really, don’t ask for “no management”, ask for management you can control<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> its the difference between &lt;manufacturer BIOS&gt; and Libreboot, etc<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBMC">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBMC</a> is probably a better explanation<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> so there essentially aren’t affordable options for open source CPUs at all<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> OpenPOWER<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> as was linked<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> if you want to wait another decade, we might get some traction in RISC-V<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> but for now, RISC-V competes with ARM, not Intel/AMD<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that thing was 4000 bux<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> listen bud freedom doesn’t come free<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> <a href="https://fglt.nl/assets/img/agora/freedom-aint-free.jpg">https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/856/704/8b2.jpg</a><br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> praise Jesus<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> fugg</p>

<h2 id="the-economics-of-open-hardware">The economics of open hardware</h2>

<p><strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t understand why I can’t get an SBC with an open source CPU<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> that’s because you don’t understand market economics, but that’s ok<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> if SBC grade is what you’re looking for, you can get RISC-V now for a shit perf:$ ratio, but a low absolute cost<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> okay<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> but a few hundred dollars would be possible<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> not just 4k<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> probably we’re talking Raspberry Pi perf for the cost of a decent laptop<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> yeah that’s reasonable<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> and no software support<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> <a href="https://www.sifive.com/boards">https://www.sifive.com/boards</a><br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> I think I need to learn something about RISC-V<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> basically just imagine the ARM product line but open source<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> I ain’t mad at that<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> looks like you can get an unleashed board for ~$1000<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> still a bit high<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> but much more reasonable<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> maybe I’ll take the dive eventually<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> sadly, that’s the two ends of the spectrum right now<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> It’s getting better<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> you can get an Raspberry Pi for $1000, or you can get a POWER workstation for $5000<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I might just get one of those Rockchip SBCs instead<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> or ARM SBCs<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t have 1000 bux to drop on a PC I want to use rarely<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> Rockchip is ARM<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> right<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> well either way<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> is Mali open source?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> I thought it needed blobs<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> oh, ARM give you some open source userspace drivers<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> standby for 0 perf lmoa :(((<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> if I was gonna just get an ARM SBC do you have any suggestions<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I know the banana pi is mostly open software/hardware<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> what’s your use case?<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I need about 1GHz CPU and 1-2GB of RAM, I’ve been using an old 2003 Dell Tower for minimalist Linux, right now Alpine, and a simple web browser, text-based email client, text-based torrent client, text-based IRC client, and like mpv or something<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s about it<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> no, tell me your use case<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s my use case<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> what you’re upgrading from<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t understand<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s what I’m upgrading from, that tower, do you want the model<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> ok<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> just get whatever the most-FOSS SBC you can find is<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> but just remember that half of them aren’t actually FOSS<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> (either because they are crippled when running FOSS only, or they ship violating blobs)<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> Way to crush his dreams, Socrates<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> yeah it’s not a great situation right now<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> Thrasymachus: he wants everything for nothing, the only solution they have is to pay and support showing that its a workable market, or to just deal with compromise<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> or sit on his hands and hope the rest of the world carries them I guess<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> <a href="http://nonfree.pizza/">http://nonfree.pizza/</a><br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t want everything for nothing<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I want to know what my options are<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t know much about open source hardware so I’m learning<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I only just jumped off from using Windows 10 daily lmao<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> I really suggest you understand what management is though, because you went from “I don’t know where OpenBMC sits in the stack” to “management bad”<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> so you p much only know the “IME is bad” bit of the story, which is absolutely true, but only one page of a very large book<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I never said management bad<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I asked if there was anything I could get with no management<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> to understand the range of these devices<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> you said you didn’t want management at all, which pigeonholes you to “very old” or “very low end”<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t mind very old<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> the problem is very old is often very proprietary as well<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> management is now the default, so you need to make some compromise: remove it, at cost, or pick something old, at a performance penalty, or pick something low end, at a perf penalty, or pick something where the management is open, at a cost<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I also wanna avoid x86 bc then I can pigeonhole myself into only using Linux/BSD<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> interesting statement<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> pick x86_64 and you get to run anything, including a better range of Linux, and other interesting stuff like Haiku, Plan 9, etc<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s the opposite of what I want<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t want to run anything<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> if I did I’d have kept my gaming PC<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> then why are you even here?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> ascetic minimalism and restriction comes at the cost of your own experience<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> perfect<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s exactly what I want<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> then get a Filofax and some stamps<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> the computing world is not for you<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> you’ve been had, and you’re taking the /g/ minimal desktop thread meme way too hard<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> nah, I’m enjoying myself<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I just want to take the next step and get more open hardware<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> well<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> you say that but you’re not willing to take what comes with that<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> buying cheap SBCs is usually non-free, even when they have “FOSS” on the sticker<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> usually by taking the allwinner route<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> because it doesn’t have to be expensive<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> it is currently<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> the only way to make it not expensive is to support the market now<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> it has to be expensive when you have low demand and high costs due to lack of scale<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> nah<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> like, Raptor are seriously, seriously thinking about pulling from the market<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> because they cant make the economics work<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> because of what Adeimantus said<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> then buy it yourself? I’m not gonna buy a 1000 dollar PC<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> it doesn’t have to cost that much<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> like I said, you don’t …</p></div></div>

<p>Resilience is something those who use Kubernetes to run apps and microservices in containers aim for. When a system is resilient, it can handle losing a portion of its microservices and components without the entire system becoming inaccessible.</p>



<p>Resilience is achieved by integrating loosely coupled microservices. When a system is resilient, microservices can be updated or taken down without having to bring the entire system down. Scaling becomes easier too, since you don’t have to scale the whole cloud environment at once.</p>



<p>That said, resilience is not without its challenges. Building microservices that are independent yet work well together is not easy. You also have to create and maintain a reliable system with high fault tolerance. This is where Chaos Engineering comes into play.</p>



<h2>What Is Chaos Engineering?</h2>



<p>Chaos Engineering has been around for almost a decade now but it is still a relevent and useful concept to incorporate into improving your whole systems architecture. In essence, Chaos Engineering is the process of triggering and injecting faults into a system deliberately. Instead of waiting for errors to occur, engineers can take deliberate steps to cause (or simulate) errors in a controlled environment.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering allows for better, more advanced resilience testing. Developers can now experiment in cloud-native distributed systems. Experiments involve testing both the physical infrastructure and the cloud ecosystem.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering is not a new approach. In fact, companies like Netflix have been using resilience testing through Chaos Monkey, an in-house Chaos Engineering framework designed to improve the strength of cloud infrastructure for years now.</p>



<p>When dealing with a large-scale distributed system, Chaos Engineering provides an empirical way of building confidence by anticipating faults instead of reacting to them. The chaotic condition is triggered intentionally for this purpose.</p>



<p>There are a lot of analogies depicting how Chaos Engineering works, but the traffic light analogy represents the concept best. Conventional testing is similar to testing traffic lights individually to make sure that they work.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering, on the other hand, means closing out a busy array of intersections to see how traffic reacts to the chaos of losing traffic lights. Since the test is run deliberately, more insights can be collected from the process.</p>



<h2>Why Use Chaos Engineering?</h2>



<p>Let’s start this part by accepting the fact that chaos engineering and fault testing have a lot of overlaps, but the latter tests a specific condition instead of real chaos. Chaos Engineering actually lets you garner more insights, down to identifying nodes that are not behaving as intended and generating errors under certain conditions.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering is not for testing every condition, but it covers a lot of ground. There are several things you can learn about the system through chaos testing.</p>



<ul><li>Inter-service latency causing bottlenecks and grinding the system to a slow pace can be discovered through Chaos Engineering.</li><li>Routine driver checks to identify how drivers of different versions or variations affect system performance and stability.</li><li>Memory and CPU usage being maxed out and how the condition affects your system, particularly in scalable Elastic environments.</li><li>Fault injection, particularly the introduction of multiple faults at the same time.</li><li>Simulating catastrophic failure of the entire cloud architecture or datacenter.</li></ul>



<p>Chaos Engineering, on the other hand, is not very effective when used to test specific faults, especially when the faults are siloed in one or two microservices. Chaos experiments are also more suitable for revealing effects and impacts that you are not aware of and confirming your suspicions after running into several similar errors.</p>



<h2>The Principles of Chaos Engineering</h2>



<p>From the previous explanations, it is clear that Chaos Engineering is meant to uncover faults and weaknesses in a system. You want to run the Chaos experiment in a controlled and close-to-ideal environment so that there is no bias to worry about.</p>



<p>To run the experiment, there are several principles that you need to follow.</p>



<h3>Formulate a Hypothesis</h3>



<p>This is the start of the experiment. You begin by making assumptions about how the system will react when certain faults and conditions are introduced. The hypothesis lets you identify which metrics to measure.</p>



<h3>Identify Variables</h3>



<p>Chaos Engineering relies on real-life events; the Chaos experiment reflects real-life events and potential situations that you want to anticipate. When choosing variables, you have to think about the probability of those variables manifesting and their estimated impact on your system.</p>



<h3>Automation</h3>



<p>Automated orchestration is another important component of Chaos Engineering. Using automated orchestration, you can perform state condition checks and analyze application and data integrity more comprehensively than when you do everything manually. In fact, manual experiments are far from sustainable.</p>



<h3>Reduced Blast Radius</h3>



<p>The next principle is reduced blast radius, which means running the Chaos experiment in a controlled environment to minimize the damage and influence caused by the test. Most developers run Chaos experiments on their production environment, but with added measures put in place to prevent catastrophic failures. Alternatively, you can create a robust testing environment to further reduce the blast radius.</p>



<h3>Scaling the Blast Radius</h3>



<p>The blast radius can be scaled to further identify system faults. Limiting the blast radius too much may not always yield the best results, which is why it is sometimes necessary to scale the blast radius up in order to identify faults that relate to real-life behaviors of the system.</p>



<p>The principles governing Chaos Engineering, when implemented thoroughly, creates the perfect chaos. It is a lot easier to identify faults and understand their impacts when you have a controlled chaos, a robust monitoring routine, and the ability to observe real-life system behaviors when faults are introduced.</p>



<h2>Are You Ready for Chaos Engineering?</h2>



<p>Lastly, it is important to understand whether your organization is ready for Chaos Engineering. Chaos Engineering requires the basic weaknesses to be plugged first. This means getting your system to a point where it is resilient enough to handle network spikes and service failures. Once the prerequisites are met, you can run Chaos experiments to uncover other weaknesses.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering also requires your system to have maximum visibility. Fortunately, most cloud architectures and environments are compatible with monitoring tools that maximize system visibility. Optimize Chaos Engineering to review your systems, seek out new systemic weaknesses and improve your infrastructure’s fault tolerance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When browsing the web, it can often feel like your privacy is being constantly invaded and your data misused; in the most by companies spying on you to advertise things you don’t really need. </p> <p>As the Moneyed app enables users to view their financial data, it’s vital that privacy and security are built into the core of our tech. One security consideration is cookies: if an attacker stole your session identifier, they could pretend to be you, and potentially view your data. </p> <p>Below is a list of some of the cookie-related procedures we follow at Moneyed. To keep everyone’s data safe, other companies should be doing the same with their cookies (but, as the title suggests, they probably aren’t). </p> <h4>1. Use cookies over sessionStorage or localStorage</h4> <p>The session identifier could be stored in a cookie, sessionStorage, or localStorage. Given that the session identifier is only required by the server, access should be restricted to it; this is possible to do with cookies (see number 4), but not possible with sessionStorage and localStorage. </p> <h4>2. Use only strictly necessary cookies</h4> <p>Strictly necessary cookies do not require consent from the user[1]; this avoids the need for an annoying cookie permission popup and signals to the user that you care about their privacy. </p> <h4>3. Set the secure attribute</h4> <p>The secure attribute requires that the browser only accepts the cookie and only shares the cookie if the site is secure, e.g. served over HTTPS, making it harder for a man-in-the-middle attacker to steal the cookie[2, 3]. </p> <h4>4. Set the HttpOnly attribute</h4> <p>The HttpOnly attribute requires that the browser only share the cookie with the server (via HTTP requests) and specifically prevents scripts running in the browser from accessing the cookie; this makes it harder for a cross site scripting (XSS) attacker to steal the cookie[2, 4]. </p> <h4>5. Set the path attribute to '/'</h4> <p>The path attribute specifies which URL paths the cookie is shared with. Setting the path attribute to '/' means the cookie is shared with any path on the domain[2]; this is best practice as most security measures are based on the origin (rather than path). </p> <h4>6. Don’t set the domain attribute</h4> <p>The domain attribute specifies which URL domains the cookie is shared with. Not including/setting the domain activates the host-only-flag, ensuring that the cookie is only shared with the host that set it; this is preferable to explicitly setting the domain as it excludes subdomains. </p> <h4>7. Set the SameSite attribute to Lax or Strict</h4> <p>The SameSite attribute controls when a cookie is shared with cross origin requests. Strict should be used in preference as it prevents any sharing, whereas Lax allows for top level navigation i.e. when a user follows a link from an external site. </p> <h4>8. Use the '__Host-' name prefix</h4> <p>Adding <code>__Host-</code> as a prefix to the cookie name requires that the Secure attribute is set, the Path attribute is set to '/', and the domain attribute is not set; this acts as a failsafe ensuring that the cookie cannot exist without these attributes. </p> <h4>9. Don’t set max-age or expires</h4> <p>By not setting max-age or expires the cookie becomes a session cookie; this ensures that the cookie is deleted when the user’s session ends. The alternative is needing to remember to delete the cookie, or predict the perfect time in the future to schedule a deletion. </p> <h4>10. Set the same attributes when deleting</h4> <p>When a user logs out, they expect their session to end and therefore that the cookie has been deleted. Cookie deletion is usually achieved by setting a cookie that expires immediately. For this to work the cookie must have the correct combination of attributes e.g. deleting a `__Host-` prefixed cookie requires the Secure, Path, and domain attributes to have the correct values. </p> <h4>Moneyed’s Cookie</h4> <p>Our session cookies incorporate all of the best practices outlined above, the exact header is the one at the top of the page, <code>Set-Cookie: __Host-[name]=[value]; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/; SameSite=Strict </code> . </p>  <div><h4>Work in tech?</h4> <p>We'd love to hear your feedback on our app (and in exchange, we'll offer you a discounted subscription) </p> </div>  <h4>Moneyed sponsored open source work</h4> <p>The following open source changes have been sponsored by Moneyed to help secure cookies for all, </p> <ul><li>Correctly delete cookies (missing attributes) <a href="https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/pull/1889" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Werkzeug #1889 </a></li> <li>Correctly delete cookies (missing attributes) <a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart/-/commit/2041c0dbbdd69de39d0a839e6f8be5f556c59e01" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Quart 2041c0db </a></li> <li>Best practices in Quart-Auth <a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart-auth/-/commit/5a34616f3b71fbb9fba44c9dc79b188b5faedb8d" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Quart-Auth 0.4 </a></li></ul> <h4>References</h4> <p>[1] Strictly necessary cookies, GDPR <a href="https://gdpr.eu/cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://gdpr.eu/cookies/ </a> <br> [2] MDN Web docs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Using HTTP cookies </a> <br> [3] MDN Web docs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MitM" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Man-in-the-middle attacker </a> <br> [4] MDN Web docs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Types_of_attacks#Cross-site_scripting_(XSS)" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XSS </a> <br> [5] <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-05" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">RFC6265 draft </a></p></div></div>]]>

The player returns.</p><p><em>Ad infinitum.</em> Until either the player or opponent breaks the loop, because they failed to return the ball.</p><p>Tennis folks call this a rally, but for us, this repeating structure is the game's core loop. It's exactly what we were looking for.</p><p>A core loop is the game's <em>essential activity</em>. Every sport has one, and every game has one:</p><ul><li>Baseball: a pitcher pitches a ball; a batter hits the ball, or misses.</li><li>Football: a quarterback receives the ball, and makes a play.</li></ul><p>Games have larger loops of course! In baseball, runners run to bases around a diamond. There are innings. There are game series.</p><p>But we seek the smallest, tightest loop of the game. Such that if you take this loop away, the game won't work.</p><p>Can you find a game that <em>doesn't</em> have a core loop? Heck, one can argue that visual novels –&nbsp;which are heavily story-based –&nbsp;have a core loop of dialogue navigation.</p><p>Since <a href="https://teamavocado.co/sports-game">we're making a boxing game</a>, let's identify the core loop:</p><ol><li>A boxer throws a punch.</li><li>An opponent evades or blocks the punch, or throws a punch back.</li></ol><p>From that core idea, we can scope our project.</p><h2 id="define-project-milestones">2. Define project milestones</h2><p>When game developers say to build on a strong core, they refer to core loops.</p><p>Wanna know why?</p><p>Once you've identified your game's core loop, the path forward is clear:</p><ol><li>🧭 <s><strong>The Goal.</strong> Do you want to tell a story? Express a feeling? Fulfill a game jam prompt? Make a game for a certain demographic?</s></li><li>🍏 <s><strong>The Core Loop.</strong> What's the essential activity that defines your game?</s></li><li>👩 <strong>The First Playable.</strong> Get stuff moving on screen ASAP.

Design your game loop's length</h2><p>I think a <strong>good</strong> game is one where the total player time far exceeds the development time.</p><p>Why? Because players can replay your game over and over if it's genuinely fun. On the other hand, you only had to make the game once.</p><p>You get a lot more bang for your buck.</p><p>Part of that comes from the length of the higher-level game loop.</p><p>If you recall Pico Tennis, the <em>essential activity</em> is hitting the ball back and forth. But the higher-level <em>game</em> loop is the <em>rally</em>.</p><p>And in Pico Tennis, a rally lasts maybe a minute. This is important!</p><p>If you're designing for busy people who play games in pockets of time, maybe you want minute-long game loops. So players can play several rounds within the span of a coffee break.</p><p>(An interesting take: Jan Willem Nijman's <em>Minit</em> has game length in its name. Its game loop lasts exactly 60 seconds.)</p><blockquote><p><em>"Man, that's deep. Can I get some dog treats now?"</em></p><p><em>– Paraphrasing my dog, as she stares intently into my soul.</em></p></blockquote><p>Once you understand the idea of a core loop, you start to see them everywhere.</p><p>Take the game of life.</p><p>Not Conway's Game of Life!

July 17, 2020 | https://alexkondov.com/how-a-chrome-extension-broke-my-web-app/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://alexkondov.com/how-a-chrome-extension-broke-my-web-app/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After a long break from personal projects, the situation around the virus inspired me to build something on the side again. I’ll spare you the details but I decided to build a new kind of job board that would let developers browse open positions based on the technologies they are interested in.</p>
<p>It’s a straight forward full-stack JavaScript application that uses React in the browser, Express on the server and Dynamo for storage. As much as I wanted to give Go, or Svelte a try I wanted to ship something fast. Learning a new technology on the go wasn’t compatible with that goal.</p>
<h2>The First Tests</h2>
<p>So I invested around 40-50 hours in an alpha version that had all the basic functionality in place. It wasn’t visually fascinating but it got the job done. I decided to Heroku for the Express app and Vercel for the React one.</p>
<p>Once the alpha version was ready, I entered a few commands in the terminal and I it deployed for the world to see. I sent it to a couple of my friends to get some feedback. They told me what they liked and what they didn’t and uncovered a few bugs along the way. I had plenty of work to do.</p>
<h2>“Probably nothing serious…”</h2>
<p>One of the bugs they discovered was quite unfortunate. The most important feature of the app was a rich, long form which had a lot of client side functionality. It has different fields, WYSIWYG editors, file uploads, drag and drop elements and what not. Turns out the whole form didn’t on Chrome.</p>
<p>The app was still in its infancy so I didn’t pay much attention to that. I had probably broken something small by accident just before deploying. I didn’t even open the console because I expected to see <code>cannot read property state of undefined</code> or something in those lines. You know what I mean.</p>
<p>Probably nothing serious. So did I think…</p>
<h2>The Plot Thickens</h2>
<p>A couple of weeks later I had made some improvements and fixes. I settled on a name, picked fonts and colors and gave the app a bit of personality. It was time to ship the next version. I tested locally and everything worked fine, including the form.</p>
<p>I run a few commands, type the domain name in the browser and there it is. Everything looks great. I send out the links again and wait for the responses, tapping my foot on the floor. The three dots signaling that someone is writing appeared in the chat box. A couple of seconds later the first message popped up - “The form doesn’t work again”.</p>
<p>That’s not right I tested multiple times. I checked the console and there weren’t even warnings. I didn’t want this to be a blocker for the test so I rolled my sleeves up and started digging. I opened the form on the production environment. Wrote a few letters in one of the text fields - and the form didn’t work.</p>
<p>There’s a small preview widget on the side that should be updated as you type but it wasn’t working. No errors in the console either. I run the app locally and everything works seamlessly. There’s something wrong with the production environment.</p>
<p>But how could that impact the page? I didn’t use any environment variables there, nothing platform specific either. I decided to check the behavior in different browsers. Started Firefox, went to the app and opened the form. It worked. Everything was updated as expected. I started Safari and checked the form there. Everything works again.</p>
<h2>We Knot Who, But We Don’t Know Why</h2>
<p>My friend experienced the same behavior - the bug was only in Chrome. I was completely puzzled. I never thought that Chrome of all browsers would be causing unexpected bugs. It’s usually the others that require special attention. At least I know where the problem is - time to dig.</p>
<p>I rolled my sleeves up and opened the dev tools. I wasn’t using any unsupported browser APIs so it’s not that. No application errors but in the Network tab I see that some of the requests are marked as blocked without a status code for the response. Huh?</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, those requests are for the JavaScript bundles that make the form page functional. The other pages are working fine, though. Their JS gets downloaded successfully. The one for the form, however, is marked as blocked without any message or any response.</p>
<p>My first thought was that a security rule in Chrome could be blocking the files for some reason. I did some reading around cookies, CORS, checked the configuration in Vercel but found no leads there. I scoured the web (and by that I mean Stack Overflow), searched for different phrases and problems that could give me some insight into what is happening.</p>
<p>No thread, or documentation page held any answers for me.</p>
<h2>On The Verge Of Desperation</h2>
<p>What I thought would be a trivial problem related to a missing check in JavaScript turned out to be a massive blocker. I can’t ship the app without the form. If it was failing only in Safari I could live with it. But this is Chrome - everybody’s using it.</p>
<p>At this point I had already spend my Saturday afternoon with no success. The wise thing here would be to call it a day and go back tomorrow with a clean mind. But since I was so invested I pressed on and continued to jam random words related to the problem in the search bar.</p>
<p>Then something happened. Somehow I put the correct combination of words, the stars aligned and at the top of the list I saw a link. It still had the blue color of a page that I still hadn’t opened. It was a question on Stack Overflow, of course.</p>
<p>I had already opened around 10 such threads, all with similar names, but hope dies last. I click on the link, hold my breath and start digging through the comments. Most of the responses and ideas I had already tried, they were of no help. But as I was about to click the back button, my eye was caught by one of the responses lower on the list. </p>
<h2>A New Hope</h2>
<p>It had the meager 7 upvotes but it was worth the try. All it said was to check the Chrome extensions since one of them could be interfering with the network call. Up until this moment I hadn’t even thought about them. They have access to everything on the page but in my 6 years of web development I hadn’t experienced any problems because of an extension.</p>
<p>But at this point I couldn’t rule it out.</p>
<p>I once again examined the unfortunate bundle. They are all named with an identifier, followed by a hash and the file extension - <code>index</code>, <code>create</code>, <code>listing</code>, <code>advert</code>. The blocked one that was breaking the form page was the <code>advert</code> bundle. I looked at the name for a second. Then I looked at the line of extensions next to the address bar. I looked at the name again. Then back to the extensions. Oh no…</p>
<p>A small red icon on the extension bar caught my attention - the AdBlocker. Could this be it? I disabled the AdBlocker and lo and behold - the page was fully functional. My friend got the same result. Apparently because the file contained the word <strong>advert</strong> it was getting blocked by the extension.</p>
<p>Everyone that tested on Chrome experienced the problem with the form. That’s because that’s their default browser and they most likely have some ad blocking add-on. Once they switched to another browser which they didn’t use and had no extensions installed, everything would work.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect AdBlocker to be that unforgiving but as a person who is not that fond of ads, I should be careful what domain language I use in my applications.</p>
<h2>Live To Tell The Tale</h2>
<p>So, this is it. The result of a Saturday afternoon spent debugging obscure problems. After such a session you usually go out of the room with a stern look on your face. Walking like a veteran with all your knowledge and the things you’ve seen. Well, I can’t say I learned anything new but I’ll be really careful with how I name my files from now on.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I was always interested in the RF world, the fact that we are surrounded by an infinite amount of invisible waves that carry information is intriguing. A lot has changed over the years, the technology advanced and today you can easily dive into the electromagnetic realm without fiddling with mountains of equipment and burning your pocket.</p>
<p>In this post we’ll explore using RTL-SDR to read live temperature and humidity stats from cheap 433.92Mhz modules, feeding them to InfluxDB using rtl_433, MQTT and Telegraf on a Raspberry Pi (but any Linux based device can work)</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011HVUEME/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B011HVUEME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rsv0f-20&amp;linkId=b3bd3c48a6a7e921144609cb59359f0e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">RTL-SDR</a></strong></p>
<p>The definition of SDR is “Software Defined Radio”, it’s a radio-communication system where instead of using components that were traditionally implemented in hardware - software is used, allowing greater flexibility and reducing costs.</p>
<p>RTL-SDR is a high quality USB dongle (but relatively cheap at ~$25) that can be used to scan and receive radio signals from 500Khz (24Mhz for the device I used) up to 1.75Ghz. It was designed and built by the awesome dudes over at <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">RTL-SDR.com</a> based on DVB-T TV tuner dongles. I ordered <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011HVUEME/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B011HVUEME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rsv0f-20&amp;linkId=b3bd3c48a6a7e921144609cb59359f0e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this</a> kit which included two modular dipole antennas.</p>

<p>Almost any RF based wireless thermometer / humidity sensor is probably readable by <code>rtl_433</code>.

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://cubicsdr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">CubicSDR for MacOS</a></strong></p>
<p>This is an awesome free open-source software for SDR. It wasn’t easy finding one for MacOS, most of the commonly-used projects are made for Linux and Windows. It’s not really required for decoding 433.92Mhz signals, but I wanted to get my hands dirty and look on live RF, it’s pretty neat (and of course to test the device is actually working!)</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">rtl_433</a></strong></p>
<p>An amazing project that can be used to decode a variety of RF-based devices on various frequencies (433.92 MHz, 868 MHz, 315 MHz, 345 MHz, and 915 MHz ISM bands). This is the software that does the heavy lifting.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Mosquitto</a></strong></p>
<p>Very simple MQTT server and client implementation, we’ll be using that as the output of rtl_433 and input of Telegraf to stream the metrics to a remote InfluxDB instance.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Telegraf</a></strong></p>
<p>Agent for collecting and writing metrics. It will subscribe to our MQTT queue, parse and transmit the metrics to InfluxDB.</p>
<h2 id="getting-a-signal">Getting a signal</h2>
<h3 id="connecting-the-antennas">Connecting the antennas</h3>
<p>Let’s start by quickly testing our shiny RTL-SDR receiver, I’ve used the two short 5cm dipole telescopic antennas for this test, you should definitely read <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/using-our-new-dipole-antenna-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this great guide</a> that the awesome dudes over at rtl-sdr.com wrote on using the provided antennas. The antenna used is critical for getting high-quality signal in some cases. For our radio FM test any antenna will probably suffice, but if you want to receive <a href="http://happysat.nl/Setup_Meteor/Setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">weather satellite signal running on 137Mhz</a>, you’ll have to be more specific.</p>
<p>Hopefully you’ve ended up with something like this:</p>

<h3 id="listening-to-radio">Listening to radio</h3>
<p>Now you can connect the dongle to your usb port, launch CubicSDR, choose “Generic RTL2832U OEM” and hit “Start”, you can ignore the extra settings you see on the right for now. You should see a pretty moving signal heatmap, you can change the center frequency by hovering over it and tapping space (the key), I chose a local FM radio station that is broadcasting on 88Mhz (FM).</p>
<p>Now your bandwidth setting should be set to 200Khz, you should get a nice signal and when you hover your mouse over it the band will “encapsulate” the signal, click and you should start hearing radio!</p>
<h3 id="checking-frequency-43392mhz">Checking Frequency 433.92Mhz</h3>
<p>Let’s get ready to use <code>rtl_433</code> by looking at the frequency and making sure there are devices there. Usually they will transmit information in 30 second bursts, you can change the center frequency to 433.92Mhz and check that you see data. Near the end of the video above you can see the signal bursts when I switch to 433.92Mhz</p>

<p>So we’re getting live sensor data, that’s pretty awesome, let’s stream everything to InfluxDB. You can open a free <a href="https://cloud2.influxdata.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Influx Cloud</a> account and we’ll configure Telegraf to stream information to it, after you open the account generate an API key for your bucket.</p>
<p>We’ll use Eclipse Mosquitto as the MQTT server, it’s a very lightweight implementation of MQTT server, providing simple pub/sub service which we’ll use.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>PostgreSQL backups can be categorized into two types: <em>logical</em> and <em>physical</em>. This post briefly covers each type and discusses the situations where you would use either one.</p><p>We'll cover some of the many tools you can use for Postgres backups in future posts.</p><h2>Logical Backups</h2><p>This form of backup is typically achieved by <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup-dump.html">translating all the data into a set of SQL commands and writing it into a single file</a>. This can then be fed to any database cluster to recreate everything. In your CLI, performing logical backups can be as easy as:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>pg_dump db_name </span><span>&gt;</span><span> file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>for a single database, and:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>pg_dumpall </span><span>&gt;</span><span> file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>for an entire database cluster. Both the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html">pg_dump</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pg-dumpall.html">pg_dumpall</a> utilities have their respective additional options for you to choose from and set up your desired logical backup setting. Recovering from them is comparably as simple:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>psql -d db_name -f file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>What is it good for?</h3><h4>Simpler and quicker way of performing backups</h4><p>As shown above, a single command is enough to perform a logical backup and another to recover from it. As a novice with databases, this would be an ideal and non-intimidating ensure that your database is backed up at all times.</p><h4>Migration between different major versions of Postgres</h4><p>If you are planning to migrate to a different major version of Postgres (for example, from Postgres 11 to Postgres 12), logical backups via <code>pg_dumpall</code> would surely be your <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html">tool of choice</a>. This is mainly because internal data storage formats may differ between major versions. This is the basis of physical backups, eliminating it as an option when upgrading. We'll go deeper into migrations and how to perform them in another post.</p><h4>Backing up a single specific database</h4><p>With <code>pg_dump</code>, you can constantly back up a single, targeted database.</p><h2>Physical Backups</h2><p>Physical backups pertain to the actual set of files or file systems where your database data is stored. One option for physical backups involves <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup-file.html">taking a snapshot</a> of your data files by making a copy of them.</p><h3>What is it good for?</h3><h4>More ideal for larger databases</h4><p>As your database grows to the size of a few gigabytes, backing it up through physical backups is more ideal than through logical backups. As explained <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-data-safety-and-continuous-protection#the-performance-impact-of-logical-backups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, over time, performing logical backups in large databases could lead to degraded performance for other queries. Given the long run time as well to successfully perform a logical backup on a large database, errors have a higher chance of occurring, making the eventual backup unusable.</p><h4>Achieving Point in Time Recovery</h4><p>Postgres also generates <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html">Write Ahead Log</a> (WAL) files, which can be used together with a backed-up file system to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/continuous-archiving.html">recover a database up to any chosen point in time</a>. When disaster strikes, this is one of the best options for recreating your database up to the point right before the unfortunate happens. This greatly minimizes <a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/business-continuity/rpo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</a> along the way. Even better, tools such as <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAL-G</a> are readily available to simplify the steps involved in setting this up.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>All in all, logical and physical backups are generated differently from one another. Neither has an advantage over the other. Depending on your needs, each brings unique uses to the table:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Logical</th><th>Physical</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Simpler way of getting started with backups.</td><td>Better way of handling backups for larger database clusters.</td></tr><tr><td>Using it to migrate between different major versions of Postgres.</td><td>Using it for Point in Time Recovery.</td></tr><tr><td>Having the option to back up a single database.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></section></div>]]>

<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>3</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p><span>The word trust is a common theme in cybersecurity when it comes to network breaches, yet the idea of lack of trust is what’s highlighted in these breaches. A company’s feeling of safety and security can disappear in a nanosecond once their network has been infiltrated, and all control of networks and applications is lost. For all tech-forward organizations, the feeling of lost control becomes more universal with every new breach to hit the headlines.</span></p>
<p><span>While in some industries this scary feeling may be up and coming, in the network security landscape it is not a new phenomenon. Whether from malware, ransomware, or your classic unauthorized access network breach </span><a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/blog/news/the-capital-one-data-breach-how-crisis-could-have-been-averted/"><span>like we saw with Capital One</span></a><span>, zero optimism is entertained concerning the safety of companies and individuals from hackers. Awareness of one’s level of a vulnerability is a prerequisite to safety and enables one to take pragmatic steps to secure their data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Rethink the Approach for Network Security&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Until recently, the organization’s IT and security teams primarily focused all their security efforts on fighting off different attacks on the perimeter. While this was the right approach when everyone worked in the same office, times have changed. Due to COVID-19 accelerating the “work from anywhere” approach, we need to rethink network security strategies and pivot them around the user instead of where the network is based.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With more employees working outside the physical office, there is a quickly growing number of endpoints for hackers to attack. In most organizations, the typical employee uses multiple devices to do their daily job. Is each device secure? The answer is probably yes – but you can’t be certain. With each unsecured every device, organizations’ networks are taking an unnecessary risk. When networks are breached, the process of understanding where and how access was gained is not instant and by the time you have your answers, it is too late.</span></p>
<p><span>IT and security teams need to change their approach, and instead of solely emphasizing perimeter security, transform their employees’ permissions and access policies. One of the most common mistakes organizations make is trusting their users when it comes to authorized access. When you provide unrestricted access to any user or device in your network, you simply open the gates for your organization’s network to be breached.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once a user or organization is compromised, their credentials can easily be used to infiltrate the network, especially with different attacks. This presents the idea that organizations need to have better visibility when it comes to authorized user access to their network. So how can organizations trust their employees once again?</span></p>
<h2><span>Zero Trust Helping Us Trust Again&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Can we trust our employees once again, and reduce their responsibility and impact as guards of the organization’s network against hackers? I believe we can, as humans are meant to be trusted even though in many instances human error puts that trust in doubt. People aren’t perfect, we all make mistakes, but we must account for them proactively.</span></p>
<p><span>A common approach that has gained popularity over the past decade for secure network access is by implementing the <a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/solutions/zero-trust-security">Zero Trust model</a>. Zero Trust was </span><span>originally proposed by Forrester in 2010, with the motto </span><span>“never trust, always verify”. This is the idea that until the user can verify him or herself via authentication, they will not receive access to the network. </span><span>Adopting Zero Trust is not a specific product or architecture, instead, it’s taking a more modern approach of setting up organization-wide guidelines inside the company’s resources.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By implementing the ZTNA model for secure network access, IT teams will have full control over who is granted access, enters and leaves the network at all times. For each network, resource or application, there should be a set of rules and policies in place enforced by the key elements of the Zero Trust model: multi-factor authentication, proper device management, limited privileged access and network segmentation using software-defined architecture.</span></p>
<h2><span>ZTNA The Approach Not the Model&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Organizations that take the right approach with ZTNA can erase the concept of trusting in their employees and won’t fear to grant access. To achieve secure network access inside your organization you will need to have the proper principles implemented and distributed throughout the company. Treat </span><a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/zero-trust-network-access"><span>Zero Trust Network Access</span></a><span> as a manual for how organizations should strategize and “trust” their employees with the keys to the kingdom.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <section>
                <p>I learned how to build websites the old fashioned way: looking at website source code and trying to replicate the things I saw. I threw in the odd book for the stuff I couldn’t <em>see</em> (like PHP/MySQL), and I was on my way.</p>

<p>This was back in 1999, when we’d write things like <code>&lt;font size="4" color="#000000"&gt;</code> and DHTML was a <em>thing</em>.</p>

<p>When CSS came along my approach to learning didn’t differ. But I <em>really</em> wish I’d taken the time to learn CSS properly: there was so much fundamental stuff I missed.</p>

<p>Here are some things I didn’t know that I wish I’d learned earlier.</p>

            </section>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            
        
        
                        
<h2 id="block-inline-and-inline-block">Block, inline and inline-block</h2> 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            
                    <section>
                <p>Even though I <em>knew</em> about these properties, I didn’t fully understand them for a long time.</p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>block</code> elements expand horizontally to take up a whole line (like a heading). We can apply vertical margin to these.</li>
<li><code>inline</code> elements expand horizontally just enough to contain their content (like <code>strong</code> or <code>em</code> elements). We <strong>cannot apply vertical margins to these</strong> and they should usually be placed inside a <code>block</code> element.</li>
<li><code>inline-block</code> elements are like <code>inline</code> elements, <strong>but you can apply vertical margins to these</strong> (making them useful for things like buttons).</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example below, <code>block</code> elements have a blue border, <code>inline</code> elements have an orange background, and our <code>inline-block</code> element has a red border.</p>

                    <section>
                <p>Images <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#Styling_with_CSS">being inline by default</a> isn’t a problem, but it can cause confusion when trying to position them or add vertical margins.</p>

<p>If your CSS reset doesn’t include this already, I’d suggest adding the following rule:</p>

<pre><code>img {
    display: block;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That will make their behaviour much more predictable. You might also want to add <code>max-width: 100%;</code> to stop them breaking out of their container, too.</p>

            </section>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            
        
        
                        
<h2 id="how-height-and-width-are-calculated">How height and width are calculated</h2> 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            
                    <section>
                <p>By default, the width/height of a box is calculated by adding together the dimensions of the:</p>

<ul>
<li>Content area</li>
<li>Padding area</li>
<li>Border area</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn’t usually a problem for an element’s height: we’re usually not too bothered about how content reflows vertically. The problems usually occur when trying to calculate an element’s width, especially if there’s more than one element in a row.</p>

<p>If we had the following CSS:</p>

<pre><code>.some-class {
    width: 50%;
    padding: 2em;
    border: 0.1rem;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The total calculated <code>width</code> for <code>.some-class</code> would be:</p>

<p><code>50% + 4em + 0.2rem</code></p>

<p>That’s because of a property called <code>box-sizing</code> which has a default value of <code>content-box</code>. This value means the <code>width</code> property <strong>applies to the content area</strong>: everything else is added on top of this.</p>

<p>We can change this for all elements with the following rule:</p>

<pre><code>* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Returning to our example, the element’s width would now apply to the <code>border</code>, so our element’s total <code>width</code> would be <code>50%</code>.</p>

<p>What happens to the <code>border</code> and <code>padding</code>? Those properties/values still apply, but they don’t affect the total <code>width</code> of the element: they sit within the defined area.</p>

                    <p>We haven’t discussed <code>margin</code> here because <strong>margin is the space between elements</strong>. For that reason, it is never part of this calculation.</p>

                                    </article>
            </section>

                    <section>
                <p>If an element has no <code>background</code> or <code>border</code>, it can appear that <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code> are the same. They are not!</p>

<ul>
<li><code>margin</code> is the space <strong>between</strong> elements</li>
<li><code>padding</code> is space <strong>inside</strong> an element</li>
</ul>

<p>That makes <code>padding</code> useful for elements that have a <code>background</code>. We often don’t want the content to be close to the edge of the element’s box and <code>padding</code> helps us achieve that.</p>

                    <section>
                <p>This has been the source of frustration for CSS newcomers for a long time. Rachel Andrew <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/margins-in-css/#margin-collapsing">describes the behaviour</a> as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When margins collapse, they will combine so that the space between the two elements becomes the larger of the two margins. The smaller margin essentially ending up inside the larger one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we have two block elements with <code>margin-bottom: 1em</code> on one element and <code>margin-top: 1.5em</code> on the element directly below it, the total space between the two elements would be <code>1.5em</code>.</p>

<p>We can see that here:</p>

                <p>When two margins meet, the larger margin absorbs the smaller margin. If the margins are the same value, they absorb each other.</p>

<p>As soon as we know this, <code>margin</code> calculations become easier. It might also change our approach to managing them, and that’s where something like <a href="https://cssfordesigners.com/articles/managing-vertical-margins-in-css">the Lobotomised Owl selector can be useful</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Margins don’t collapse when the parent element is set to <code>display: grid</code> or <code>display: flex</code>.</p>

                <p>CSS stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>. It’s no surprise therefore that the <strong>cascade</strong> is one of the fundamental concepts of CSS.</p>

<p>Though we might be aware of how our own stylesheets interact with each other, we have to remember that there’s <strong>always a default browser stylesheet</strong>. This is loaded <em>before</em> any custom stylesheets, making it easy to redeclare existing values.</p>

<p>The declared styles vary by browser, but they’re the reason that, by default:</p>

<ul>
<li>Headings have different sizes</li>
<li>Text is black</li>
<li>Lists have bullet points</li>
<li>Elements have any <code>display</code> property (such as <code>block</code> or <code>inline</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>And many other things.</p>

<p>Even if a website only has a single stylesheet, that stylesheet will always be merged with the browser’s default styles.</p>

                <p>Using pixels (<code>px</code>) is tempting because they’re simple to understand: declare <code>font-size: 24px</code> and the text will be <code>24px</code>. But that won’t provide a great user experience, particularly for users who resize content at <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2019/12/responsive-type-and-zoom.html#Update02">the browser level</a> or zoom into content.</p>

<p>I started using <code>em</code> (and later <code>rem</code>) for font sizing early. It took much longer to feel comfortable using <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> for other things such as <code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code>, <code>letter-spacing</code> and <code>border</code>.</p>

<p>Understanding the difference between <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> is critical to making relative units manageable. For instance, we might use <code>em</code> for <code>@media</code> queries and vertical margins, but <code>rem</code> for consistent <code>border-width</code>.</p>

<p>The benefits of going all-in on relative sizing are well-worth the small adjustment in thinking that requires.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Snap Search completes one year today 🥳</p><p>To be absolutely correct, it’s been a year since Version 1.1.1 went live on the store, I’m not even sure when I started working on it – but I assume at least 1 week before release.</p><p>This has been an amazing journey. I’ve made many apps/websites/products before – but never have I been so committed to something for so long. I usually get ‘bored’ after releasing and barely hold on for a month or so.</p><p>I’m going to try to share as much as I can about the inception of the idea, the process, what I learnt, future plans and then some numbers 📈</p><p>BUT, before I start – if you don’t have Snap Search and you have an Android device – consider downloading it: <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cybersky.snapsearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Play Store</a>.</p> <h2>Why a Browser for Android??</h2><p>Building a browser for Android was never the plan. Snap Search did not start as a browser. The idea was born as a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snap-sarch/diidgminbhdappppdmgglehmdoeiaheg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">browser extension</a>. I’ve made many apps before, but it was the first time I was making an extension. I had so much fun making that, I literally just wanted to make an Android version of Snap Search because I wanted that thrill. The extension currently follows the exact same format:</p><ul><li>Select your website/search engine</li><li>Enter your search term</li><li>Results will show in Incognito Mode</li></ul><p>However, on Android I could do much more. Incognito mode alone is <span>not</span> safe for browsing. I went a step ahead and did a lot more on Android because it was technically possible for me.</p><h2>The Process ♺</h2><p>Honestly, I do not have any process. May be if I had one I’d make better stuff or may be this just works for me – I’m not sure and I doubt I’ll ever find out. I’m more of a build first guy than plan first guy. This is a comparison of what the first version looked vs what it looks like now:</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png" alt="Home screen for Snap Search before vs now" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-300x261.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-768x668.png 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1536x1336.png 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-2048x1781.png 2048w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1160/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1160x1009.png 1160w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_58/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-58x50.png 58w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_650/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-650x565.png 650w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1000/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1000x870.png 1000w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_50/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-50x43.png 50w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-300x261.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-768x668.png 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1536x1336.png 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-2048x1781.png 2048w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1160/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1160x1009.png 1160w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_58/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-58x50.png 58w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_650/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-650x565.png 650w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1000/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1000x870.png 1000w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_50/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-50x43.png 50w"><figcaption>Before (left) v/s Now (right)</figcaption></figure><p>There were a couple of things I knew from the start about what I wanted this app to be and how I wanted it to be.</p><ol><li>I knew I wanted a Proxy Mode/VPN ability for those users who really wanted to be safe on the web. Doing so wasn’t going to be easy or cheap – and so I had to introduce a ‘Premium Mode’. Now, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://snapsearch.online/app-change-log/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">27 releases later</a> there are multiple <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://snapsearch.online/general/why-should-i-pay-for-premium-mode-of-snap-search/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reasons to buy a premium plan</a> for Snap Search.</li><li>The app should NEVER ask for permissions. No storage, no location, no gallery, no contacts – nothing. If any feature required it, I would have to find a way around it or Snap Search would just have to be a browser without it.</li><li>No ads on Snap Search. Personally, I hate ads.</li></ol><p>And so, I just kept building.</p><p>Most app updates involved introducing New Features and UI Improvements. I made myself understand a few things beforehand:</p><ul><li>It needs to look good or people won’t use it.</li><li>It needs to be unique or people won’t use it.</li><li>It needs to work as promised or people will hate it.</li></ul><p>I guess these are standard points for any application/platform/service. However, that doesn’t make it any less important. In fact, I made sure to remember the same every time I sat down to write code or work on the app.</p><h4>Deciding What To Do Next</h4><p>Have you heard of a concept called the “Writer’s Block”? I was scared I’d face something similar – like a “Developer’s Block” or “Maker’s Block”. After every update I’d sit down and think – Do I have anything to do for the next update?</p><p>I always had the option of just improving what is already there – which is a good thing to do obviously, but I wanted something new to add, whether it was a new feature or an update to the UI. The current browser is a result of just that. I didn’t think of the current design at the start, it came to look like this after changes again and again. The original browser had the standard options of:</p><ul><li>Close</li><li>Minimize</li><li>Copy URL</li><li>Share URL</li><li>Open URL using External Browser</li></ul><p>Today, the browser <strong>has over 26 actions one can do!</strong> Here’s the before version and now version of that:</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1024x890.png" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1024x890.png" alt="Browser for Snap Search before vs now" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1024x890.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-300x261.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-768x668.png 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1536x1336.png 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-2048x1781.png 2048w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1160/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1160x1009.png 1160w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_58/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-58x50.png 58w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_650/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-650x565.png 650w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1000/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1000x870.png 1000w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_50/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-50x43.png 50w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1024x890.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-300x261.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-768x668.png 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1536x1336.png 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-2048x1781.png 2048w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1160/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1160x1009.png 1160w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_58/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-58x50.png 58w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_650/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-650x565.png 650w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1000/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1000x870.png 1000w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_50/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-50x43.png 50w"><figcaption>Before (left) vs Now (right)</figcaption></figure><h2>What I Learnt 📚</h2><p>There are 3 important, fundamental concepts one must be aware of. These apply to all walks of life though:</p><ul><li>Focus</li><li>Perseverance</li><li>Hard Work</li></ul><p>Only with a healthy mix of all 3 have I been able to build Snap Search and get it to where it is today. I admit, it is probably nowhere close to a general measurement of success, but I wouldn’t have even come this far if I hadn’t focused on making it better, persevered through all obstacles, and continued to work hard towards my goals.</p><p>Another important thing I learnt is people are willing to try new things. When you think of a browser, it’s actually a pretty saturated market on its own. You got Chrome, Firefox and Safari leading the pack. Brave and Edge are catching up and then on Android, there are thousands more. One would think building a Browser for Android isn’t a smart idea, and that this is going to be really difficult to get into. But it turns out not that difficult too.</p><h2>Future Plans 🕞</h2><p>iOS! That’s all I’m going to plan ahead for. Yes, bug fixes and performance improvements and all that too. I need to focus on the iOS version now. Building a Browser for Android was fun, building one for iOS is going to be a challenge for me though.</p><h2>Numbers 📈</h2><p>Let’s get into it.</p><ul><li>Monthly Active Unique Users: 6.2K</li><li>Total Downloads: 20,000+</li><li>Total revenue: $1.4K</li></ul><p>To be fair, most of the growth has come in the last 4-5 months. January – December 2020 report will probably be much much better than this one. Initial growth was very tough.</p><p>Thank you for reading such a long post. It’s really hard to describe a year long experience in words, specially when you’re still coming to terms with it yourself. All I know is I’m grateful for it, and even more motivated for the coming year!</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>Science is facing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">reproducibility
crisis</a>. Poorly designed or
 implemented scientific software represent a major limitation in making
packages reusable and analyses reproducible. In this article, I’ll break down
good software engineering practices to six <em>hallmarks</em>. These hallmarks guide
researchers through improving their code quality, maximizing the utility and
impact of the software, and in the long run improve the perspective of
replication in science.</p>

<p>Adhering to these guidelines is one aspect of making your research <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR</a> (<strong>f</strong>indable, <strong>a</strong>ccessible, <strong>i</strong>nteroperable and <strong>r</strong>eusable).</p>

<p><img src="https://grst.github.io/assets/bioinformatics/hallmarks_annotated.png" alt="hallmarks"></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: The Hallmarks of Good Scientific Software<sup id="fnref:hallmarks"><a href="#fn:hallmarks">1</a></sup>. The icons
 (except pipeline) are from <a href="https://fontawesome.io/">fontawesome</a>. The figure
 may be reused under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a>
 license.</p>

<p>These hallmarks focus on tools and habits which will help taking your software quality
to the next level. I assume that you are already familiar with the basics of 
<em>clean coding principles</em>, i.e. you format your code consistently, use sensible 
variable names, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">keep everything stupidly simple</a>. 
The importance of writing easy-to-read code cannot be overstated. 
A good starting point for learning how to write clean code is this <a href="http://stat405.had.co.nz/r-style.html">style guide for R</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/zedr/clean-code-python#introduction">clean-code-python</a> project.</p>

<p>Next, let’s distinguish between <em>software packages</em> and <em>data analysis reports</em>.
Both are pieces of software which are covered by the hallmarks – however, they
have slightly different priorities.  Software packages are a tool, or a
collection of tools which are created with the aim of being applied to different
datasets. A typical example would be a sequence aligner like
<a href="https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR">STAR</a>, or a library for single-cell RNA-seq
analysis like <a href="https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/">scanpy</a> or
<a href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/">Seurat</a>. The main goal of software packages is
<strong>reusability</strong>, defined by the ability to reuse the code for multiple datasets
and for diverse goals of data analysis.</p>

<p>In contrast, <em>data analysis reports</em> mostly build upon existing software
packages and are specifically adapted to produce interpretable results for a
certain dataset. The main goal of data analysis reports is <strong>reproducibility</strong>,
defined by the ability to reproduce the results when run in another computing
environment or in a later time point than when the report was written.  Yet, it
can often make sense to abstract a data analysis report into a reusable pipeline
which can be applied to other datasets.</p>

<p>The first four hallmarks apply to both software packages and data analysis
reports. (In fact, they apply to pretty much any kind of software):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use version control (<a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>)</li>
  <li>Use automated testing and continuous integration (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub actions</a>)</li>
  <li>Containerize all dependencies (e.g. <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, <a href="https://sylabs.io/docs/">Singularity</a>)</li>
  <li>Write extensive, high-quality documentation (e.g. <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">sphinx</a>, <a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/">pkgdown</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to that, two more hallmarks apply to data analysis reports:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use automated reporting (e.g. <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">Rmarkdown</a>, <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a>)</li>
  <li>Use a workflow manager (e.g. <a href="https://www.nextflow.io/">nextflow</a>, <a href="https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Snakemake</a>)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="use-version-control">Use version control</h2>
<p><img src="https://grst.github.io/assets/bioinformatics/brick_vc.png" alt="vc"></p>

<p>The first, and arguably the most important hallmark is to use
<a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a><sup id="fnref:vc-systems"><a href="#fn:vc-systems">2</a></sup>. It keeps track of all your code
changes, and allows you to share your code on public repositories such as
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a><sup id="fnref:github"><a href="#fn:github">3</a></sup>. <strong>Making the code publicly available and
easy to be modified by others is the first step towards making your project both
discoverable and reproducible.</strong></p>

<p>There are many benefits of using git and GitHub, for instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You don’t need to worry about backups any more. Every version of your code you store in git can be restored at any time.</li>
  <li>It allows you to keep track of what you did (this is very useful when continuing on a project after several weeks of interruption).</li>
  <li>It allows you to synchronize changes across working environments (say laptop and server cluster) and between collaborators.</li>
  <li>GitHub provides an issue tracker and project management tools to keep track of bugs and suggestions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet, the most important aspect of using GitHub is to get people involved with your software. <br>
<strong>Communication is an essential part of the scientific process, and GitHub is the way to communicate about scientific 
software.</strong> It increases your visibility in the community and makes your software 
being discovered more easily. You can retrieve feedback in form of bug reports, feature
requests and code reviews. Others can directly contribute improvements in the form of
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull requests</a>. 
Finally, it enables you to browse other, well-engineered pieces of software and learn
from them by reading their code.</p>

<p><strong>Tool of choice:</strong> <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> in combination with <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>.</p>

<h2 id="use-automated-testing-and-continuous-integration">Use automated testing and continuous integration</h2>
<p><img src="https://grst.github.io/assets/bioinformatics/brick_testing.png" alt="testing"></p>

<p>Automated testing is an industry standard in software firms for <em>years</em>, but it
is terribly underused in most scientific software, particularly those developed
by single contributors such as students and contractors. Automated testing does
not only ensure that your software package works on other systems than yours or
that you don’t break old functionality while adding new one – <strong>it also
increases the likelihood that the results your software generates are actually
predictable, at least within the space of the input parameters that you can
test, and correct</strong>. The correctness of the software output is top priority for
scientific software.</p>

<p>The concept of automated testing is simple: for every piece of code you write,
you also write a <em>unit test</em> that calls the piece of code with some example
data, and validates that it produces the expected result.</p>

<p>Initially, this might seem like a waste of time, but it isn’t: it helps to to
<strong>find bugs early</strong>. As a result, it pays off and saves time in the long run.
Finding bugs early decreases the cost for fixing them. If you detect a bug
right after writing the function, you still have everything in your memory
and can likely fix it within minutes. If the bug is discovered by someone
else a few months later, it might take you hours or days to figure out the
problem, because you have to dig into the code again. There are excellent
packages for automated testing for virtually every programming language. The
most common ones are <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a> for Python
and <a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org/">testthat</a> for R. Moreover,
<a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Hypothesis</a> is a python
package implementing <a href="https://medium.com/criteo-labs/introduction-to-property-based-testing-f5236229d237">property-based
testing</a>,
which holds the promise to facilitate writing tests while covering a larger
set of test cases.</p>

<p>Writing tests by itself is not helpful if they are not executed on a regular
basis. This is where <em>continuous integration</em> comes into place. Continuous
integration runs your tests every time you upload your code on e.g. GitHub and
notifies you if the tests fail. By combining continuous integration with a
<a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">branch-and-pull-request
workflow</a>, you ensure that the
code on your master branch is always fully tested. You are notified when tests
fail, therefore increasing the chance to fix bugs early and quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Tools of choice</strong>: <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a> and
<a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Hypothesis</a> 
for Python packages, <a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org/">testthat</a> for R
packages. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</a> for continuous integration.</p>

<h2 id="containerize-dependencies">Containerize dependencies</h2>
<p><img src="https://grst.github.io/assets/bioinformatics/brick_container.png" alt="container"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>(Isaac Newton, 1675)</i></p>

<p>This is definitely true for scientific software. Most software packages and data
analyses would not be possible without giants like
<a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a>,
<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>, <a href="https://numpy.org/">numpy</a>,
<a href="https://www.scipy.org/">scipy</a> and many more domain-specific packages.
Unfortunately, complex dependencies make it hard to install and run your
software. They also hamper reproducibility of your analysis as different
versions might be incompatible or produce slightly different results. This
phenomenon is commonly referred to as the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency
hell</a>.</em></p>

<p>Therefore, it is vital to accurately declare all dependencies required for your
software to run, <strong>down to the exact version number</strong>.  The most reliable way of
doing so is to build a <em>container</em> with all software required to run your
software. That way, your package or analysis can be ran in exactly the same
software environment you have been using. Containers are one of the few ways to ensure
that your analysis can be ran in a few years from now<sup id="fnref:conda-reprod"><a href="#fn:conda-reprod">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>For software packages (as opposed to data analysis reports) it is also
appropriate to declare the dependencies in the format of the corresponding
package manager. This could be a <a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html">DESCRIPTION
file</a> for R, a <a href="https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dependencies.html">setup.py
file</a> for
python, or a <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#source-section">conda
recipe</a>.
Arguably, the best option is to offer both: properly declared dependencies and a
container.</p>

<p><strong>Tools of choice</strong>: <a href="https://sylabs.io/docs/">Singularity</a> and
<a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> for data analyses.
<a href="https://bioconda.github.io/">Bioconda</a> or
<a href="https://conda-forge.org/">conda-forge</a> for software packages.</p>

<h2 id="write-extensive-high-quality-documentation">Write extensive, high-quality documentation</h2>
<p><img src="https://grst.github.io/assets/bioinformatics/brick_docs.png" alt="docs"></p>

<p>Documentation is an essential part of each software. <strong>Without proper
documentation, the most elegant piece of software can be useless.</strong> As a rule of
thumb, the documentation should have at least as many lines as the source code.
Documentation helps users getting started with your software quickly and vastly
increases the potential userbase.</p>

<p>For software packages, good documentation consists, one the one hand, of a
documentation of the public interface (API). The API consists of all functions,
classes etc. which are exposed to the end user. The API documentation describes
the input parameters and results for each function.  On the other hand, the
documentation should comprise instructions on how to install the package and a
step-by-step tutorial teaching the user to apply the software to real-world
datasets.</p>

<p>For data analysis reports, it is best to mix the documentation with the code
(see <a href="#write-self-reporting-data-analyses">self-reporting analyses</a>). Moreover,
it is vital to provide step-by-step instructions on how to rerun the analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Tools of choice</strong>: <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">sphinx</a>
(Python/general purpose) and <a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/">pkgdown</a> for R.</p>

<h2 id="write-self-reporting-data-analyses">Write self-reporting data-analyses</h2>
<p><img src="https://grst.github.io/assets/bioinformatics/brick_reporting.png" alt="notebooks"></p>

<p>It is common practice to run a few commands in an R shell to produce a plot and
then copy and paste it to a PowerPoint presentation. <strong>This is not only terrible
from a reproducibility perspective, it is also inefficient and error-prone.</strong> It
is inefficient, because you have to re-do the plot manually if you change your
preprocessing or get new data. It is error-prone, because you’ll forget to
update all plots and old (wrong) versions keep floating around.</p>

<p>By using self-reporting …</p></article></div>

                    <p>Inferrd is built on proven technologies that allow us, as developers, to focus on making the experience great. You might think building a hosting platform is a lot of headaches, not anymore!</p><p>I have been wanting to build something similar to Inferrd for 2 years now, but I never had the tools to do so. That is until a few months ago.</p><p>Google recently announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Cloud Run</a>. It allows anyone to deploy containers in production really fast. The best part is the pricing: one only pays for the milliseconds that they use. The container becomes "alive" when a request comes in and "pauses" right after. From our experience, the cold starts are usually around 400ms.</p><h2 id="the-architecture">The Architecture</h2><p>In order to serve someone else's model we had to know for sure that the architecture would be robust and scalable. Reliability is our priority. </p><p>Today, Inferrd runs <em>misson-critical production workloads</em> flawlessly for customers, let's see how.</p><p>The architecture consists of 6 parts: </p><ul><li>The API (on Heroku)</li><li>The Front-End (on Netlify)</li><li>Cloud Run</li><li>Storage (Google Cloud Storage)</li><li>A Postgres Database (on Heroku)</li><li>A Redis Database (on Heroku)</li></ul><p>Here is a simplified schema of the full architecture (minus redis and postgres, which are in the Inferrd API box).</p><figure><img src="https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-5.59.22-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-5.59.22-PM.png 600w, https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-5.59.22-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-5.59.22-PM.png 1458w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Inferrd.com's Architecture</figcaption></figure><p>This architecture is great for a few reasons:</p><ul><li>Every part of it is either scalable or Serverless. 🚀</li><li>CloudRun isolates user's models so we don't have to.</li><li>It is very cheap to run. </li><li>It requires almost no maintenance.</li></ul><p>You might wonder, why do inference requests go through the API first, instead of going straight to Cloud Run. Well, it is a real pain to setup redirections through the Google API (the documentation is seriously laking). Moreover, this allows us to save metrics and logs about models without having to write custom code for every environment.</p><h2 id="environments">Environments</h2><p>Inferrd supports many environments out of the box:</p><ul><li>TensorFlow</li><li>Scikit</li><li>spaCy</li><li>Keras</li><li>others to come...</li></ul><p>We had to make it very easy to push new environments and update existing ones. Environments are basically a docker image with the most up to date version of the frameworks required and a Flask server.</p><p>Cloud Run takes those containers and instantiates them at scale behind a load balancer. That's it. Security and reliability is taking care off by Google Cloud.</p><h3 id="try-inferrd">Try Inferrd</h3><p>Did you enjoy this technical write up and would like to test Inferrd?

For example, 32 cents USD is one quarter, one nickel, and two pennies. </p></li><li><p>Calculating the number of ways you can add or subtract an array of values to reach a target number. </p></li><li><p>Calculating the optimum combination of items you can include in a knapsack by the knapsack’s weight capacity.</p></li></ul><p>Dynamic programming isn’t best for all problems. In many instances, dynamic programming just can’t help us in the improvement of the runtime of a problem. If your program isn’t performing repeated work, no amount of caching will make any difference.</p><p>If you’re very new to the concept of dynamic programming or have never even heard of it before, don't worry. All of these books on dynamic programming explain the idea in the simplest terms.</p><h2>Overview of the Criteria For the Best Books on Dynamic Programming</h2></div></div><div data-aspect-ratio="50.70422535211267" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594947342441_16112"><div>

It is an introductory book that focuses significantly on the basics of dynamic programming.</p><p>You may absorb more information when doing rather than merely reading. The teaching style of this book reflects this. The book provides many practice problems with explanations of all the techniques required to solve the problems.</p><p>As a bonus, the author's fluent style does an excellent job of igniting an avid interest in the subject.

That chapter also discusses its related concepts, such as optimal substructure and overlapping-sub problems. But, those books tend to lack complex examples showcasing dynamic programming in action.</p><p>Dynamic Programming for Coding Interviews takes a different approach. This book dedicates one chapter per concept under dynamic programming. While discussing the ideas, the author provides straightforward examples. This allows you to maintain focus on the chapter's concept.</p><p>Once the concept is clear to you, the author then shifts focus to complex problem-solving.</p><h3><strong>Book 4: <em>Algorithms Illuminated (Part 3): Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming</em></strong></h3></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594930016355_33881"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0999282948/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0999282948&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booksoncode-20&amp;linkId=7359407268ab91ff1863a8a453d2538e"><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=0999282948&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=booksoncode-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=booksoncode-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0999282948" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594930016355_33947"><div><p>Tim Roughgarden describes his <a href="https://amzn.to/3fN8sy8" target="_blank"><em>Algorithms Illuminated (Part 3): Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming</em></a> book as an “accessible, no-nonsense, and programming language-agnostic introduction to algorithms.”&nbsp;</p><p>The book includes hints and solutions …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

Me and Joanne in front of one of our four homemade Grommet backdrops that were featured in all of our early videos.</p></div>
<p>Late last month, my Grommet co-founder Joanne Domeniconi and I were fired. Our majority shareholder Ace Hardware made the call, as is their right. It happens when visions for a company diverge.</p>
<p>Joanne and I are sad to abandon our Citizen Commerce™ mission and not see Grommet through to becoming a household name. But we feel nothing but a great deal of pride when we reflect on the hundreds of careers we shaped, the more than 3,000 small businesses we accelerated, and the thousands of jobs we created. We grew to a meaningful scale: where we could legitimately move markets and create demand for previously unheard-of products and even create new product categories. No one had heard of brands like SodaStream, Fitbit, OtterBox, PopSockets, S’well, Bombas, SimpliSafe and Mrs. Meyers when we embraced and launched them.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news one Grommet maker wrote, “<em>I have said it so many times it must sound like a broken record, but what you created was pure magic</em>!”&nbsp; For a small business with an innovative product, breaking through in a crowded consumer world is excruciatingly difficult. Each Grommet we launched benefited handsomely from our reputation, credibility, and gaining access to our 4M followers.&nbsp; I always saw being chosen as a Grommet as cutting two years of struggle out of their path. Many awesome companies would have died on the vine if it were not for Grommet.</p>

<p>We employed hundreds of the best and brightest.&nbsp; One of the current team members said, “<em>The Grommet has made an impression on me in many ways in the three years since I joined. I’ve worked for a number of small companies now, and while most of their founders have had “hustle” to spare, I have not encountered&nbsp;anyone else with your commitment to&nbsp;values.&nbsp;I did not choose a career path which automatically involves helping others (doctor, nonprofit, etc.), so it has been a comfort to work for someone who steers the ship with moral conviction</em>.”</p>

<p>Lynda Applegate, a Harvard Business School professor, wrote a popular case on The Grommet. Out of the thousands of potential case study subjects at her disposal she chose Grommet because she said we were the kind of business that could uniquely thrive in a <strong>modern</strong> economy—with a groundbreaking approach to creating value for multiple parties. Here’s a small slice of what that means to me: I believe that each person in a company is sacred and capable of leadership. When individuals are <strong>truly</strong> engaged toward a common purpose, powerful gains can be delivered for customers, suppliers, society, and the planet. It is then that a great business–measured in revenue and profits–can also be a great company.&nbsp; I was not interested in one without the other. This is what Lynda recognized.</p>
<p>I also hope our Grommet alums will be brave on the innovation front. As one of our investors John Landry told me, “If you aren’t the lead dog you are just sniffing someone else’s butt.”&nbsp; We originated the use of video in e-commerce. We were the first company to assign societal/personal values to the products we sold. While corporations today are scrambling to show they “care” about products from minority or queer or veteran entrepreneurs, or from social enterprises, or about American made sourcing—moves that I wholeheartedly applaud—I take pride that we sourced all of our products according to those kind of values from Day One.</p>

<p>It seems so basic, but we built a company whose people and products you could trust implicitly. If retail were not a catastrophic race to the bottom, “trustworthiness” would not be a distinctive competitive asset–but it was at The Grommet. And it was measurable. While most e-commerce companies find that dissatisfied customers return 15-25% of what is bought, our customers only returned 3% of Grommets. And these are products from totally unknown small businesses. 3%!! This is because we curated carefully and only launched products worth buying, from people worth supporting.</p>

Our investors Bruce and Bridgett Evans, Jill Preotle, and Peter Lynch hosted a progressive dinner for our whole team to enjoy.</p></div>
<p>As a CEO, I am proud that we defied the odds and built a large-scale business, and shepherded it successfully through two financial crises and a global pandemic. We also defied the odds in attracting visionary angel investors like Peter Lynch and Jill Preotle–in a world where women founders get 2.7% of the funding from venture capitalists.&nbsp; We navigated not just one, but two, strategic investors over seven years.&nbsp; A public company CFO friend told me after the first investment (from the wonderful Rakuten) “<em>I have bought many companies. It never works for the founders. You won’t last six months.</em>” Ha!&nbsp; Joanne and I are not quitters. And we not only defied the odds in scaling the business, but also remained friends and partners throughout. We came into the venture together and there is poetry in the fact that we left Grommet the same way. Joanne and I were always a package deal.</p>
<p>I know this is kind of sappy, but I will think back at Grommet under our leadership as a form of “Camelot” for our team, our Makers and ourselves. My greatest hope is that Grommet alums will go on to use the lessons of how a business can both do good and do well. I know Grommet team members will be contributory to–and demanding of–their future employers when it comes to both ethical and executional standards. We all certainly learned a valuable lesson that one cannot simultaneously grow and harvest the same company–you have to pick a lane.</p>
<p><em>Sidebar: for some reason beyond my understanding, our amazing VP of Operations Jason McCarthy was also terminated. The company was on a fantastic 2020 trajectory with revenues up 50% over plan in May and 25% for the year. Jason was very, very central to that success—our business was extremely operationally intense. Jason is a dynamic leader whose teams will follow him anywhere. &nbsp;He was my go-to person for many things from brainstorming new initiatives to putting models and plans to an analytical or real-world test.&nbsp; At Grommet he had the broadest portfolio of responsibilities among all my reports, including Logistics, Inventory Planning, Account Management, Growth Services and Customer Support. &nbsp;He also founded and built our Wholesale business. &nbsp;Beyond all that he is a culture builder who earned deep respect and loyalty during his seven year+ tenure at Grommet, including mine of course. I will be very happy to introduce him to worthy employers and startup teams.</em></p>
<p>At the end of the day (and our run), while the future course of Grommet will not include its founders’ drive and hustle, or our moral and spiritual guidance, we are happy to have shown the way for individuals and companies to support small businesses, to celebrate&nbsp; the work of underrepresented entrepreneurs, to seek out quality products, and to honor trustworthy people.&nbsp; Grommet was the culmination of my life’s work—and Joanne’s. We share a deep satisfaction and priceless legacy with the many talented and committed individuals who made it all happen.&nbsp; I have no regrets. This is the simplest definition of success that I know.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>With the increasing popularity of Python web frameworks supporting asynchronous I/O like <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, <a href="https://www.starlette.io/">Starlette</a>, and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/releases/3.1">soon in Django 3.1</a>, there has been a growing demand for native async I/O support in the Python Elasticsearch client.&nbsp; Async I/O is exciting because your application can use system resources efficiently compared to a traditional multi-threaded application, which leads to better performance on I/O-heavy workloads, like when serving a web application. </p> <p>The wait is over! Native async / await support is now available in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/index.html">version 7.8.0 of the package</a>, alongside support for all the shiny new Elasticsearch 7.8 APIs. To follow along with the below examples you’ll need Python 3.6 or later installed locally and an Elasticsearch 7.x cluster running. </p> <p><strong><h2>Installing and using the Elasticsearch Python client</h2></strong></p><p>Install the package using the <code>[async]</code> extra to install an additional dependency, <a href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/">Aiohttp</a>, which is used to make HTTP requests to your Elasticsearch instances: </p> <pre>$ python -m pip install elasticsearch[async] </pre> <p>After being successfully installed, you can now access an async native Elasticsearch client from Python.&nbsp; </p> <p>To show async in action, I’ll demonstrate&nbsp;using <a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a> since an event loop is available right away, allowing me to call <code>await</code> from the REPL.

July 16, 2020 | https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
        css-media-vars adds several --custom-css-variables, all namespaced with "--media-" and based on media queries, onto the HTML tag. These vars act as universal mixins for your CSS values. If the media query is true, your value will be used. If it's false, the var(..., fallback) will be used.</p><p>
        
        For example, there are several named breakpoints that respond to the width of the screen, such as <code>--media-lte-sm</code>.</p><p>
        
        In your CSS, if you want a value to only apply when the screen is less than or equal to the "small" breakpoint range, you mix it into your value:<br>
        <code>--my-small-value: var(--media-lte-sm) 2px;</code><br>
        From this point, you can use your variable anywhere and it will only be "2px" if the media query is true. Else, it uses the fallback you provide, like so:<br>
        <code>border: var(--my-small-value, 15px) solid green;</code><br>
        <img src="https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/suchborder.gif" alt="Border changing size at 900px breakpoint"><br>
        Here's a link to the jsbin pictured in the gif: <a href="https://jsbin.com/giqedowale/edit?css,output">https://jsbin.com/giqedowale/edit?css,output</a></p><p>
        
        If you need multiple break points, all you have to do is mix a different breakpoint into another variable and use it in the first fallback:<br>
        <code>
          --my-small-value: var(--media-lte-sm) 2px;<br>
          --my-medium-value: var(--media-md) 15px;<br>
          border: var(--my-small-value, var(--my-medium-value, 30px)) solid green;<br>
        </code><br>
        In this case, because the small values are listed first, this approach is <b>mobile-first</b>! CSS Variables don't compile the fallback unless it's used (similar to the expected short-circuting of conditionals in JavaScript).</p><p>
        
        This is all vanilla CSS. No JS or build step is necessary.<br>
        The library is small and built on a CSS trick called "Space Toggle" discovered in the development of <a href="http://augmented-ui.com/">augmented-ui</a>. You can read more about Space Toggle in these tweets which contain links to JSBins you can explore further with:<br>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/James0x57/status/1283596399196680192">Second Tweet, a simple demo</a><br>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/James0x57/status/1282303255826046977">First Tweet, an advanced demo</a></p><p>
        
        Browser support for CSS Variables is currently 94% globally according to <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables">caniuse</a>.<br>
        Each of the --media-* vars are using the actual media query in CSS to switch them to the "true" state. Browser support depends on the feature but will always behave as if it's "false" if the media query isn't supported in the user's browser, such as <code>--media-prefers-light</code> which only recently gained traction.

<p>Usually I set up sites on VPS services like <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-with-lamp-on-ubuntu-18-04">DigitalOcean</a>, but wanted to get better at producing quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">minimum viable</a> proof of concepts. This will mean I focus on creating value, in this case content, instead of having to spend time on <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/resource-center/tutorials/building-your-first-website/">one hundred and one other things</a>.</p>



<p>In this instance I’ve chosen WordPress’s $48/year plan, as I’m used to the platform and willing to forego some of the niceties I’m used to like <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/tips-tricks/how-to-connect-to-your-website-via-ssh-and-why-youd-want-to">full control of the machine with SSH access</a>, FTP to upload custom files, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/24-must-have-wordpress-plugins-for-business-websites/">plugins</a> and additional custom software.</p>



<p>I didn’t expect however that I’d be prevented from making minor adjustments to my site like changing the header colour, centring the site title, changing link colours or fixing spacing.</p>



<p>WordPress also prevent you from removing their “powered by WordPress” advert at the bottom of your site. Although I mind that less because it’s a generally good platform and I’d like to encourage other people to share things they learn, with WordPress remaining a great platform to start doing so.</p>



<p>Just don’t expect much control over how individual things look, or be ready to pay for their $300/year business plan to do so.</p>

                <p>Let’s talk tax! Taxes aren’t the most interesting of topics, but as a mass
exodus from San Francisco begins in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are
a whole bunch of people working at Silicon Valley tech companies who are going
to have to start dealing with them in much more depth.</p>

<p>In general, people expect that taxes will be complicated in the year that they
move. However, if you’re being granted equity, as most Silicon Valley employees
are, you might be surprised to discover that they will be complicated for much
longer.</p>

<p>If you choose to move internationally, rather than just interstate, this counts
for double. My partner and I — neither of us US citizens — moved from San
Francisco to Sydney three years ago, and have spent the last few years figuring
out our tax situation. We struggled a lot to find good guidance on any of this
online, so I’m going to take the time to document what we learned in a few
posts, so that I can make the path more well-trodden for the next person.</p>

<p>Although I’ve spent a lot of time learning about this, I’m not a tax
professional. If any of it sounds wrong to you, or if you have your own story to
share, please <a href="mailto:hello@karla.io">reach out</a>!</p>

<h3 id="trailing-tax-liabilities">📆Trailing tax liabilities</h3>
<p>Income taxes sound like they should be simple: at the end of a tax year, you pay
a percentage of the amount that you earned that year to the relevant tax agency.
In some countries, your employer collects these taxes as you earn them
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-as-you-earn_tax">PAYE/PAYG</a>), and you need
to think about them even less.</p>

<p>Equity complicates this situation. When you’re granted equity, you’re being
promised something of value. There’s a problem though: that equity might not yet
be liquid — it could have a vesting schedule, you might not have exercised it,
it could be in a private company… and if it’s not liquid, you probably
shouldn’t have to pay anything when it’s given to you. Many tax jurisdictions
handle this by choosing to tax you at a later point: rather than when the equity
is granted, instead taxing you when it vests, is exercised (in the case of
options), or is sold.</p>

<p>However, imagine you move tax jurisdictions between the date where you’re given
the equity, and the date on which you actually pay tax. The first jurisdiction
now has a problem: in their eyes, you earned that equity while you lived there,
and they only gave you a free pass on immediately paying tax on it through the
goodness of their hearts. When you eventually pay tax in the second tax
jurisdiction, they want a piece of that too.</p>

<p>This is a trailing tax liability.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, any time that you’re granted equity in one jurisdiction, but
only trigger a taxation event on it in another, the first jurisdiction is likely
to say that they also have taxation rights.</p>

<p>That first jurisdiction is said to have “source” taxation rights, because that’s
where the asset was sourced, while the second is said to have “residency”
taxation rights, i.e. the right to tax you because you are presently a resident.</p>

<h3 id="apportioning-income">💰Apportioning income</h3>
<p>Now presumably, if you worked in both jurisdictions between the point where you
were given the equity, and the point at which you pay tax, there’s some
percentage that each should be considered the source of.</p>

<p>Internationally, this apportionment is governed by pairwise tax treaties between
countries. These are typically based on the
<a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2017_mtc_cond-2017-en#page28">OECD model tax convention</a>,
which helpfully has an in-depth commentary on this exact point
(<a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2017_mtc_cond-2017-en#page329">Commentary on Article 15, 12.14</a>).
In short, unless otherwise agreed between two countries, income is allocated
based on the percentage of <em>workdays</em> spent in each jurisdiction, from the day
the equity was granted, to the day that it vested. Note that this percentage
will differ for each tranche, or part of a grant, that vests on a different day.</p>

<p>However, those treaties only apply at the country to country level, i.e. for
taxes levied federally. In addition to imposing federal taxes, the US also has
state taxes, and these are not governed by international tax treaties.</p>

<p>That allows states to take a different view of how to decide whether income
belongs to them, and in fact, they do. For restricted stock, California takes
the same view as the tax treaty, and considers the period from grant to
vest. However, for someone granted options in California, who is a non-resident
when they exercise those options, the source is calculated by the percentage of
workdays spent in California from grant to <em>exercise</em>, rather than to vest (per
the <a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/misc/1004.html">Equity-Based Compensation Guidelines</a>).</p>

<h3 id="residency-taxation">🏠Residency taxation</h3>
<p>But the tax doesn’t stop there! In addition to the source jurisdiction taxing
you for the percentage they believe is theirs, the jurisdiction in which you are
currently a resident will also want to tax you, typically on 100% of the
income you earn from an asset. This can lead to double taxation: residency
taxation means you need to pay tax on 100% of the income to your current tax
jurisdiction, but you also need to pay tax on some percentage of the income
(potentially up to 100% again) to the source jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Many tax agencies provide relief against this situation, in the form of tax
credits: if you’ve already had to pay tax in one location for the same event,
they won’t charge you again.</p>

<h3 id="worked-example">📔Worked example</h3>
<p>That’s a lot to take in, so let’s work through an example:</p>

<p>Let’s assume you were granted 1,000 non-qualified stock options (NSOs) with a
strike price of $1.00, on 2018-07-01, while a tax resident of California.
The options vest once a year for the next four years, in four equal tranches of
250.</p>

<p>(If you’re not familiar with options, an NSO gives you the right to purchase a
given company’s stock at a given price, regardless of its current market value.
In this case, the option would be valuable if the company’s stock price rose
above $1.00, because you could exercise your right to pay the company $1.00 for
a share, and then immediately sell that share at its market value, taking the
difference as a profit, and consequently, as income.)</p>

<p>About a year and a half later, on 2020-03-01, you move from California to
Melbourne, Australia. We can figure out the source of each of those tranches
like so:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>

<p>Internationally, these percentages apply regardless of when you choose to
exercise those options, provided you do so after the date you move to Australia.
However, those options are also subject to taxation within California, and as
we’ve mentioned, the tax agency there believes in a different source percentage
scheme.</p>

<p>Let’s say that you don’t touch that equity until three years after your move,
on 2023-03-01, when you choose to exercise it all.</p>

<p>If we assume that once exercised, but not prior, your options become liquid
shares, you’ll be taxed by each of the US federally, California, and Australia
on the day you exercise. Taking just the 2020-07-01 tranche into consideration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’ll be taxed on 83% of the income in the US,</li>
  <li>you’ll be taxed on 36% of the income in California, and</li>
  <li>you’ll be taxed on 100% of the income in Australia, which has residency
 taxation rights. However, you’ll be able to get tax credits for tax paid
 in the US federally on the 83% of the income considered to be foreign-sourced.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that despite having lived outside of the US and California for 3
years on the date of exercise, you’ll still need to declare US and Californian
income, and pay tax in those jurisdictions. If you’d moved interstate within the
US, you’d still be filing federal returns regardless, but you’d also be required
to file a Californian return that year.</p>

<h3 id="gotchas">🔎Gotchas</h3>
<p>Note that there’s a big gotcha in the worked example above: you only got to
claim tax credits in Australia for the 83% income that the US taxed federally,
but not for the 36% that California taxed.</p>

<p>That’s because, as previously mentioned, the tax treaties only operate between
pairs of countries, not between one country and a state in the other. This
means it’s quite possible that you won’t be able to get tax credits for taxes
paid to a state of another country, and will end up double taxed on part of your
income.</p>

<p>For the worked example, Australia specifically
<a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/pdf/pbr/it2507.pdf">does consider Californian taxes to be a part of the US income tax system</a>,
so you would in actuality be allowed to claim credits for taxes paid there,
though the same isn’t true in all other countries.</p>

<h3 id="investments">📈Investments</h3>
<p>You might wonder what happens when you eventually sell the shares you get as
a result of exercising – will those also be subject to US or Californian
taxes? While I don’t have personal experience with this situation, the OECD
tax treaty commentary clarifies this point in
(<a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2017_mtc_cond-2017-en#page326">Article 15, 12.2</a>):
only the income effectively connected to your employment is taxable in the
source jurisdiction. Since exercising is considered to be an investment
decision, any increase in value of the share resulting from the exercise of an
option is considered to be a capital gain, and is therefore <em>not</em> taxable by the
source jurisdiction. Helpfully, this is also California’s interpretation, giving
us some much-needed consistency between what happens internationally and within
California.</p>

<p>If instead you had chosen to exercise prior to moving, the OECD commentary
states that when you moved the asset would be treated as being capital in
nature, and so would only be taxable in your jurisdiction of residence at sale.
However, several countries, including the US …</p></div></section></article></div></section></section></div>
