It's believed to be more contagious than the original coronavirus strain.</p>  <p>"We know that if not controlled, it becomes a predominant strain within weeks of first appearance," Fitzgerald said. "This is concerning and serious. But we have the ability to overcome it."</p>  <p>Effective immediately, the entire province is at Alert Level 5, with all but essential businesses closed, Fitzgerald announced.</p>  <p>The decision expands&nbsp;previous measures implemented in the St. John's area this week, returning Newfoundland and Labrador to the same rules it followed for weeks last spring.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5912464.1613155105!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/covid-testing-mundy-pond-blizzard.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5912464.1613155105!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/covid-testing-mundy-pond-blizzard.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5912464.1613155105!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/covid-testing-mundy-pond-blizzard.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5912464.1613155105!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/covid-testing-mundy-pond-blizzard.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5912464.1613155105!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/covid-testing-mundy-pond-blizzard.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5912464.1613155105!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/covid-testing-mundy-pond-blizzard.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>COVID-19 testing has spiked this week as Newfoundland and Labrador reports record daily cases.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Lisa Warren)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Nine more cases have been added to the active total since the afternoon briefing, Fitzgerald said.

Other provinces are battling the mutation, with experts in Ontario warning B117 could become the dominant strain there before April.</p>  <p>Due to the variant's contagious nature, Fitzgerald said the speed of isolation measures is critical to contain it.</p>  <p>Residents are now expected to remain inside their own homes as much as possible and restrict gatherings to no more than five people.</p>  <p>All non-essential businesses and facilities, including playgrounds, gyms, salons, cinemas, restaurants, bars, private health-care clinics, and retail stores that do not provide the essentials of life, are now closed.</p>  <p>Elective surgery and non-emergent medical treatments are&nbsp;also suspended.</p>  <p><em><strong>Watch the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador briefing:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e68GaBbp81c" frameborder="no" title="YouTube content" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></span></p>  <p>"At this point, stay in your bubble," Fitzgerald said, simplifying&nbsp;the strict public health directions that Newfoundlanders and Labradorians haven't faced since last May.</p>  <p>"We're back here for a little while.

"The election will now shift exclusively to voting by mail."</p>  <p>The deadline to apply for mail-in special ballots has been extended to Feb. 15.

When he dropped the writ in January, the province had a steadily low caseload.</p>  <p>As the outbreak worsened this week, Furey repeatedly defended his election timing.</p>  <p>"I haven't given much thought to the election," Furey said Friday evening, prior to Chaulk's announcement and just as news broke of B117's arrival. "I understand there are questions about the election … but we don't have the answers."</p>  <h2>Accountability ahead: opponents</h2>  <p>Fitzgerald said she has spoken with the province's chief electoral officer&nbsp;but would not disclose the advice she gave him when pressed during the briefing, saying it's not her jurisdiction.</p>  <p>Furey's opponents had been calling for an election delay this week&nbsp;and applauded the decision to move to special ballots. NDP Leader Alison Coffin expressed concern, however, that some people may face barriers&nbsp;in registering for mail-in voting by Monday.</p>  <p>"We may see some court challenges come from this," Coffin said. "What I'm more concerned about is how irresponsible Andrew Furey's actions were."</p>  <p>Progressive Conservative Leader Ches Crosbie declined an interview&nbsp;but said in a statement his party would discuss Furey's election timing "another day," saying the public health emergency is the&nbsp;priority.</p>  <p>"Our province deserves a thoughtful conversation about why it took so long for us to reach the right decision in postponing this election and how we hold our political leaders accountable," the statement read.</p>    <p>Earlier on Friday, officials reported 50 new cases of COVID-19, with the vast majority in the St. John's metro region. The province has reported&nbsp;higher-than-average new cases since Monday, when rampant community spread was first identified.</p>  <p>Thousands of people are now in isolation, including 300 health-care workers.</p>  <p><em><strong><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador">Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador</a></strong></em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

I’m not diabetic or even prediabetic. But when I stumbled on the chance to wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) as part of a challenge partnered with Levels, I jumped on it. I’ve been conscious of blood sugar my whole life because I suffered from spells of hypoglycemia as a child.</span></p><p><span>Hypoglycemia is when your blood sugar drops below 70mg/dL. I still don’t know why it happened, but it wasn’t fun. When my glucose levels dropped too low, I’d experience cold sweats, lightheadedness, trembling hands, and an elevated heart rate. These symptoms were likely the result of my body releasing epinephrine (adrenaline) to stabilize my blood glucose.</span></p><p><span>Over the years, I started to pick up on which foods caused my blood sugar to crash. The biggest culprits were cereal for breakfast and sweet tea later in the day. Every time I ate a big bowl of cereal before school (usually Frosted Mini-Wheats or Honey Nut Cheerios), I would crash around 10:30 a.m. like clockwork. Sometimes the crashes were so bad that I thought I might pass out, so I’d call my mom to check me out of school.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture.jpg 512w" data-sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture.jpg 512w"></p><p><span>Experiencing low blood sugar not only made it hard to focus but was, quite frankly, a scary experience for someone who didn’t understand what was going on. After missing a few classes from these episodes, my mom decided it was time to change my diet.</span></p><p><span>I went from eating cereal in the mornings to eggs, bacon, and fruit (berries or avocado) and cut out the sweet tea (tough to do for a boy raised in Alabama). Once I made those changes, the crashes stopped, and I had energy throughout the day.</span></p><p><span>At the time, I didn’t fully understand why the switch worked, but I did understand even at a young age that consuming a bunch of carbs and sugar wasn’t good for me. Since then, I’ve become fascinated with maintaining a healthy lifestyle and finding ways to improve my health. My curiosity for seeking ways to optimize my diet is what eventually led me to put a CGM on my arm.</span></p><h2>The Challenge</h2><p><span>I first learned about the 28-day </span><a href="https://www.wearablechallenge.com/"><span>Wearable Challenge</span></a><span> from following </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jwmares"><span>Justin Mares</span></a><span> on Twitter. I’ve followed Justin for quite a while since he knew a lot about the health-and-wellness space after founding two health food companies, </span><a href="https://www.kettleandfire.com/"><span>Kettle &amp; Fire</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://perfectketo.com/"><span>Perfect Keto</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In October, Justin shared an </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jwmares/status/1315696415213936641"><span>interesting tweet</span></a><span> about a weight-loss challenge that only required participants to track their blood glucose with a </span><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/"><span>Levels</span></a><span> CGM. After reading the tweet, I knew this was something I had to try. Even though the challenge focused on weight loss, I enrolled immediately because I wanted to experiment with a CGM to see how my body reacts to my diet.</span></p><p><span>The challenge required me to keep my glucose levels below 120mg/dL even after a meal. For every day I went over, I’d lose $25 (talk about having skin in the game). The challenge started with a three-day grace period, so I could experiment with my diet to see how it impacted my glucose without getting penalized.</span></p><p><span>(For context, according to the</span><a href="https://www.idf.org/component/attachments/attachments.html?id=728&amp;task=download"> <span>International Diabetes Federation (IDF) guidelines</span></a><span>, your glucose values are “normal” if they stay below 140mg/dL after meals and return to pre-meal levels within two to three hours. Since this is a challenge geared towards weight loss, the upper limit was set slightly lower.)</span></p><p><b>Related article: </b><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/what-should-my-glucose-levels-be-ultimate-guide"><b>What should your glucose levels be? Here’s the ultimate guide to healthy blood sugar ranges</b></a></p><p><span>To help stay in the target range, each member of the challenge had access to a WhatsApp group chat to support each other. The group chat was a place for members to share what diet was working well, vent their frustrations when they failed, and provide a positive environment for motivation and encouragement. This aspect was less useful for me (I ended up muting it after a few days) because my goals were different. Still, I could see how much other members appreciated the accountability and support.</span></p><h2>What I Learned</h2><p><span>Overall, I found the challenge to be a learning experience filled with joyful moments of self-confirmation, times of utter disappointment, and a few surprises in between.</span></p><h3>The Good</h3><p><span>The best news was discovering that my typical breakfast of three eggs, bacon, and half an avocado drizzled in olive oil caused almost no glycemic response, nor did my afternoon snack of raw almonds. The app showed that these foods consistently hit a perfect score. Since I eat these foods most often, it was comforting knowing that I had a strong foundation.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png" alt="" width="400" height="600" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-267x400.png 267w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-133x200.png 133w" data-sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-267x400.png 267w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-133x200.png 133w"></p><p><span>The challenge also confirmed my belief that eating a low-carb paleo/keto-inspired diet consisting of mostly meat, vegetables, and healthy fats (olive oil, coconut oil, and butter/ghee) was optimal for maintaining consistent glucose levels.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-140x200.png 140w"></p><p><span>Over the past four years, I’ve made a conscious effort to cook meals that avoid simple carbs, vegetable oils, and sweeteners, and it felt really good knowing I’d been making the right choices.</span></p><h3>The Not-So-Good</h3><p><span>The foods with the most considerable impact on my blood sugar were white rice and craft beer, although I can’t say I was surprised. Unfortunately, I love both of these things (so long Chipotle burrito bowls). It was disappointing to finally have to stare down the truth instead of continuing to live in willful ignorance.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-140x200.png 140w"></p><p><span>I was also disappointed to learn how much sweet potato spikes my blood sugar. I knew sweet potatoes had a lower </span><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods"><span>glycemic index (GI)</span></a><span> than regular potatoes, but they still pushed me over the limit. I plan to keep them in my diet but will be more conscious about how often I eat them.</span></p><h3>The Surprising</h3><p><span>The biggest surprise of the challenge was discovering that quality tequila (G4 Reposado) had almost no effect on my blood sugar. Tequila that is 100% agave has zero carbs because of the distillation process (an average craft IPA has around 13g of carbs). Since beer is my usual go-to if I want a drink, I was happy to learn there was a healthier substitute I already enjoyed.</span></p><p><span>I also recognize I need to be careful here. Just because I didn’t experience a glucose spike doesn’t mean I didn’t have a biological response. </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/85/6/1545/4632987"><span>Research suggests</span></a><span> that alcohol decreases the liver’s ability to make new glucose, so it can trigger hypoglycemia, especially if you’re fasting or in a ketogenic state.</span></p><p><b>Related article: </b><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/alcohol-and-metabolic-fitness"><b>What does alcohol do to my glucose levels?</b></a></p><p><span>Another big surprise was discovering that my glucose levels aren’t just impacted by <em>what</em> I eat but also <em>when</em> I eat. I confirmed this because I meal prep twice a week to save time by eating the same meal multiple days in a row. (You may find that boring; I find it efficient.)</span></p><p><span>Eating the same thing for lunch and dinner on several challenge days was great for understanding how my body responds to food at different times of the day. All else being equal, my glucose spikes more after dinner than it does for lunch—sometimes by as much as 20mg/dL!</span></p><p><span>Even more surprising was noticing how little change there was from eating the same meal from day to day, but then having a large variance between lunch and dinner. I’m sure there’s a reason why, but I couldn’t tease a convincing explanation out of the data.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-140x200.png 140w"></p><h2>What’s Changed</h2><p><span>Since the challenge ended, I’ve made a few adjustments to my diet. I’m not one to make radical changes (like cutting out a particular food from my diet forever), but now I’m more careful when I still want to splurge. Here are some of the changes I’ve made:</span></p><ul><li aria-level="1"><span>If I’m going to drink, I opt for quality spirits (neat or on the rocks) over craft beer or cocktails loaded with sugar.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I’ve reconsidered the idea of a cheat day. I still plan on enjoying the occasional night of pizza and beer or tacos and margaritas, but a cheat day isn’t just a day. Now that I’m aware that the effects of an unhealthy meal can last for 2-3 days, I better make sure that the meal is worth it.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I need to avoid any sweetened beverage, no matter how “healthy.”&nbsp; Smoothies, sweetened kombucha, and sweetened coffee wrecked my glucose levels, even though they’re often touted as healthy choices. Better to eat my sweets after a hearty meal than to drink them.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I’m now more conscious of what I order when I eat out. For example, I opt for the salad at Chipotle instead of the burrito bowl. I’ve also switched to eating more sashimi instead of sushi to avoid eating as much rice.</span></li></ul><p><span>Even though the challenge only lasted 28 days, I learned more about my diet and lifestyle in those four weeks than I had from any previous blood test or book on dieting.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><img src="https://crystal-lang.org/assets/media/crystal_logo.svg" alt="Crystal Logo"></p>
<p>It's been more than three years since I've been hooked into Crystal Lang. For
those who don't know, Crystal promises to be able to write high-level code,
borrowing syntax from Ruby while adding strongly-typed yet inferred parameters
and avoiding the null exception problem. It also provides a complete and powerful <em>stdlib</em> and uses concepts from new generation languages like Go Lang. </p>
<p>Oh, and a powerful on-compile time macro system making runtime reflection obsolete! </p>
<p>Did it fulfill its promises? Yes. At some costs.</p>
<p>I started developing in Crystal Lang out of curiosity and pleasure, as I thought
this is a fun language to work with. 
Then I challenged myself to see what I was able to write, and it ended up with <em><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anykeyh/clear">Clear</a></em>, an ORM I've built from scratch.</p>
<p>Eventually, I started working on a booking platform. Getting free hands on the technical side, I decided to design the backend in Crystal. </p>
<p>Nine months later and an app finished, I can give some insight about using Crystal in a professional environment; the <strong>good</strong>, the <strong>bad</strong>, and the <strong>ugly</strong>, and how to develop an app in a language that is still considered confidential and in a pre-release state.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The good</h2>
<p>Crystal kept its promise in being a very expressive language. It allowed me to
write clean high-level business code, allowing to lower the gap between clients
requirement and code syntax. Big <em>oui</em> here!</p>
<pre><code>
post <span>"/contact_us"</span> <span>do</span> <span>|env|</span>
  form = ContactUsForm.from_json(env.request.body.not_nil!)
  Mail.deliver ContactUsEmail.new(form.email, form.title, form.message)
<span>end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The customer had some very complex rules when bookings were moved or canceled,
and I was aware that two teams of developers had given up on this project prior
to my work. </p>
<p>I decided to go for a Controller - Business Logic - Model 3-tier on
the backend and keep the View and Presentation on the frontend (using Typescript
and MithrilJS). </p>
<p>Because Crystal is strongly typed, the work to be done on spec
and coverage of the code is strongly reduced, in comparison to a Ruby or Python
code. </p>
<p>80% of the bugs occurring in those script languages have their root cause
laying in lose parameter type or nullable type. Both cases are covered at
compile time in Crystal. Basically, I wrote only 120 test cases on this
application, covering the different business cases of the user. In Ruby, for an
application of this scale, I would be around 250 to 400 tests.</p>
<p>At release, the application faced very few bugs. 
Some edges case we forgot with the client were failing. But so far, the compiler did an excellent job in preventing most of the bugs. </p>
<p>Because the language is compiled, it is wonderful to use within a Kubernetes cluster: The app starts in less than 200ms, allowing horizontal scaling, health-check and automatic restart of the app much more convenient than a big Rails application. </p>
<p>Memory usage is relatively low, peeking to ~250Mb and I never experienced any memory leak whatsoever. </p>
<p>And it runs fast. Really fast. For those who used to work with Rails, Django, or Laravel,
we are comparing snails with a cheetah there. </p>
<p>Actually, it runs so fast that I decided to do some complex data aggregation and transformation directly in Crystal instead of PostgreSQL.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2>
<p>The major challenge I faced in keeping a good pace and being productive was the
compilation time. It takes around 20 seconds to compile/run spec on my i7 8750H.
We are talking of an app with ~9000 LOC, few shards (library), for a grand total
of probably less than 100k LOC. This compilation time is mostly due to the very
dynamic nature of Crystal lang, the work needed to be done at
compile-time  (<em> macro and type inference being the culprits </em>) , and the lack of
incremental compilation at the time of writing this article. 20 seconds seems
not much, but during a whole working day, it builds-up leading to a
non-negligible loss of productivity. For the defense of the language, the
problem is also at the developer level: it is just enough to lose focus, browse
few tabs on Reddit, check a video on Youtube, and can - too often! -  snowball
to minutes or more. Guilty I am!</p>
<p>Another challenge was the usage of the young library ecosystem. The language is
still confidential and some shards  (the name which is given to libraries in the Crystal
world) are not working with the latest version of Crystal, or lack of support,
as some authors just gave up on the language or have little to no time to
maintain them. 
I can't complain, as I am too responsible for this, as I gave little maintenance the last months over <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anykeyh/clear">Clear ORM</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-ugly">The ugly?</h2>
<p>During development, I faced a few but worrying bugs, where the compiler was
literally crashing without any idea of where the problem came from. It also
happens that using some complex features of the language, like inheriting from
generic classes could lead to segfault during execution after a while. Issues
were raised and the Crystal Lang team fixed everything on short notice.</p>
<p>Since now, I'm not able to build the backend using <code>--release</code> flag due to
segfault at compile time. 
This is not a problem <em>per se</em>, as even without the optimization, the backend spends like 90% of its time waiting for PostgreSQL. </p>
<p>I still get a random crash of the application I gave up fixing for now.
Basically, the app can't access anymore to the PostgreSQL database after a
while.
This occurs on average between 3 to 30 days of running; I defined an
<code>/healthcheck</code> endpoint throwing a simple <code>SELECT 1</code>; to check the connection, called each second by Kubernetes.</p>
<p>With multiple pods redundancy, and thanks to low
memory foot-print and quick start-up time, pods defaulted got evicted and
recreated in a matter of seconds.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>If I did this app using Rails, would have I been more productive?</strong></p>
<p>It's hard to say, as I spent quite a lot of time debugging, improving, and
maintaining Clear ORM within the scope of this project. I think the
productivity difference would have been negligible.</p>
<p>What you would win by having a strict compiler avoiding your hours of debugging 
and specs definition, you lose by the compile-time, the need to rewrite some 
basic functionality you could get via gems. </p>
<p><strong>Would I recommend people using Crystal?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are aware that something might break, as the ecosystem is still young.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoiding monolithic application patterns will certainly reduce the compile-time
problems. Having micro-service architecture is a must-have if you want to
develop with Crystal, as each service will take much less time to compile, test
and deploy. </p>
<p>The low memory footprint and fast execution time fit perfectly with
this architecture. If you come from the Ruby world, you will feel at ease with
the syntax but will have to learn new design patterns of face issues with
compile-time or overly complex macro/code.
A common mistake is to try to use open hash, JSON, or collection to realize too late that strongly typed language doesn't like open structures</p>
<p><strong>Compared to Go Lang or Rust, how do Crystal fits?</strong> </p>
<p>Go Lang is very dull and <em>feels</em> austere in my opinion. It's not a bad
technology, but it feels not enough magical for my personal taste.
Rust is great but it remains less elegant to write business code with it. 
The magic Rust does with the memory still adds a burden in terms of readability,
with reference, lifecycle, and other symbols polluting the essence of the code
in my opinion. </p>
<p>Knowing that the Crystal Lang team is aware of most of the
problems above and working hard to release the v1.0 of the language, I'm
confident the language will know a bright future and all the traction it merits.</p>

			<p>Note: <em>I wrote a quite complete article on the Zen but for some reason it went down in seo history. I am tired seeing people write ‘in-depth’ article with commentaries from the top of their head and materials they pulled out of their pockets. I’m publishing the article in here.  The commentary part is built from the sayings of Brett Cannon, Guido, Chris Angelico, Nick Coghlan, Raymond Hettinger &amp; co. Warning: read only if you are a fan of Python. Last notes: I do hope learners will get a great glimpse of how the Zen can help them structure their code and give them better insight and foresight. It’s a documentation  of how practically the Zen is applied in Python decisions.</em></p>

<li>Authentic Commentary</li>
</ul>
<p>The Zen of Python saw light for the first time in 1999. It’s one of the many aspects that adds to the awesomeness of Python. It’s a set of expressions which corners the spirit of the language. It was enounced by Tim Peters, a reputable software engineer, master Pythonista and Python’s ‘most prolific and tenacious core developer’ in the words of none other than Guido [18]. This article bases itself mostly on the saying of core devs and highly reputable members. It makes a great gift to all those interested in the history of the sysadmin script which took the world by (pleasent) surprise.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598545343242-89b4c263a343?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=750&amp;q=80" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></p>

<p>The way the Zen came about was unique. It was a reflection from the unknown Patrick Phalen about the Python feel [1]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  … the more I use<br>
  and learn about the language, the more I find myself appreciating the<br>
  nice balance and heft Guido gave to it. Yet there doesn’t seem to be a<br>
  single document that sums up that “aesthetic,” but rather it<br>
  tends to appear piecemeal, over time, mostly in the Wisdom of Chairman Tim.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It was a call to infuse the Python spirit into aliens from Perl Land and beyond. It requested some 10 to 20 lines which sums up the Python view</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Would both Guido and TIm Peters be willing to collaborate on a short<br>
  paper — call it “The Python Way” for lack of a better title — which<br>
  sets out the 10-20 prescriptives they might offer to those who come to<br>
  Python from other languages and immediately want to find a way to bend<br>
  it into uncomfortable positions — (implement closures, etc.).
</p></blockquote>
<p>It was a request to prevent Pythonistas from falling into the error of campaigning for changing the language. It advocated for imbuing yourself with the language’s flow and change your ways and views instead of the other way round. In the original mail, it quoted Fredrik Lundh as saying “sure looks like the ‘community’ thinks that changing the<br>
language is more important that using it…” [5]. Patrick clarifies:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What I have in mind is sort of a very brief Strunk-&amp;-White-like<br>
  “Elements of Style” for Python, which suggests fundamental idiomatic<br>
  recommendations for operating within the spirit of the language. A<br>
  distillation of Python Zen is what I’m talking about — something to go<br>
  off and contemplate when the “fix Python now” decibels become a bit<br>
  much.
</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555573989-14a9017746c3?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=749&amp;q=80" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></p>

<p>The Zen school lays out hints and guidelines. You understand by your own exercise and by the company of someone seasoned in the craft</p>
<blockquote><p>
  it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through spiritual practice and interaction with an accomplished teacher or Master.[2]
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Zen was a request to help Python people achieve the Python state of mind so that your code resonates well with the structure behind, conveying in the process the associated beauty, elegance and finesse. Those guidelines if well impregnated would make your code revered whithin the circle of true monks.</p>
<p>But, curiously enough, Tim tells [19]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If I were to change anything, I’d drop the reference to “Zen”.  That wasn’t<br>
  part of the original, and was added by someone else.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the title is not from the author [23]</p>
<p>Strunk &amp; White is the name of two people, viz William Strunk and Elwyn Brooks White. Strunk wrote <em>The Elements of Style</em>, acclaimed by the Times as one of the most influencial books since 1923 [3]. White who was Strunk’s student and reviser after the professor’s death describes the book as:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  a forty-three page summation of the case<br>
  for cleanliness, accuracy, and brevity in the use of English [4]
</p></blockquote>
<p>The effect of the book is described below, he being Strunk:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  he omitted so<br>
  many needless words, and omitted them so forcibly and with such eagerness and obvious<br>
  relish, that he often seemed in the position of having shortchanged himself — a man left<br>
  with nothing more to say yet with time to fill, a radio prophet who had out-distanced the<br>
  clock. Will Strunk got out of this predicament by a simple trick: he uttered every sentence<br>
  three times
</p></blockquote>
<p>One effect of applying the Zen would then also be lighter code files.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484108678824-e6543e2e4230?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=752&amp;q=80" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></p>

<p>Master Tim heard the plea, approved the demand and responded accordingly [6]</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Clearly a job for Guido alone — although I doubt it’s one he’ll take on<br>
  (fwiw, I wish he would too!).  Here’s the outline he would start from,<br>
  though <wink>:
</wink></p></blockquote>
<pre><code>Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
</code></pre>
<p>The 20th was left for Guido to fill in:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  There you go:  20 Pythonic Fec^H^H^HTheses on the nose, counting the one I’m<br>
  leaving for Guido to fill in.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Venerable Tim shares exactly how the lines came about [15]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It was a throwaway python-list post. But like all great triumphs of literature, it was written during commercials breaks while watching professional wrestling on TV, and munching on a ham sandwich. All true!
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet, the author is emphatical: It’s complete and more than meets the demand [6]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If the answer to <em>any</em> Python design issue<br>
  isn’t obvious after reading those — well, I just give up <wink>.
</wink></p></blockquote>
<p>The above also reveals the purpose of the Zen: To address design issues. And it’s not a simple matter. Guido says [18]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In many ways, the design philosophy I used when creating Python is probably one of the main reasons for its ultimate success.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Zen only gives the outlines, in contrast to Strunk and White which gives explanations and examples in addition. Thus the need for commentaries. These help the non-initiated without being a replacement for the company of the bright minds.</p>
<p>In a time of fluctuating and steered standards, the reference in the actual PEP8 document to Strunk and White in the usage of the English language caused a bitter, ugly and messy thread [7]. It caused some of the best people of the community to forego following  python-list [8], a casual reminder that being too open without limit hurts.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593297372323-2ba78409d0b1?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=750&amp;q=80" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></p>

<p>The Zen has become an important piece of the Python programming language. If you don’t know the Zen, you won’t strike the right chord to communicate with the community. Raymond Hettinger advises:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Before creating more tracker items, please take time to learn about how Python’s history, how it is used, and its cultural norms.  In particular, read the Zen of Python, consider what is meant by duck-typing, what is meant by “a consenting adults language”, what is meant by over-specification, etc.  Python is quite different from Java in this regard. [13]
</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s also a practical aspect to it. It’s popular because it works [14]. It’s the golden guiding principle in pretty much everything Python.</p>
<p>Finally are the Zen points rules? What are they really. Many people take the Zen for rules. The ‘most opinionated linter ever’ at one time actually included the Zen to back their views [9]. It was situations like these which prompted me to write: The Zen Of Python Is A Joke And Here Is Why [10]. It was nice enough for Michael Kennedy and Brian Okken to call it a ‘must read’ on PythonBytes [11].</p>
<p>According to Nick Coghlan, the Zen gives you the idea, not everything [12]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This<br>
  challenge is reflected in the fact that the Zen of Python is<br>
  deliberately self-contradictory, as it articulates competing design<br>
  principles to take into consideration, rather than being able to<br>
  provide ironclad rules that avoid the need for human judgement in<br>
  determining which of those design guidelines are most salient in any<br>
  given situation.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Self contradiction is also coincidentally, one of the criticised aspect of Strunk and White [17].<br>
The Zen also goes beyond coding, such as shaping the thought pattern of features [12]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The thing we work toward as core developers, and aspiring core<br>
  developers, is good design intuition that aligns with the Zen of<br>
  Python. That doesn’t mean we’re all going to be able to perfectly<br>
  articulate that intuition in every case, and even when we can, those<br>
  explanations are themselves generally going to be backed by intuition<br>
  rather than rigorous scientific research.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If ever i myself would have added a 20th one it would have been: “Use your judgement.”. But Nick illustrated it better.</p>
<p>As for the famous <code>import this</code> command, it was Barry Warsaw’s pick. He sneaked it in a this.py in 2001 along with the ROT13 obfuscation [16]. He also mentionned that it was a time ‘when the Python community had a sense of humor’.</p>

<p>Now the time is ripe to see what the Zen actually means. But before we should know that whatever the words<br>
and concepts mean in the Zen is not …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div class="page"><h2>Intro</h2><p>People use computer simulations to both understand the world and design for it. Those who need to know where a satellite will be at some future time build simulations of the forces acting on the satellite and propagate its motion from some known location and velocity. Those who design robots create simulations of the environments their robots will experience in order to test how the robots make decisions and move. And those designing power plants simulate weather, energy demand, and system failures to determine the best design for a range of conditions and uncertainty.</p><p>However, despite the importance and widespread applicability, few receive education on the subject. The best information is scattered in places one might not know to look, and even most simulation textbooks are narrowly targeted to specific applications or tools. The inevitable result is that many simulations suffer from basic problems that have easy solutions.</p><p>This article will set out the critical aspects of building good simulations — that is, simulations that are accurate, easy to develop and analyze, and fast. The first sections deal with how a simulation evolves over time, as this is the core of any simulation. Further sections deal with details that make simulations easier to develop, faster, and applicable to a large number of variations. The target audience is engineers, scientists, and programmers, whether new to creating simulations or experienced. A tiny amount of vector math and calculus is assumed, making this text accessible to first- and second-year undergraduates. By the end, the reader should be able to begin building quality simulations, avoid common pitfalls, communicate the reasons for their decisions to peers, and know where to look for additional resources on specific topics and for the mathematical rigor behind it all.</p><p>We'll start with the motivation for understanding the core of how systems evolve over time.</p><h2 id="TToDt">From \(t\) to \(t+\Delta t\)</h2><p>Let’s get started with a really basic example. Let’s say we have a little moon orbiting a big planet. At some time, we know its position and velocity, and from this we want to simulate the future trajectory.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon_illustration.png"><figcaption>Planet and moon</figcaption></figure><p>We know the planet pulls on the moon with gravity, so the moon’s acceleration at any point in time is:</p><p>$$\vec{a}(t) = -\frac{GM}{r(t)^2} \hat{\vec{r}}(t)$$</p><p>Here, \(\vec{a}(t)\) is the acceleration vector, \(\vec{r}(t)\) is the position of the moon with respect to the center of mass of the planet, \(\hat{\vec{r}}\) denotes a unit vector in the direction of \(\vec{r}\), \(r\) denotes the magnitude of \(\vec{r}\), and \(GM\) is the gravitational constant of the planet (remember high school?). Let’s ignore all other forces that might act on the moon for now, since this is overwhelmingly the biggest. How do we turn this into a simulator? It might seem obvious: if we know \(\vec{r}(t)\) and \(\vec{v}(t)\) for some \(t\), then at some time later, \(t + \Delta t\), if \(\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{a}\) are nearly constant across this \(\Delta t\), we would have:</p><p>$$\vec{v}(t + \Delta t) \approx \vec{v}(t) + \vec{a}(t) \Delta t$$
$$\vec{r}(t + \Delta t) \approx \vec{r}(t) + \vec{v}(t) \Delta t + \frac{1}{2} \vec{a}(t) \Delta t^2$$</p><p>Perhaps by taking a series of small \(\Delta t\) and updating the position and velocity along the way, we'll generate the future trajectory. That certainly seems easy enough, so let's try it out. We'll pick a moon in a circular orbit about the planet. It has a period, \(T\), of 30 time units (we can call them days, but it doesn't really matter) and is located at 1 distance unit from the planet. Since it's a circular orbit, the velocity has magnitude of \(2 \pi / T\) and is perpendicular to the vector from the planet to the moon. Finally, \(GM = \left(\frac{2\pi}{T}\right)^2\). We'll take a series of time steps, each \(\Delta t\) in length. Let's use \(\Delta t\) = 1 time unit, so there should be 30 time steps in the orbit, bringing the moon exactly back to where it started. Here are the results using the “multiply by \(\Delta t\)” method above, plotted on top of the actual future trajectory.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon2.png"><figcaption>Initial simulation</figcaption></figure><p>It's not a very good circle. What went wrong?</p><p>Let's zoom in on the very first time step. Note that as the moon moves, the acceleration should change to always point towards the planet, but since we've assumed the acceleration is constant across \(\Delta t\), the acceleration in this step is always to the left in this figure. This doesn't affect the position all that much, but look at the velocity compared to the true velocity (since this system has a closed form solution, we can compare to an exact value for truth). The stepped velocity wasn't “pulled back” towards the planet enough (since it always pulled left). The result is that the moon is now going a little too fast and to the outside of the true trajectory. This image is not to scale so that we might better see the small difference in the two velocities at the upper left.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon1.png"><figcaption>First time step</figcaption></figure><p>As this continues, the velocity will always have a systematic error, leaning to the outside with every step. The error builds up rapidly, and so our simulated trajectory is not useful. Of course, we used a really big time step. Only 30 time steps for the whole trajectory? That seems ambitious. Let's cut the time step down by a factor of 2. And then by another factor of 2. And then again, again, again, and again.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon3.png"><figcaption>Multiple time steps</figcaption></figure><p>With our smallest time step above we're now taking 1920 time steps, and still the error is huge (given that these are planets).</p><p>Now let's fix it. Note that the stepped trajectory is always to the outside, no matter how small the time step. What if we used some method of stepping that wouldn't have this outward tendency? Something that would take a step, see that the new acceleration is significantly different from the acceleration of the previous step, and figure out what the acceleration was across the time step? Fortunately, some great mathematicians have figured out excellent, all-purpose ways to do this. For example, applying one of the most common and all-purpose methods (it's not tailored to orbits in any way), we can achieve less error than our most precise time step above with only 11 steps. Yes, 11. These are plotted as dots on top of the true trajectory below. Let's find out how.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon4.png"><figcaption>Multiple time steps with a much better solution</figcaption></figure><h2 id="ODEs">Ordinary Differential Equations</h2><p>First, we need to establish what types of things we're going to propagate. When we have systems with some <dfn>state</dfn> (like position and velocity) at some time and we calculate the derivatives of that state (velocity and acceleration for the example) at that time, we call this an <dfn>ordinary differential equation</dfn> (ODE) (and when we're dealing with motion, we call this the <dfn>equation of motion</dfn>). We usually stick all of the parts of the state together into a column matrix and call it the <dfn>state vector</dfn>.</p><p>$$ x(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \vec{r}(t) \\ \vec{v}(t) \end{bmatrix}$$</p><p>Then we have this for the time derivative:</p><p>$$ \frac{d x(t)}{dt} \equiv \dot{x}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \vec{v}(t) \\ \vec{a}(t) \end{bmatrix}$$</p><p>Then we describe the ODE something like this:</p><p>$$ \dot{x}(t) = f(t, x(t))$$
which just states that the derivatives depend on time and the current state and nothing else. It's also common to drop the explicit dependence on time, because it's generally understood. For our example, we have:
$$ \dot{x} = f(x) = \begin{bmatrix} \vec{v} \\ -\frac{GM}{r^2} \hat{\vec{r}} \end{bmatrix} $$</p><p>When we're keeping track of position by simulating its acceleration, it's a <dfn>second-order system</dfn>, because acceleration is the second-derivative of position. However, in terms of the state vector, \(x\), it's a <dfn>first-order system</dfn> (we calculate \(\dot{x}\) and not \(\ddot{x}\)). This can cause confusion, so we should just remember that the system is ultimately second-order, and we're just conveniently packaging up everything into \(x\) so as to use first-order techniques on \(x\).</p><p>In general, \(f(x)\) is our model of something, which might be nonlinear and even stochastic. The only assumption we make about the whole system is that it's differentiable (smooth-ish). It probably doesn't have a closed-form solution or we'd use the closed-form solution instead of simulating (our circular orbit of course has a closed-form solution, but that's just so that we can compare our simulation to something exact).</p><p>We'll talk about other types of systems (things that aren't ODEs) later. For now, this gives us plenty of great material since a plethora of physical systems are described as ODEs that boil down to \(\dot{x} = f(x)\), such as equations of motion, chemical reactions, thermodynamics, population growth, etc. Having a generic framework to describe these systems therefore lets us describe the solvers in a generic way, making them applicable to a great number of different problems.</p><h2 id="FixedStep">Fixed-Step Solvers</h2><p>In the orbit example, we held the acceleration constant across the time step, and this ultimately created a systemic bias to one side. Of course, we could easily have seen that the acceleration wasn't constant across the time step. For instance, we could have propagated by one time step, re-calculated the acceleration, and used this updated value to determine how the acceleration had changed across the time step, allowing us to revise the step. Drawing from this motivation, an excellent solution was created by Carl Runge and Martin Wilhelm Kutta a long while back. They proposed taking a series of small steps forward, using the derivatives along the way to determine the effective derivatives across the entire time step in such a way that the errors could be made very, very small.</p><h3>Runge-Kutta Fourth Order Method</h3><p>The most common Runge-Kutta method is known as “the” fourth order method, and we'll call it RK4. It involves calculating the derivatives four times like so:</p><ol><li>First, calculate the derivative at \(t\), 
$$ k_1 = f(t, x(t)) $$</li><li>Form an intermediate update of the state, 
$$ x(t + \frac{1}{2} …</li></ol></div></div>

<hr>

<p>Just yesterday, I released my <a href="https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/dither">dithering library</a>, written in Go.
It’s the product of many hours of research, experimentation, and refactoring. I’m
excited that it’s finally out, and to see what people create with it. Personally I’d like to create a CLI dithering
tool at some point that uses it.</p>

<p>Creating this library required research into the different algorithms for dithering, and how to implement them.
Unfortunately, not all of that knowledge is easily found. It’s spread across blog posts, Wikipedia pages without
citations, old books, and code comments. Recently, Surma wrote an article called
<a href="https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/">Ditherpunk — The article I wish I had about monochrome image dithering</a>.
It is an invaluable resource that combines lots of knowledge about dithering into one place. The main thing missing
from the post, however, is going beyond “monochrome”. Surma shows us how to dither with a 1-bit palette of black and
white, but what about more shades of gray? What about colour images? With this blog post I’d like to explore those
techniques, taking them out of my code and into English, so you can easily apply them elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>First off, please read Surma’s post.</strong> It explains what dithering is, how it works, and many different algorithms.
I don’t feel the need to explain these again, but merely add on what I’ve learned.</p>

<h2 id="before-we-start">Before we start</h2>

<p>An HN commenter <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26122642">informed me</a> that you cannot accurately represent
linear RGB with just 8-bits (0-255), you need at least 12. Because of this, I have updated the blog post to use
16-bit color (0-65535), and will be updating the library shortly. Make sure you do this in your code too!</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Dithering operations consist of at least two steps, applied to each pixel. Sometimes there are further steps, like
“modify these nearby pixels”, but these are the basic ones.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Modify the pixel’s colour value.</li>
  <li>Find the colour in the palette that is “closest” to that modified value and use that on the output image.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, we know from Surma’s post that step 1 must be done with linear RGB values. Otherwise, different values will be
affected differently – for example adding 5 to each colour won’t affect all colours the same way.</p>

<p>But what about step 2? How do we find the closest colour in the palette? In 1-bit dithering we don’t have to worry
about this, because anything above 0.5 is white, and anything below is black. But when your palette colours can be
anyhere in a 3D space, it is something that needs to be figured out.</p>

<p>Perhaps surprisingly, we’re not looking for a way that matches human perception. In fact, we are using Euclidean
distance with linear RGB values, which doesn’t match human perception at all! Why is this?
Thomas Mansencal (<a href="https://github.com/KelSolaar">@KelSolaar</a>) explains it best:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can factor out the observer [the human] because what you are interested in here is basically energy
conservation. The idea being that for a given pool of radiant power emitters, if you remove a certain number of
them, by how much must the radiant power of the remaining ones be increased to be the same as that of the full
pool. It is really a ratio and doing those operations in a linear space is totally appropriate!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This helped it click for me. Dithering can be thought of as trying to reconstruct the “radiant power” of the original
pixel colours, while restricted to a certain set of “emitters”, aka the palette colours. It is only with linearized
RGB values that we can properly measure the radiant power.</p>

<h2 id="random-noise-grayscale">Random Noise (grayscale)</h2>

<p>Random noise is a good one to start with, to show the differences between 1-bit dithering and larger palettes.</p>

<p>Surma does this by basically just adding a random number from -0.5 to 0.5, and then thresholding it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>grayscaleImage</span><span>.</span><span>mapSelf</span><span>(</span><span>brightness</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>brightness</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0.5</span> 
    <span>?</span> <span>1.0</span> 
    <span>:</span> <span>0.0</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my library, there are two separate random noise functions. One is for grayscale, and one is for RGB. The grayscale
one looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>gray</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>max</span><span>-</span><span>min</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>min</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The math with <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> is just to put the random value in the desired range. If we clean that up it’s more
understandable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>gray</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>rand</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>rand()</code> just represents a function that does whatever range we want, -0.5 to 0.5 in this case.</p>

<p>So, obviously this is quite similar to what Surma does. The heavy lifing of the dithering in this case is done by the
other code, the part that finds the best palette colour.</p>

<p>The main thing that’s worth noting here is how the rounding works. <code>roundClamp</code> rounds the value to an integer, and then
clamps it to the range 0-65535. But how is the rounding done?</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26122642">HN commenter</a> shared <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/articles/1UCRko23/">this link</a>
which discusses different rounding methods, and the problems with the way rounding is often done. The best solution is to
use a rounding function that does this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given a number exactly halfway between two values, round to the even value (zero is considered even here).</p>

  <p>round( 1.7 ) –&gt; 2 round( 2.7 ) –&gt; 3<br>
round( 1.5 ) –&gt; 2 round( 2.5 ) –&gt; 2<br>
round( 1.3 ) –&gt; 1 round( 2.3 ) –&gt; 2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not really about dithering, but this is a pretty important point to get things right mathematically.
Make sure you do it! Otherwise your outputs will be biased.</p>

<h2 id="random-noise-rgb">Random Noise (RGB)</h2>

<p>Back to random noise, but for colour this time.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>maxR</span><span>-</span><span>minR</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>minR</span><span>))</span>
<span>g</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>maxG</span><span>-</span><span>minG</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>minG</span><span>))</span>
<span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>maxB</span><span>-</span><span>minB</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>minB</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And simplified:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>randR</span><span>())</span>
<span>g</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>randG</span><span>())</span>
<span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>randB</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pretty simple, it just adds randomness in each channel. This can be done with grayscale images too, but it won’t
work very well, because grayscale colours only actually have one dimension. So it will just not add as much
randomness as you would expect.</p>

<p>Also note that usually you’ll want the random ranges to be the same for R, G, and B.</p>

<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<h2 id="ordered-dithering">Ordered Dithering</h2>

<h3 id="modifying-threshold-matrices">Modifying threshold matrices</h3>

<p>Most of the resources online that talk about ordered dithering talk about a “threshold matrix”. “Thresholding” is
how these matrices are applied for 1-bit dithering. You divide the matrix by whatever number is specified, scale
it to the colour value range, and compare it to each pixel in the image. If it’s less than the matrix value, make
it black, otherwise white. Obviously this doesn’t work with any other kind of palette. So what’s the solution?</p>

It’s the amount the matrix will be applied to the
image. The closer to zero it is, the smaller the range of input colors that will be dithered. Colors outside
that range will be quantized. Usually you’ll want a strength of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, to apply the matrix and dither fully, but
sometimes reducing it can be useful, to reduce noise in the output image. It is inversely proportional to contrast –

This is useful in certain cases where the matrix usually
makes things bright, like what Surma describes with Bayer matrices.</p>

<p>Note that <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>65535</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">65535</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is multiplied by <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">strength</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> because the colours in my code are in the range <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>65535</mn><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">[0, 65535]</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

It represents the maximum value of the matrix, and normalizes
it by dividing. Usually this is the product of the dimensions of the matrix. It can also be the
largest value in the matrix plus one.</p>

<p>The result of applying this operation to each cell of the matrix is a new, precalculated matrix, which can be added
to a pixel’s colour value for dithering. Adding 0.5 does not need to happen in this case. In my library, I call the
function that does this <code>convThresholdToAddition</code>, because that’s essentially the purpose of this – converting
a threshold matrix into one that can be used for addition.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is designed for matrices that range from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">max - 1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. If you’re using a matrix you found that
starts at <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, you’ll usually just want to subtract one from each value when you program it, then apply the operation
I described above.</p>

<h3 id="using-a-modified-matrix">Using a modified matrix</h3>

<p>Now that you’ve modified the matrix so it can be used for addition, it needs to be applied to the image. This is pretty
simple. Use modulus so the matrix values are tiled across the image, and add the same value in the R, G, and B channels.
If you’re using a grayscale image you can just apply it in the one channel, or still use RGB. Since the same value is
being added it doesn’t make much of a difference. Like always, make sure to clamp the values to the proper colour range.</p>

<p>Doing all of this definitely works with colour images, but it’s not the greatest. Here’s an example, where the palette
is red, green, and black.</p>

<p>A few days ago, <a href="https://www.emiratesmarsmission.ae/">Emirates Mars Mission (Hope)</a>, and <a href="https://destevez.net/tag/tianwen/">Tianwen-1</a> performed their Mars orbit injection burn (MOI). <a href="https://amsat-dl.org/">AMSAT-DL</a> made a livestream for each of the two events, showing the X-band signals of the spacecraft as received with the <a href="https://amsat-dl.org/en/20-meter-antenna/">20m antenna at Bochum</a>.</p>



<p>In the case of Tianwen-1 the signal was pretty strong even while the spacecraft was on the low gain antenna, and we could clearly see the <a href="https://youtu.be/1myQ5tIig0w?t=6593">change in Doppler rate as the thrusters fired up</a>. However, in the case of Emirates Mars Mission the signal <a href="https://youtu.be/413DdMua8ec?t=2641">disappeared as soon as the spacecraft switched to the low gain antenna</a>. In fact <a href="https://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn/dsn.html">DSN Now</a> reported a received power of -155 dBm with the 34m DSS55. That was a large drop from the -118 dBm that it was reporting with the high gain antenna. Therefore, nothing could be seen in the livestream waterfall until the spacecraft returned to the high gain antenna, well after the manoeuvre was finished.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, a weak trace of the carrier was still present in the livestream audio, and it could be seen by appropriate FFT processing, for example with <a href="https://github.com/miek/inspectrum">inspectrum</a>. I put up a <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1359152918004461574">couple</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1359161368289701888">tweets</a> showing this, but at the moment I wasn’t completely sure if what I was seeing was the spacecraft’s signal or some interference. After the livestream ended, I’ve been able to analyse the audio more carefully and realize that not only this weak signal was in fact the Hope probe, but that the start of the burn was recorded in perfect conditions.</p>



<p>In this post I’ll show how to process the livestream audio to clearly show the change in drift rate at the start of the burn and measure the acceleration of the spacecraft.</p>



<p>The idea with this post is that anyone can reproduce what I’m going to show. After all, the only data I’m using is the audio of a livestream that is recorded in Youtube. For convenience, I include with my code the segment of data I’m using, which is a 5 minute segment that starts 7850 seconds into the audio of the full video. If you want to start from scratch, you can use any webpage or application to download the audio of the full video, and work with that. In my case I used a webpage to download the audio in 320kbps MP3 format, then converted it to an 8ksps WAV file, and used <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> to read the WAV file and extract the 5 minute segment.</p>



<p>In the figure below you can see the waterfall of the first minute of the 5 minute clip I cut. The spacecraft signal can be seen as faint diagonal lines between 700 and 800 Hz. They are quite weak and have some fading, but hopefully you can see them.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_start.png"><img width="644" height="438" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_start-644x438.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_start-644x438.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_start-300x204.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_start.png 730w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>There is something that is convenient to remark about the Doppler correction system that was used at Bochum for the livestreams. First, the system used the trajectory of the the spacecraft, ignoring the burn, to compute the expected Doppler. Therefore, the expected Doppler computation would be quite good before the burn started, but as soon as the thrusters fired it would diverge more and more from reality.</p>



<p>Second, rather than constantly adjusting the tuning to correct for Doppler and keep the signal exactly centred, the system performed discrete jumps of fixed size with the goal of keeping the signal inside a certain band, roughly 350 Hz wide. This had the effect of creating a sawtooth wave in the waterfall and the audio. As the signal arrived to one edge of this imaginary band, the Doppler correction performed a frequency jump to put the signal at the other edge of the band.</p>



<p>This can be seen quite clearly in the livestream of Tianwen-1. At the <a href="https://youtu.be/1myQ5tIig0w?t=0">beginning of the livestream</a>, the drift rate was quite low, since the spacecraft was well away from periapsis. Therefore, the period of the sawtooth was long. As the spacecraft approached periapsis and the drift rate increased, the period of the sawtooth <a href="https://youtu.be/1myQ5tIig0w?t=4667">kept reducing</a> until it was quite short <a href="https://youtu.be/1myQ5tIig0w?t=6023">right before the burn</a>. However, note that the amplitude of the sawtooth (this is, the width of this imaginary frequency band) is always the same.</p>



<p>The next figure shows the waterfall of the audio when the burn starts. It is a bit difficult to see, but hopefully you’ll be able to see two or three lines at the left around 800 Hz, and then a couple of lines going up in steps and with less slope, near the middle of the image.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_burn.png"><img width="644" height="438" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_burn-644x438.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_burn-644x438.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_burn-300x204.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_burn.png 730w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>When the burn starts, the drift rate increases (i.e., changes from negative to less negative), since the retrograde burn accelerated the spacecraft towards Earth. As the Doppler correction keeps tuning in steps to correct for a more negative drift rate, we get steps upwards. This is the same that happened at the <a href="http://youtu.be/1myQ5tIig0w?t=6593">start of the burn of Tianwen-1</a>. In that case the drift rate became almost zero, and then positive, since the thrust-to-mass ratio of Tianwen-1 is higher than that of Hope.</p>



<p>The resolution of the plots shown above, and those that come later is 0.98 Hz per FFT bin (FFT size of 8192 with a sample rate of 8ksps) and 64ms per time step (due to the use of overlapping FFT, and an advance of 512 samples per FFT).</p>



<p>In what follows, the idea is to undo the Doppler correction done at Bochum to join back the pieces of the sawtooth wave and also correct for the drift rate in order to get a signal of constant frequency that we may see clearly in a spectrum plot. To do this, we just need to create a sawtooth that has the same (or almost the same) phase, amplitude and period as the one that the Doppler correction created, and then use that sawtooth to control the frequency of a local oscillator with which we mix the audio signal. I have adjusted the parameters of the sawtooth by hand until I obtained something where the resulting signal before the start of the burn had a constant frequency and had no (or very brief) jumps.</p>



<p>The result of this correction can be seen below. We see the signal before the burn as a flat line at constant frequency, slightly above 800 Hz, and then the signal rising up as the burn starts. The vertical white line marks the moment in which the start of the burn happens, which is at 184.96 seconds into this 5 minute segment. The right panel contains the spectrum plot of the data in the left of the waterfall (to the left of the white line). The signal can be seen very clearly, with an (S+N)/N of about 5dB, which would give an estimated CN0 on the order of 3 dBHz.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_before_burn.png"><img width="644" height="427" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_before_burn-644x427.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_before_burn-644x427.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_before_burn-300x199.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_before_burn-768x510.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_before_burn.png 856w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>If we now change the drift rate correction, we can make flat the signal after the burn. We see that the drift rate is not constant, but rather it increases slightly with time, so it is not possible to find a drift rate that makes the line totally flat. I have chosen a drift rate that makes the line flat at approximately 20 seconds after the start of the burn. The  right panel shows the spectrum of the right part of the waterfall (after the white line). Again, we have some 5 dB of (S+N)/N.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_after_burn.png"><img width="644" height="427" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_after_burn-644x427.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_after_burn-644x427.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_after_burn-300x199.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_after_burn-768x510.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_after_burn.png 856w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>We have seen how by correcting the drift rate the “corner” of the Doppler curve, which marks the exact moment in which the thrusters started firing, can seen in the waterfall, whereas with the waterfall of the original audio signal it was impossible to see this corner. The moment in which the corner happens corresponds to 2:13:54.96 into the video, which by looking at the timestamps that appear in the screen shown in the video we can associate with 15:41:38 UTC (with a precision of perhaps one or two seconds). Since the light-time delay for this burn was 637 seconds, this means that the burn started at 15:31:01 UTC. This matches the official report of a start at 15:30 UTC, because it is possible that ullage motors fired one minute before the main burn, as we saw in <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-tcm-1/">Tianwen-1’s TCM-1</a>.</p>



<p>The drift rate before the burn is -19.5 Hz/s, and when the burn starts it changes to -8 Hz/s. Such a drift rate change gives a line-of-sight acceleration of -0.41 m/s². This is just the projection of the acceleration vector onto the line-of-sight. In order to compute the full acceleration, we assume that it happened along the velocity vector of the spacecraft (with respect to Mars), and compute the projection of the unit velocity vector and the unit line-of-sight vector to Earth at the start of the burn. This computation ignores light-time delays, but is good enough for our purposes, since the line-of-sight vector changes slowly enough. The projection is 0.86.</p>



<p>This means that we only see 86% of the total acceleration in the Doppler drift rate. Therefore, the total acceleration must have been around -0.48 m/s². This contrasts to the theoretical acceleration of -0.58 m/s² that 720 N of thrust (since the spacecraft has 6x 120 N thrusters) applied to 1250 kg of mass produce (here the mass comes from a dry mass of 550 kg and 700 kg of fuel, assuming that the probe already spent in mid-course corrections 100 kg of its initial 800 kg).</p>



<p>Working backwards, we see that the measured acceleration of -0.48 m/s² would correspond to a thrust of 594 N. In fact, while I <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1359081278079987712">worked out the planning of the manoeuvre on Twitter</a>, I noticed that the publicly stated burn length of 27 minutes was way too long to achieve the target orbit with a thrust of 720 N. To have a burn of 27 minutes that gave me the required apoapsis altitude I had to use a thrust of 658 N.</p>



<p>Note that all these calculations about the acceleration are just estimates, since we don’t know exactly the mass of the spacecraft, and our estimate of 1250 kg could be wrong by up to 10%. In any case, I think it is always good to go through these calculations to show what can be achieved with simple Doppler measurements and to check that the signal we observed matches what we expected.</p>



<p>The calculations and plots in this post have been done in <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/EMM/MOI/Bochum%20MOI%20recording.ipynb">this Jupyter notebook</a>. The data file with the 5 minute segment of the livestream audio is included in the same repository. The results that I have shown are intended to be easily reproducible. It is possible to run the notebook with the supplied data or to start from scratch by downloading the audio from the livestream video on Youtube.</p>

<p>How things have (and have not changed). I'm still a command-line junkie with at least two xterm windows open. I'm still using a 3x3 virtual desktop. However, instead of fvwm, it is now LXDE. I've also switched from FreeBSD to Linux and I'm running Lubuntu as my distribution.</p>

<p>There are a lot of indispensable GUI tools that I use. These include Firefox, lyx, Gimp, KeepassX, Shutter, viking, dia, Wireshark, calibre, audacity, Handbrake and VLC. But where possible I still prefer to script things. My main development languages are still shell, Perl and C.</p>

<p>My shell is now bash. The vi keystrokes are burned into my fingertips and, as long as vim can be ported to new systems, that will be my text editor until I pass on. My mail client is now mutt (definitely not a web client) and my mail is stored locally, not on someone else's server.</p>

<p>The only issue I have is that, since a job change, I now have to deal with Windoze things. Thus, I have VirtualBox, libreoffice and Wine to help me do that.</p>

<p>I started with Unix on a Pyramid 90x. I now have a smart phone that blows the 90x out of the water on performance, RAM and storage. But I'm so very happy that, somewhere down underneath, there is still a Bourne shell and an operating system that does open(), close(), read(), write(), fork() and exec()!</p>

<p>Nearly every solar power panel sold in the European Union has its origins in China’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/24/china-uighurs-europe-sanctions-381080" target="_blank">oppressed Xinjiang region</a>.</p>



<p>The solar industry and Brussels lawmakers argue Europe’s renewable energy push should not come at a human cost amid long-standing international concern over reports China has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-un-idUSKBN1KV1SU" target="_blank">detained 1 million people</a> with Muslim backgrounds in camps in Xinjiang and is putting them to work.</p>



<p>“Everybody knows what’s going on in China, and when facilities are based there you have to accept that there’s a high possibility that forced labor will be used,” said Milan Nitzschke, president of <a href="https://www.prosun.org/en/mission-en/" target="_blank">EU ProSun</a>, an alliance of solar businesses seeking to promote sustainable, solar manufacturing based in the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the U.S. has already rolled out sanctions against products such as cotton and tomatoes originating from Xinjiang, the European Commission has avoided confronting China with any trade measures. </p>



<p>It has fallen to lawmakers in the European Parliament to try to push Brussels to implement trade bans, on all industries including solar panels, if companies are implicated in human rights abuses.</p>



<p>“Import bans need to complement as a last resort if forced labor is involved in the production, like in Xinjiang," said Green MEP Anna Cavazzini.</p>



<h3>Suspicions about every panel</h3>



<p>For the past decade Beijing has been carrying out a campaign to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1256994">detain and “reeducate”</a> the Muslim-majority population of the Xinjiang region.</p>



<p>Human rights groups have alerted that state-run reeducation centers <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1408155">double as forced labor camps</a>, with detained people obliged to work in low-skilled, labor-intensive sectors such as cotton picking. But recent reports out of the region suggest the Xinjiang government has also been focusing on “upskilling” the workforce and putting them to work in more specialized sectors.</p>



<p>That’s of particular concern to the global solar industry given Xinjiang’s outsized role in the production of <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=62601">polysilicon</a>, a material used to make photovoltaic (PV) cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nearly every silicon-based solar module — at least 95 percent of the market — is likely to have some Xinjiang silicon in,” said Jenny Chase, head of solar analysis at BloombergNEF.</p>



<p>Industry analyst Johannes Bernreuter added that last year roughly 45 percent of the global supply of solar-grade polysilicon came from the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Raw polysilicon is transported to factories — usually outside Xinjiang — and melted into cylinders, known as ingots. Because it’s blended with polysilicon produced in other regions, it’s difficult to trace material that could potentially come from forced labor camps in Xinjiang, Chase and Bernreuter said.</p>



<p>For any single solar panel “the mathematical probability is relatively high" it has some material produced in the province, said Bernreuter.</p>



<h3>An open secret</h3>



<p>Beijing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/china-cotton-forced-labour-trfn-idUSKBN28P2CM" target="_blank">insists</a> the camps — which it calls “vocational training facilities” — are simply “helping people of all ethnic groups secure stable employment” and argues that this is “entirely different from forced labor.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The China Photovoltaic Industry Association <a href="http://www.chinapv.org.cn/association_news/922.html" target="_blank">said</a> accusations of forced labor in Xinjiang were ”the lie of the century fabricated by several institutions and people from Western countries.”</p>



<p>In Europe, industry players said the potential use of forced labor to produce material included in solar panels imported into the EU was an open secret.</p>



<p>Industry group SolarPower Europe said it was investigating the situation in Xinjiang with its membership and looking at different options to ensure no forced labor was used in the PV manufacturing process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We cannot accept that such practices take place in the solar PV sector, which is a leader in sustainability and a key enabler of the energy transition,” said SolarPower Europe CEO Walburga Hemetsberger.</p>



<p>The group said its members were using supply chain management guidelines, certifications and standards to ensure that forced labor was not used, and that it was evaluating how to encourage best practices across the industry.</p>



<h3>Distancing measures</h3>



<p>If the EU’s solar sector wants to distance itself from solar components manufactured under questionable circumstances in Xinjiang, it would have several ways of doing so.</p>



<p>Bloomberg NEF’s Chase said one option would be to continue accepting components made with polysilicon from China, but insisting that material produced in Xinjiang be exempted from the mix blended in factories.</p>



<p>“There’s plenty of non-Xinjiang polysilicon,” Chase said — around a quarter of the global market in 2021 is expected to come from the U.S. and the EU. But she said enforcing the exclusion would be complicated and likely make little difference for the plight of any workers. </p>



<p>Xinjiang polysilicon would simply shift to the domestic market and customers in the EU and the U.S. “will pay an almost unnoticeable amount more for modules,” said Chase. “Honestly, it is unlikely to be a big deal for solar, but good news for companies that make silicon outside Xinjiang.”</p>



<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, European manufacturers believe the answer is repatriating the industry back to the EU and using tariffs if necessary.</p>



<p>“Solar components can be produced in Europe,” EU ProSun’s Nitzschke said. “The companies making them were here until 2012 but they went bankrupt when the tariffs used to address Chinese overproduction and public financing were removed, allowing their companies to undercut us in terms of price.”</p>



<p>Nitzschke argued the EU should revise its trade deals and ensure that the same standards on human rights and forced labor that apply in Europe be extended to imported products. “We can’t have a level playing field if there’s ethical leakage, and you could prevent it by applying tariffs to products that don’t meet our standards.”</p>



<p>SolarPower Europe’s Hemetsberger said she didn’t favor trade tariffs due to their often counterproductive effect on European solar growth. "The best way of ensuring that imported goods abide by strict human rights protocols and ethical standards is improving the level of transparency of the global value chain so that EU-based suppliers can make informed decisions."</p>



<p>The European Commission has said the EU’s solar capacity needs to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2030_en#:~:text=2030%20climate%20and%20energy%20framework%20%2D%20existing%20ambition,32.5%25%20improvement%20in%20energy%20efficiency" target="_blank">grow five-fold by 2030</a> to meet its climate targets. Hemetsberger said there was a “solar manufacturing renaissance” underway in Europe.</p>



<p>“Nearly all areas of the supply chain can be produced in Europe,” said Gunter Erfurt, CEO of <a href="https://www.meyerburger.com/en/company/about-meyer-burger/management/" target="_blank">Meyer Burger</a>, a Swiss-German solar module production company that aims to reestablish solar’s industrial supply chain on the Continent, pointing out that solar-grade polysilicon is <a href="https://www.wacker.com/cms/en-us/about-wacker/wacker-at-a-glance/profile-and-organization/wacker-polysilicon.html" target="_blank">already produced</a> at several sites in Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have a lot of respect for the Chinese strategy because 10 years ago they understood what Europe is still struggling to grasp: that solar is the future,” he said. “EU leaders speak of batteries, electric mobility, hydrogen … But where is the electricity to produce those things supposed to come from? We are already the technological frontrunners, what we need now is financing to bring production back.”&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Growing pressure on Brussels</h3>



<p>Solar panels are yet another example of goods made with forced labor entering the EU market, raising <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1572638">criticisms from lawmakers and NGOs</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, expects the EU to step up scrutiny of imports from Xinjiang, including solar power panels.</p>



<p>“The pressure is piling on the Commission and member states that they have to use unilateral means to send China a message, such as screening of imported products,” said Wuttke.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brussels <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-china-inestment-agreement-soft-approach-odds-us/">is taking its time</a> when its comes to tackling goods made with forced labor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Commission is working on <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1496802">a new tool</a> — due diligence legislation — which would make EU companies accountable if their suppliers breach labor and climate laws. But MEPs would like the Commission to go even further to tackle serious situations such as the one in Xinjiang. Last month, the European Parliament’s legal affairs committee <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1590418">called on</a> the Commission to introduce an import ban for “products related to severe human rights violations.”</p>



<p>“The EU due diligence legislation has a key role to play in that as it will help ensure that human rights are respected throughout our supply chains,” said MEP Cavazzini. She backs an import ban if suppliers are shown to be involved in human rights abuses.</p>



<p>The Commission is <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12548-Sustainable-corporate-governance" target="_blank">set to</a> come up with its supply chain responsibility proposal by June after a public consultation ended this week.</p>



<p>According to Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders, who is in charge of the file, new rules are likely to focus on so-called Tier 1 suppliers and to make reference to the International Labor Organization’s core conventions, which China committed to ratify under the new investment deal concluded with the EU.</p>



<p>“Expanding the use of renewables is of utmost importance in order to stop the climate crisis. But it cannot come at the cost of human rights,” said Cavazzini.</p>

<p>The hardware and software worlds may seem poles apart, and in many ways, they indeed are. But there’s a wealth of knowledge that each can learn from the other. Despite the seemingly massive differences in the final product, they share more in common than you might expect. </p>



<p>Computer engineers at places like Intel, just like software engineers, spend most of their time sitting at their desks, writing (verilog) code that implements the desired system behavior. They then compile (synthesize) their code in order to generate lower-level outputs (digital circuits and physical layouts). And finally, they write automated tests that exercise their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_under_test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SUT</a>, to ensure that the code is functionally correct. Sound familiar?</p>



<p>I know all this intimately, given my own past as a hardware engineer, and my later transition into software development. After finishing my Master’s degree in Computer Architecture, I spent over 5 years working at Intel and Sun as a Hardware Verification engineer, before turning down a senior-staff role at Apple, in order to reboot my career as a software developer.</p>



<p>In the past 5 years, I’ve worked in some great software teams at places like Google, and have also led development for multiple personal projects in my free time. The programmers that I’ve met and worked with are undoubtedly smart, and possess a number of skills that my hardware colleagues should strive to emulate. However, one thing I’ve noticed is that when it comes to testing, their instincts have been… off. Way off. </p>



<p>Here’s my attempt to distill the lessons I’ve learnt from my Hardware days, and how they can be applied to improve our Software testing methodologies and outcomes.</p>



<p><em>Disclaimer: this post is focused on non-UI programming, where functionality can be 100% covered without the need for “eyeballing”. Front-end/UI testing is a whole other beast that I wouldn’t comment on or touch with a ten foot pole.</em></p>







<p>The elephant in the room in most software companies, is the perceived importance of testing. In hardware, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://anysilicon.com/verification-validation-testing-asicsoc-designs-differences/" target="_blank">pre-silicon verification</a> is a first-class citizen in the development process. Dedicated verification engineers earn 6 figure salaries, sit next to their RTL design counterparts in all planning meetings, and enjoy careers that are just as prestigious and lucrative. In comparison, at most software companies I’ve come across, testing is treated as a 2nd class citizen – being a “test engineer” (or worse, “tester”) is often maligned as being less prestigious or lucrative.</p>



<p>This difference in culture isn’t an accident of nature. It’s a natural consequence of the much higher stakes in the hardware world. Because the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape-out" target="_blank">tapeout</a> process is so expensive and time consuming, finding even a single bug can delay your product launch by months, and cost you millions of dollars in additional expenses. Or worse: finding a bug after your customers have already purchased and installed the chips, can result in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_FDIV_bug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="extremely expensive product recalls (opens in a new tab)">extremely expensive product recalls</a>. Even if the fix is a simple one-line code change.</p>



<p>The consequences of software bugs can certainly be disastrous. But at least the fix is extremely cheap logistically – code deployments and software patches are vastly faster and cheaper than manufacturing and distributing new silicon. Hence why hardware organizations take testing much more seriously than comparable software companies.</p>



<p>The results do speak for themselves. Hardware products that are in the hands of customers, have an order-of-magnitude fewer bugs. The percentage of bugs that are caught prior to release, is vastly higher in the hardware industry as compared to the software industry.</p>



<h4>A Better Way</h4>



<p>It is tempting to say that hardware teams are better at testing, purely because of their greater financial investment. That software teams are already operating at their most ideal, and that improvements in testing-quality can only be had through sacrifices in time/cost. </p>



<p>Such a view is unjustifiably optimistic about the current state of affairs, and pessimistic about our potential for improvement. Over the past decades we have vastly improved our software-development practices and methodologies. There’s no reason to believe that we have now achieved a state of nirvana where no further improvements are possible.</p>



<p>Even though many programmers tend to short change it, testing-methodology is itself a skill set. One that is learned over time by an entire industry, at a rate proportional to its level of investment. And in this sense, the hardware industry is miles ahead when it comes to testing best-practices. Not because they are “smarter” in any way, but simply because their survival depends on it.</p>



<p>You wouldn’t expect a football player to be able to jump as high as a basketball player.<br>You wouldn’t expect a restaurant to take cleanliness as seriously as a hospital.<br>You definitely shouldn’t expect a software organization to master testing best-practices, the way a hardware company has.</p>



<p>If you want to master the art of testing, talk to a hardware verification engineer.</p>







<h2>The 0th Law of Testing: Only the Paranoid Survive</h2>



<p>If it hasn’t been tested, it doesn’t work. <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="“If this isn't absolutely true, it is certainly a good working assumption for project work.” (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.hyperthot.com/pm_princ.htm" target="_blank">“If this isn’t absolutely true, it is certainly a good working assumption for project work.” </a></em>This rule forms the foundation for most other lessons listed here.</p>



<p>Word of Warning: The universe of all possible inputs and corner-cases is infinite. Hence, you will never attain 100% coverage via empirical testing. You will never cross the finish-line. If you ever think that you are “done” with testing, you’re in for a surprise. All you can do is chase as much coverage as can be attained, with the amount of time and resources available.</p>



<h2>Manual Testing is not good enough</h2>



<p>Things I’ve heard developers say:</p>



<p><em>“This is so important, that we have to test it manually. I don’t trust an automated test to do the job.”</em><br><em>“Don’t worry about trying to build automated tests. We’ve been manually testing these changes.”</em></p>



<p>What a Hardware engineer would say instead:</p>



<p><em>“This is so important, that we have to build an automated test suite for it. I don’t trust human testers to do the job.”</em><br><em>“Maybe run a few tests manually as a final sanity check, but don’t spend too much time since it’s been auto-tested pretty well.”</em></p>



<p>Running a couple tests by hand and eyeballing the results, might work in a college VLSI class. But it’s going to get you laughed at in industry. Manual testing cannot be code-reviewed on GitHub. Manual testing is subject to human error, whether due to oversight or laziness. Manual testing is extremely time and labor intensive, when subjected to every single release.</p>



<p>There might be specific exceptions where a test cannot be automated. But these should be the exception – not the norm. Reliability ultimately comes from the strength of your automated test suite, not how much manual testing you’re doing. Anything important enough to test by hand, is important enough to build an automated test suite for.</p>



<h2><strong>Testing Two Inputs in Isolation != Testing Them Together</strong></h2>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Suppose your team is implementing and testing the following method:</p>


<pre title="">public static double myCustomDivider(double numerator, double divisor);
</pre>


<p>Alice:<em> “Do we have tests checking correct behavior for negative inputs?”</em><br>Bob:<em> “I have a test where the numerator is negative, and another test where the divisor is negative”</em><br>Alice: <em>“Do you have a 3rd test where they are both negative?”</em><br>Bob: <em>“No, and we don’t need that. We’ve already covered both cases individually.”</em></p>



<p>You laugh, but I’ve heard variations of this said far too many times, by far too many senior developers.</p>



<p>If the 2 inputs are completely decoupled, maybe it makes sense to assume we don’t need to test them in combination. But often times, 2 inputs which are assumed to be decoupled, aren’t nearly as decoupled as people think. And even if the implementation is indeed decoupled at the time of writing the test, it can often evolve to become coupled at a later time. As the saying goes: <em>“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.”</em></p>



<p>As a general heuristic: If 2 inputs are both being parsed within the same method, there is definitely value in testing them in combination.</p>



<p>Perhaps you’ve decided that the risk-reward tradeoff merits not writing tests to cover some combinations. This is certainly a reasonable decision to make, depending on the particular project circumstances and the events being considered. But do so cognizant of the risk you’re taking on. Do not delude yourself into thinking that there’s no value in testing combinations of multiple events.</p>



<h2>Testing Output_A for Event_1 != Testing Output_A for Event_2</h2>



<p>Suppose you find yourself needing to test the following addPerson method:</p>


<pre title="">public int getAge(String name);
public int getHeight(String name);
public int getWeight(String name);

// Returns true if a previous value was overwritten
public boolean addPerson(Person person);
</pre>


<p>And so you write the following tests:</p>


<pre title="">@Test
public void addNewPerson_shouldReturnFalse() {
  Person person = new Person("john", 30, 175, 70);
  boolean result = system.addPerson(person);
  Truth.assertThat(result).isFalse();
  getAndCheckPerson(person);
}

<p>This week I had a discussion with one of my friends on how to choose a programming language. It was triggered by multiple discussions I had with our customers on their engineering strategy in the last six months and one question that came multiple times was should we use X programming language for our new initiatives. Some customers were thinking of moving from .NET stack to Java, some banks were thinking about moving to Golang because their technical leaders have watched Monzo talks on Golang, for some it was from Java to Kotlin, and some were thinking of dumping JavaScript for Typescript.</p>



<p>To come up with the answer I try to find answers to following questions in context of the organization:</p>



<ul><li>What is the maturity of the programming language with respect to its community and ecosystem? Should they spend their one innovation token on this language?</li><li>How easy it is to find available talent in the market for that programming language?&nbsp;</li><li>How easy it is for the organization to acquire production engineering know-how for a programming language?</li><li>What are the productivity and efficiency gains that can be achieved from using a programming language? Are those gains aligned with the organization goals?</li><li>What are the use-cases an organization wants to solve with the programming language?</li><li>What is the future of a programming language? For a big enterprise it is important if the language can last for a decade.</li><li>What is the learning curve of the programming language? Can existing staff be upskilled?</li></ul>



<p>There is no correct answer to these questions. Most engineering organizations will end up using multiple programming languages. For example an organization may choose Golang as a general purpose language to build backend services, Python for scripting and data related work, Typescript for building web frontend. It is also possible that an engineering organization might choose Python for building most services and for few where performance and efficiency is important it chooses Golang. I think the important point is defining a small list of programming languages for the organization and documenting when you will choose which programming language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I use a decision matrix like the one shown below to come up with one possible answer. Depending on which factors are important to the organization they can give them weights and that will impact the score of the language. In the image shown below, language 1 is the winner.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WGB2gGPDUN24IZXig5kZSGzKwcpwSIfP5dzPMp5gxTpIGw5g5rRlqcsWPSTYDY0QWf6U0D14oL9dfTeRZlDanEwK54XjJIirmMeIGTL62skChi8YxVTBZcpeJyRbnveFCKYW3d7U" alt=""></figure>



<p>As I was writing this post a few more questions came to my mind.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Does a programming language help us write less buggy software?</li><li>Does a programming language have some constructs that help us reduce the essential complexity of the system?</li><li>What constraints does a programming language impose and how do they impact the business goals?</li><li>Can a programming language be a competitive advantage for an organization?</li><li>Can a programming language influence the quality of the development team, the quality of code, and practices they follow?</li><li>Does a programming language influence engineering organization culture?</li><li>Can a programming language over time help average Joe become a good software engineer?</li><li>What makes a programming language future safe? Can we predict it to safeguard us?</li><li>Should a language choice depend on NFRs that you want to achieve?</li><li>How does a programming language influence behavior of a team?</li></ul>



<p>I don’t have answers to all of the above mentioned questions. I am hoping there is academic research done on the above but I am yet to read those papers.</p>



<p>I did some research on why different organizations choose certain languages and I found the following key points.</p>



<ol><li>Gitlab – Ruby – <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/10/29/why-we-use-rails-to-build-gitlab/">Link</a><ul><li>GitHub, a source of inspiration for GitLab, was also based on Rails, making it a logical pick considering his interest in the framework.</li><li>Ruby on Rails ecosystem allows you to shape a lot of functionality at a high quality</li><li>We need a lot of functionality and Ruby on Rails is a way to do it</li><li>Consistent coding practices.

There’s rarely any need to reason about or recreate the internal state of objects. Data moves through the system in a composable, inspectable, consistent, and immutable way (without hiding it inside of objects).</li><li>Functional code is much easier to test, and that gives us the confidence to deploy an average of over 50 changes per day in a mission-critical domain.</li><li>Nubank has acquired Cognitect, the US-based software consultancy behind the Clojure programming language and the Datomic database</li></ul></li><li>Janestreet – Ocaml – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1CmGbOGb2I">Link</a> , <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2038036">Link</a> , and <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/does-jane-street-use-other-programming-languages-aside-from-ocaml/2761/5">Link</a><ul><li>Brevity of the language and the powerful type system that makes OCaml code very readable</li><li>Powerful abstraction capabilities that reduce boilerplates</li><li>Static type system for ensuring code correctness</li><li>He spoke about some of the fancy type tricks like parametric polymorphism, algebraic data types, type inference, phantom types and type indexed values that add to the expressivity of code.</li><li>Also OCaml hits the sweet spot between expressiveness of code and the performance numbers.

          <p>February 12, 2021</p>

<p>Monty Python’s “Bicycle Repair Man” is a fitting allegory for the information security industry. It is filled with supermen and -women who fight bad guys with their super powers, such as threat hunting, attribution and TTPs. The big question however is, are enough of us looking after our own infrastructure, our “bicycles”?</p>

<p>The SolarWinds case is no different, as in the heat of the moment everybody is focused on attributing the malice and all things related. My position is that in addition, we should also pay attention to what may have led into this situation, which oftentimes simply is poor security posture due to a failure in people, processes or technology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even more precisely, the crux of the problem often lies in poor IT processes related to patching, access control or other “boring stuff”, such as keeping X.509 certificates from expiring.</p>

<h2 id="how-dare-you-say-that-out-loud">How dare you say that out loud?</h2>

<p>Simply, because for more than a decade I’ve been helping people in their mission to reduce incidence of suspected compromise, publicly exposed vulnerable services or open services which may be unintentionally exposed to the Internet - at nation scale and through automation.</p>



<p>SolarWinds is a company, whose mission is to make the IT administration simpler and more secure at scale. This is a great mission and I fault the company not with what they have built or how secure their products are.</p>

<p>The challenge seems to be the fact how well they have their own people, processes and technology in line with what they enable their customers to achieve through their products.</p>

<h2 id="can-you-show-me-the-proof">Can you show me the proof?</h2>

<p>Yes, as the proof is in the open for everyone to see. Look at their publicly available network assets and connect the dots between the assets and known vulnerabilities observed through Shodan. I did this with the help of our research into 86 specific known and vetted issues on Shodan and matched the data against the SolarWinds assets and the picture is quite clear and unflattering.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-you-singling-them-out">Why are you singling them out?</h2>

<p>Their case is actual and well known and if a tragedy on such a scale can contribute to the common good, then we should seize the opportunity. On 2021-01-12, we reached out to SolarWinds to confirm that the network assets we used for the evaluation actually belong to them. We even offered them the findings to help them mitigate them. Unfortunately, they did not respond to our requests and we are now publishing our results in this blog post.</p>

<p>Given the constraints I lay out below, they clearly have not done their due diligence and as a result we have this mess, where threat actors must have had a field day in gaining initial access to the company - no zero days needed.</p>

<p>I implore you to reflect that in addition to threat signatures and TTPs about the malice, we need to start looking at the security posture of organizations as well - and not just after a high profile breach such as this one. The information I present below after all, is public and most likely used by threat actors every single day.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the vulnerabilities I detail below, plague most organizations on the Internet. Picking three prominent US defense contractors at random, I found most of the same issues related to their network assets as well, namely General Dynamics, Harris Corporation or Northrop Grumman.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-the-evidence">So what’s the evidence?</h2>

<p>As stated above, I used the 86 vetted queries from Shodan against the publicly available network asset information related to SolarWinds. In essence, I used the same approach as the cyber rating companies do, which means that they rely in large part on publicly available IP network registration information when producing their ratings of you.</p>

<p>To be reproducible, the uncertainties related to the interpretation of the results must at least account for the following four things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>That the network asset in question belongs to the right party, which in this case study should be SolarWinds.</li>
  <li>That the service in question may be honeypot, whose intention is to monitor for scanning and/or exploitation of the emulated service.</li>
  <li>That the service implementation based version matching suffers from patch backporting, which means that the detection or assessment method cannot solely rely on a simple version banner.</li>
  <li>That the party doing the interpretation has to be able to understand the impact, as just having all the Shodan matches against a network asset alone makes interpretation difficult in practice.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-are-the-observations-then">What are the observations then?</h2>

<p>In this case, I used evidence from the last 6 months mapped against the publicly available network asset attributable to SolarWinds. Mapping the 86 topics against those assets with automation, I was able to detect seven distinct vulnerabilities in their infrastructure, as follows:</p>

<p><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/swell-rail.cloudvent.net/hash-store/0f84f98834724a9d07eea6fba20806d4.png" alt="" width="1390" height="532" data-cms-original-src="/images/content/image1-1.png"></p>

<h4 id="expired-x509">Expired X.509</h4>

<p>If you have ever done systems administration of any type of Internet facing services, you have battled against time and expiration of X.509 certificates, which prove the identity of your service to its users. You’re probably thinking right now that wait, we should be talking about vulnerabilities, about CVEs, right? Remote code execution, the sexy stuff. My favorite retort to that is the following: the Equifax data breach which exposed the PII of 147 million people was largely caused by expired X.509 certificates in critical monitoring systems.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="sslv2">SSLv2&nbsp;</h4>

<p>The arms race against crypt analysis has accelerated over the past couple of years. This means that cryptographic hashes or ciphers perfectly acceptable five years ago have become obsolete. SSL version 2 is a cryptographic protocol, which hasn’t met the requirement for Internet facing services for even longer. Its use was prohibited by RFC 6167 in 2011.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="exposed-snmp">Exposed SNMP&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Simple Network Management Protocol is very handy for gathering low-level information about networked devices and their status, especially in the switch and router space. As demonstrated by OUSPG PROTOS project in 2002, SNMP, whatever the version, is not and will not be a protocol fit for the Internet. Access to SNMP implementations must be access controlled to those devices, which are under your control, no matter which version of the protocol the device is speaking. Google “c06-snmp test suite” and assess the ramifications yourself, if you need more background on the issue. Moreover, threat actors have abused SNMP for reflected DDoS attacks for years, since sending a single spoofed UDP packet with the source address of the target will yield a huge amplification factor to their DDoS traffic.</p>

<h4 id="exposed-telnet">Exposed Telnet&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Before the advent of SSH, telnet was the de facto protocol for remote management or shell access to systems or devices. In 1995, a Finnish engineer called Tatu Ylönen invented SSH, which made the telnet obsolete overnight. 25 years later, however, telnet is still going strong for some reason. There simply is not any Internet facing use case for the service, period.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="exposed-mysql">Exposed MySQL&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Even if MySQL database engine is the de facto component as a backend service for many an Internet facing service, exposing it directly to the Internet without any further access control in front of it is inviting disaster. Recently, there was a major data breach in Finland, which allegedly resulted from the database backend being directly exposed to the Internet without any further access control in front of it. Layered security is not just a fancy buzz word. In many cases the database backend doesn’t even need to be reachable over the network at all, but when it does, access to it must be locked down to only those hosts, which actually need it.</p>

<h4 id="cve-2015-0204-aka-freak">CVE-2015-0204 a.k.a. FREAK</h4>

<p>Compliance with US cryptographic export controls lies at the heart of this vulnerability. An Internet facing service simply should not support negotiation of an encrypted connection, which is possible to decipher using $100 worth of cloud computing resources. We could even rename this vulnerability, man-in-the-middle made easy.</p>

<h4 id="cve-2019-10149">CVE-2019-10149&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Exim is a popular Mail Transfer Agent, MTA, used in many mostly linux-based servers. It has had a mottled history with information security and in 2019, a serious flaw was discovered in it, which leads to remote code execution. Please note that using this dork especially, one must understand the implication of backporting security fixes and how they are reflected in the version banner.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I know maintaining and repairing “bicycles” is tedious. This work, however, is the thing that will keep you safer and make it more difficult for the threat actors to attack you. I’m not saying that the threat actor’s initial access in the case of SolarWinds could’ve been prevented by addressing the specific issues I highlighted above, but it would’ve made it more difficult.</p>

<p>Building security in and making it layered is the only foundation you can build on that gives you predictability in a much more coherent way than investing in the magic security technology X that exploits the hype of the day. Building security in, means investing in people and processes as well.</p>

<p>One of the big challenges is that this type of information security work is not viewed as glorious or sought …</p></div></div>

                    <p>Much has been covered about developer salaries based on coding language, location, job title, and so on. However, little has been done to chart the rise and fall of developer salaries over the years.</p><p>Tracing developer salaries over the last 20 years was an interesting endeavor. Researching the topic meant changing the language I used to search for data. <br>Back in the early 2000s, tech and software were referred to as “Information Technology” (IT) or “Information and Communications Technology” (ICT), developers were still referred to as “IT workers” and little was mentioned about the many specialized roles we have today.</p><p>To go back in time, I mainly referred to data published by the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> as they offered the most comprehensive year on year data. I looked at data from alternate years, from 2001 to 2019.</p><h2 id="starting-in-the-year-2000">Starting in the year 2000</h2><p>At the turn of the century, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2000/07/21/career/q_degreecompsci/">CNN Money</a> reported that the average starting salary for an entry-level computer programmer was $40,800.</p><p>Fresh graduates were also paid differently based on the degrees they held:</p><ul><li>Computer engineering: $49,505</li><li>Computer science: $48,740</li><li>Information science: $38,900</li><li>Management information systems: $41,800</li></ul><p>Due to the shortage of skilled workers going into tech fields, salaries in America for IT graduates became more and more competitive. Salaries in 2000 were already 10% higher than the previous year and, apart from information science majors, were well above the <a href="https://www.naceweb.org/job-market/compensation/salary-trends-through-salary-survey-a-historical-perspective-on-starting-salaries-for-new-college-graduates">national average starting salary</a> of $39,824.</p><figure><img src="https://codesubmit.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/cs-grads-2000-2.png"><figcaption>The "IT Industry" looked different in 2000 than it does today</figcaption></figure><p>The following table shows the average annual salary for developers, programmers, and other IT-related job functions, across all industries in the year 2000:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

That year, while wages did not fall despite the dot-com burst, around 400,000 Americans working in IT-related roles lost their jobs going into 2001.</p><p>2008 was when the stock market crashed. Similar to the dot-com burst in 2001, wages in 2008 remained relatively unchanged. However, roughly 111,000 Americans working in IT-related fields lost their jobs going into 2009. </p><p>2008 was also the year when wages began to increase at a slower rate compared to previous years. While individuals enjoyed an average of $5,000 increase every two years previously, after 2008, wages only increased by $2,000 every two years. </p><p>Generally speaking, from 2001 to 2011, individuals working in tech had at least a 21% increase in wages over time. Systems Software Engineers experienced the largest jump in wages, an increase of 35%.</p><p><strong>Average salary increase from 2001-2011:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-to-expect-in-the-future">What to expect in the future</h2><p>In the years to come, industry experts expect <a href="https://medium.com/predict/are-programmers-headed-toward-another-bursting-bubble-528e30c59a0e">low-level coding and programming jobs to become obsolete</a> with the development of new tools that remove the need to code completely. Take for example the role of Web Developers when it comes to building websites. With popular CMS tools like WordPress and Squarespace, almost anyone can build a website for their business, reducing the need for people who know “just a little bit of front end web development”. </p><p>As automation takes away the need for “basic” coding jobs, new skills or a combination of skills will be needed in the future for roles that don’t even exist yet. The need for field experts and true problem solvers will never disappear. The key is to adapt and learn as new technologies emerge. </p><p><strong>Additional sources:</strong><br><a href="http://www.oecd.org/digital/ieconomy/1939833.pdf">OECD Technology Outlook Report 2000</a><br><a href="http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/37620123.pdf">OECD Technology Outlook Report 2004</a><br><a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/it_outlook-2010-sum-en.pdf?expires=1612698150&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=7DC9765AA37510F78D7BBDA7FF42254D">OECD Information Technology Outlook Summary 2010</a><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iGfVr1j-VStKVwSWvVvSo3qbwwHTL_V9tPttpeBTmK4/edit?usp=sharing">BLS data in Google Sheets</a></p>

<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[00:00] Good morning today I have with me, Kan Yilmaz. Welcome to ManagersClub.</p>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[00:06] Thank you, Vidal.</p>



<h2>About Metrics</h2>



<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[00:07] Kan you are an expert in engineering metrics. I was really impressed that the discussion we had about engineering metrics last week. Could you tell people how did you get so interested in engineering metrics?</p>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[00:20] It wasn’t specifically about engineering metrics. What made me interested in this topic was there were engineers, and we are proud to say that we are logical. We acknowledge data, and we make decisions better based off of data. But once we look into an engineering organization, the application yes, we have lots of data, and we make really good decisions on the application. </p>



<p>But once we go into the process of how do we actually do this engineering process? We don’t have the data, and we don’t use anything. Everything is mostly based on gut feeling. And that made me uncomfortable. I wanted to figure out why engineering among all different organizational teams, such as sales or marketing, did not use any data, whereas every single other one did. So I went into that problem, and that led me to metrics itself.</p>



<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[01:19] How long have you been working in this field of engineering data and metrics?</p>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[01:24] So I had been working on this for more than a year and a half full-time talking to people of understanding why they are using metrics. What is the reason and how does it make our lives better?</p>



<h2>The Goal of Metrics</h2>



<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[01:39] What is the goal of metrics? Why should we care about these?</p>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[01:43] Why do we track anything? Why do we have metrics? The base reason is to align people to a specific goal. For companies, this is revenue. We have a single goal, to make sure that the company is profitable. That is our metric to track.</p>



<p>And this goes into every different even if you’re like having, let’s say you want to lose weight, you have a goal. And the metric represents that, which is how many kilos are you at the moment? For engineering, this was missing. So I was really interested in what should the engineering organization track.</p>



<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[02:21] You’ve also spoken with hundreds of engineering managers.&nbsp; And that’s how we connected. What are some common mistakes or misunderstandings that managers have on this topic?</p>



<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[02:32] So there are a few mistakes that they do. The first one is the obvious one, which is big brother. You’re tracking all of my actions, and that sounds like big brother. You don’t want to be tracked — it feels from an engineer’s perspective, it doesn’t feel good. And there’s a reason for this. People have tracked engineers with the wrong metrics. There’s this guy called <a href="https://amzn.to/39W8NhG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Eliyahu Goldratt. He wrote the book, The Goal.</a> And in his book, he specifically mentioned that <strong>if you track anybody with metrics that can not control that they won’t care.</strong></p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/2N4jp5f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519C2Gz-v2L.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519C2Gz-v2L.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></a></figure></div>



<p>And that is what happens in engineering metrics. They try to track engineers with metrics that they don’t control. That is the biggest mistake that I have seen. The second biggest mistake is tracking metrics, which doesn’t and result into the organization success. </p>



<p>So an example of this is the number of commits. That has no correlation whatsoever with the company’s success, and a lot of companies track the number of commits and other ones lines of code. These are numbers. You can track them, but it doesn’t mean anything, and it won’t make your company successful because of this. The engineers themselves —&nbsp; they know it internally. They know that it doesn’t represent the company’s success and they feel like “I’m just being tracked by an arbitrary number.” And it goes back into something that doesn’t matter. </p>



<p>So you need to make sure that you’re tracking two different things. One is that the team can control those metrics. The second point is those metrics actually align with the company’s goals.</p>



<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[04:13] I think that’s a great point. Yes. If you can’t really control the metric, what do you, what are you going to do? Just pray that it changes? </p>



<h2>Two Best Practices</h2>



<p><strong>Vidal:</strong> We talked about some of the mistakes people make. What do you understand to be some of the best practices? What should people do?</p>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[04:26] Specifically for engineering teams, I will be by default, I’ll mention about product engineering. That is where we have figured out what metrics to track. I don’t know about R &amp; D or other departments of engineering, so there’s a distinction between that for product engineering, what are the best practices of tracking.</p>



<p>It goes into the team level. <strong>If you track the individual level, what happens usually is you don’t get the signal of the process. You get the signal of the person, and it’s a shaky number.</strong> A person might work hard today, but tomorrow they might do design, and the next day they might actually have lots of meetings.</p>



<p>And if you try to track it by a single number, you’ll get lots of spiky graphs and that won’t result into actionable results. But if you do that in team level, You will actually get a really good understanding of what the process is. And if I do any kind of iteration in my process, you can see that change in that team’s habits and in that team’s metrics. So that is one best practice that I can say. <strong>Don’t track individuals, track teams</strong>. </p>



<p>The second best practice is, this goes into the mistakes as well, make sure that the team can control the metric itself. Most of the teams that I have seen tried to put product metrics inside engineering organizations.</p>



<p>How I will describe it in this way, monthly active users. I have seen quite a few engineering teams being judged on monthly active users. There are other metrics such as JIRA tasks completed, or it’s usually goes into story points completed. Story points completed is again, it looks fine. You think that it represents the delivery of that specific team.</p>



<p>The problem with story points is it’s inaccurate. It’s inaccurate because the engineers do not fill it in at the correct time. And this produces such a chaotic environment where you don’t get actionable insights from tracking story points to be able to do that. </p>



<p>There is a workaround. It’s not like you cannot do it. You can do it. You need to make sure that story points are accurate and people are not gaming. So there are, those are a bit hard problems to solve. I have seen people solving those problems but <strong>I would generally recommend not tracking product-related metrics for engineering.</strong></p>



<p>There are much, much better metrics to track.&nbsp; We can go over that if you want.</p>



<h2>Metrics for Product Engineering Teams</h2>



<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[07:00] I’d like to. I think that’s a great point you make about confusing the product metrics.&nbsp; What are some of the appropriate metrics to track for product engineering teams?</p>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[07:10] Okay. Let’s go from the fundamentals again. Back to the conversational starting point. I said the metrics they need to represent organization success. What that means is decreased churn, increased revenue. What metrics represent this? </p>



<p>In product engineering, imagine a car. This is the product itself, the organization itself. The driver is the product manager. They can make decisions on where to go on the road. But they don’t decide on the speed. The speed is decided by engineering.&nbsp;The engineering organization is the engine of this car. And how do we make sure that the car goes fast?</p>



<p>That is the <strong>number of successful iterations</strong>. <strong>That is the core metric that product engineering teams should track</strong>. What does the number of successful iterations mean? The number of iterations is quite obvious in the sense of, okay, if I do a deployment, then I did an iteration. I gave value to customers. </p>



<p>But if you just track that metric, what happens is we have seen this in multiple companies. The engineering manager says, “Hey let’s iterate faster. How can we iterate faster?” And the team response. “Let’s not write&nbsp;tests. We spend 20% of our time writing tests…” and that doesn’t work out. Then you have a faulty product.</p>



<p>It’s not a successful iteration. The customer didn’t get value from that deployment. You need to make sure that the iteration is fast and it’s successful. So what are the metrics to track these? I would Put this into five different metrics.&nbsp; I’ll take one step back. I’ll represent this into two different categories.</p>



<p>One product engineering, second DevOps team. I will focus on product engineering and they have four different metrics. It divides into speed and quality. Just like I said, number of successful iterations. The speed part is deployment frequency and cycle time. <strong>Deployment frequency</strong> is how often do you deploy? That’s quite obvious by itself. </p>



<p>Then we go to <strong>cycle time</strong>. Cycle time can be tracked into different ways. Some people track it from JIRA, a single task. How long did it take for a single JIRA task to complete? The second way to track it is how long did a single pull request take to complete by complete I mean start to deployment.</p>



<p>In pull request, you can do this by first commits to production. In JIRA, it can start from triaged to production as well one nuance there is the JIRA. One might not be accurate because engineers it’s like an extra process.&nbsp; It’s not in their habits to track.</p>



<p>Make sure that the JIRA task is correctly tagged, but Github one pull requests. It’s in their habit, it’s in their workflow. They make sure that pull request is tagged correctly because they don’t actually control the tag. They just behave normally and you can get that data from it. So I would recommend specifically focusing on pull requests, but JIRA is also a way to track cycle time.</p>



<p>So what I have talked about was speed, deployment frequency, and cycle time. Now we can go to <strong>quality metrics</strong>, which also divides into two different categories. The pair of deployment frequency is hotfixes. It is called <strong>change failure rates</strong>…</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><h2 id="h-kubernetes-is-deprecating-docker">Kubernetes is Deprecating Docker?!</h2><p>For some time now, it seems that when people think of containers, they think of <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/introduction-to-containers-and-docker">Docker</a> and <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/kubernetes-deep-dive">Kubernetes</a>. Docker has been the big name when it comes to building and running containers, and Kubernetes has been the big name when it comes to managing and orchestrating them. It might seem a bit shocking to hear that Kubernetes is deprecating support for Docker as a container runtime starting with Kubernetes version 1.20.</p><p>So, I want to take this opportunity to talk about what this change really means, and what Kubernetes users will need to do about it.</p><figure><p> <iframe title="Kubernetes This Month: Container usage in production goes through the roof!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KzCaCBIgGvI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure><h2 id="h-what-s-changing">What’s Changing?</h2><p>Kubernetes deprecating Docker is actually not as big of a deal as it sounds, so let’s talk about what is really going on here.</p><p>Kubernetes is removing support for Docker as a <strong>container runtime</strong>. Kubernetes does not actually handle the process of running containers on a machine. Instead, it relies on another piece of software called a <strong>container runtime</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZdkIrgRa5Kx9RkYvsf_MitDSotGYiXP1dwpSE03SitQcSuHrk8VHKjGr5Mkdo8OXtoFsQpYv4UNaLw7xXLlbcYvvUDNyFM_Tcx2ussVCo7E9Z_aNj_NeN2AXJmLESV60PSp7hfVf" alt=""></figure><p>The container runtime runs containers on a host, and Kubernetes tells the container runtime on each host what to do. You can actually choose from a variety of options when it comes to what software you want to use as your container runtime when running Kubernetes. Up to now, a fairly popular option was to use Docker as the container runtime.</p><p>However, this will no longer be an option in the future. You will still be able to use Docker in other ways that are relevant to Kubernetes (more on that in a moment), but you will not be able to use Docker as the container runtime underneath Kubernetes.</p><h2 id="h-why-is-kubernetes-deprecating-docker">Why is Kubernetes Deprecating Docker?</h2><p>Kubernetes has supported using Docker a container runtime up to this point, so why are they choosing to stop supporting it?</p><p>Kubernetes works with all container runtimes that implement a standard known as the <strong>Container Runtime Interface (CRI)</strong>. This is essentially a standard way of communicating between Kubernetes and the container runtime, and any runtime that supports this standard automatically works with Kubernetes.</p><p>Docker does not implement the Container Runtime Interface (CRI). In the past, there weren’t as many good options for container runtimes, and Kubernetes implemented the Docker shim, an additional layer to serve as an interface between Kubernetes and Docker. Now, however, there are plenty of runtimes available that implement the CRI, and it no longer makes sense for Kubernetes to maintain special support for Docker.</p><h2 id="h-what-s-really-going-on">What’s Really Going On?</h2><p>To really understand why it makes sense for Kubernetes to deprecate Docker, we need to go a little deeper.</p><p>I’ll let you in on a secret: <strong>Docker is not actually a container runtime</strong>! It’s actually a collection of tools that sits on top of a container runtime called <strong>containerd</strong>.</p><p>That’s right! Docker does not run containers directly. It simply creates a more human-accessible and feature-rich interface on top of a separate, underlying container runtime. When it is used as a container runtime for Kubernetes, Docker is just a middle-man between Kubernetes and containerd.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qAs7sRi19J_vdE9NYNyZ5MZp8rFoV4aNUmn4aGtrc4zJXsgA_Not2cG68ut6XAXxVFAiBDyK-zp7FO6-sdcFv2obvfIxBrkcsawBisG7IKirWP4ODOlwP0kz1V9vNn_TbXAhaGKz" alt=""></figure><p>However, Kubernetes can use containerd directly as a container runtime, meaning Docker is no longer needed in this middle-man role. Docker still has a lot to offer, even in a Kubernetes ecosystem. It’s just not needed specifically as a container runtime.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cNGPBxKBF4_Vm_WvKM4QWqXGrX4LqgaJfUUxVycD3d5XPuyXS8aWH8zeEooL--2MSDUhKzOmwCdYPGo6Zpga0xIk3EzyNq2fyDbHc0akoGLbBfnymOODbDPHh2zAhHzvdvsFxUxS" alt=""></figure><h2 id="h-what-s-the-role-of-docker-going-forward">What’s the Role of Docker Going Forward?</h2><p>Although Docker is not needed as a container runtime in Kubernetes, it still has a role to play in the Kubernetes ecosystem, and in your workflow.</p><p>Docker is still going strong as a tool for developing and building container images, as well as running them locally. Kubernetes can still run containers built using Docker’s <strong>Open Container Initiative (OCI) </strong>image format, meaning you can still use Dockerfiles and build your container images using Docker.</p><p>Kubernetes will also continue to be able to pull from Docker registries (such as Docker hub). This means that Docker will remain a powerful contender when it comes to managing the images once they are built.</p><p>All in all, Docker will continue to be a useful tool on your development workflows and continuous integration (CI) systems, even if you don’t need it to run your containers underneath Kubernetes in production.</p><hr><p><em>Looking to get certified on K8s? Read our <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/which-kubernetes-certification-path-should-i-take">blueprint for the Kubernetes certification journey</a>. </em></p><hr><h2 id="h-what-should-i-do">What Should I Do?</h2><p>&nbsp;If you are currently using Docker as a container runtime in your Kubernetes environment, you will need to make some changes. Moving forward, you can simply eliminate Docker as a middle-man in your Kubernetes environment. Instead, use another container runtime, such as <a href="https://containerd.io/">containerd</a> or <a href="https://cri-o.io/">CRI-O</a>.</p><p>Before upgrading to a Kubernetes version removes support for Docker (which is currently estimated to release in late 2021), you will need to modify (or replace) existing Kubernetes nodes so that they use a supported container runtime other than Docker. Starting now, you may want to start building any new nodes so that they use a non-Docker container runtime as well.</p><p>Other than that, nothing is really changing. You can continue to use Docker to build your images, as well as to run containers locally for development purposes, or in your continuous integration (CI) stack. You can also continue to use Docker registries to store and manage your images.</p><p>If you are interested in learning how to use containerd alongside Kubernetes, check out my new course, <a href="https://acloud.guru/overview/introduction-to-kubernetes">Introduction to Kubernetes</a>. It includes lessons that will walk you through the process of installing containerd and using it in your Kubernetes cluster.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><b>Researchers at the RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research in Japan have discovered a recipe for continuous cyclical regeneration of cultured hair follicles from hair follicle stem cells.</b></p>
<p>Scientists have been making waves in recent years by developing ways to grow a variety of useful items in laboratories, from meat and diamonds to retinas and other organoids. At the RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research in Japan, a team led by Takashi Tsuji has been working on ways to regenerate lost hair from stem cells. In an important step, a new study identifies a critical population of hair follicle stem cells in the skin and a recipe for normal cyclical hair regeneration in the lab.</p>
<p>The researchers took fur and whisker cells from mice and cultured them in the laboratory with other biological “ingredients”. They used 220 combinations of ingredients, and found that combining a type of collagen with five factors — the NFFSE medium — led to the highest rate of stem cell amplification in the shortest period of time.</p>
<p>Hair growth in mammals is a continuous cyclical process in which hair grows, falls out, and is grown again. Growth occurs in the anagen phase and hair falls out in the telogen phase. Thus, a successful hair-regeneration treatment must produce hair that recycles. To test whether stem cells cultured in the NFFSE medium produce hair that cycles, the researchers placed bioengineered hair follicle stem cells in NFFSE medium or in medium missing one of the ingredients and observed the regenerated hair for several weeks. They found 81% of hair follicles generated in NFFSE medium went through at least three hair cycles and produced normal hair. In contrast, 79% of follicles grown in the other medium produced only one hair cycle.</p>
<p>Knowing that stem-cell renewal can depend on what is attached to the outside of the cells, the researchers next looked for markers on the surface of cells cultured in the NFFSE medium. In addition to the expected CD34 and CD49f markers, they found the best hair cycling was related to the addition of Itgβ5. “We found almost 80% of follicles reached three hair cycles when Itgβ5 was also bioengineered into the hair follicle germ,” explains first author Makoto Takeo. “In contrast, only 13% reached three cycles when it was not present.” Analysis showed that these important cells are naturally located in the upper part of the hair follicle’s bulge region.</p>
<p>“Our culture system establishes a method for cyclical regeneration of hair follicles from hair follicle stem cells,” says Tsuji, “and will help make hair follicle regeneration therapy a reality in the near future.” As preclinical animal-safety tests using these cultured cells were completed in 2019, the next step in the process is clinical trials.</p>
<p>“RIKEN is primarily an institute that does basic research,” explains Tsuji. “And clinical trials usually require outside collaborators. We are therefore looking for a partner company to help develop the clinical applications and welcome donations to promote the R&amp;D.”</p>

For this reason, I thought it would be better to start by explaining how this console displays images and then go through the internal hardware.</p><h4 id="projecting-an-image">Projecting an image</h4><p>Once you switch the Virtual Boy on, you will start seeing two <strong>monochromatic red</strong> pictures (one for each eye) through the eyepiece. So far so good? Well, here is the interesting part: <strong>This console doesn’t have a screen</strong>, so what you see is more of an ‘illusion’ - Let’s dive deeper to know what’s going on.</p><p>The topics involved in explaining this (optics, visual phenomenons, etc) may feel difficult at first, but I constructed some interactive animations to make this section little more immersive.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-scanner-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-scanner">Scanner</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-mechanics-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-mechanics">Mechanics</a></li><li id="tab-2-3-display-link"><a href="#tab-2-3-display">Display</a></li><li id="tab-2-4-active-periods-link"><a href="#tab-2-4-active-periods">Active periods</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-scanner"><h4>Scanner</h4><p>The large volume of this console can be attributed to the <strong>Scanner</strong>, which fills up a big part of it. The Scanner is the area of the Virtual Boy that displays images. It’s composed of two <strong>Display units</strong>, each one independently projects a frame (giving a total of two frames, one per eye).</p><p>A Display unit is where all the ‘magic’ happens, it’s made of the following components:</p><ul><li>An <strong>LED Unit</strong>: Contains 224 red LEDs stacked vertically and the necessary circuitry to control each one of them.</li><li>A <strong>Lens</strong>: Refracts the light coming from the LEDs.<ul><li>At the top of the Virtual Boy’s case, there is a <strong>Focus slider</strong> used to shift the lenses closer or further away from the LEDs. This allows the user to adapt the console to their focal length (preventing blurry images).</li></ul></li><li>A <strong>Mirror</strong>: Reflects the light coming from the lens and directs them to the user’s eyes. Furthermore, this component will be constantly oscillating thanks to a <strong>Voice coil motor</strong> connected to it. The motor is managed by the <strong>Servo control</strong>, a separate board which sends electrical pulses at 50 Hz.<ul><li>All in all, this is a very complex and fragile area of the console, so there’s a photo interrupter (a type of photosensor) installed. This reports the oscillation observed from the mirror to the Servo control, which in turns monitors the oscillations and applies the necessary corrections.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Next to the focus slider there is a <strong>IPD dial</strong> (knob-shaped switch), which adjust the distance between the two Display units. This is done to adapt the displays to the user’s inter-pupil distance.</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-mechanics"><h4>Mechanics</h4><div><figcaption>Basic representation of the angle of the oscillating mirror over time (at a very slow motion)<br>The left and right LEDs are operating (active) during the red and blue period, respectively<br>During the grey period, no LED is operating (idle)<br>For sake of simplicity, the angular velocity represented here is constant (but not in the real world)</figcaption></div><p>Now that we have each component identified, let’s take a look how the Virtual Boy manages to show images to our eyes.</p><p>If you haven’t noticed before, there <strong>isn’t any dot-matrix display to be found</strong>, so why are we seeing two-dimensional images from the eyepiece? Similarly to the functioning of a CRT monitor, Display units play with the way we perceive images:</p><ul><li>The fact the mirrors oscillate enables a single column of LEDs to displace horizontally between our field of view. The angle of the mirror is strategically directed to place the LEDs on 384 different ‘column positions’ distributed across our field of view.</li><li>Human vision is logarithmic and the mirror oscillates at <strong>50 Hz</strong> (each period takes 20 ms). This is so fast we end up perceiving 384 columns of LEDs illuminating at the same time (afterimage effect) until the mirror stops oscillating.</li><li>All of this is perfectly synchronised with the LED controller, which updates each LED bulb every time the mirror is slightly moved. Thus, we end up seeing a full picture coming from the eyepiece.</li></ul><p>In practice, there are some conditions for all these principles to work:</p><ul><li>The LEDs must only operate when the angular velocity of the mirror is stable (in other words, not when the mirror is changing direction). This can be thought of as the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#tab-2-4-result"><strong>Active State</strong></a> of a CRT monitor.</li><li>In relation to the previous point, the angular velocity of the mirror can’t stay constant (since the mirror can’t change direction instantly, the periods considered ‘stable’ will be subject to forces that will disrupt its velocity). To remedy this, the Virtual Boy stores a list of values in memory called <strong>Column Table</strong> which instructs how much time to dedicate for each column interval, in an effort to balance out excessive &amp; insufficient periods of ‘LED column’ exposure.</li><li>Let’s not forget that this whole process has to be done twice since we got two display units (one per eye). Unfortunately, both units can’t pull energy and data at the same time, so each one operates at different display periods (out-of-phase, 10ms apart). We don’t notice this (another illusion!).</li></ul></div><div id="tab-2-3-display"><h4>Display</h4><div><figcaption>Simplified representation of how the first LED unit operates during specific periods of time. Notice how the LEDs will start displaying each column of the frame-buffer during active periods.</figcaption></div><p>Contrary to previous video chips modelled after CRT displays (i.e. <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#graphics">PPU</a> and <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#graphics">VGP</a>), graphics on the Virtual Boy are <strong>not rendered on-the-fly</strong>. The graphics chip on this console sends the processed frame to a frame-buffer in memory, each column of the frame is then sent to the LED array for display.</p><p>Once the Servo board detects it’s time for display, the graphics chip will start sending columns of pixels from the frame-buffer to those 224 vertically-stacked LEDs, one-by-one in a strategically synchronised matter so the LEDs will have shown 384 columns during the display period. Hence, the ‘screen resolution’ of this console is 384x224 pixels.</p><p>Moreover, we need to store two frame-buffers since each one will go to a different display unit. The graphics subsystem also employs double-buffering and other quirks (mentioned later in the ‘Graphics’ section). So, for now, just remember how a digital frame is sent to the LEDs.</p></div><div id="tab-2-4-active-periods"><h4>Active periods</h4><div><figcaption>Another simplified animation, this time showing how the oscillation of the mirror deviates the LEDs light in a way the user will end up seeing a proper frame</figcaption></div><p>Consequently of this design, there are going to be periods of:</p><ul><li><strong>Active Display</strong> during which the LEDs are pulling an image from the frame-buffer and nothing can disrupt it.</li><li><strong>Active Display 2</strong>: Same as before but now the other Display unit is operating.</li><li><strong>Drawing idle</strong>: A period where none of the LEDs are operating and the angular velocity of the mirror is unstable.</li></ul><p>This cycle is repeated 50 times per second (hence the 50 Hz refresh rate). That means that for every frame, the CPU and GPU would have around 10ms worth of time to update the picture that the user will see. In reality, Nintendo’s engineers implemented something more sophisticated. Again, I’ll try to explain this with more depth in the ‘Graphics’ section. But for now I hoped you got a good understanding of how the Virtual Boy cleverly managed to produce a picture with inexpensive hardware.</p></div></div></div><p>This has been a quick explanation of how optics can turn a single vertical line into a picture. If you own or have read about the Virtual Boy before, you may be wondering when the three-dimensional imagery takes place. I just want to make it clear that none of the previous explanation have a connection with that effect. I’m mentioning this because in the past I’ve seen many places arguing that the oscillating mirrors are the cause of the ‘depth perception’, however, with all the information I’ve gathered in this study, I don’t think that claim is accurate.</p><p>That being said, I think it’s time we discuss the 3D phenomenon…</p><h4 id="creating-a-third-dimensional-vision">Creating a third-dimensional vision</h4><p>During the marketing of the Virtual Boy, there was a lot of fanfare regarding the fact this console could project a ‘3D world’. I’m not referring to images with 3D polygons stamped (like the other 5th gen. consoles), but the actual perception of depth.</p><p>In a nutshell, the Virtual Boy relies on <strong>Stereoscopic images</strong> to carry out that illusion. So this system wasn’t only capable of toying with our vision to project a full image, but it also did it in a way we would think certain drawings are closer/far away from others!</p><div><div><figcaption>Snapshot of the game seen from the different display units<br>Mario's Tennis (1995)</figcaption></div><p>The technique is very simple: Each of the two frames displayed (one on each eye) will have some elements slightly shifted horizontally, so when we try to see them with our two eyes, our brain will think they are nearer than others. This depends on the direction the elements are shifted.</p><p>Objects shifted towards the centre of your eyes (moved right on the left frame and moved left on the right frame) will appear closer, objects shifted away from the center of your eyes will appear further away. Finally, objects with no shifting will appear between the two other. This approach is called <strong>Stereoscopic parallax</strong>.</p></div><p>One of the drawbacks of stereoscopy is <strong>eyestrain</strong>. This was alleviated by the fact games provided an ‘automatic pause’ system which reminded the user to take breaks every 30 min. Nintendo also wrote down various warning messages in their packaging and …</p></div></div></div>

<p>This is the continuation of the second part of a three part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/05/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iia-the-many-faces-of-battle/">IIa</a>, III) discussion of the notion that there is a ‘universal warrior’ – a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of useful blueprint for life generally or some sort of fundamental truth about the experience of war.</p>



<p><a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/05/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iia-the-many-faces-of-battle/">We started this section last week </a>by looking at the forms of war along with the direct emotional experience of combat.  What we found is that, quite to the contrary of there being just one sort of war that ‘never changes,’ there are in fact multiple <em>systems</em> of war that function quite differently (with considerable variation both within and between those systems) to the point that armies often find opponents working from within a different system of war almost utterly alien to them.</p>



<p>Moreover, as we discussed, the experience of battle, not merely the technology, tactics and circumstances, but the <em>raw emotional experience</em> (taken in terms of courage and fear) wasn’t constant either.  Different cultures understood ‘courage’ differently (and we must remember that translation here can be deceiving – most of them didn’t understand ‘courage’ at all, they understood <em>andreia</em> or <em>fortis </em>or <em>corage</em> or <em>der Mut</em> or <em>woohitike</em> which are, in the end, subtly different things and so not quite ever exactly courage at all) and different battles imposed different sorts of fear which strained those combatants in different ways.</p>



<p>Now we’re going to keep soldiering on and look at some of the other factors of the war experience: the importance of comrades, the drudgery and toil of war, and of course wounds (both physical and mental) and their healing.  Once again, to abuse the opening lines of the <em>Fallout</em> series, we going to ask if it is really true that “War, war never changes.”</p>

<h2>The Ties that Bind</h2>



<p>What about the personal relationships that are formed in the context of conflict?  Surely, the ‘band of brothers’ is a truly universal experience, right (<a href="https://youtu.be/76_Q9ruJfrE">but note on the complexities of Shakespeare’s <em>Henry V</em></a>)?  Surely the social bonds that held<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Brothers_(miniseries)"> Easy-Company</a> together in 1944 and 1945 are the same as those from 1415?  Or 415?</p>



<p>Well, no.  Not quite.</p>



<p>We can approach this question through the idea of cohesion – the moral force that holds a group of combatants together on the battlefield under the intense emotional stresses of combat.  The intense bonds that soldiers form in modern armies (particularly those in the European pattern) are not an accident, but a core part of how those armies, institutionally, seek to build cohesion.  Going back to last week, we discussed briefly the emergence of the extensively drilled and disciplined ‘mechanical’ soldier of Early Modern Europe, noting that this approach wasn’t necessary for the effective use of firearms (the Ottoman Janissaries, for instance, were quite good with firearms, but were not trained and organized in this way), but rather was a product of elite aristocratic (read: officer) disdain for their up-jumped peasant soldiers and thus the assumption by those aristocrats that the only way to get such men to fight effectively was to relentlessly drill them.</p>

<p>Now the funny thing about this system is that it clearly <em>worked</em>, but not for the reasons its aristocratic pioneers believed.  It was only really after the Second World War that systematic study began to be made of unit cohesion (e.g. S.L.A. Marshall, <em>Men Against Fire</em> (1947), though subsequent literature on the topic is voluminous and Marshal’s work has its problems, but its conclusions are broadly accepted having been confirmed in subsequent studies).  What emerged quite clearly was that it wasn’t ‘the cause’ or patriotism that held troops together under fire, but group cohesion born out of an intense need not to let fellow soldiers in the unit down.  In short, what held units together and made them fight more effectively was (in part, there are many conclusions in <em>Men Against Fire</em>) the strong social bonds between comrades.</p>



<p>And, in fact, the drill and discipline of early modern European armies unintentionally did quite a lot of cohesion building things.  Soldiers were removed from civilian society (isolation from larger groups builds unit cohesion), split into very small groups (keeping the core group that coheres below <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s number</a> aids in group cohesion; thus <a href="https://youtu.be/a15gihWu1SM">why the platoon is a natural unit size</a>) and then pushed through difficult and unpleasant training (that drill and discipline) creating a sense of unique shared experience and sacrifice.  All of which doesn’t render men <em>machines</em>, but it does create strong social bonds within the units that will keep the men fighting even when they care little for their cause (which they generally did in this period; one does not find a super-abundance of patriotism among, say, the Army of Flanders).</p>



<p>And there is a tendency to point to this cohesion, its modern source in ‘toughening’ boot camp and to say, ‘aha!  That is the true universal about effective soldier-warriors!’  Except – and you knew there was going to be an except – except it isn’t.  Systems built on the use of drill and discipline for the development of unit cohesion through social bonds are actually, historically speaking, quite rare.  We see systems like that in use by the Romans from the Middle Republic forward (but significantly faded by the end of late antiquity; the Byzantine army doesn’t seem to function this way), in China from the Han Dynasty onward, in Japan for the <em>ashigaru</em> infantry from the Sengoku period, and in Europe from the Early Modern period.  That <em>sounds</em> like a lot, but that is relatively small minority of the historical period and even then in a relatively small minority of places.  It is, for instance, a period that only covers about half of the historical period in Western Europe, the place most often associated with this very system of organization (though that association is perhaps unfair to East Asia).</p>



<p>Instead, most societies relied on existing social bonds formed <em>outside</em> of the experience of war for cohesion.  Greek hoplite armies, for instance, generally formed up by <em>polis</em> (read: city) and then within those blocks by still smaller and smaller social divisions, so that family and neighbors would be standing shoulder to shoulder in the battle line (Sparta does this through the system of communal messes, the <em>syssitia</em>, but the idea that you fought alongside the men you dined with socially – your neighbors, generally – was perfectly normal in most Greek cities).  That was intentional – it allowed the phalanx to cohere through the social pressure not to be seen as a coward before the men who meant the most to you, whose shaming gaze you would have to endure in civilian life.  The same pressures, by the well, held together the (mostly volunteer) armies of the American Civil War (on this, see, McPherson, <em>For Cause and Comrades</em> (1997)).</p>



<p>By contrast, ‘warrior’ classes often rely on a sort of class solidarity along with the demand of an individual military aristocrat to be <em>individually</em> militarily excellent.  Richard Kaeuper quips of the literature of the medieval knightly class that it was filled with “utterly tireless, almost obsessional emphasis placed on personal prowess” (R.W. Kaeuper, <em>Chivalry and Violence in Medieval Europe</em> (1999)).  We’ve talked a fair bit about the values of mounted aristocrats, both in <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/">their </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/10/collections-antarah-ibn-shaddad-victory-songs/">role </a>as combatants and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/06/12/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-vii-hanging-by-a-thread/">in their roles as generals </a>and those values are relatively disconnected from discipline-induced forms of buddy-cohesion.  Of course exactly what ‘good generalship’ or ‘good officership’ looks like varies wildly from place to place – Alexander was expected to command his cavalry from the front; Roman emperors rarely took the battlefield and when they did they commanded from the rear since it would be foolish to risk the ‘brain’ of the army in personal combat and in any event someone at the front of a cavalry charge can hardly direct the rest of the army.</p>



<p>One of the things I find most striking about the ‘warrior ethos’ advanced by writers like Pressfield is that it accepts as normal the unique nature of the bonds that hold soldiers together in battle, assuming this bond and its shared sacrifice to be at once unique to combat and also transcendent to all combatants.  But one of the key points made very well in Sebastian Junger’s <em>War </em>(2010) and later <em>Tribe</em> (2016) is just how <em><strong>strange</strong></em> that experience is, historically.  <strong>Junger notes that in earlier societies, soldiers would have returned from war into communities </strong>(often small, agricultural communities or tribal communities) <strong>every bit as close-knit as the infantry platoon – and indeed, often involving <em>literally the same people</em> as the infantry platoon</strong>.  Instead, the intense feeling of uniqueness that modern soldiers feel about the bonds of combat is because of the historically unusual deracination produced by modern societies by the industrial revolution and the post-industrial period.</p>



<p>And Junger’s point is born out quite clearly when looking at the myriad of historical societies where those non-combat social bonds were the basis of the principles of military cohesion, be it the small-town cohesion of the hoplite phalanx or the class-based-expectation cohesion of a group of knights, or (for that matter) later modern …</p></div></div>

<p>Elliptic curve cryptography is a modern <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/public-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">public-key&nbsp;encryption&nbsp;</a>technique based on mathematical elliptic curves and is well-known for creating smaller, faster, and more efficient cryptographic keys. For example, <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://bitcoin.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> uses ECC as its asymmetric cryptosystem because of its lightweight nature.</p>
<p>In this introduction to ECC, I want to focus on the high-level ideas that make <a aria-label="ECC (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography" target="_blank">ECC</a> work. For the purposes of keeping this article easier to digest, I’ll omit implementation details and mathematical proofs, we can save those for another time.</p>
<h2>What is elliptic curve cryptography used&nbsp;for?</h2>
<p>A common use of ECC is to encrypt data so that only authorized parties can decrypt it. This has several obvious use cases but is most often used to encrypt internet traffic. For example, on the <a href="https://qvault.io/">Qvault web app</a> I could used ECC to encrypt a verification email so that no one but the recipient can read the message.</p>
<h2>ECC is public-key cryptography</h2>
<p>There are many types of public-key cryptography, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography is just one flavor. Other algorithms include <a aria-label="RSA (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)" target="_blank">RSA</a>, <a aria-label="Diffie-Helman (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange" target="_blank">Diffie-Helman</a>, etc. Let’s go over a quick background of public-key cryptography as a jumping-off point, so that I can discuss ECC and build on top of these ideas. By all means, study more in-depth on public-key cryptography when you have the time.</p>
<p>Public-key cryptography allows the following to happen:</p>

<p>We create two keys, a public key, and a private key. The public key is given freely, and any party can encrypt data by using it. However, the private key is kept secret and only those who hold it will have the ability to decrypt data.</p>
<h2>An example of public-key cryptography</h2>
<p>Let’s pretend that Facebook is going to receive a private post from Donald Trump. Facebook needs to be able to ensure that when the ex-president sends his post over the internet, no one in the middle (Like the NSA, or an internet service provider) can read the message. The entire exchange using public-key cryptography would go like this:</p>
<ul><li>Donald Trump Notifies Facebook that he wants to send them a private post</li><li>Facebook sends Donald Trump their public key</li><li>Donald Trump uses the public key to encrypt his post:</li></ul>
<p><em>“I love Fox and Friends” + Public Key = “s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em></p>
<ul><li>Donald Trump sends only the encrypted message to Facebook</li><li>Facebook uses its private key to decrypt the message:</li></ul>
<p><em>“s80s1s9sadjds9s” + Private Key = “I love Fox and Friends”</em></p>
<p>As you can see, this form of encryption can be quite useful. Here are some key points:</p>
<ul><li>The public key can safely be sent to anyone. It’s public.</li><li>The private key must be kept safe because if someone in the middle were to get the private key, they could decrypt messages.</li><li>Computers can quickly use the public key to encrypt a message, and quickly use the private key to decrypt a message.</li><li>Computers require a <em>very</em> long time (millions of years) to derive the original data from the encrypted message if they don’t have the private key.</li></ul>
<h2>How it Works: The Trapdoor&nbsp;Function</h2>
<p>The crux of all public-key cryptographic algorithms is that they each have their own unique trapdoor function<strong>. </strong>A trapdoor function is a function that can only be computed one way, or at least can only be computed one way <em>easily</em> (in less than millions of years using modern computers).</p>
<h3>Not a trapdoor function:</h3>
<p><code>A + B = C</code></p>
<p>If I’m given A and B I can compute C. However, if I’m given B and C I can also compute A. This is not a trapdoor function.</p>
<h3>Trapdoor function:</h3>
<p><code>"I love Fox and Friends” + Public Key --&gt; s80s1s9sadjds9s</code></p>
<p>If given <em>“I love Fox and Friends”</em> and the public key, I can produce <code>s80s1s9sadjds9s</code>, but if given <code>s80s1s9sadjds9s</code> and the Public Key I can’t produce <em>“I love Fox and Friends”</em></p>
<p>In RSA, which is arguably the most widely used public-key cryptosystem, the trapdoor function relies on how hard it is to factor large numbers into their prime factors.</p>
<p><strong>Public Key:</strong> <code>944,871,836,856,449,473</code></p>
<p><strong>Private Key:</strong> <code>961,748,941</code> and <code>982,451,653</code></p>
<p>In the example above the public key is a very large number, and the private key is the two prime factors of the public key. This is a good example of a Trapdoor Function because it is very easy to multiply the numbers in the private key together to get the public key, but if all you have is the public key it will take a very long time using a computer to re-create the private key.</p>
<p><em>Note: In real cryptography, the private key would need to be 200+ digits long to be considered secure.</em></p>
<h2>What Makes Elliptic Curve Cryptography Different?</h2>
<p>You would use ECC for the same reasons as RSA. ECC and RSA both generate a public and private key and allow two parties to communicate securely. One advantage to ECC however, is that a 256-bit key in ECC offers about the same security as a 3072-bit key using RSA. ECC allows resource-constrained systems like smartphones, embedded computers, and cryptocurrency networks to use ~10% of the storage space and bandwidth required by RSA.</p>
<h2>ECC’s Trapdoor&nbsp;Function</h2>
<p>This is probably why most of you are here. The trapdoor function is what makes ECC special and different than RSA. The trapdoor function is similar to a mathematical game of pool.</p>
<p>First, we start with an arbitrary point on the curve. Next, we use the dot function to find a new point. Finally, we keep repeating the dot function to hop around the curve until we finally end up at our last point. Let’s walk through the algorithm.</p>

<ul><li>Starting at <code>A</code>:</li><li><code>A dot B = -C</code> (Draw a line from A to B and it intersects at -C)</li><li>Reflect across the X-axis from -C to C</li><li><code>A dot C = -D</code> (Draw a line from A to C and it intersects -D)</li><li>Reflect across the X-axis from -D to D</li><li><code>A dot D = -E</code> (Draw a line from A to D and it intersects -E)</li><li>Reflect across the X-axis from -E to E</li></ul>
<p>This is a great trapdoor function because if you know where the starting point (A) is and how many hops are required to get to the ending point (E), it’s very easy to find the ending point. On the other hand, if all you know is where the starting point and ending point are, it’s nearly impossible to find how many hops it took to get there.</p>
<p>Public Key: Starting Point A, Ending Point E</p>
<p>Private Key: Number of hops from A to E</p>
<h2>Questions?</h2>
<p>Here are a few questions I had when I first learned about ECC. Hopefully, I can address them properly.</p>
<h3>1. How is the second point found? If the dot function is basically drawing a line between two points, don’t you need a second point to start&nbsp;with?</h3>
<p>No. The second point (we will call it -R below) is actually the result of P dot P (let’s assume the first point is called P)</p>
<p><code>P dot P = -R</code></p>
<p>So what is <code>P dot P</code>? It is actually just the tangent line of P. See the graphic below:</p>

<h3>2. What happens if the dot function produces a line that will go way off out to some&nbsp;extreme?</h3>
<p>If the line doesn’t hit the curve close to the origin, we can actually define a maximum X value where the line will wrap back around and start from the beginning again. See the graphic below for an example.</p>

<h3>3. If the number of hops is the private key, can’t I just count the hops until I hit the endpoint?</h3>
<p>Nope! The number of hops is <em>very</em> large, something like <code>2^256</code>. It would take far too long to compute each hop one by one, for example <code>p dot p dot p dot p ...</code>.</p>
<p>If however, you know the number of hops you can use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring" target="_blank" aria-label="exponentiation (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exponentiation</a> trick to find the ending point quite quickly. For example, and omitting the details of elliptic curve operations: <code>2P = P dot P</code> and then <code>4P = 2P dot 2P</code>. This allows you to get up to those crazy high calculations exponentially faster.</p>
<h2>Who Cares?</h2>
<p>ECC is used as the cryptographic key algorithm in Bitcoin because it potentially can save ~90% of the resources used by a similar RSA system. It seems that each year we see more systems moving from RSA to a more modern elliptic curve approach.</p>

					<div>
						<p>When the US joined World War Two, it set back a number of peacetime R&amp;D projects. A team at Bell Labs had been studying some interesting properties of semiconducting substances, with the hope that they might find a way to replace the then-ubiquitous vacuum tube. But the exigencies of wartime complicated their plans—for one thing, the only supplier of sufficiently pure silicon was a German company—so they took a break to focus on wartime applications like radar. By the time they returned to regular work, the war was won, the US industrial base had dramatically ramped up (now DuPont, not German suppliers, made the world’s purest silicon), and the team had acquired an encyclopedic knowledge of how substances like silicon and germanium behave.</p>
<p>Two years later, the transistor was born.</p>
<p>Crises radically reshape priorities; they cancel some projects, and accelerate others. But another effect they have is to make people more conscious of the future. To struggle through a crisis is, implicitly, to view the future as a point very much worth getting to. The Bell Labs team certainly helped build a better postwar future, and arguably Covid-19 has pushed people in the same direction.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t expect the results of this to be visible just yet. Scientific progress is visible on a lag: while the <i>New York Times</i> did mention the invention of transistors, it was midway through a column called “news of the radio,” hardly an accurate assessment of the impact of one of the twentieth century’s great inventions. Fortunately, there are more real-time ways to approximate people’s attitudes towards the future—the stock market is a real-time dollar-weighted poll about what kinds of companies will matter, and how that’s changing.</p>
<p>One of the surprising consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic was that, after a brief and fearsome decline, overall asset prices rose. That’s partly an artifact of how policymakers responded to the pandemic; pumping liquidity into the market does help offset supply shocks, and some of that money finds its way into speculative vehicles. But even <i>within</i> the market, there’s been a striking rise in investor interest in electric vehicles, autonomous cars, AI, and software companies ranging from consumer-facing companies like Facebook and Google to complex enterprise products like Snowflake.</p>
<p>The market’s judgments always have to be taken judiciously. Humans are imperfect judges of the present, not to mention the future. And as the recent GameStop fireworks demonstrate, sometimes prices can be driven more by technical aspects of market structure than by a cold and calculating assessment of the net present value of future cash flows. Even GameStop’s run-up, though, was born out of forward-looking analysis of a business, not gambling. The original thesis behind buying GameStop, before it turned into a social movement devoted to punishing hedge funds, <i>was</i> an argument that the company was fundamentally underpriced—because the market had missed its opportunity to transcend brick-and-mortar retailing and digitize its business!</p>
<p>There are definite precedents for extrapolating about new concerns from stock prices. Defense stocks rise when war is rumored to be imminent, for example, and cyclical stocks’ performance tends to change ahead of macro data on the economic cycle. More narrowly, the economist Armen Alchian <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0929119914000546">deduced that hydrogen bombs use lithium by tracking the stock prices of mining companies</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the world’s most valuable automaker is Tesla, with a market capitalization of $827bn, compared to $232bn for runner-up Toyota. Tesla isn’t valued based on its current production (just under 500,000 vehicles annually, compared to Toyota’s 9.2 million) or high margins (it eked out a net profit margin of just under 2%, less than half of Toyota’s results). Instead, Tesla is valued based on three forward-looking intangibles: it’s a pure-play electric vehicle company, its brand name is synonymous with clean energy rather than the more mixed reaction General Motors or Hyundai might engender, and its charismatic CEO has been able to recruit cult-like adherents to his vision of sustainable transportation and a multiplanetary species.</p>
<p>Calling Tesla is a cult isn’t pejorative, just descriptive: any organization that successfully accomplishes something that is widely believed to be impossible has to have distinctive beliefs, and any group of people who behave in unusual ways because of shared beliefs can be reasonably described as a cult. Some companies use their cultish aspects in harmful ways, but cults are a social design pattern that shows up over and over again, in successful companies and political movements. Cult-like traits are more common with companies that are growing fast—it would be hard for a steel mill or a local bank to engender this kind of behavior in its employees. It’s a way to focus everyone’s energy on the future, and avoid distracting questions about whether or not that future is viable—a way to raise the variance of outcomes, which makes extreme upside scenarios possible while increasing the odds of failure.</p>
<p>Tesla is not the only futuristic vehicle stock to be accorded a high value by the stock market. In fact, it’s arguably among the more mature. There are at least earnings to put a price/earnings multiple on, whereas many of the more recent EV companies are at an earlier stage than that. Luminar Technologies, for example, went public through a reverse merger late last year, and currently has a market value of almost $11bn. The company has minimal sales ($11m over the last nine months) and is still pouring money into R&amp;D. But LiDAR appears to be the most promising way to get cars to full autonomy, so investors are willing to value it based on the chance that a) autonomous vehicles will happen, b) they’ll use LiDAR, c) they’ll use Luminar’s systems to do it, and d) Luminar will be able to earn acceptable margins selling it.</p>
<p>The joint probability of all of those possibilities is low if they’re independent: if there’s a 10% chance of autonomous vehicles, a 10% chance they’ll use LiDAR, a 10% chance that LiDAR-using AVs will use Luminar’s technology, and a 10% chance that Luminar will get good margins, then the odds of Luminar being a good investment work out to 0.01%. But the more ambitious a company is, the more its job is to make those variables <i>conditional</i> instead: the closer a company gets to being the <i>only</i> way a given technology can happen, the more technology risk becomes synonymous with business risk, which compresses the overall range of outcomes. It also solves for the viable-business condition: if there’s just one company that can make AVs possible, then that company will have the pricing power necessary to make them profitable, too.</p>
<p>This dynamic actually works in two directions: first, it means that the odds of Luminar selling LiDAR conditional on LiDAR becoming ubiquitous are higher, because the latter is most probably going to happen if the former is true. And second, it’s a recruiting tool: if there’s one company that has a reasonable shot at accomplishing something, and it’s a desirable goal, then the company has a monopoly on the kinds of employees who can achieve that goal. This is a point Peter Thiel articulates in <i>Zero to One</i>, and it’s one of the reasons technology companies have such a skewed distribution of outcomes. They articulate a variant view, which means they attract people who share that variant view—and since the argument is settled by technology and economics, they don’t have to persuade the rest of the world, just to offer a better product.</p>
<p>The rise of special purpose acquisition vehicles, or SPACs, is a general testament to a more forward-looking market. In a conventional IPO, an operating company sells shares to the public; with a SPAC, an empty shell company goes public, and then identifies a private company to merge with. Due to a quirk in securities laws, a traditional IPO prospectus only shows a company’s backwards-looking estimates, and makes heavily-qualified statements about the future. A company that goes public through a SPAC is technically engaging in a merger, rather than an IPO, and the rules are different. When a public company buys another company, securities laws allow it to talk about that company’s anticipated growth, or the likely cost savings of the merger. Similarly, SPAC offerings can talk up a company’s long-term prospects, and even make exact estimates of future revenue.</p>
<p>SPACs have existed for years, but they exploded in popularity in 2020. Of the 466 SPAC companies that went public from 2011 through 2020, 248 of them went public in 2020 alone. A number of technical forces drove this—a large number of private companies looking for acquisitions, investors eager to get into <i>any</i> growth company early, some technicalities around SPAC issuance that make them attractive to specialist hedge funds. But the key driver of excitement about SPACs is that they can take companies public based on a future-focused outlook.</p>
<p>When Virgin Galactic went public by merging with Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings, the company, which has taken deposits but generated minimal revenue, was able to project $590 million in annual revenue in the year 2023, and over a quarter of a billion dollars in pretax, pre-depreciation earnings. While this was optimistic, it’s also demonstrative: a company like Virgin Galactic would have been almost impossible to take public in a conventional way, because backwards-looking financial statements showed only losses. it may not work out as a business, or live up to its projections, but those projections got more plausible once it had access to public markets for funding.</p>
<p>High valuations for money-losing, often pre-revenue companies remind people of the dot-com bubble, and it’s worth putting that bubble in perspective. Someone who bought the market at its peak in March 2000 has earned a 6% compounded return since then. …</p></div></div></div>

      <div><p><i>I sent this email to the whole team at YC yesterday:</i></p><p>When I joined&nbsp;YC&nbsp;7.5 years ago, there weren’t many people around. PG and Jessica were still running things. We had offices in Mountain View, Palo Alto, and on Kearny street, but they were nearly always empty. The only meeting on any calendar was the lunch on Thursdays where we’d talk about companies over takeout or at a table in a crowded restaurant.</p><p>The ways in which we’ve changed since then have been amazing to see.&nbsp;YC&nbsp;has grown in every way imaginable. The scope of what&nbsp;YC&nbsp;funds is larger. The team is bigger and more capable. The number of companies is pushing towards some ever receding upper bound. There’s more software, a larger community, and more programming designed to help&nbsp;YC&nbsp;founders build better futures.</p><p>I feel a deep sense of pride and honor at the part that I’ve played in that change and growth. I recall the first conversation I had with Aaron King about the Series A for Snapdocs. The questions he and I worked through were the kernel of the Series A program. I am amazed to see the directions in which Janelle is now building YCA. I’m grateful for the part I played in our conversations about growing beyond seed investing - conversations which eventually took shape as YCC. And, of course, there are fifteen batches worth of applications, interviews, dinners, office hours, and demo days rattling around in my head.<br></p><p>I’ve been thinking, recently, about the founders with whom I’ve had a chance to work. I’ve lost count of the number of incredible people I’ve gotten to know over these last years. Thinking back, it’s easy to see how the sheer weight of numbers can drive a person to be jaded about the problems that founders face. But the other night, as I spoke with a founder about a tough situation, I was reminded about how important it is to that individual that she gets the best possible advice. This is a lesson I learned time and again, and is something I hope I’ll never forget.</p><p>And then there’s the funny stuff. There were stolen air conditioners, barefoot pitches, robots that did not make sandwiches, update emails pulled from the I Ching, bandages, inhaled jet fuel, and literal blood on the interview floors. These are the things that I’ll remember long after everything else.</p><p>The truth is, I only meant to stick around&nbsp;YC&nbsp;for two years. Somehow, that two became two more, and then some more. As meaningfully as I’ve enjoyed my work here, it’s time for me to move onto something different and new and outside the bounds of what&nbsp;YC&nbsp;does. That’s a strange, exhilarating moment, and an important one for me and for my family. The pandemic provided the practical and existential nudge I needed to see the depth of this need.</p><p>To my fellow partners - thank you for your tireless work for our founders and for&nbsp;YC. Thank you for everything you’ve taught me, for all the strange conversations we’ve had, and for all the demo day presentations we’ve crafted.</p><p>To PG and Jessica and Trevor and RTM - thank you for giving me this opportunity and for making&nbsp;YC&nbsp;the kind of place I could love enough to stay long after I meant to leave.</p><p>To Janelle - thank you for building YCA with me and for being the best person I could imagine to take it into the future.</p><p>To everyone else -&nbsp;YC’s mission in the world is abstract. It could mean so many things, but it wouldn’t be anything without your work. Whether you are managing founder expectations about housing in the Bay Area, helping someone understand the mysteries of cap tables, talking someone down off the ledge of yelling at a reporter, or making sure that there will one day be an office to come back to, you are what makes&nbsp;YC&nbsp;a viable, vital force in the world.</p><p>I’ve never liked&nbsp;goodbye.</p><p>aaron</p></div>

  <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> The most common implementations of the factorial function in C do not handle
errors correctly and have typical code vulnerabilities. The factorial function should
include error handling even when only for the goal of teaching recursion, so that
beginners get used to writing robust code.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need a real factorial function, or its logarithm to do number theoretical
calculations, it’s available in the C standard library as <code>tgammal()</code> and <code>lgammal()</code>
functions <a href="#ref-glibc-math">[1]</a><a href="#ref-posix-tgammal">[2]</a><a href="#ref-posix-lgammal">[3]</a>.</p>

<p><span>!☕</span> The C language was created shortly after the Unix
operating system in the 1970’s, so that the new operating system could be written in a
simple and efficient programming language, instead of
assembly <a href="#ref-chistory">[4]</a>. Portability soon became a motivation too: to be able
to run Unix and applications in heterogeneous systems caused the operating system and the
C programming language to have a profound and long lasting impact on computer
systems <a href="#ref-tiobe-index">[5]</a><a href="#ref-stackoverflow">[6]</a><a href="#ref-ctoday">[7]</a><a href="#ref-unixhistory">[8]</a><a href="#ref-unixtoday">[9]</a>.
Simplicity, efficiency and portability, built into the language and transformed into
programming philosophy, came with a price. When programming in C, if you want it, you’ll
have it. That includes writing broken code, invoking behavior not defined by the language
and, in general, allowing you, without questioning, to “shoot your own foot”. Those who do
not program in C might believe this wouldn’t affect them. Remember, though, that many
modern languages were influenced and even replicated C syntax and
behavior <a href="#ref-cfamily">[10]</a>. Even for languages that were not directly influenced
by C, simplicity and efficiency requirements may still cause a lot of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment" target="_blank">astonishment</a>.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll begin by writing a couple of factorial function implementations in C
that 9 out of the first 10 Google Search results implement. Then, we’ll discuss the
problems, present a minimal robust implementation and finally discuss about different ways
of doing error handling in C, so that, in the end you feel motivated to always write
robust code.</p>

<h3 id="recursive-factorial">Recursive factorial</h3>

<p>So here we go, this is the “Google version” of the recursive factorial function written in
C:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
	<span>/* This basic recursive factorial function is widespread
	 * on the Internet, but results in incorrect results most
	 * of the time, contains a stack overflow and integer
	 * underflow. */</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

	<span>return</span> <span>n</span><span>*</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
	<span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>

	<span>/* Missing error checking on standard I/O. */</span>
	<span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Input a number: "</span><span>);</span>
	<span>scanf</span><span>(</span><span>"%d"</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>);</span>
	<span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"The factorial of %d is: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>));</span>

	<span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s compile and run this program:</p>

<pre><code>$ cc -o fact0 fact0.c
$ ./fact0
Input a number: 100
The factorial of 100 is: 0
$
</code></pre>

<p>So the factorial of 100 is 0. Or is it ? Factorials are positive integers. Have we
written anything wrong ? A quick search online shows that there are indeed
implementations exactly like this and that the mathematical recursive formula for the
factorial is correct. Also, for some numbers the program correctly calculates the result:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./fact0
Input a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is: 120
$ ./fact0
Input a number: 12
The factorial of 12 is: 479001600
$
</code></pre>

<h3 id="interlude-factorial-in-python">Interlude: factorial in Python</h3>

<p>Let’s put this code on hold for a moment and implement exactly the same algorithm in
Python:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env python3
</span><span>def</span> <span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>):</span>
    <span># Incomplete factorial implementation, but better than C
</span>    <span># (all behavior is defined by the language).
</span>    <span>if</span> <span>n</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span> <span>return</span> <span>1</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>n</span><span>*</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>main</span><span>():</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>(</span><span>'Input a number: '</span><span>))</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'The factorial of %d is: %d'</span> <span>%</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)))</span>

<span>if</span> <span>__name__</span> <span>==</span> <span>'__main__'</span><span>:</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this program outputs:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./fact.py
Input a number: 100
The factorial of 100 is: 93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000
$ ./fact.py
Input a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is: 120
$ ./fact.py
Input a number: 12
The factorial of 12 is: 479001600
$
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, now it makes sense. The Python programming language, using arbitrary precision integer
numbers is able to correctly calculate the factorial using the recursive formula. In the
case of C, the integer data type (<code>int</code>) is a fixed width binary integer number (on my
computer, a 32-bit integer), without a defined overflow behavior. I can confirm this is
causing problems by using the undefined behavior detector library from my C compiler:</p>

<pre><code>$ cc -o fact0 fact0.c -fsanitize=undefined
$ ./fact0
Input a number: 100
fact0.c:10:10: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 13 * 479001600 cannot be represented in type 'int'
The factorial of 100 is: 0
$
</code></pre>

<p>So, that’s it, we’ve found it. Not only integer overflow is happening, we’ve confirmed by
using the undefined behavior detector that signed integer overflow in C is undefined
behavior. Due to the motivation of being small, efficient and portable to write an
operating system 50 years ago, the language rules won’t bother considering this case: what
happens when an integer operation overflows ? The language states that it’s
undefined. Anything is allowed to happen (like crashing the program or exploding a
spaceship). The reason for this is that this might be used for some kind of benefit,
typically related to performance and compiler simplicity, for a certain type of computer.
For example, for my compiler with default flags, integer overflows simply wrap around to
the minimum possible value because, when compiled, it results in the fastest possible
integer arithmetic code for my machine, and could be used for modular value calculations,
if desired. Other computers are free to implement a different behavior, also striving for
the fastest performance, if desired. This means that undefined behavior in C is part of
the language specification that helps guaranteeing that the language will be both portable
and performant in heterogeneous systems. Undefined behavior is arguably one of the reasons
C is so widespread for writing high performance system software. Consider, for example,
the modern high performance language <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank">Rust</a>,
praised for its modern safety features <a href="#ref-rustsafety">[11]</a>, and, in my opinion,
one of the best contenders for replacing C++ in the near future, also
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html?highlight=overflow#integer-overflow" target="_blank">opting to allow silent integer overflows, yet stating that relying on it is considered an error</a>.
More commonly nowadays, however, since computers are becoming more homogeneous, the
unexpected result will simply cause a bug, without offering any other portability benefit.
Worse yet, in our specific case, compiling with default flags mentioned nothing. The
programmer was allowed to do that and the C compiler was silent about that.</p>

<h3 id="as-buggy-as-possible">As buggy as possible</h3>

<p>In the latest international C draft standard (ISO C 2017/2018 <a href="#ref-isoc17">[12]</a>),
undefined behavior is defined as the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.4.3 undefined behavior</p>

  <p>behavior, upon use of a nonportable or erroneous program construct or of erroneous data,
for which this International Standard imposes no requirements</p>

  <p>(…)</p>

  <p>EXAMPLE An example of undefined behavior is the behavior on integer overflow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the C programming language “imposes no requirements” on the behavior of integer
overflow, someone must. That someone is you, the programmer. You are allowed to shoot
your own foot, but if you’re smart you won’t.</p>

<p>Now any pragmatic programmer would think that this discussion doesn’t really make sense,
since the only goal of the recursive factorial function is to teach recursion and only
scratch the surface of C programming, so this discussion is meaningless. If that were the
whole story I would agree with that too and never waste my time writing this, but the
truth is that even though we must keep it simple, we have gone too far:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In the C factorial example we have gone beyond as simple as possible and the code has
become oversimplified and thus incorrect. What I’m talking about is the amount of program
failures caused by buffer overflows, rounding errors, uninitialized memory access,
insufficient input validations and others that are main causes of electronic device
misbehaviors and exploitations in modern information technology. Famous bugs include the
$370 million Ariane 5 rocket explosion <a href="#ref-ariane5">[13]</a> and the Year 2000
bug <a href="#ref-y2k">[14]</a>, both caused by numeric overflows. Less impactful were the
integer overflows caused by the addictive Gangnam Style music video being viewed more than
2^31 times on YouTube <a href="#ref-gangnam">[15]</a> and Paypal depositing $92 quadrillion
(2^63 dollars) into the account of a user <a href="#ref-quadrillion">[16]</a>. On the other
hand, the cyberwarfare Stuxnet virus, believed to have been created by the Israeli and
American governments to damage Iranian uranium enrichment

        <h4>February 12th, 2021 · 5 minute read</h4>

        <p>
          I've seen quite a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21990566">few</a> <a href="https://blog.pushbullet.com/2020/05/13/lets-guess-what-google-requires-in-14-days-or-they-kill-our-extension/">people</a> <a href="https://blog.lipsurf.com/part-ii-after-3-years-of-work-chrome-killed-my-extension-and-wont-tell-me-why/">complaining</a> lately about the Kafkaesque Chrome extension review process, so when I started running into my own problems with the Chrome Web Store I wasn't exactly surprised.
        </p>

        <p>
          It wasn’t until I submitted the same extension to the Firefox Add-Ons Store that I saw just how good things could be. In a world of walled gardens watched over by heavy handed reviewers, Firefox's review process was laughably good.
        </p>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            In January 2020 my buddy and I started working on an idea we had for an automation app. We called it Otto.
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto consisted of two parts: a Mac app and a browser extension. After a few months worth of nights and weekends we had an alpha version we were ready to share with friends. I submitted the browser extension to Chrome under my own personal account, and after a review process of a couple days it was accepted. So far so good.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            The trouble started a few months later. After some more development and discussion, we re-framed our idea as an app to make custom keyboard shortcuts and we decided to rename Otto to <a href="https://keysmith.app/">Keysmith</a>. We also took the time at this point to create a company Google account. We renamed the extension and submitted it from our new company account.
          </p>

          <p>
            To be clear: changing the name was the <i>only</i> change we made.
          </p>

          <p>
            A few days later we received a rejection email. Here's a timeline of our interaction:
          </p>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We submit Keysmith to the Chrome Web Store.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <div>
              <p>
                First rejection email.

                Quick summary:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Keysmith "violates the 'Use of Permissions' section"</li>
                <li>We should "Request access to the narrowest permissions necessary"</li>
                <li>"If more than one permission could be used to implement a feature, you must request those with the least access to data or functionality."</li>
                <li>We shouldn't attempt to "future proof"</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <div>
              <div><p>
                We double check the permissions we've requested and can't find any problems. We respond asking for more detail.
                </p><p>
                We also mention that we had previously submitted the <i>same</i> extension with the <i>same</i> requested permissions, just under a different name (Otto). We hoped they'd say "oh, in that case we'll approve this right away!". But instead:
              </p></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                Otto, our <i>existing extension</i>, is removed from the store and no additional detail on the rejection is provided. In fact, this email contains the <i>same exact</i> text as the previous one.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We respond, again asking for more detail. We ask if it would help if we expanded on how we're using each permission in the permissions justification section.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with the <i>exact same text again</i>. No further detail. No help at all.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We suspect these reviews are entirely automated, so we ask if we can speak to a "human reviewer", hoping this will trigger a manual review (we also consider dropping an f-bomb for the same reason, but decide to remain decent for now).
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with some <i>slightly</i> different text, but still nothing useful.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We try adding a lot more detail to the "justification" section for each of the permissions we use and we resubmit.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with the exact same text as the first rejection.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We respond with one more plea for more more information.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with the same text again.
              </p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            At this point I dig into Chrome's documentation once again with a fine-tooth comb and I make a discovery: we had been requesting both the <span>tabs</span> and <span>activeTab</span> permissions, but since we also requested permission to run on <span>&lt;all_urls&gt;</span> it turns out that the features made available by <span>activeTab</span> were a strict subset of the features made available by <span>tabs</span>. So the <span>activeTab</span> permission was redundant. We weren't opening up any new functionality, we were just asking for a <i>redundant</i> permission.
          </p>

          <p>
            This discovery made the Chrome review team's communications far more frustrating in retrospect. The line that all of their emails repeated was "Request access to the narrowest permissions necessary". And, sure, we had asked for <span>activeTab</span> when we didn't need it, but that permission <i>didn't grant us any more functionality</i>. They had rejected our extension 6 times with no detail <i>because of a technicality</i>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We committed the 1 line diff removing the <span>activeTab</span> permission and resubmitted. A day later it was accepted.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            A Firefox version of our browser extension had long been on our list, but for the first little while it didn't feel worth the additional support cost. We didn't know exactly how large that cost would be, but we suspected that there would be enough differences between the two browsers that it'd be a bit of a hassle to maintain them both.
          </p>

          <p>
            Boy were we wrong. When we finally started looking into porting our extension to Firefox we found that we had to make <i>zero</i> changes to the code. None whatsoever. Firefox even supported the use of the global <span>chrome</span> object for accessing extension APIs (if you're curious, Chrome is not kind enough to return the favor).
          </p>

          <p>
            So we created a Firefox developer account, submitted our extension, and girded ourselves for another rough ride.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Boy were we wrong.</i>
          </p>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We submit the first version of our extension to Firefox.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <div>
              <div><p>
                Less than 3 hours later we receive an email from Firefox that says, in effect, "Sorry this is taking so long, but we'll get to it soon!"
                </p><p>
                Responses from the Chrome team usually came in the wee hours of the morning, making the effective turnaround about 24 hours. Firefox apologizing after fewer than 3 hours was <i>hilarious</i> to us.
              </p></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We get an email saying the extension was accepted exactly 24 hours after submission.
              </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Further updates have been even speedier, usually only taking 2 or 3 minutes to be scanned and accepted. One of our updates even got accepted before I finished uploading the unminified source archive (which they require if you minify in production). And the dashboard shows your position in the review queue to give you some idea of when it'll complete.
          </p>

          <p>
            Needless to say, this was a breath of fresh air, and we won't be neglecting support for Firefox ever again in the future.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            I realize that in some ways this is an unfair comparison. Chrome's market share is much larger than Firefox's these days, so surely they also have to deal with far more extension submissions.
          </p>

          <p>
            But the lack of transparency in their process was infuriating and counter-productive. Had someone taken the time to manually review our case, or at least <i>read any of the emails</i> we sent, we could've resolved this issue with one response. Instead it took 6 responses and a week of wondering if this review process would kill our product before it even launched.
          </p>

          <p>
            I really hope things improve, but I'm not counting on it.
          </p>

                    <figure><img src="https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/2021/01/startwithwhy-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/startwithwhy-1.png 600w, https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/2021/01/startwithwhy-1.png 700w"></figure><p><a href="https://simonsinek.com/">Simon Sinek</a> - the author of <em>'<a href="https://simonsinek.com/product/start-with-why/">Start With Why; How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action</a>'</em> - identified a pattern in the thoughts, actions, and communication of great leaders like Steve Jobs, Martin Luther King, or the Wright brothers.</p><p>According to Simon, great leaders share a process that is the exact opposite of what the large majority of average, unremarkable leaders do.</p><p>Holding a position of power or authority can define you as a leader, but those who truly lead are the ones who inspire us. <em>"We follow them, not because we have to, but because we want to."</em></p><p>Perhaps you have your sights on developing incredible leadership skills and galvanizing others. Or maybe you want to feel more inspired at work. Either way, learning to start with WHY can be extremely valuable.</p><h3 id="the-golden-circle">The Golden Circle</h3><p>Simon created The Golden Circle, a simple framework that consists of 3 concentric layers: WHAT, HOW, and WHY.</p><figure><img src="https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/2021/01/goldencircle.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/goldencircle.jpg 600w, https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/goldencircle.jpg 1000w, https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/2021/01/goldencircle.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@picoftasty?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Mae Mu</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/s6S8IgEN6-4?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>WHAT</strong> - Every leader can articulate what they, and their company, do. Since it's so straightforward, that is where they usually start.</p><p><strong>HOW</strong> - Most leaders also explain how they do what they do. Their unique value proposition, differentiators, and values.</p><p><strong>WHY</strong> - Few leaders make an effort to communicate why they do what they do: What's their purpose? Why does the organization exist? And why should anyone care?</p><p>The real breakthrough is the direction in which to move in the Golden Circle. You have probably guessed it by now. &nbsp;<strong>You're supposed to start with the WHY and move outwards, to the HOW, and finally the WHAT.</strong></p><p>As Simon points out, Martin Luther King gave the <em>"I have a dream"</em> speech, not the <em>"I have a plan"</em> speech.</p><h3 id="start-with-why-within-your-team">Start with WHY within your team</h3><p>When you lead a team, your success depends on the team's ability to accomplish its mission. Creating the conditions for them to succeed should be your number one priority.</p><p>Some leaders might argue that telling people what to do is the shorter, more efficient path to success. They may think that teaching the team how to do their tasks is all that's left to do.</p><p>Well, that might be good enough when dealing with workers doing repetitive, pre-defined chores. However, it is certainly not the best way to manage a high-performing team when problem-solving and creativity are ingredients of their daily tasks.</p><p>Starting with WHY, and reminding it constantly, keeps everyone aligned on the purpose of the team. That will energize and empower each individual to be pro-active, make the right decisions, surpass roadblocks, and the team will move faster as a consequence.</p><p>Teams that start with WHY are also more likely to have a strong sense of purpose and experience less churn.</p><p>People who make a habit of applying this framework can inspire others and be inspired themselves. It applies in both directions. When in doubt, don't be afraid to ask WHY.</p><h3 id="start-with-why-in-marketing">Start with WHY in Marketing</h3><p><em>"People don't buy what you do. They buy why you do it."</em> - Simon repeats this so many times, it can get on your nerves.</p><p>He also claims that <em>"the goal is not to do business with people who need what you have, the goal is to do business with people who believe in what you believe."</em></p><p>Many authors reference Apple again and again to illustrate this point. Let's allow it one more time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/2021/01/thinkdifferent.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/thinkdifferent.jpg 600w, https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/thinkdifferent.jpg 1000w, https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/2021/01/thinkdifferent.jpg 1100w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Focusing on the WHAT and the HOW, Apple would sell computers like this:</p><blockquote><em>"We make great computers. They're user friendly, beautifully designed, and easy to use. Want to buy one?"</em></blockquote><p>Starting with WHY and then moving to HOW and WHAT, they would end up with something more along these lines:</p><blockquote><em>"With everything we do, we aim to challenge the status quo. We aim to think differently. Our products are user-friendly, beautifully designed, and easy to use. We just happen to make great computers. Want to buy one?"</em></blockquote><p>In this case, a decision is made emotionally first and then justified rationally. That's why Apple <em>fanboys</em> are often accused of buying inferior products at inflated prices, as long as they come from Cupertino. Whether that is true or an exaggeration, any brand would love to have such a dedicated following.</p><p>Simon states that this behavior is grounded in biology and the way our brain makes decisions. The outer circle (WHAT) corresponds to the neocortex, where rational thoughts and language are processed. The inner circles (HOW and WHY) relate to the limbic system, where our emotions take control.</p><p>A gut feeling, that kind of decision that we need to follow but have trouble explaining rationally, comes straight from the inner circles. If your marketing can tap into the emotions of your audience, amazing things can happen.</p><p>Remember: People don't buy what you do.

    <p>I recently came across <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity">SerenityOS</a> when it was featured in hxp CTF and then on <a href="https://twitter.com/liveoverflow">LiveOverflow’s</a> YouTube channel. SerenityOS is an open source operating system written from scratch by <a href="https://twitter.com/awesomekling">Andreas Kling</a> and now has a strong and active community behind it. If you’d like to learn a bit more about it then the recent <a href="https://cppcast.com/serenity-os/">CppCast episode</a> is a good place to start, as well as all of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/andreaskling">fantastic videos by Andreas Kling</a>.</p>

<p>Two of the recent videos were about writing exploits for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMvjaoBLPxA">typed array bug in javascript</a>, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt6-TC6FtMs">kernel bug in munmap</a>. The videos were great to watch and got me thinking that it would be fun to try and find a couple of bugs that could be chained together to create a full chain exploit such as exploiting a browser bug to exploit a kernel bug to get root access.</p>

<h3 id="entrypoint">Entrypoint</h3>

<p>I started looking around and discovered an integer overflow when creating a typed array from an array buffer, the length was multiplied by the element size which could overflow.

<p>This could be used to create two powerful primitives, one that could read an arbitrary address and the other that could read an arbitrary amount from some allocated memory. These were the same primitives that Kling created in his video which meant that the issue could be exploited in exactly the same way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finding a vtable pointer with the offset primitive by spraying lots of Numbers</li>
  <li>Use the deterministic memory layout to calculating the stack location</li>
  <li>Find the saved return address on the stack</li>
  <li>Overwriting it with a rop chain.</li>
</ul>

<p>While I was looking into exploiting this, someone else spotted the same issue and it was quickly patched.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/commit/f6c6047e49f1517778f5565681fb64750b14bf60"><img src="https://devcraft.io/assets/serenity/slack.jpg" alt="slack"></a></p>

<p>As I had already started and wanted to keep using the same issue, I kept working from <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/commit/c899ace3ad1efbf1bc8f8ee2ebb1e35903d7224b">this commit</a> which still had the bug :)</p>

<p>Exploiting the issue is pretty much identical to the video above and it does a great job explaining what is going on, so I wont go into too much detail. Here Is what I ended up with:</p>

<p>After loading this up and setting a breakpoint with gdb at <code>0x9d000000</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://devcraft.io/assets/serenity/gef.jpg" alt="gef"></p>

<p>Success! Arbitrary code in the browser.</p>

<h3 id="kernel-bug-hunting">Kernel Bug Hunting</h3>

<p>Next it was time to try and find a kernel bug that could be reached from the browser process. There had been a few issues with integer overflows, so I started looking for places that this might happen. After some searching I saw the following in <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/blob/22b0ff05d4a5b087d805d8147ca12efe410cb18f/Kernel/VM/RangeAllocator.cpp#L139">RangeAllocator::allocate_anywhere</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>m_available_ranges</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>();</span> <span>++</span><span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>available_range</span> <span>=</span> <span>m_available_ranges</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>

    <span>// FIXME: This check is probably excluding some valid candidates when using a large alignment.</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>available_range</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>()</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>(</span><span>effective_size</span> <span>+</span> <span>alignment</span><span>))</span>
        <span>continue</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each process has a list of available ranges that are used when allocating memory regions. This code is looping through all the ranges and seeing if there is one large enough to hold the requested size, taking into account the alignment (both <code>effective_size</code> and <code>alignment</code> are controlled by the user). The issue is that <code>effective_size + alignment</code> can overflow, resulting in a range being chosen that is too small to hold the requested size.</p>

<p>The <code>available_range</code> is then used to create a new allocated range:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>FlatPtr</span> <span>initial_base</span> <span>=</span> <span>available_range</span><span>.</span><span>base</span><span>().</span><span>offset</span><span>(</span><span>offset_from_effective_base</span><span>).</span><span>get</span><span>();</span>

                        SVG, short for <em>“scalable vector graphics”</em> is a format for, well, scalable vector graphics. In this article I summarize my opinion of the format, what its problems are and suggest what could be done to improve things.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a>, short for <em>“scalable vector graphics”</em> is a format for, well, scalable vector graphics. In this article I summarize my opinion of the format, what its problems are and suggest what could be done to improve things.</p>
<p>I’ve been using SVG together with Inkscape regularly for a few years for sketches and graphics, and like to write it by hand to satisfy my love for precision and art through code. SVG and I have a kind of love-hate relationship. It’s powerful and has some nice free and open-source tooling, but the format itself is pretty ugly.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s <em>the</em> format for vector graphics. It is well supported by a range of programs from Adobe Illustrator to Inkscape for editing and in various browsers.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s a web standard so you can use it directly in websites. You can also use CSS with it.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s XML-based, so the syntax is familiar, it’s extensible and can benefit from the vast XML ecosystem. For example, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLink">XLink</a> you can reference other elements and definitions in an SVG file. Or <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> uses custom XML tags to extend SVG into their editor exchange format.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s powerful. You can do <em>a lot</em> with it. It obviously supports various path types and shapes, supports text and more, but also animations, gradients, effects and more.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>It’s a web standard. And as is customary for a web standard, SVG is magnificiently bloated. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/REC-SVG11-20110816.pdf">SVG specification</a> brings a whopping 826 (<em>eight-hundred twenty-six</em>) pages to the table. And as if that’s not enough, it’s also XML-based and cross-linked with other web standards, driving the scope of any implementation to dizzying heights.</p>
<p>If you want to be sure to correctly render all SVG files, not only do you have to consider 800 pages of SVG spec, but e.g.&nbsp;another 20 pages of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xlink11/">XLink spec</a>. Oh, and CSS as well, by the way. And, I shit you not, <em>JAVASCRIPT</em>. Yes. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/script">SVG files can include <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</a></p>
<p>SVG fits right in with web browsers. They’re hilariously bloated already, they already implement stuff like CSS and JavaScript that a complete SVG implementation requires. This problem of SVG is actually just the <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope.html">problem of the web in general</a>. It’s scope is huge, it’s bloated and hard to work with.</p>
<p>SVG is nothing you could implement in a day. Or a week. Or a month. The huge amount of specifications, that are most often only partly implemented, makes it very hard to overview what supports what, confusing the user as to what features they can actually use if they want their SVG file to be universally supported.</p>
<p>Furthermore the XML-based syntax is pretty ugly and needlessly verbose. It’s tiring to write by hand and just as tiring to parse or generate automatically.</p>
<h2 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h2>
<p>A central problem that can be extracted from the points listed above is the one I detailed in my article about <a href="https://www.eisfunke.com/article/language-design-machine-or-human.html">language design for machines vs.&nbsp;humans</a>: SVG doesn’t know what it wants to be, a machine-focused language or a human-focused language and ends up doing badly in both aspects.</p>
<p>Is it a machine-processible language? It’s far too bloated for that. Writing parsers, renderers and generators for SVGs is a huge task. The syntax is repetitive and complex. It has a lot of features that could be represented by more basic features.</p>
<p>But is it a format well-suited for direct usage by humans? Well, no. Firstly, the exhausting syntax and complexity is also bad for human users. Secondly, it misses a lot of features that would make it suitable for direct use. A graphics language that is meant for direct human use would be <a href="http://texdoc.net/pkg/tikz">Ti<em>k</em>Z</a> for LaTeX. While it’s not a great language regarding user experience in my opinion, it is definitely meant for humans and has the necessary features to help making creating complex graphics easy. But nobody would have the idea to use Ti<em>k</em>Z code as an interchange format for the finished graphic. Nobody would want to implement 1300 pages of Ti<em>k</em>Z manual just to view some graphic. Instead you compile it into an PDF (which is also a horrible format and badly bloated, but well). If SVG was a language meant for human use, compiling it into a machine-focused format would be the way to go as well, but as I said – it isn’t. It’s neither.</p>
<h2 id="what-now">What now?</h2>
<p>A good idea would be to develop a simple vector graphics exchange format that is desigend to be easily processed by machines. As minimal in features as possible. Maybe JSON-based, definitely not XML-based. You should be able to implement a basic renderer in a few days, or even better, hours, without depending on two metric tons of XML ecosystem libraries. Bezier curves, elliptic curves, fills, outlines and gradients should mostly suffice to represent every unanimated SVG. An extension could allow animations in a separate file extension.</p>
<p>This minimal and well-delimited format could then have a strict test suite and be implemented in browsers and image viewers with relative ease. Users could rely on their graphic working everywhere and implementers wouldn’t have to worry about implementing XLink, CSS and JavaScript as well. It could save bandwidth and computation power. Compilers from and to SVG could be written for compatibility.</p>
<p>It could be used as export format of user-facing programs like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator. For people wanting to markup graphics through code there’s already stuff like Ti<em>k</em>Z, <a href="https://diagrams.github.io/">Haskell diagrams</a> or <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html">Python matplotlib</a> that could also export to the new minimal interchange format.</p>
<p>I’m actually thinking about making a slim machine-focused vector graphics format (the name <em>“SlimSVG”</em> has been suggested :D) and writing my own human-focused Haskell graphics creation library with similar goals for my own purposes in the future, maybe as a student research project for the university.</p>
<p>In summary: Decide whether a language is for humans or for machines and do one of those things. And do the one thing well instead of both, but badly.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> This article was posted on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26114863">Hacker News</a> and landed on the front page, currently it’s on rank 3. I’m honored! <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=26115086&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D26114863%2326115086">In the comments there</a> somebody mentioned an <a href="https://www.xul.fr/svgtetris.svg">interesting use of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in SVG</a>. I’m unsure though whether I should be impressed or horrified :D</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Somebody posted this on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/livw57/svg_the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly">Reddit</a> as well. Currently, there are over 150 comments, wow.</p>
<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> PEOPLE, PLEASE. This is absolutely not about “XML is bad, let’s do JSON instead”. I actually like XML more than JSON in total, I’m a fan of XML schema and nice strong schemas. And while I still don’t like the syntax, XML generally is a good fit for a document markup language like HTML. I mostly wouldn’t care whether a good format with a good data model was encoded in JSON, XML, YAML, binary, Brainfuck or monkey feces. The encoding really is the least important part. I just think that for a strictly machine-focused format for data JSON would be a better choice.</p>
<p>I guess though I should have anticipated that saying that I don’t like XML and then mentioning the word “JSON” would start a religious war.</p>

                    <p>Wouldn’t it be amazing if you could sign up with a website with face recognition on your mobile phone and the next day on your MacBook you could just use your fingerprint scanner to sign in? What if we told you that this is possible today? </p><p>Currently you manage your accounts using passwords that you have to remember. For most users this is done by either remembering various different passwords, or worse; using the same one for every website. While social login has brought us a convenient way to sign in to websites using a single account, it still requires an account with a password. On top of that, there are security and privacy risks when using a single account for each service. Extra layers of security, like two factor authentication, can be added. But those come at the cost of complexity for the end user. The problem lies in passwords themselves. To solve it we should, and finally can, get rid of them all together to provide a user-friendly and secure authentication flow. </p><p>Even though it is still early and it has not landed in all browsers, we feel this is the future. We have already looked into what it takes to implement. As with any form of authentication, it is definitely not a trivial subject and it requires effort to implement. But please bear with us though, as we talk you through the steps. The result for the end user is definitely worth it.</p><p>Passwordless authentication on the web is made possible by the new Web Authentication (WebAuthn) API. If you’re not familiar with this API, you can check out <a href="https://webauthn.guide/#about-webauthn">this guide</a> or the video below to make it all a bit more tangible.</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hk7kDRx3MuQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>The simplicity of using WebAuthn</figcaption></figure><h3 id="connecting-devices">Connecting devices</h3><p>The WebAuthn API supports replacing passwords with biometric data through device specific authenticators. These authenticators are, for example, the facial recognition &amp; fingerprint scanners built into (mobile) devices.</p><p>Creating accounts and logging in with a device-specific authenticator has one problem. The fingerprint scanner on a mobile phone isn’t connected to the one on a laptop. So, how does a user access their account on a laptop if they created the account on a mobile phone? </p><p>For multi-device passwordless authentication we created a proof-of-concept flow. Our solution uses a secure environment already shared on all devices: email. A secure link sent through email connects the laptop &amp; mobile phone. No typing required at all. Let’s explore this flow together.</p><h3 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood</h3><p>For most server side languages, there’s a library available that does the heavy lifting around WebAuthn by implementing FIDO2. We went with <a href="https://github.com/abergs/fido2-net-lib">abergs/fido2-net-lib</a> on .NET core. The juicy part is in expanding the user interaction flow. Let’s start with registration. </p><p>A user enters a desired username (a valid email in our case), presses the register button and is presented with a biometric confirmation modal to resolve a generated challenge that is sent by the server. When the user successfully authenticates with their biometric info, an account is created for that user.</p><p>During account creation, these steps are executed:</p><ol><li>Server sends challenge</li><li>Device requests biometric confirmation</li><li>User scans finger</li><li>Device creates public + private key</li><li>Device sends public key as response</li><li>Server creates user account associated to that public key</li></ol><p>When a user later wants to login to the website, they enter their username (email) again and then are presented with a biometric confirmation modal to resolve a generated challenge. This time the server checks if the response (that the browser generates based on the given challenge and private key) matches the user with the given email address. If that’s the case, the user is logged in.</p><p>During user login, these steps are executed:</p><ol><li>Server sends challenge</li><li>Device requests biometric confirmation</li><li>User scans finger</li><li>Device signs challenge with private key</li><li>Device sends response to server</li><li>Server verifies response with public key</li></ol><p>On a technical level this is not too different compared to a regular password login, if you would hash and salt the password before sending it over. The biggest difference is we’re not asking the user to authenticate with something that needs to be remembered.</p><h3 id="implementing-multi-device-sign-in">Implementing multi-device sign-in</h3><p>Logging in with a platform authenticator only works if the local device has credentials stored for this website. The first step in making multi-device possible is by detecting if the device has credentials for the current website user account or not. If it doesn’t, the Web Authentication API will throw an error. This allows us to ask the user if they want to add this device to their account.</p><figure><pre><code>let credentials;
try {
  credentials = await navigator.credentials.get(optionsObject);
} catch (err) {
  // Show modal to ask if the user wants to add this device to their account
  confirmAddDevice();
}</code></pre><figcaption>Detect if the device platform authenticator has known credentials</figcaption></figure><p>This is the hook that allows us to extend the user experience. For our take on a possible UX flow for passwordless multi-device authentication we came up with the diagram below. Highlighted in blue is the email confirmation flow that we found missing in existing implementations of logging in without a password. Remember that, while this diagram may seem daunting at first, all the parts in black are taken care of by WebAuthn and the FIDO2 library. Luckily that also is the hardest and most boring part.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vwtyGrDkcChPhUrxucOV-6IbyzezykWKK-NI_KEF4px3Ke-uGunrfKZXd34gd0z5R0tfd1-xEiidbgTCVbKK09qdhKiW6ezDYaUg_keR61DoGJmJR1Xs4vXokVCnSzWAD2fSwFFG"><figcaption>Expand the platform authenticator flow to support multiple devices</figcaption></figure><p>Our flow starts when the user wants to sign in to their existing account from an unknown device. The flow starts similar to the regular login flow. However, we can now detect when the device has no credentials stored for this website.</p><p>Interaction wise this is where things get interesting. We can let the user know that this is an unknown account that is being attempted to sign in to. But just showing an error is a dead path. A user expects an immediate follow-up action to add this device to the account.</p><p>In our case we show a modal to ask the user if they want to add the new device:</p><figure><pre><code>async function confirmAddDevice() {
  const confirm = confirm('Do you want to add this device to your account?');
  if (!confirm) {
    // User denied the confirm modal, do nothing
    return;
  }

  try {

        <p>&lt;rant&gt;Two years ago I sat in on a security meeting. The subject was protecting the code and associated websites from attack.</p><p>"I'd just attack the npm packaging system, introducing subtle changes in several that would work together to do whatever I wanted."</p><p>All I got was blank stares, and this was from professionals. From <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/researcher-hacks-over-35-tech-firms-in-novel-supply-chain-attack">this week's reading</a>:</p><blockquote>Unlike <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-npm-project-steals-discord-accounts-browser-info/">traditional typosquatting attacks</a> that rely on social engineering tactics or the victim misspelling a package name, this particular supply chain attack is more sophisticated as it needed no action by the victim, who automatically received the malicious packages.<p>This is because the attack leveraged a unique design flaw of the open-source ecosystems called <strong>dependency confusion.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Even using things like Test-Driven Development, programmers can only reason about a small part of the code in front of him in the IDE. (In fact, one of the reasons TDD is so successful is because programmers have no idea at how much they suck at actually understanding what they're doing).</p><p>From a recent study:</p><figure><img src="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png" alt="" srcset="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1000w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1890w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Here's the takeaway graphic:</p><figure><img src="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg 600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg 678w"></figure><p>Note: this result is seeking out a mean, regular coders writing regular code. Your mileage may vary.</p><p>Why is this? Let's take two code samples:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>echo Hello World
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>#include &lt;cstdio&gt;

int main()
{
    printf("hello from %s!\n", "HelloWorld");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In the first example, how many symbols is the programmer manipulating to reach their goal? Only one, "echo" In the second example, how many symbols are being manipulated?</p><p>I counted seven, but I wasn't trying to be strict.</p><p>What do these seven involve? There's namespaces, libraries, standard function signatures, string substitution, OS return values, and so on.</p><p>Do any of these matter to the new C# programmer? Of course not! That's why it's called "Hello World". You're supposed to be able to type in a few symbols and start doing something useful right away.</p><p>The waters get murky very quickly after that. Let's say your boss sends you an email:</p><p>"Jenkins, add the cover sheet to all of those TPS reports"</p><p>Something goes wrong. The boss is unhappy. You two have a conversation about what you did that was mistaken.</p><p>Suppose instead you're looking at the following code:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>WorkingStack.Reports.AddSheet(cover);
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The boss is mad because it's not working right.</p><p>You can certainly go into the boss's office and have that same conversation, just this time over code instead of an email. <em>In fact, that's what you have to do</em>. Without a bunch more source code, what the hell does that C# code do, anyway? You don't know. It says it does the same thing as the boss wanted, but for all you know it's mailing off your tax returns to Russian hackers.</p><p>Most of modern programming is spent creating and consuming fake abstractions that are much more leaky and buggy than we'd like admit. In fact, it's grown far, far beyond our ability to reason about. It's magic. We spend a lot of time pretending that this isn't the case, then cursing when reality rears its ugly head again.</p><p>When I was writing <a href="https://leanpub.com/info-ops2">my second book</a>, I had to address this problem because reasoning about code and controlling complexity is the number one problem in software development today. It's the reason we have buildings full of hundreds of developers wasting a lot of time and money. Our incentives are wrong.</p><p>The best thing to look for in any professional, doctor, lawyer, coder, etc is their ability to not engage with a problem, instead solving it in a simple and non-intrusive way. The worst behavior from professionals are the folks who are going to do a lot of work no matter what. These guys look busy, and they’re deep in a bunch of technically wonky stuff that nobody understands, so naturally they look like they know what they’re doing and are doing a good job. The guy who shows up in flip-flops and after a five-minute conversation solves your problem? He’s just some smart eleck showman, probably a con man.</p><p>We don’t teach coders the one skill they need most of all: adding incremental complexity as-needed. Nobody talks about choosing what to add and why. Nobody talks about ways to understand you’ve gone too far (except for a few folks like me. Apologies for the shameless plug.)</p><p>For some odd reason, discussions on frameworks and complexity always devolve into some version of “Dang kids!” vs. “Talentless luddite!” As many people have pointed out, not only do we not teach or talk about incremental complexity, if you don’t have the appropriate buzzwords in your CV, you don’t get hired. So BigCorps naturally end up with scads of people who did well on scads of tech that somebody decide they had to use/learn but nobody very good at actually making things happen.</p><p>This can't continue, and I want to do my part in making it end. The answer I came up is something I call it <strong>Code Cognitive Load (CCL)</strong>. It's the amount of risk you take on as a programmer looking at any piece of code to manipulate it, whether coding fresh or doing maintenance on existing code.</p><ol><li>It's scoped first by method/function and then by compilation unit. There's no other scoping (namespace, class, module, etc.)</li><li>To compute, you add up four things: symbols you are required to look at to do your work, exceptions that using those symbols may throw, &nbsp;any editable code underneath that you may have to read or write for those symbols to work, and exceptions that code may throw</li></ol><p>You can see for the first Hello World example, there's only one symbol, echo, and there's only one general type of exception, and that's related to system resources. For the second example, the count easily goes into the dozens.</p><p>Why is this related to the security problem I led off with? Because if you have code you can't reason about, you don't just have a risk for bugs, it's a security risk too. The code doesn't care whether it's busy screwing up your beautiful solution or hacking your local network. You can't reason about it. Period. That's the problem. It's doing whatever it's coded to do.</p><p>Do npm packages count as "editable code underneath that I have to read or write for these symbols to work"? Sure, if you're downloading code and compiling it, you may have to edit it. It's a risk. If you're just hotlinking to a dll or something, that's different. If you're using precompiled code, whatever you've got, you've got. It may be buggy as hell and it may do nasty things that make you sad and drink by yourself late at night, but it's not a complexity issue, it's some other kind of issue, security, performance, and so on. Don't confuse them. You address and work with the problems of that precompiled library in a totally different way than you would with code you may one day have to plow through.</p><p>Code Cogntivie Load (CCL) is not a good/bad metric. It's a measure of the risk in complexity you're assuming to do whatever work you have to do. Some problems may naturally require a great deal of complexity risk. Others not so much. That's your call, not mine.</p><p>The point is that you're measuring it, instead of just ignoring it until something goes wrong. Is your solution doing mostly the same thing but your CCL is going through the roof? You're most likely doing something wrong, since your code's value is staying the same while your coding risk is dramatically increasing. </p><p>There's no way of knowing whether code is appropriately complex or not, but we can (and should) measure how much <em>complexity risk</em> we're taking on ourselves and our downstream maintenance workers.</p><p>This will change the way you code and the way you think about coding. Good. Looking at the software landscape today, things need changing.</p><p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>    </div>

                    <p>On December 1st, 2020, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/want-more-postgresql-you-just-might-like-babelfish/">Amazon AWS announced Babelfish</a>. Babelfish “<em>adds an endpoint to PostgreSQL that understands the SQL Server wire protocol Tabular Data Stream (TDS), as well as commonly used T-SQL commands used by SQL Server. Support for T-SQL includes elements such as the SQL dialect, cursors, catalog views, data types, triggers, stored procedures, and functions</em>”. Wow. <strong>SQL Server wire and application compatibility for PostgreSQL!</strong></p>
<p>What this means is that Babelfish will be able to “impersonate” a SQL Server database. Applications may be able to run unchanged, believing that they are connecting to SQL Server, when they will actually be connecting to PostgreSQL-Babelfish.</p>
<p>Surely, compatibility will not be 100% at the beginning. But it will keep improving, and <strong>as long as it provides enough compatibility for a nice set of applications to run unchanged on Babelfish, it will open the door to migrations and replacing SQL Servers with Babelfish</strong>. This is very good news for the PostgreSQL Community!</p>
<h2 id="brief-analysis-on-postgresql-popularity">Brief analysis on PostgreSQL popularity</h2>
<p><a href="https://db-engines.com/en/blog_post/85">PostgreSQL has been named (again) database of the year 2020</a>. This award is given based on “<em>DBMSs sorted by how much they managed to increase their popularity in 2020</em>”, which means that <strong>PostgreSQL was the database that grew the most in popularity in 2020</strong>. <strong>But in absolute terms, PostgreSQL’s popularity is still way behind that of Oracle, MySQL and SQL Server</strong>. Let’s analyze <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend">db-engines popularity trend chart</a> for the Top4 DBMS, on a linear scale (db-engines presents results on a logarithmic scale):</p>
<p><img src="https://postgresql.fund/img/dbengines_popularity_ranking-linear-900.png" alt="DB-engines popularity ranking - linear scale"></p>
<p>The trends for the last 8 years are clear: Oracle and SQL Server are constantly declining in popularity; MySQL is slightly declining; and PostgreSQL is clearly growing in popularity. But while PostgreSQL almost tripled in popularity in these eight years, it is still far behind the other three.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL became the database of 2020 because its popularity grew the most in the last year. The other three mentioned databases declined in popularity during 2020. If we assume the same rate of change in popularity will continue for the upcoming years, by 2025 PostgreSQL would still remain in the 4th place, albeit close to SQL Server. It won’t overtake SQL Server until 2026, and by 2030 PostgreSQL would still lag behind Oracle and MySQL.</p>

<p>How is this analysis related to Babelfish? <strong>Babelfish opens the door to new users, new markets, new opportunities. <strong>Babelfish may bump PostgreSQL’s popularity further, targeting use cases that either PostgreSQL is not able to reach today; or can only reach via complex technology migrations.</strong> Babelfish could be one of the many potential boosts that PostgreSQL needs in order to become a more universally used database</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="to-fork-or-not-to-fork-thats-the-question">To fork, or not to fork, that’s the question</h2>
<p>In their announcement, AWS said that “<em>We are open sourcing Babelfish in 2021. […] We are releasing Babelfish under the Apache 2.0 license. We invite others to become active in the project, and we will see it as a sign of success when developers outside of AWS become committers or maintainers. You can help by adding or extending Babelfish functionality, submitting feature requests, working on documentation, and contributing test cases</em>”. They also mentioned the code will be published on GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>At the time Babelfish will be published, it will likely require changes to PostgreSQL to enable Babelfish to be an extension</strong>. Some people may call that a “fork” of PostgreSQL, and others may call it a “development branch”. The difference between the two will only be clear over time. Note that PostgreSQL development model doesn’t use feature branches, and in my opinion it’s a great model –but this is an entirely different topic. It is really appreciated that AWS is releasing the code as open source, and under a permissive license (that should be compatible with PostgreSQL’s). <strong>If AWS developers work with the PostgreSQL Community to get the necessary changes merged into PostgreSQL core, then it would have been a development branch, and not a fork. This is something that the PostgreSQL Community and all parties involved need to figure out</strong>.</p>
<p>On January 25th, Amazon AWS made a first move. In an <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CAGBW59d5SjLyJLt-jwNv%2BoP6esbD8SCB%3D%3D%3D11WVe5%3DdOHLQ5wQ%40mail.gmail.com">email to PostgreSQL’s hackers mailing list</a>, Jan Wieck, a well-known Postgres-er, proposed to start discussing the implementation of protocol hooks. These hooks would enable to implement SQL Server’s protocol as an extension, rather than a fork.</p>
<p>Protocol hooks are, possibly, not the only hooks or modifications to PostgreSQL core that would be required to integrate the whole Babelfish project. With those changes to the core most of the Babelfish code could possibly be integrated in core as an extension(s). I cannot estimate the complexity of these core changes. But I believe that it would be a worthwhile effort, an effort that may further increase PostgreSQL outreach.</p>
<p>Only very recently (Feb 10th, 11th) some initial, very interesting, discussion around this proposal has started (including a very interesting offer to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CADUqk8UndFi7WHVNZscs4ZCk37_2aBUw-K32QA7sQd_3cJ%2Bqng%40mail.gmail.com">open source MySQL protocol compatibility for Postgres!</a>). It’s understandable, it’s a very busy time for PostgreSQL hackers (the last Commitfest for feature inclusion into PostgreSQL 14 is ongoing). But Babelfish was already announced more than two months ago; and it could be published anytime. I believe we need to start a deeper conversation about Postgres-Babelfish integration sooner than later. And what is being discussed so far are mainly technical considerations around the integration of one of the possibly several integration points that may be required. <strong>I’d love to also have a strategic discussion, where the Community would address, from a leadership perspective, what would be the plans for integrating, or not, Babelfish</strong>. <strong>Is Babelfish the Elephant in the Room?</strong> Probably not anymore, but I anyway hope this post will help, at the very least, to spark the strategic discussion.</p>
<p>What is the alternative? What will happen if PostgreSQL would not implement such hooks or will not pursue understanding with AWS, for the common benefit, and help Babelfish and PostgreSQL cooperate and allow for code bases integration?</p>
<p><strong>Under this scenario, AWS will probably have to keep Babelfish as a fork</strong>. For one, AWS already keeps Aurora as a fork, even though it’s an internal one. Given AWS’ well-known customer obsession and that AWS doesn’t kill services that they started offering, I think that if given no other chance they will keep Babelfish as a separate fork, getting its own share of features and contributors. Surely AWS knows that maintaining a fork is expensive. And I believe they have no intention to have it as a fork (otherwise, they won’t be publishing it as open source). So there will be serious intentions and efforts to merge it into PostgreSQL, for the benefit of all. But the recent Elastic case has demonstrated that AWS is committed to the open source software that is part of their managed services, and are willing to step up with a lot of resources when they are required to continue serving their customers. Apparently AWS has around 200 open job positions (!!) for developers working on Elasticsearch. Surely they can do the same for Babelfish, especially given that RDS Postgres/Aurora/Babelfish is probably a much larger business for them than Elastic.</p>
<h2 id="on-protocol-hooks">On protocol hooks</h2>
<p>Jan also argued that “<em>Creating the necessary infrastructure in the postmaster and backend will open up more possibilities, that are not tied to our compatibility efforts. Possible use cases for wire protocol extensibility include the development of a completely new, not backwards compatible PostgreSQL protocol or extending the existing wire protocol</em>”. I cannot agree more. This effort not only benefits the Babelfish integration; but also opens the door for new PostgreSQL protocols.</p>
<p>The current PostgreSQL protocol (v3) <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/release-7-4.html">has been in use since PostgreSQL 7.4</a>, released in 2003. It works well, and has spun the broadest possible set of drivers, tools and even compatible databases that use it (like CockroachDB, Crate.io or NoisePage, for example). But it also has some limitations and well-known problems. There is an entry in PostgreSQL “TODO” about <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Todo#Wire_Protocol_Changes_.2F_v4_Protocol">proposed changes for an eventual v4 version of the protocol</a>. I also participated in another <a href="https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/blob/95ba7b261e39754674c5817695ae5ebf9a341fae/backend_protocol_v4_wanted_features.md">“brain dump” on v4 proposed features</a>. But despite much talk, v4 has not happened and there’s no ongoing effort to make it happen. v3 is to stay for long.</p>
<p>Why is that, why can’t the protocol evolve? Have a look at <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CD5C1525-8B2C-4986-87F0-B1CB3B52ACA7%40wa-research.ch">this thread</a>, where a proposal to implement an HTTP protocol for PostgreSQL was made. Other than the proposal about HTTP itself –which has its own merits, and is a topic that I believe should definitely be discussed again–, the general sentiment was that <strong>any new protocol would have to provide all the features that the current protocol has, work for every use case, do not disrupt existing drivers or provide good means for driver rewrites; and do it significantly better than the current one</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-innovators-dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</h2>
<p>I don’t have an MBA, but this to me is a clear case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a>. PostgreSQL protocol v3 is the incumbent, and protocol v4 and/or other protocols like HTTP are the potential disruptive innovators. In what looks like a perfect match for Christensen’s book, a disruptive protocol innovation “<em>would not initially satisfy the demands of even the high end of the market</em>”. In other words, initial versions of these protocols should not target feature parity with the incumbent. They should rather focus on doing the basics, but much better, with a compelling higher value proposition.</p>
<p>Eventually, these protocols “<em>will surpass sustaining technologies</em>” and may end up replacing the current v3 protocol. This was very well explained by Prof. Clayton and is represented on his famous graph comparing the product …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div>

<p>This article is my attempt to summarise common technical interview process steps and to collect in one place some useful insights from recruiters that they normally send to applicants before the interviews. This is not a comprehensive guide of the interview process and the actual interview steps may vary from company to company.</p>

<p>The common technical interview process consists of three main steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Phone interview with recruiter</strong> when you’ll be ask to tell about your experience and explain your motivation.</li>
<li><strong>Technical phone interview</strong> where you’ll be asked to solve some tech problems in real time.</li>
<li><strong>On-site (in-person) interview</strong> in company’s office when you’ll be asked to solve technical and system design problems as well as to answer some behavioural questions.</li>
</ol>

<p>All interview steps are mainly consists of three following building blocks:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Problem solving.</strong> The main focus here is your ability to solve technical problems by applying different algorithmic approaches and data structures.</li>
<li><strong>System design.</strong> This one is about your ability to combine many pieces (frameworks, approaches, databases, micro-services) and design a system as a whole that will successfully solve certain tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioural questions</strong> that are focused on your experience, motivations, leadership and soft skills.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s move on and touch every of these 6 aspects of the interview process.</p>

<p>Recruiter will introduce himself and give you more details about the company and projects you might be working on. You’ll be asked to introduce you and explain what was your responsibility on the previous projects.</p>
<p>Normally only things you did during the last 1–3 years matters. So focus on your latest achievements and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Introduce your side-projects, open-source projects and production projects from your latest workplace.</p>
<p>It will be done by means of telephone.</p>
<p>Things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get familiar with the job description and prepare your questions regarding the job.</li>
<li>Prepare a short introduction of yourself in the context of your profile, professional past, qualifications and education.</li>
<li>Use specific examples. The strongest examples are work based examples, but you can also use study or personal examples.</li>
<li>If you haven’t understood the interviewer’s question, ask them to repeat it or explain it further.</li>
<li>Learn about the company, be passioned about the company’s product (about what company is doing).</li>
<li>Feel free to ask any questions you have about the role or company in general.</li>
</ul>
<p>Explain yours experience examples in a clear manner. Using the STAR technique will help you:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>SITUATION/TASK</em> — Describe the situation/task you faced and the context of the story.</li>
<li><em>ACTION</em> — What actions did you take?</li>
<li><em>RESULTS</em> — How did you measure success for this project? What results did you achieve?</li>

<p>During the phone interview you’ll have a coding exercise (or task to develop something online).</p>
<p>The call will be 45–60 minutes long.</p>
<p>Some interviews will include 2 people. Don’t worry — one will be there purely for training purposes.</p>
<p>You will need access to a webcam. Wired internet and headphones are recommended but not essential. Your computer may require a plug-in install, so make sure you test the link that will be provided to you by recruiter with enough time before your call. Make sure to take the call in a calm environment.</p>
<p>You might be asked to install and/or use special programs and service like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/chime/">Amazon Chime</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bluejeans.com/">BlueJeans</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">Hangouts</a></li>
<li><a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom.us</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a></li>
<li><a href="https://coderpad.io/">CoderPad</a> or others</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to expect during the interview:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>45 mins initial interview with 1–2 coding questions using a whiteboard (if on site) or laptop and a service similar to CoderPad (if remote).</li>
<li>You will be tested on your problem solving and core CS fundamental skills (theory, algorithms, data structures, design patterns, recursions, binary tree questions, Fibonacci series etc.)</li>
<li>You will need to think of an efficient, optimised and bug-free solution to code up quickly and concisely in whatever language you code best in.</li>
<li>Keep it simple! If you think it’s obvious, it probably is. Start with a simple solution, and think about making it more efficient afterwards.</li>

<p>For the on-site, you generally have 4 to 5 interviews — at least 2 strictly focused on coding, 1 on design, and 1 on conversation/coding. So basically all three building blocks described at the beginning of the chapter will be included.</p>
<p>There will be a 45-minute lunch to break up your day — the lunch will most likely be with one of the engineers. Feel free to be very candid with the engineer — they will not be providing feedback, but are there to answer any questions/concerns you may not have asked during your interview.</p>

<p><strong>General tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explain</strong> — Interviewers want to understand how you think, so explain your thought process and decision making throughout the interview. Remember they are not only evaluating your technical ability, but also how you solve problems. Explicitly state and check assumptions with your interviewer to ensure they are reasonable.</li>
<li><strong>​Clarify</strong> — Many questions will be deliberately open-ended to provide insight into what categories and information you value within the technological puzzle. Interviewers are looking to see how you engage with the problem and your primary method for solving it. Be sure to talk
through your thought process and feel free to ask specific questions if you need clarification.</li>
<li><strong>Improve</strong> — Think about ways to improve the solution you present. It’s worthwhile to think out loud about your initial thoughts to a question. In many cases, your first answer may need some refining and further explanation. If necessary, start with the brute force solution and improve
on it — just let the interviewer know that’s what you’re doing and why.</li>
<li><strong>Practice</strong> — You won’t have access to an IDE or compiler during the interview so practice writing code on paper or a whiteboard. Be sure to test your code and ensure it’s easily readable without bugs. Don’t stress about small syntactical errors like which substring to use for a given method (e.g. start, end or start, length) — just pick one and let your interviewer know.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="before-the-interview">Before the interview<a href="#before-the-interview" aria-label="before the interview permalink"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Practice! Practice! Practice!</strong></p>
<p>Put yourself under time constraints as speed is important in the interview.</p>
<p><strong>Problems examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Write the code to print the first element of each “row” of a binary tree.</li>
<li>Implement tic-tac-toe.</li>
<li>Write the code to show the number and type of permutations of a given string.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>You might also want to read <a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">Cracking the coding interview book</a> that will help you to prepare for coding interviews similar to what you will be solving throughout the interview process.</p>
<p><strong>Topics to cover:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coding</strong> — You should know at least one programming language really well, preferably C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Go, or C. You will be expected to know APIs, Object Oriented Design and Programming, how to test your code, as well as come up with corner cases and edge cases for code. Note that interviewers will focus on conceptual understanding rather than memorisation.</li>
<li><strong>Algorithms</strong> — Approach the problem with both bottom-up and top-down algorithms. You will be expected to know the complexity of an algorithm and how you can improve/change it. Algorithms that are used to solve problems include sorting (plus searching and binary search), divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming/memoization, greediness, recursion or algorithms linked to a specific data structure. Know Big-O notations (e.g. run time) and be ready to discuss complex algorithms like Dijkstra and A*. Knowing the runtimes, theoretical limitations, and basic implementation strategies of different classes of algorithms is more important than memorising the specific details of any given algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Sorting</strong> — Be familiar with common sorting functions and on what kind of input data they’re efficient on or not. Think about efficiency means in terms of runtime and space used. For example, in exceptional cases insertion-sort or radix-sort are much better than the generic QuickSort/MergeSort/HeapSort answers.</li>
<li><strong>Data structures</strong> — You should study up on as many data structures as possible. Data structures most frequently used are arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash-sets, hash-maps, hash-tables, dictionary, trees and binary trees, heaps and graphs. You should know the data structure inside out, and what algorithms tend to go along with each data structure.</li>
<li><strong>Mathematics</strong> — Some interviewers ask basic discrete math questions. Spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory on (or teaching yourself) the essentials of elementary probability theory and combinatorics. You should be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk.</li>
<li><strong>Graphs</strong> — Consider if a problem can be applied with graph algorithms like distance, search, connectivity, cycle-detection, etc. There are three basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list) — familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros and cons. You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms, breadth-first search and depth-first search. Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs …</li></ul></div></div>

<p><em>After I finished school in 2007 and later graduated from high school in 2012, I thought it was all over. I kind of swore that I’d never touch a textbook again. “Welcome world,” I said, “I’m ready and now I know everything!” Boy was I wrong. I learned the hard way that our complex and rapidly changing world increasingly demands adopting new skills. And what I’ve accumulated as knowledge during my time behind the desk was not even close to what was happening in the real world.</em> <em>Learning, not simply during the years associated with formal schooling, but across the lifespan seemed a must.</em></p>



<p>Mark Twain famously said, “I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.” More than 100 years later, that’s still the case – or at least it should be. We should not, let the material we study now, or years ago when we were in school, satisfy our appetite and our thirst for knowledge.</p>



<p>In our current setting, it’s extremely important to educate yourself and regularly expose yourself to various topics that are not covered by your school, and/or job, curricula. Simply digesting what your teacher shares or what your company is doing is not enough to stay afloat. You need a different point of view. Make unusual connections. Look for inspiration in topics that others might call crazy or insane.</p>



<p>If you’re a student reading this, you probably haven’t yet discovered that the information shared by your teacher is not enough to help you get a <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/bullshit-jobs/" target="_blank" aria-label="nice job (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">nice job</a> or <a href="https://durmonski.com/business/fewer-moving-parts/" target="_blank" aria-label="start a business (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">start a business</a>. If you have already dealt with the school bureaucracy, fought your way through countless exams and unusually not useful school practices, and you’re now a proud owner of a Job, congrats! You know how little our school system has given to us. You know, I hope, how little you know and how much is yet to be explored. Especially today, when things constantly change and where, as many modern authors state, “change is the only constant.”</p>



<p>Our complex and rapidly changing world creates a need, demands a need, for self-initiated and self-managed learning.</p>



<p>If you still don’t know how little you know, and how much you need to acquire to get a new job, keep your current one, or completely change directions, in this article, I’m going to share why it’s so damn important to become master of your own learning process. To become a sophisticated learner. To learn how to learn and to keep doing it till your very last day.</p>







<h2>What Does Self-Regulated Learning Mean?</h2>



<p>Self-regulation in the learning process is commonly related to formal education. We think that becoming better at learning is not for us if we’re not in school. “I graduated with honors. I don’t need to get better at learning,” you might think.</p>



<p>That may be true. I mean, yes, being your teacher’s favorite student is probably a thought that makes you feel all fuzzy and good. But the information you accumulated in school as I just elegantly pointed out, is not enough – it never was – to transform you into a blossoming individual.</p>



<p>A self-regulated learner is a person who is aware of what he’s consuming and actively working towards self-imposed goals to acquire more relevant information. In this case, relevant means things that are closely related to the interests and skills of that person. Or the interests and skills the person wants to acquire. In other words, self-improving, as banal it might sound.</p>



<p>To avoid interpreting what has just been mentioned as something dry and unimaginable, let us give an example:</p>



<p>So, for example, let’s say that you’re a professional photographer. You’re making a living taking pictures. You are good. You have regular clients. Your <a href="https://durmonski.com/private/using-social-media/" target="_blank" aria-label="Instagram (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> profile is widely known in your country. Yet, for how long you think this will last?</p>



<p>As stated, things are changing. And they are changing fast. Reportedly, video is becoming more and more popular. In this situation, if you want to get to the next level, you probably need to school yourself on shooting and later editing video. Then, probably, you need to figure out how to properly attune your clip to fit across the newly created social media channels. And then, you need to learn all the growth-hack techniques other online entrepreneurs so enthusiastically share on their profiles. </p>



<p>To put it differently, there is always something new to learn. But this is not always obvious. In most situations, we reach a certain level of expertise and we settle. We get comfortable. And the moment we get too cozy with what we know is the moment others get ahead.</p>



<p>Self-regulation means actively monitoring your learning process. Being mindful about how and from where to obtain, and master, new information. Settings goals and motivating yourself to expand your expertise.</p>



<p>Plainly, continuously asking yourself the following: “Is the thing I’m reading, watching right now, helping me get better at X?”</p>







<h2>Why is Self-Regulated Learning Important?</h2>



<p>To make things even more difficult, if we have to go back to the example of the photographer, the simple realization that one needs to learn new things is not enough to make him better. The person also needs to have a good learning process.</p>



<p>Something we’re not thought in school, sadly.</p>



<p>The school, the system that runs the school, doesn’t do much to teach us how to actually improve our learning skills. It’s presumed that we know how to learn and study. The material is handed to us and we are expected to know what to do with it.</p>



<p>Or as stated in a scientific paper about self-regulated learning, “There is an overwhelming assumption in our educational system that the most important thing to deliver to students is content.”<span id="easy-footnote-1-13224"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-13224" title="Self-Regulated Learning: Beliefs, Techniques, and Illusions &amp;#8211; <a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143823&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>Annual Reviews</a>."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Besides sharing what is supposedly thought from teachers as great content, there is also a need to organize and remember that content. And today, in the 21st century, there is also the need to find great content. Since there is so much stuff out there, you need to know how to adequately sort the good from the clickbait-y.</p>



<p>Regrettably, schools are not actively teaching us about these things. We’re given a lecture. A paper with resources. Commonly also some sort of assignment. And that’s it. We need to figure how to best connect the pieces. But that’s not the worst of it. We’re also not though that these things also need to happen outside school premises – when we now have jobs and families. That after there is no longer a teacher who is monitoring your assignments and actually imposing them on you, that you should take his role and set assignments for yourself.</p>



<p>When we don’t know any of these things, they end in the graph unknown unknowns.<span id="easy-footnote-2-13224"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-13224" title="There are known knowns &amp;#8211; <a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>WIKI</a>."><sup>2</sup></a></span> Or in other words, things we don’t know exist. Hence, we don’t do them. And since we don’t do them, we never get better at what we do.</p>



<p>Self-regulating your learning process involves creating your own curriculum – being both the teacher and the student. This involves seriously considering what you want to learn and how you need to approach this subject.</p>







<h2>What Are The Self-Regulated Learning Fundamentals?</h2>



<p>Intuitively, high-achievers know how to approach learning. Or they simply found the best way for them after years of trial and error. Others, in contrast, simply go with the flow and do the most obvious exercise when trying to learn something new: they consume the information in front of them, never actually looking for resources on their own, and hope that some of the facts will stick.</p>



<p>These are not the best strategies, though.</p>



<p>The point of becoming sophisticated as a learner requires knowing how to manage your own learning activities.</p>



<p>It requires planning and the process is guided by metacognition (thinking about thinking). Or in our case, thinking about how to learn better.</p>

<p>This is a deliberate thought process that one must consider before actually approaching anything new. In simple words, this means that you don’t just open Google and start endlessly browsing articles. You first ask yourself: “What do I want to learn?; Why do I want to learn this?” You set expectations and goals. You consider your weaknesses in the learning process and find resources that are most likely to appeal to your persona.</p>



<p>Instead of relying on the algorithms to show you great content, you approach things strategically – you search for great content based on your goal.</p>



<p>Here are the fundamentals to create your own learning process:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Establish a plan and find resources</strong>: The first requirement, sort to say, is asking yourself what do you want to learn and why. Then, figure out what sources you’ll use, and how you’ll find them, to learn the desired thing. And finally, set a learning schedule and form a plan that will help you along the way.</li><li><strong>Monitoring and maintenance of knowledge</strong>: This is often overlooked. You can’t expect to remember everything from your first attempt. You should monitor yourself and find gaps in your skills – your processes. Then, find new ways to approach things that are hard for you to understand. Additionally, since often learning something new requires retention of certain facts, writing down the most important things is also a must.</li><li><strong>Self-reflection and adapting</strong>: Getting a good grade in school feels awesome. Launching a product and making sales is amazing. But these things are just outcomes. Often, the results we get are a lot of times based on luck, not always dependent on what we did. That’s why it’s far more important to reflect on what you think you did that get you these results and why.</li></ul>



<p>Now, once we have the fundamentals, let’s expand this further…</p>







<h2>How to Best Approach Something New?</h2>



<p>To put all of the above into practice, let’s consider another following example:</p>

<h2 id="0-what-is-active-listening-" data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_2b06d7-a8"><strong>What is active listening?</strong></h2>
<p>Active listening is the ability to focus completely on a speaker, understand their message, comprehend the information and respond thoughtfully, in a relevant way. Compared to passive listening, this highly valued interpersonal communication skill ensures you’re able to engage with your peer and later recall specific details without needing information repeated. Your partner will feel cared for and listened to, which results in building genuine and honest relationships.</p>
<p>To practice active listening, you make a conscious effort to hear not only the words that another person is saying but, more importantly, the&nbsp;complete message&nbsp;being communicated, subtle hints and non-verbal messages included, such as tone, emphasis, facial expressions and body language.</p>
<p>Active listening is always neutral and nonjudgmental from the listener’s side.</p>
<p>Finally, to practice active listening, you turn an otherwise passive process into an interactive flow by techniques such as eye contact, asking follow-up questions and reflecting back what was said.<br></p>
<h2 id="1-why-is-active-listening-essential-in-a-work-environment-" data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_14e87a-de"><strong>Why is active listening essential in a work environment?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>First and foremost, <strong>it helps you build trust</strong>. When people know they can speak freely to you without interruptions and judgment, they’ll be more likely to confide in you. This is especially helpful when meeting a new customer or business contact with whom you want to develop a long-term working relationship.</p>
<p><strong>It helps you build genuine and honest connections. </strong>Active listening helps others feel comfortable sharing information with you. When you demonstrate your willingness and ability to listen to what others have to say truly, people will be motivated to communicate with you on a regular basis. This can open up opportunities to collaborate with others, get work done quickly or start new projects. All of these things can help lead you to success in your career. As a manager, this skill is also essential to your success – in fact, the lack of it is <a href="https://ochronus.online/engineering-manager-4-ways-of-failure/#3-4-too-much-solving-not-enough-listening">one of the key ways to fail</a>.</p>
<p><strong>It helps you increase your knowledge and understanding of various topics. </strong>The best employees are always striving to learn something new and grow their knowledge base. Because active listening helps you retain information, it will also help you better understand new topics and remember what you’ve learned so you can apply it in the future.</p>
<p><strong>It helps you identify and solve problems. </strong>Actively listening to others will help you detect challenges and difficulties others face or problems within projects. The more quickly you’re able to spot these issues, you sooner you can find a solution or create a plan to address it.</p>
<h2 id="2-how-can-active-listening-be-beneficial-while-searching-for-a-job-" data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_6339e7-8f"><p><strong>How can active listening be beneficial while searching for a job?</strong></p></h2>
<p>Active listening is beneficial throughout the whole process of searching for a job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you look at job advertisements and research companies, you can look for clues that might help you learn more about the company before you apply. Don’t just look at the words, though. Try to identify the tone of the post. Does the job posting use formal language? Casual? Conversational? Does it use a lot of technical jargon or industry language? Does it seem frantic? All of these can help determine what the job and company are like and help you decide if you want to apply. Actively listen to the company website’s tone to learn more about the company culture. What images do they use? Are they stock photos, formal portraits, or candid images? Are there videos you can watch (and listen to!)? How formal or informal is the narrator? What do you find on social media? All of these clues can help you figure out if the company is the right fit for you.</p>

<p>Naturally, the best place to utilize your active listening skills is the interview. You gather much more information this way, both because of encouraging your interviewer to be more honest with you and asking clarifying and follow-up questions. Active listening can also boost your evaluation during and after an interview. More and more companies recognize that good communication skills are essential for job success and even company culture and are actively looking for it during interviews. Even if you interview at a company which does not focus on this, you will leave a good impression by being an active listener – you’ll seem more interested in the job than other candidates. It will be in general much more enjoyable for the interviewer to talk to you. Last but not least, actively listening to your interviewer, you’ll get a glimpse of what kind of communication standards are present in your target company and whether you’d enjoy working there.</p>

<h2 id="3-how-can-you-best-practice-active-listening-" data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_3396a3-a4"><p><strong>How can you best practice active listening?</strong></p></h2>
<p>Active listening starts with the <strong>right intent</strong>. If you don’t actually care about what the other person wants to say it will be tough to listen genuinely. We are frequently rushing from meeting to meeting, and our minds are already on the next thing we need to do when talking to someone. Slowing down and taking some time (even a minute can help!) to refocus our attention and prepare right before the discussion starts is essential. If you know the topic in advance, think a bit about it while considering your peer’s context with regards to it. What is their potential goal with the conversation, what do they hope to get out of it? What mindset would that result in, and how could that influence the discussion? How can you best support them?</p>
<p><strong>Be curious</strong> about what the other person has to say. Actively work on putting your judgment aside and be neutral, even when what they say strikes a nerve. Giving feedback is generally not a part of active listening, it comes after that and only if the other person asked for it.</p>
<p>Giving <strong>verbal and non-verbal affirmations and cues</strong> is key so that your peer actually feels that you are listening to them.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t interrupt</strong> your partner while they are speaking. Use non-verbal cues to demonstrate that you’re following along.</p>
<p><strong>Shut down your internal dialogue</strong> – this both helps you focus and keeps you judgment-free.</p>
<p><strong>Be patien</strong>t with the other person – you might feel the discussion is dragging on but remember your role is to listen, not to enforce your agenda! On a related note, don’t abruptly change the subject until you’ve made sure your peer said what they wanted to about the topic at hand.</p>
<h3 id="4-what-are-some-verbal-ways-to-demonstrate-active-listening-" data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_b430a5-b3">&nbsp;<p><strong>What are some verbal ways to demonstrate active listening?</strong></p></h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08934215.2011.610731" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2011 study</a> concluded that active listening was primarily associated with verbal social skills.</p>
<p>One of the most important techniques to verbally demonstrating active listening is paraphrasing. This is a form of reflecting on what you’ve heard by summarizing the message’s main points in your own words. When you do this, you show that you understand the message and you’re also giving a chance to your peer to clarify or expand it further. An example: “So you’re basically saying that our training process works in general, but could use some improvement, right?</p>
<p>Asking <strong>open-ended follow-up questions</strong> is equally important. Ask these questions in a way that demonstrates that you’ve gathered the essence of what your partner was saying and also guide them to share more or more in-depth information. This technique can be used together with paraphrasing. Open-ended questions are ones that cannot be answered with a simple “yes” or “no” but instead require your peer to elaborate. An example, building on the previous paragraph: “I understand you feel our training process could be improved – what changes would you like to see?”</p>
<p>Besides open-ended questions, you can ask more specific probing questions too. These questions drill deeper into topics or can be used to narrow down the scope of a subject that might be too broad to discuss in one setting. Example: “Could you elaborate a bit on how the sequencing of training sessions was unhelpful?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learn more about questions as a coaching technique here: <a href="https://ochronus.online/questions-vs-directions/">Coaching Questions vs. Giving Directions – Ochronus online</a></p>
<p><strong>Displaying empathy</strong> goes a long way in conversations and is key in active listening. Ensure your peer understands that you recognize their emotions and maybe even share their feelings. Go a step further with showing compassion which will help you connect with your partner and establish mutual trust. Example: “Going through that kind of an experience must have been hard for you; I’m really sorry!”</p>
<p>You can <strong>share similar experiences</strong> to show you deeply understand what your peer is talking about. It will also help build the relationship and – depending on the goal of the situation – can turn into you giving valuable advice about how you’ve solved similar challenges in the past. Example: “I also had a tough time with the training process years ago. This is how I made it better: ….”</p>
<p><strong>Short verbal affirmations and cues</strong> are probably the easiest way to show that you’re following along and are still engaged. Some of these can even be used while the speaker is talking without interrupting them. Examples: “Mhm”, “I see”, “I agree”.</p>
<p>Nothing demonstrates that you care about your peer and the topic at hand than <strong>recalling relevant, previously shared information</strong>. Example: “Oh, true, and I remember you shared your ideas about improving our training process – let’s make sure we implement those ideas!”</p>
<h3 id="5-what-are-some-non-verbal-ways-to-demonstrate-active-listening-" data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_343c56-85"><p><strong>What are some non-verbal ways to demonstrate active listening?&nbsp;</strong></p></h3>
<p>Non-verbal cues are just as important as verbal ones in active listening, and there is a set of simple things you can do here. Use a combination of the following techniques:</p>
<p>Maintaining <strong>eye contact</strong> is a sure way to make the speaker feel you’re focused on them. Make sure your gaze is natural and conveys a feeling of interest and care.</p>

    <p>Whether it was our first call or our hundredth, founders inevitably asked me whether they should market and sell their enterprise software to buyers/executives (top-down) or to users (bottom-up). My view, which only strengthened every time I uttered it, was this:</p>

<p>Marketing and selling to users is just another, roundabout way of getting to the buyer. Compared with the top-down approach — think whitepapers and meetings with the CIO — it takes more effort and time to see a payoff. More effort because users want a smooth self-serve experience, which means more product work. More time because big budget decisions are made at the executive level, which means you are just adding more hoops to hop through before meeting the CIO.</p>

<p>More recently this inevitable question evolved from “top-down or bottom-up?” to “what do you think of product-led growth?”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gkogan.co/product-led-growth/">Product-led growth</a> is the strategy of getting to the users first. It emphasizes letting users see, test, and get value from the product quickly and on their own. Since it’s an evolution of “bottom-up,” my answer was more or less the same.</p>

<p>Sure, there were success stories like Atlassian and GitLab, but those were exceptions to the rule, especially for enterprise software.</p>

<p><strong>I was wrong.</strong></p>

<p>Although the clues had been all around me for months, I paid them no mind until they hit me in the face in quick succession:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Late in November I had an intro call with yet another founder interested in product-led growth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A week later, another founder brought up product-led growth. Not as a question but as a decision they’ve made. (I now <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/pinecone/">work</a> for this <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/">company</a> in part because of that decision.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next day, I attended several sessions at FC Build, where CEOs of unicorn and public companies mentioned product-led growth either as a major contributor to their growth or a major area of focus in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The day after, I spoke on a panel about developer marketing, with other panelists from Twilio, Google Cloud, and Sequoia. In this discussion I heard “developer marketing” used interchangeably with “product-led growth.” (Much of my work involves marketing to developers, yet I never thought of it as product-led growth.) The event organizer holds a panel like this every month, and this one had the most attendants of all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A week later, Tomasz Tunguz of Redpoint Ventures made a <a href="https://tomtunguz.com/2021-predictions/">prediction</a> that “Product-led growth [will become] the standard GTM for software and infrastructure companies” in 2021.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Over a few reflective days in December, other clues from the past year started coming into focus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>My three biggest opportunities of the year — two unicorns and one Fortune-50 company — revolved around product-led growth. (Having failed to recognize it at the time, I lost those opportunities.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the projects I enjoyed most were really about product-led growth: Launching a trial and growing data scientist users for <a href="https://www.dominodatalab.com/">Domino Data Lab</a>, increasing self-serve revenue from developers for <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, and commercializing open-source software for <a href="https://www.goteleport.com/">Teleport</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seemingly every one of my startup clients and every other prospective client had asked me about product-led growth at some point, indicating widespread interest among founders and their investors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I researched enterprise software companies that recently went public for my <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/category-creation/">category creation</a> post, I noticed more than half of them offer free trials.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure I wasn’t just seeing what I wanted to see, I emailed five investors with a question: “How much (or little) demand are you seeing for product-led growth compared to enterprise demand-gen?” Four out of five confirmed seeing strong demand and opportunity for product-led growth among startups; one remained neutral.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/399f678b2d026ec46d1dbd67095ad42bd7552e52/80e97/images/uploads/370.jpg" alt="Cartoon about getting a second opinion."></p>

<p>The trend was clear: Software purchasing decisions are increasingly starting with the users. “What tools do my engineers need,” “what do they already use,” “can they try this,” “what do they think of this?” Ironically, calling the CIO is now a roundabout way of getting to the users.</p>

<p>I changed my mind about product-led growth. Software companies not already targeting users (over buyers) should consider changing theirs.</p>

    <p><em>Posted on January 30, 2021
    
        by Thomas Mahler
    </em></p></div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Quite a while back I wrote a larger article on the algebraic foundation of software patterns which also covered the <a href="https://thma.github.io/posts/2018-11-24-lambda-the-ultimate-pattern-factory.html#map-reduce">MapReduce algorithm</a>.</p>
<p>During the research digged out a paper on <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0498/3a1c0d6343e21129aaffca2a1b3eec419523.pdf">algebraic properties of distributed big data analytics</a>, which explained that a MapReduce will always work correctly when the intermediate data structure resulting from the <code>map</code>-phase is a Monoid under the <code>reduce</code>-operation.</p>
<p>For some reason, I was not convinced that this Monoid-condition was enough, because all the typical examples like word-frequency maps are even <strong>commutative</strong> Monoids under the respective reduce operation.</p>
<p>So I came up with the following personal theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only if the intermediate data structure resulting from the <code>map</code>-phase is a <strong>commutative Monoid</strong> under the <code>reduce</code>-operation, then a parallel MapReduce will produce correct results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried to validate this property using the <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_QuickCheck2">QuickCheck test framework</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly the QuickCheck tests failed! This finally convinced me that my theory was wrong, and after a little deeper thought, I could understand why.</p>
<p>I was impressed with the power of QuickCheck, so I thought it would be a good idea to share this lesson in falsification.</p>
<p>The code shown in this blog <a href="https://github.com/thma/CommutativeMonoid">is also available on GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="commutative-monoids">Commutative Monoids</h2>
<p>In abstract algebra, a monoid is a <em>set</em> equipped with an <em>associative binary operation</em> and an <em>identity element</em>.</p>
<p>The simplest example for a <em>commutative Monoid</em> is <span>\((\mathbb{N}_0, +, 0)\)</span>: the natural numbers under addition with <span>\(0\)</span> as the identity (or neutral) element. We can use QuickCheck to verify that indeed the Monoid laws plus commutativity are maintained.</p>
<p>If we want to use <code>GHC.Natural</code> type to represent natural numbers, we first have to make <code>Natural</code> instantiate the <code>Arbitrary</code> type class which is used by QuickCheck to automatically generate test data:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>import</span>           <span>Test.QuickCheck</span> (<span>Arbitrary</span>, arbitrary, <span>NonNegative</span> (..))</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>import</span>           <span>GHC.Natural</span>     (<span>Natural</span>, naturalFromInteger)</span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>instance</span> <span>Arbitrary</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5">  arbitrary <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">    <span>NonNegative</span> nonNegative <span>&lt;-</span> arbitrary</span>
<span id="cb1-7">    <span>return</span> <span>$</span> naturalFromInteger nonNegative</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can start to write our property based tests. For algebraic structures it is straightforward to come up with properties: we just write the required laws (associativity, 0 is identity element and commutativity) as properties.</p>
<p>I am using Hspec as a wrapper around QuickCheck as it provides a very nice testing DSL which makes it easy to read the code and the output of the test suite:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>import</span>           <span>Test.Hspec</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span>spec ::</span> <span>Spec</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">spec <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5">  describe <span>"The Monoid 'Natural Numbers under Addition'"</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6">    it <span>"is associative"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb2-7">      property <span>$</span> \x y z <span>-&gt;</span> ((x <span>+</span> y) <span>+</span> z) <span>`shouldBe`</span> ((x <span>+</span> (y <span>+</span> z))<span> ::</span> <span>Natural</span>)</span>
<span id="cb2-8">      </span>
<span id="cb2-9">    it <span>"has 0 as left and right identity element"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb2-10">      property <span>$</span> \x <span>-&gt;</span> (x <span>+</span> <span>0</span> <span>`shouldBe`</span> (<span>x ::</span> <span>Natural</span>)) <span>.&amp;&amp;.</span> (<span>0</span> <span>+</span> x <span>`shouldBe`</span> x)</span>
<span id="cb2-11">      </span>
<span id="cb2-12">    it <span>"is commutative"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb2-13">      property <span>$</span> \x y <span>-&gt;</span> x <span>+</span> y <span>`shouldBe`</span> (y <span>+</span><span> x ::</span> <span>Natural</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The output of these tests will be as follows:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>Monoid</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2">  <span>The</span> Monoid <span>'Natural Numbers under Addition'</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3">    <span>is</span> associative</span>
<span id="cb3-4">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span>
<span id="cb3-5">    <span>has</span> 0 as identity (or neutral) <span>element</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span>
<span id="cb3-7">    <span>is</span> commutative</span>
<span id="cb3-8">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So behind the scenes, QuickCheck has generated test data for 100 tests for each property under test. For all these data the test cases passed.</p>
<p>This is definitely not a proof. But it gives us some confidence that our math text-books are correct when giving Natural Numbers under addition as an example for a commutative Monoid.</p>
<p>OK, that was easy! Now let’s move to non-commutative Monoids.</p>
<h2 id="non-commutative-monoids">Non-commutative Monoids</h2>
<p>Strings (or any other Lists) under concatenation are a typical example. It’s easy to see that <code>"hello" ++ ("dear" ++ "people")</code> equals <code>"(hello" ++ "dear") ++ "people"</code>, but that <code>"hello" ++ "world"</code> differs from <code>"world" ++ "hello"</code>.</p>
<p>Now let’s try to formalize these intuitions as QuickCheck property based tests again.</p>
<p>First I’m introducing an alias for <code>(++)</code>, as it is defined on any list type, it would be required to have type signatures in all properties (as we had all those <code>:: Natural</code> signatures in the examples above). So I define an operation <code>(⊕)</code> which is only defined on <code>String</code> instances:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1">(⊕)<span> ::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">(⊕) a b <span>=</span> a <span>++</span> b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can extend our test suite with the following test cases:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">  describe <span>"The Monoid 'Strings under concatenation'"</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2">    </span>
<span id="cb5-3">    it <span>"is associative"</span> <span>$</span> </span>
<span id="cb5-4">      property <span>$</span> \x y z <span>-&gt;</span> ((x ⊕ y) ⊕ z) <span>`shouldBe`</span> (x ⊕ (y ⊕ z))</span>
<span id="cb5-5">      </span>
<span id="cb5-6">    it <span>"has \"\" as left and right identity element"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb5-7">      property <span>$</span> \x <span>-&gt;</span> (x ⊕ <span>""</span> <span>`shouldBe`</span> x) <span>.&amp;&amp;.</span> (<span>""</span> ⊕ x <span>`shouldBe`</span> x)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The output looks promising:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1">  <span>The</span> Monoid <span>'Strings under concatenation'</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2">    <span>is</span> associative</span>
<span id="cb6-3">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span>
<span id="cb6-4">    <span>has</span> <span>""</span> as left and right identity element</span>
<span id="cb6-5">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now let’s try to test the non-commutativity:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1">    it <span>"is NOT commutative"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2">      property <span>$</span> \x y <span>-&gt;</span> x ⊕ y <span>`shouldNotBe`</span> y ⊕ x</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But unfortunately the output tells us that this is not true:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1">    <span>is</span> NOT commutative FAILED [1]</span>
<span id="cb8-2"></span>
<span id="cb8-3">  <span>1</span>) <span>Monoid</span>, The Monoid <span>'Strings under concatenation'</span>, is NOT commutative</span>
<span id="cb8-4">       <span>Falsifiable</span> (after 1 test)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb8-5">         <span>""</span></span>
<span id="cb8-6">         <span>""</span></span>
<span id="cb8-7">       <span>not</span> expected: <span>""</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We formulated the property in the wrong way. The <code>(⊕)</code> <em>may be commutative for some</em> edge cases, e.g.&nbsp;when one or both of the arguments are <code>""</code>. But it is not commutative <em>in general</em> – that is for all possible arguments.</p>
<p>We could rephrase this property as <em>“There exists at least one pair of arguments <span>\((x, y)\)</span> for which <span>\(\oplus\)</span> is not commutative”</em>:</p>
<p><span>\[\exists (x,y) \left [  x \oplus y \neq y \oplus x \right ]\]</span></p>
<p>QuickCheck does not come with a mechanism for <em>existential quantification</em>. But as is has <code>forAll</code>, that is <em>universal quantification</em>. So we can try to make use of the following equivalence:</p>
<p><span>\[\exists (x,y) \left [  x \oplus y \neq y \oplus x \right ] 
  \equiv 
  \neg \forall (x,y) \left [ x \oplus y = y \oplus x \right ]\]</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately we can not write this simply as <code>not forAll</code>, as <code>forAll</code> returns a <code>Property</code> but <code>not</code> expects a <code>Bool</code>. But as explained in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42764847/is-there-a-there-exists-quantifier-in-quickcheck">this discussion on Stackoverflow</a> it is still posible to implement our own <code>exists</code>:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>exists ::</span> (<span>Show</span> a, <span>Arbitrary</span> a) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Property</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2">exists <span>=</span> forSome <span>$</span> resize <span>1000</span> arbitrary</span>
<span id="cb9-3"></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><span>forSome ::</span> (<span>Show</span> a, <span>Testable</span> prop) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Gen</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> prop) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Property</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5">forSome gen prop <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6">  mapResult (\r <span>-&gt;</span> r {P.reason <span>=</span> <span>"No witness found."</span>, P.callbacks <span>=</span> []}) <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb9-7">    once <span>$</span> disjoin <span>$</span> <span>replicate</span> <span>1000</span> <span>$</span> forAll gen prop</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can rewrite the property <span>\(\exists (x,y) \left [ x \oplus y \neq y \oplus x \right ]\)</span> as follows:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">    it <span>"is not commutative (via exists)"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">      exists <span>$</span> \(x,y) <span>-&gt;</span> x ⊕ y <span>/=</span> y ⊕ x</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I like how close the Haskell code stays to the concise mathematical formulation! The output of this test fits much better into our intuitive understanding:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1">    <span>is</span> not commutative (via exists)</span>
<span id="cb11-2">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 1 test.</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="sequential-mapreduce">Sequential MapReduce</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify <strong>a map function</strong> that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, <strong>and a reduce function</strong> that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.</p>
<p>[This] abstraction is inspired by the map and reduce primitives present in Lisp and many other functional languages. <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/16cb30b4b92fd4989b8619a61752a2387c6dd474.pdf">Quoted from Google Research</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not going into more details here, as You’ll find detailed information on this approach and a working example <a href="https://thma.github.io/posts/2018-11-24-lambda-the-ultimate-pattern-factory.html#map-reduce">in my original article</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the definition of a sequential MapReduce:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1">simpleMapReduce </span>
<span id="cb12-2"><span>  ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b)   <span>-- map function</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3">  <span>-&gt;</span> ([b] <span>-&gt;</span> c) <span>-- reduce function</span></span>
<span id="cb12-4">  <span>-&gt;</span> [a]        <span>-- list to map over</span></span>
<span id="cb12-5">  <span>-&gt;</span> c          <span>-- result</span></span>
<span id="cb12-6">simpleMapReduce mapFunc reduceFunc <span>=</span> reduceFunc <span>.</span> <span>map</span> mapFunc</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can test the sequential MapReduce algorithm with the following property based test:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">    it <span>"works correctly with a sequential map-reduce"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">      property <span>$</span> \a b c d <span>-&gt;</span> (simpleMapReduce <span>reverse</span> (<span>foldr</span> (⊕) <span>""</span>) [a,b,c,d]) </span>
<span id="cb13-3">                     <span>`shouldBe`</span> (<span>reverse</span> a) ⊕ (<span>reverse</span> b) ⊕ (<span>reverse</span> c) ⊕ (<span>reverse</span> d)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="excurs-foldmap">Excurs: foldMap</h3>
<p>What I have shown so far just demonstrates the general mechanism of chaining <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> functions without implying any parallel execution. Essentially we are chaining a <code>map</code> with a <code>fold</code> (i.e.&nbsp;reduction) function. In the Haskell base library there is a higher order function <code>foldMap</code> that covers exactly this pattern of chaining. Please note that <code>foldMap</code>does only a single traversal of the foldable data structure. It fuses the <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> phase into a single one by function composition of <code>mappend</code> and the mapping function <code>f</code>:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>-- | Map each element of the structure to a monoid,</span></span>
<span id="cb14-2"><span>-- and combine the results.</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3"><span>foldMap</span><span> ::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> t, <span>Monoid</span> m) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m) <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> m</span>
<span id="cb14-4"><span>foldMap</span> f <span>=</span> <span>foldr</span> (<span>mappend</span> <span>.</span> f) <span>mempty</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="parallel-mapreduce">Parallel MapReduce</h2>
<p>Now we come to the tricky part that kicked off this whole discussion: parallelism.</p>
<p>As an example we consider a simple sequential MapReduce, taking an input list of <code>Int</code>s, computing their squares and computing the sum of these squares:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> simpleMapReduce (<span>^</span><span>2</span>) (<span>foldr</span> (<span>+</span>) <span>0</span>) [<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>4</span>]</span>
<span id="cb15-2"><span>30</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s try to design this as a massively parallelized algorithm:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Mapping of <code>(^2)</code> over the input-list <code>[1,2,3,4]</code> would be started in parallel to the reduction of the intermediary list of squares by <code>(foldr (+) 0)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The mapping phase will be executed as a set of parallel computations (one for each element of the input list).</p></li>
<li><p>The reduction phase will also be executed as a set of parallel computations (one for each addition).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Of course the reduction phase can begin only when at least one list element is squared. So in effect the mapping process would have to start first. The parallel computation of squares will result in a non-deterministic sequence of computations. In particular it is not guaranteed that all elements of the input list are processed in the original list order. So it might for example …</p></div></div>

  <em>a 21 minute read (and <a href="https://github.com/bogo/arm64-to-sim">sources</a>) by <a href="https://twitter.com/giertler">Bogo Giertler</a></em>

  <p><img src="https://bogo.wtf/assets/images//Full%20Screenshot.png" alt="M1 Simulator + ARM64"></p>

<p>The screenshot above looks perfectly normal - until you realize that the sample app running on this M1 MacBook is actually a legacy Spotify SDK demo from 2017. Its proprietary binary framework has never been rebuilt to support M1 Macs and cannot run on Apple’s newest computers, unless Xcode is launched through <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment">Rosetta 2</a>.</p>

<p>If you have an M1 Mac, you probably already encountered this issue. A couple of seconds after hitting Run on your favorite project (and going <em>wow, those M1 Macs sure are fast!</em>), you were likely greeted with this:</p>

<p><img src="https://bogo.wtf/assets/images//Xcode%20Linker%20Error.png" alt="Xcode Linker Error"></p>

<div><div><pre><code>ld: in ../../SpotifyiOS.framework/SpotifyiOS(MPMessagePackReader.o), building for iOS Simulator, but linking in object file built for iOS, file '../../SpotifyiOS.framework/SpotifyiOS' for architecture arm64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In plain English, the proprietary binary framework you’ve been using in your project has not been updated to support iOS Simulator running on M1 Macs. Apple’s advice in this situation is to reach out to the vendor and ask them to release an updated version of the framework - both by migrating it to an XCFramework format, and by rebuilding it to support M1 simulators.</p>

<p>There is a lot of reasons why you might not get your hands on that updated framework anytime soon - or even at all. Commonly, the third-party vendor is slow to react, or you are pinning to a previous major version of the framework for compatibility reasons. Since you likely do not have sources for the original library, you cannot rebuild it yourself either. This means no Simulator builds and no local unit and UI tests. You seemingly hit a dead end and development on an M1 Mac will be very difficult for time being. Or did you?</p>

<p>Last week, I ran into this issue with <a href="https://github.com/spotify/ios-sdk">Spotify’s iOS SDK</a>. With the binary release not updated for over a year, I had to find a way to hack the native ARM64 binary to run in the Simulator. On the way, I learnt a lot about frameworks, binaries, and loaders.  You can find the complete sources for <a href="https://github.com/bogo/arm64-to-sim">arm64-to-sim</a> on GitHub. What follows is a detailed explanation of the ARM64 transmogrification.</p>

<h2 id="-an-idea-takes-root">💡 An Idea Takes Root</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at the error message again. The error we receive isn’t actually a compiler error - it’s a linker error. <code>ld</code> complains that we are attempting to link in a binary that was compiled for <em>native</em> ARM64 to a binary that is being built for <em>iOS Simulator</em> ARM64.</p>

<p>Historically, the ARM/x86 bifurcation in the Apple product line meant that one could safely assume that code built for <code>i386</code> and <code>x86_64</code> was meant for the Simulator, and code built for <code>armv7</code> and <code>arm64</code> was meant for native devices. This found reflection in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_binary">fat (universal) binaries</a> being a widely used hack for distributing frameworks for Apple platforms that could be used both for devices and simulators.</p>

<p>With the release of M1 Macs, this assumption no longer holds true - an ARM64 slice can now be meant for either. Under the guise of supporting macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS in a single framework, in 2019 Apple released a new bundle framework format, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/416/">XCFramework</a>.</p>

<p>This should give us an idea: since, as indicated by the <code>ld</code> error, we already have a native ARM64 slice in our library, maybe we can repackage it as an iOS Simulator-supporting XCFramework. There is no technical reason why it <em>shouldn’t</em> work - a compiled binary links against symbols of other frameworks and binaries. Since iOS devices and M1 Macs use the same ARM64 instruction set, if the symbols of native and Simulator libraries are sufficiently similar, the library should simply work. We will just need to apply a lot of elbow grease.</p>

<h2 id="-the-anatomy-of-a-xcframework">🫀 The Anatomy of a (XC)Framework</h2>
<p>XCFramework is a pretty straightforward format that is meant to be a drop-in replacement for the original Cocoa Frameworks. Essentially, each XCFramework is a directory containing a property list telling the linker where to find architecture- and plaform-specific copies of each framework.</p>

<p>An example XCFramework looks as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Example.xcframework/
|-- Info.plist
|-- ios-arm64/
|   +-- Example.framework/
+-- ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator/
    +-- Example.framework/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The actual mapping of individual frameworks to platforms is done in the <code>Info.plist</code> file. Notice the <code>SupportedArchitectures</code>, <code>SupportedPlatform</code>, and <code>SupportedPlatformVariant</code> properties.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;plist</span> <span>version=</span><span>"1.0"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;dict&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>AvailableLibraries<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;array&gt;</span>
		<span>&lt;dict&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>LibraryIdentifier<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>ios-arm64<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>LibraryPath<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>Example.framework<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>SupportedArchitectures<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;array&gt;</span>
				<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>arm64<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;/array&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>SupportedPlatform<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>ios<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
		<span>&lt;/dict&gt;</span>
		<span>&lt;dict&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>LibraryIdentifier<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>LibraryPath<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>Example.framework<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>SupportedArchitectures<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;array&gt;</span>
				<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>arm64<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
				<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>x86_64<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;/array&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>SupportedPlatform<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>ios<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>SupportedPlatformVariant<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>simulator<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
		<span>&lt;/dict&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;/array&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>CFBundlePackageType<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>XFWK<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>XCFrameworkFormatVersion<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>1.0<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/dict&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/plist&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After creating a relevant folder structure and dropping in an <code>Info.plist</code> alongside our legacy <code>.framework</code>, we should now have a real <code>.xcframework</code> on our hands. Let’s emplace the original <code>.framework</code> in Xcode with it and try to build. Of course, it would be too easy if it worked - instead, we get the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://bogo.wtf/assets/images//Xcode%20Linker%20Error%20with%20XCFramework.png" alt="Xcode Linker Error - with XCFramework"></p>

<div><div><pre><code>ld: in /Users/bogo/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/NowPlayingView-aeukgqexpeqlsrdzslkpeehveixs/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/SpotifyiOS.framework/SpotifyiOS(MPMessagePackReader.o), building for iOS Simulator, but linking in object file built for iOS, file '/Users/bogo/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/NowPlayingView-aeukgqexpeqlsrdzslkpeehveixs/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/SpotifyiOS.framework/SpotifyiOS' for architecture arm64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since the Cocoa Framework is coming from <code>DerivedData</code>, we can be sure we assembled our XCFramework correctly. Still, we are back to square one - despite our naïve wrapping, the linker can still tell that we are bringing in a native library. Here’s our new objective: to find a way to convince <code>ld</code> that the library is actually a Simulator library.</p>

<h2 id="️-into-the-binary">🕵️ Into the Binary</h2>

<p>Let’s take a look inside our framework and see what files could be informing it about the platform.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Example.framework/
|-- Info.plist
|-- Example
|-- Headers/
|   |-- A.h
|   |-- B.h
|   +-- C.h
+-- Modules/
    +-- module.modulemap
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Cursory browsing of the human-readable contents of the framework does not yield any hints, so the linker must be using the contents of the binary file itself to infer the Simulator information. Since, we don’t really know what to look for, let’s dig into the binaries of other XCFrameworks out there first.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/master/Package.swift#L244">FirebaseAnalytics.xcframework</a> is a particularly good XCFramework to investigate - it contains both native and Simulator binaries. The obvious first idea is to search for Simulator references in the human-readable strings of the binary:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># in the FirebaseAnalytics.xcframework directory</span>
<span>$ </span>strings ios-arm64_i386_x86_64-simulator/FirebaseAnalytics.framework/FirebaseAnalytics | <span>grep</span> <span>-i</span> sim
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The result is a bunch of rather uninteresting strings, none of them mentioning the Simulator. We can make an educated guess that the Simulator information is thus encoded in the machine-readable segment of the binary. To extract it, we can use <code>otool</code> - a tool meant to explore the executable files produced by LLVM. The <code>-fahl</code> parameter prints the relevant  fat, archive, and Mach-O headers, as well as the load commands.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># in the FirebaseAnalytics.xcframework directory</span>
<span>$ </span>otool <span>-fahl</span> ios-arm64_i386_x86_64-simulator/FirebaseAnalytics.framework/FirebaseAnalytics
<span>(</span>...<span>)</span>
Load <span>command </span>2
      cmd LC_LINKER_OPTIMIZATION_HINT
  cmdsize 16
  dataoff 12464
 datasize 760
Load <span>command </span>3
     cmd LC_SYMTAB
 cmdsize 24
  symoff 13224
   nsyms 201
  stroff 16440
 strsize 5064
<span>(</span>...<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Whoops, that’s a lot of data! The offsets and addresses and sizes are doing us no good and are likely to be different between platforms. Let’s constrain our search to load commands, save the results, and compare them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># in the FirebaseAnalytics.xcframework directory</span>
<span>$ </span>otool <span>-fahl</span> ios-arm64_i386_x86_64-simulator/FirebaseAnalytics.framework/FirebaseAnalytics | <span>grep</span> <span>-E</span> <span>'cmd |\.o'</span> <span>&gt;</span> simulator_cmds

<span>$ </span>otool <span>-fahl</span> ios-arm64_armv7/FirebaseAnalytics.framework/FirebaseAnalytics | <span>grep</span> <span>-E</span> <span>'cmd |\.o'</span> <span>&gt;</span> native_cmds

<span>$ </span>diff <span>-u</span> native_cmds simulator_cmds
<span>-ios-arm64_armv7</span>/FirebaseAnalytics.framework/FirebaseAnalytics<span>(</span>FirebaseAnalytics_vers.o<span>)</span>:
+ios-arm64_i386_x86_64-simulator/FirebaseAnalytics.framework/FirebaseAnalytics<span>(</span>FirebaseAnalytics_vers.o<span>)</span>:
       cmd LC_SEGMENT_64
-      cmd LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS
+      cmd LC_BUILD_VERSION
      cmd LC_SYMTAB
<span>(</span>...<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alright, we got a match! Seems that the Simulator binary contains  an <code>LC_BUILD_VERSION</code> load command, while the native binary contains an <code>LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS</code> load command in the same place. A pass with <code>otool</code> on our unsupported, native-only <code>.framework</code> confirms this theory. A bit of Googling reveals that <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D85358">this specific difference</a> is used by LLDB to distinguish Simulator and native binaries. We are on the right track then - looks like substituting <code>LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS</code> with <code>LC_BUILD_VERSION</code> might be just enough to fool <code>ld</code>.</p>

<h2 id="-meet-the-librarian">📚 Meet the Librarian</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve been playing with a fat binary, containing multiple platform-specific slices. We can see architectures available in a binary using the <code>file</code> command:</p>

Launched 12 years ago, it was the late 2017 bull run that created a media frenzy that propelled Bitcoin into the mainstream and our modern day lexicon.</p><p>Often labeled as the “original” cryptocurrency, <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> has been the catalyst (directly and/or indirectly) behind many new innovations in the blockchain and digital asset space, most notably <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a>. Shortly after the late 2017 bull run lost its steam, interest in these new technologies started to fade ― but here we are in 2021 with Bitcoin having risen like a phoenix from the ashes. As you would assume, an appetite for the blockchain and digital asset space has returned and now it is more important than ever that we understand what exactly is behind this unique asset, Bitcoin.</p><p>This article is meant to be a guide for individuals who are new to cryptocurrency and want to learn about <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>, specifically its use case and the different ways to become involved in the broader blockchain and digital asset space. My goal is to educate you on the basics and make sure that you walk away with a newfound perspective and understanding of <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>.</p><h2 id="what-is-bitcoin">What is Bitcoin?</h2><p>Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash whose transactions are recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. In late October 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto (whose identity is still unknown) published a white paper titled <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"><em>Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</em></a> on bitcoin.org (registered in August 2008) and subsequently posted it to <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html">a cryptography mailing list</a>. On January 3, 2009, the Bitcoin network was created when Satoshi Nakamoto mined the initial block of the chain, which is called the genesis block.</p><p>In essence, Bitcoin is a decentralized type of “digital money” that can be used by anyone around the world, at any time, and without restrictions or a central authority. Bitcoin is not backed by any bank or government and originally allowed users to freely send and/or spend it anywhere without trusting third parties.</p><p>At inception, the price of Bitcoin was approximately $0.01 and, as of today, the price has surpassed $40,000 per coin ― with many believing that it can grow exponentially higher to levels between $100,000 and $250,000 in the next year or so.</p><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/bitcoin-getting-started/extras_1_blockchain-80.jpg"><figcaption><h4>The transactions data are memorized through a chain-of-blocks</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Given that Bitcoin exists and operates within the confounds of the Internet, all user balances are kept on an immutable and fully transparent blockchain. Put simply, each Bitcoin transaction is broadcasted to the Bitcoin network and grouped with several other transactions in the form of a block, which the network’s miners validate. Once the block is accepted, the transactions get recorded on the blockchain (which, as you may recall, is a public ledger). Whenever this process is successfully completed, the network distributes new Bitcoin to miners for each block that has been validated ― this is referred to as a block reward.</p><p>The peculiarity of the blockchain is its distribution and decentralized properties, as all the nodes share a valid copy of the public ledger. In the Bitcoin network, nodes play a very important role ― think of them as “protectors” who are constantly monitoring Bitcoin’s blockchain to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from illegitimate ones. The basic job of a node is to prevent attempts to double-spend Bitcoins that have already been spent elsewhere. In addition, the process of mining is essential to validating transactions, as it ensures the overall trustworthiness and security of the payment network.</p><h2 id="advantages-and-limitations">Advantages and Limitations</h2><p>Members of the cryptocurrency community, who range from the tech savvy to your average retail investor, have adopted various perspectives regarding the fundamental driver of Bitcoin’s value (both in financial and non-financial terms).</p><p>On one side, there are the Bitcoin Maximalists who believe that Bitcoin is the ultimate financial innovation and will assume a mainstream role in global society ― to maximalists, other cryptocurrencies and traditional financial instruments are inferior. On the other side, you have cryptocurrency enthusiasts who believe Bitcoin’s technology is outdated and that other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, have more expansive utility.</p><p>These arguments and differences of opinion (as it relates to Bitcoin) can often become confusing, so let’s dig deeper into some of the most common discussion points with hopes that you can decipher for yourself.</p><h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3><ul><li>A blockchain is managed autonomously using <strong>a peer-to-peer network</strong> and cannot be shut down ― the only way to stop it is through shutting down or banning Internet access. (Note: Even though a blockchain or Bitcoin cannot be shut down, some jurisdictions have imposed restrictions on citizens that limit or ban the holding or trading of Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies.)</li><li>There is no need to trust a third party. <strong>You are your own bank!</strong></li><li>Relatively quick and cheap transactions without intermediary fees (around 10 minutes on average per transaction), when compared to most leading cryptocurrencies.</li><li>Increasing adoption by merchants and individuals across the globe.</li><li>Largest market capitalization and name recognition, which will continue to promote its growth and (hopefully) price stability.</li></ul><h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3><ul><li><strong>Lack of anonymity</strong> as transactions that take place in the Bitcoin network, along with many other leading cryptocurrencies, are fully transparent and can potentially be linked via chain analysis. In addition, strict AML/KYC regulations require many of the leading cryptocurrency trading exchanges to verify your most sensitive personal information.</li><li>Slow and expensive transactions, when compared to lesser known cryptocurrencies that can be sent within seconds and at a fraction of the cost.</li><li>Irreversible transactions. Once a transaction is sent, you cannot undo or cancel the transaction.</li><li>Achievement of its status as a currency will be challenging due to its volatile nature (i.e. swings in price) and regulations.</li><li>The core technology has some subtle limits that make Bitcoin outdated in comparison with other cryptocurrencies.</li></ul><p>Along with Bitcoin Maximalists and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, you have many individuals who simply like to be long-term holders of Bitcoin (because they believe in the fundamentals and value proposition) and others who speculate on the short-term price (e.g. day traders).</p><p>Whatever side you are on, there is no question that Bitcoin has established itself as a serious contender in the financial world and is here to stay for the time being. There may be other alternatives, but the granddaddy of cryptocurrencies still has the spotlight!</p><h2 id="how-to-obtain-bitcoin-from-an-exchange">How to Obtain Bitcoin from an Exchange</h2><p>Now that you have an understanding of Bitcoin and its utility, you may be interested in purchasing some. If that is the case, you have come to the right place as buying it is now easier than ever due to the growing number of exchanges and companies making Bitcoin accessible to the masses.</p><p>Some of the most well-known exchanges that allow you to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are <a href="https://coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://www.gemini.com/">Gemini</a>, <a href="https://www.kraken.com/">Kraken</a>, <a href="https://binance.com/">Binance</a>, and <a href="https://www.huobi.com/en-us/">Huobi</a>. While all of these exchanges list Bitcoin, not all of them offer the same cryptocurrencies ― so, it is recommended to open accounts across a few exchanges to ensure that you are provided adequate exposure.</p><p>Once you have created an account on an exchange, you can transfer your local fiat money via ACH or bank wire to the exchange. From there, you can purchase Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency in exchange for your local fiat money. In addition, after purchasing Bitcoin, you can exchange it for another cryptocurrency that you might not be able to purchase with your local fiat money. While some exchanges offer credit card purchases of Bitcoin, please keep in mind that the fees associated with this transaction are typically very high.</p><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/bitcoin-getting-started/extras_2_exchange-80.jpg"><figcaption><h4>You can exchange central currencies (EUR, USD) to BTC, but sacrificing privacy.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Using any of the exchanges listed above is the easiest and most convenient way to purchase Bitcoin, as the majority of the other cryptocurrency exchanges do not support fiat currencies. This being the case, you can only exchange other cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum or Monero) for Bitcoin. <a href="https://cash.app/">Cash App</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/crypto">PayPal</a>, some of the largest financial technology companies, offer its users the ability to purchase Bitcoin. While this is extremely convenient for users of these platforms, the downside for PayPal (not Cash App) is that your Bitcoin must remain on its platform, so you cannot transfer or send it. Remember: Not your keys, not your coins.</p><p>If you are not keen on using any of the methods described above, Bitcoin ATMs are a great alternative. There are over 14,000 physical ATMs worldwide, most of which can be found in major cities at peculiar locations such as a shopping mall, burger restaurant, or a bar. All you need to do is deposit cash and enter your Bitcoin address. Once you have completed the transaction, the funds will be sent to you. This is a very simple process and typically does not require any identity verification, but beware of high fees!</p><h2 id="who-accepts-bitcoin">Who Accepts Bitcoin?</h2><p>Over the years, many individuals and businesses have begun accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. From time to time, you might have noticed stickers on a shop’s window that says “Bitcoin accepted here.” As mentioned above, after the bull run of late 2017 died down, overall interest in cryptocurrencies (especially Bitcoin) amongst merchants began to wane. Today, Bitcoin and the broader digital asset space has bounced back from a pricing perspective and, with this, so has the interest amongst merchants who have triggered another wave of increased acceptance, most notably <a href="https://apnews.com/article/financial-markets-elon-musk-bitcoin-061817c6795e75d1c3c9e9d6cfc4a911">Tesla</a> disclosing that it has invested approximately $1.5 billion into Bitcoin and that the company plans to accept Bitcoin as payment for its electric vehicles.</p><p>There have been a few prominent …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="h.l7qn47u1544x"><span>Building web apps without a SPA - A case study</span></p><p><span>We all know that feeling. You’re scrolling through a page that’s full of mostly static content - constantly being interrupted by spinners - and the thought hits you, “Why did they use Javascript for this?”</span></p><p><span>Now this might not always be fair. I’ve done a fair amount of web development and there is definitely a time and a place for a SPA. And rendering libraries like React make client side work an absolute pleasure. But that’s not what I’m going to write about today. I’m going to write about all the </span><span>other</span><span>&nbsp;cases. Or as I like to call it, 73.6% of the internet.</span></p><p><span>My fiance is studying to become a veterinary physiotherapist. She has to learn </span><span>a lot</span><span>&nbsp;of animal body parts. She’s picked up a few books along the way to help her memorise various animal parts that normally look something like this:</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kALs0Nu-AjBdB7ujRxyewUokHCMcT-idZaQ0aqQrhVJUP8x3c1g4Hf3E_3A_DZWW-TOdcig3Y_gl3Z8zzE0uqPyEh0I2fI6Gw1nX_VGNnOMX1ekeUI8nrdKaxeet8SYKkLqsLbeg" title=""></span></p><p><span>Ladies and Gentlemen, the canine</span></p><p><span>I took a look at the content she was studying and thought it would probably be handy if we could put all those pictures into a little quiz app so that she could test herself. After a bit of requirements gathering, it was decided it needed to support:</span></p><ul><li><span>Profiles</span></li><li><span>A group management system to share profiles with others</span></li><li><span>Referencing and tags</span></li><li><span>Some way for her to upload pictures and map body parts</span></li><li><span>Quizzes (of course!)</span></li></ul><p><span>To keep it simple, we added two types of quizzes. The first kind points to a body part and asks you to choose what limb it is. The second kind of quiz names a part and asks you to select it on the picture. All you need to do is first prepare quizzes by uploading images and selecting the limbs.</span></p><p><span>This is what is ends up looking like:</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lLiY8kQz2JfDyeySZgzE6cC24HcQ_0MAw5a8ePJA1y94d5j-gDvv2e5aKOuYW7g0sKqW2qTfxKydlL1n_qCydremS_9GUpD-B9ymUfsXhwqxnjCbDkJD1TOiof5vU2vnxiZuKC_d" title=""></span></p><p><span>And here is what a quiz looks like:</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nlY63N83LNXIJmA9fp530SXydjZIO16NLY1HUP9MVw-nQHQIYbU0RoglAf-QOSYgd3Yzwxz1WjnTCuFNxeAaFbgJxHFafhFQYQwB029O_ht-BbyN8kFKyEn-aYPOlIglV4lTKroJ" title=""></span></p><p><span>Nothing about this is particularly complex. I probably took around a day or so in total to add everything we wanted. I worked fast and loose and skipped automated tests because I don’t plan to work on it further (and most of it is CRUD operations).</span></p><p><span>What I would like to emphasize at this point is that I’ve seen many projects with a similar scope become a React/Angular/Bitcoin app. There are a few reasons I can think of (off the top of my head) for this:</span></p><ol start="1"><li><span>The developer would like to learn a new stack (nothing wrong with this!)</span></li><li><span>The developer uses it out of muscle memory</span></li><li><span>The developer wants to create an app like experience and things this will result in faster performance</span></li></ol><p><span>I have no issue with the first reason. I also don’t have an issue with the second reason when you just want to get something done fast and you’re comfortable with a way of working. What I would like to question however is the third reason.</span></p><p><span>When working on a smaller project, I often find that it is both simpler to reason with, and faster to write everything in the backend. And I don’t just mean faster in terms of development. I think you can make a much faster system overall when you’re not sending a bulky javascript bundle that needs to perform client side rendering.</span></p><p><span>As it turns out, a lot of people think server side rendering is slow simply because of the downloading and parsing browsers need to do with javascript. But there’s a handy little library I absolutely love that alleviates this problem entirely. </span><span><a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a></span><span>&nbsp;(made by the good folks at </span><span><a href="https://basecamp.com/">basecamp</a></span><span>) intercepts the links on your page and replaces them with ajax requests. It then takes care of placing the content back in your page. What this means is that you can entirely work </span><span>as if</span><span>&nbsp;your app is entirely server side, while still leaving it feeling very much like a web app. And the best part is we get to leave the browser to do the rendering work instead of a javascript engine! Browsers are actually pretty good at doing that.</span></p><p><span>Here’s what it ends up looking like in action:</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-blx8YYUJdB1_aOeLIz7VAlPxsVolWFfNOA9uMvo1r41gUFUG-lv-u3wrqx6tRq5BOCRy5oJF4kDsNBh5UjH8hCsC6Bowlcl3umzLrAWlJHJUTyPQRB16VA-EdLMp0Xao_vAVFa4" title=""></span></p><p><span>Disclaimer:</span><span>&nbsp;I haven’t given it a go yet because it’s still in beta but the basecamp team has moved onto </span><span><a href="https://github.com/hotwired/turbo">Turbo</a></span><span>&nbsp;which is supposed to replace Turbolinks.</span></p><p><span>Then just to be extra safe, for the small parts of javascript I do use (for the quiz questions) I use </span><span><a href="https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/">rollup</a></span><span>&nbsp;to bundle it together. This ends up producing a very nice and small javascript bundle because I refused to use any javascript dependencies for the client side code. The bundle clocks in around 3.9kB.</span></p><p><span>What this results in is a very light weight, and easy to develop web app. Obviously there’s not a silver bullet that solves all problems but the next time you’re building a web app, it might be worth taking a step back and asking the question, “Do I really need a javascript frontend framework for this?”</span></p><p><span>As always you can find the code here if you want to take a deeper look:</span></p><p><span><a href="https://gitlab.com/BenWiser/physio-quiz">https://gitlab.com/BenWiser/physio-quiz</a></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>In this post we’ll discuss how Spotify optimized and sped up elements from our largest Dataflow job, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/02/18/spotify-unwrapped-how-we-brought-you-a-decade-of-data/" target="_blank">Wrapped 2019</a>, for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/genre/2020-page">Wrapped 2020</a> using a technique called Sort Merge Bucket (SMB) join. We’ll present the design and implementation of SMB and how we incorporated it into our data pipelines.</p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Shuffle is the core building block for many big data transforms, such as a join, GroupByKey, or other reduce operations. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most expensive steps in many pipelines. Sort Merge Bucket is an optimization that reduces shuffle by doing work up front on the producer side. The intuition is that for datasets commonly and frequently joined on a known key, e.g., user events with user metadata on a user ID, we can write them in bucket files with records bucketed and sorted by that key. By knowing which files contain a subset of keys and in what order, shuffle becomes a matter of merge-sorting values from matching bucket files, completely eliminating costly disk and network I/O of moving key–value pairs around. Andrea Nardelli carried out the original investigation on Sort Merge Buckets for his <a href="http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1334587/FULLTEXT01.pdf">2018 master’s thesis</a>, and we started looking into generalizing the idea as a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://spotify.github.io/scio/extras/Sort-Merge-Bucket.html" target="_blank">Scio module</a> afterwards.</p>



<h2>Design and Implementation</h2>



<p>The majority of the data pipelines at Spotify are written in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/spotify/scio" target="_blank">Scio</a>, a Scala API for <a href="https://beam.apache.org/">Apache Beam</a>, and run on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow">Google Cloud Dataflow</a> service. We implemented SMB in Java to be closer to the native Beam SDK (and even wrote and collaborated on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AQlonN8t4YJrARcWzepyP7mWHTxHAd6WIECwk1s3LQQ/edit?usp=sharing">design document with the Beam community</a>), and provide Scala syntactic sugar in Scio like many other I/Os. The design is modularized into the main components listed below — we’ll start with the two top-level SMB <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#transforms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PTransforms</a> — the write and read operations SortedBucketSink and SortedBucketSource.</p>



<h3>SortedBucketSink</h3>



<p>This transform writes a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#pcollections" target="_blank">PCollection</a>&lt;T&gt; (where T has a corresponding <a href="https://github.com/spotify/scio/blob/master/scio-smb/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/smb/FileOperations.java" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FileOperations&lt;T&gt;</a> instance) in SMB format. It first extracts keys and assigns bucket IDs using logic provided by <a href="https://github.com/spotify/scio/blob/master/scio-smb/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/smb/BucketMetadata.java" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BucketMetadata</a>, groups key–values by the ID, sorts all values, and then writes them into files corresponding to bucket IDs using the FileOperations instance.</p>



<p>In addition to the bucket files, a JSON file is also written to the output directory representing the information from BucketMetadata that’s necessary to read the source: the number of buckets, the hashing scheme, and the instructions to extract the key from each record (for example, for Avro records we can encode this instruction with the name of the GenericRecord field containing the key).</p>

<h3>SortedBucketSource</h3>



<p>This transform reads from one or more sources written in SMB format with the same key and hashing scheme. It opens file handles for corresponding buckets from each source (using FileOperations&lt;T&gt; for that input type) and merges them while maintaining sorted order. Results are emitted as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/join/CoGbkResult.java" target="_blank">CoGbkResult</a> objects per key group, the same class Beam uses for regular Cogroup operations, so the user can extract the results per source with the correct parameterized type.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="365" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image7-700x365.png" alt="" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image7-700x365.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image7-250x130.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image7-768x400.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image7-120x63.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image7.png 1067w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></figure>



<h3>FileOperations</h3>



<p>FileOperations abstracts away the reading and writing of individual bucket files. Since we need fine-grained control over the exact elements and their order in every file, we cannot leverage the existing Beam file I/Os, which operate on a PCollection level and abstract away the locality and order of elements. Instead, SMB file operations happen at a lower level of BoundedSource for input and ParDo for output. Currently Avro, BigQuery TableRow JSON, and TensorFlow TFRecord/Example records are supported. We plan to add other formats like Parquet as well.</p>



<h3>BucketMetadata</h3>



<p>This class abstracts the keying and bucketing of elements, and includes information such as key field, class, number of buckets, shards, and hash function. The metadata is serialized as a JSON file alongside data files when writing, and used to check compatibility when reading SMB sources.</p>



<h3>Optimizations and Variants</h3>



<p>Over the last year and a half we’ve been adopting SMB at Spotify for various use cases, and accumulated many improvements to handle the scale and complexity of our data pipelines.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Date partitioning:</strong> At Spotify, event data is written to Google Cloud Services (GCS) in hourly or daily partitions. A common data engineering use case is to read many partitions in a single pipeline — for example, to compute stream count over the last seven days. For a non-SMB read, this can be easily done in a single PTransform using wildcard file patterns to match files across multiple directories. However, unlike most File I/Os in Beam, the SMB Read API requires the input to be specified as a directory, rather than a file pattern (this is because we need to check the directory’s metadata.json file as well as the actual record files). Additionally, it must match up bucket files across partitions as well as across different sources, while ensuring that the CoGbkResult output correctly groups data from all partitions of a source into the same TupleTag key. We evolved the SMB Read API to accept one or more directories <em>per source</em>.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Sharding:</strong> Although the Murmur class of hash functions we use during bucket assignment usually ensures an even distribution of records across buckets, in some instances one or more buckets may be disproportionately large if the key space is skewed, creating possible OOM errors when grouping and sorting records. In this case, we allow users to specify a number of <em>shards</em> to further split each bucket file. During the bucket assignment step, a value between [0, numShards) is generated randomly <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runtime/model/#bundling-and-persistence"><em>per bundle</em></a>. Since this value is computed completely orthogonally to the bucket ID, it can break up large key groups across files. Since each shard is still written in sorted order, they can simply be merged together at read time.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Parallelism:</strong> Since the number of buckets in an SMB sink is always a power of 2, we can come up with a joining scheme across sources with different numbers of buckets based off of a desired level of parallelism specified by the user. For example, if the user wants to join Source 1 with 4 buckets and Source 2 with 2 buckets, they can specify either:<ul><li><strong>Minimum parallelism,</strong> or “Merge Greatest Buckets” strategy: 2 parallel readers will be created. Each reader will read 2 buckets from source A and 1 from source B, merging them together. Because bucket IDs are assigned by taking the integer hash value of the key modulo the desired number of buckets, mathematically we know that the key spaces of the merged buckets overlap.</li><li><strong>Maximum parallelism,</strong> or “Least Bucket Replication” strategy: 4 parallel readers will be created. Each reader will read 1 bucket from Source A and 1 from Source B. After merging each key group, the reader will have to rehash the key modulo the greatest number of buckets, to avoid emitting duplicate values. Therefore, even though this strategy achieves a higher level of parallelism, there is some overhead of computing duplicate values and rehashing to eliminate them.</li><li><strong>Auto parallelism:</strong> Creates a number of readers between minimal and maximal amounts, based on a desired split size value provided by the Runner at runtime.</li></ul></li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="459" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-700x459.png" alt="" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-700x459.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-250x164.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-768x504.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-120x79.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3.png 1115w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></figure>



<ul><li><strong>SortedBucketTransform:</strong> A common usage pattern is for pipelines to enrich an existing dataset by joining it with one or more other sources, then writing it to an output location. We decided to specifically support this in SMB with a unique PTransform that reads, transforms, and writes output using the same keying and bucketing scheme. By doing the read/transform/write logic per bucket on the same worker, we can avoid having to reshuffle the data and recompute buckets — since the key is the same, we know that the transformed elements from bucket M of the inputs also correspond to bucket M in the output, in the same sorted order as they were read from.</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>External Sort:</strong> We made a number of improvements to Beam’s <a href="https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/sdks/java/extensions/sorter">external sorter extension</a>, including replacing the Hadoop sequence file with the native file I/O, removing the 2GB memory limit, and reducing disk usage and coder overhead.</li></ul>



<h2>Adoption — Core Data Producers</h2>



<p>Since SMB requires data to be bucketed and sorted in a specific fashion, the adoption naturally starts from the producer of that data. A majority of the Spotify data processing relies on a few core data sets that act as single sources of truth for various business domains like streaming activities, user metadata and streaming context. We worked with the maintainer of these data sets to convert a year’s worth of data to SMB format.</p>



<p>Implementation was straightforward since SortedBucketSink is mostly a drop-in replacement for the vanilla Avro sink with some extra settings. We were using Avro sink with the sharding option to control the number and size of output files. After migrating to SMB, we did not notice any major bump in terms of vCPU, vRAM, or wall time since sharding requires a full shuffle similar to the additional cost of SMB sinks. A few other settings we have since had to tweak:</p>



<ul><li>Agree on user_id as a hexadecimal string as bucket and sort key, since we need the same key type and semantic across all SMB datasets.</li><li>Set compression to DEFLATE with level 6 to be consistent with the default Avro sink in Scio. As a nice side effect of data being bucketed and sorted by key, we observed ~50% reduction in storage from better compression due to collocation of similar records.</li><li>Make sure output files are backwards compatible. SMB output files have “bucket-X-shard-Y” in their names but otherwise contain the same records with the same schema. So existing pipelines can consume them without any code change; they just do not leverage the speedup in certain join cases.</li></ul>

  <p><span>09 Feb 2021</span></p><p>Anyone who ever tried to cross-compile a C/C++ program knows how big a PITA the whole process could be. The main reasons for this sorry state of things are generally how byzantine build systems tend to be when configuring for cross-compilation, and how messy it is to set-up your cross toolchain in the first place.</p>

<p>One of the main culprits in my experience has been the GNU toolchain, the decades-old behemoth upon which the POSIXish world has been built for years.
Like many compilers of yore, GCC and its <code>binutils</code> brethren were never designed with the intent to support multiple targets within a single setup, with he only supported approach being installing a full cross build for each triple you wish to target on any given host.</p>

<p>For instance, assuming you wish to build something for FreeBSD on your Linux machine using GCC, you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A GCC + binutils install for your host triplet (i.e., <code>x86_64-pc-linux-gnu</code> or similar);</li>
  <li>A GCC + binutils complete install for your target triplet (i.e. <code>x86_64-unknown-freebsd12.2-gcc</code>, <code>as</code>, <code>nm</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>A sysroot containing the necessary libraries and headers, which you can either build yourself or promptly steal from a running installation of FreeBSD.</li>
</ul>

<p>This process is sometimes made simpler by Linux distributions or hardware vendors offering a selection of prepackaged compilers, but this will never suffice due to the sheer amount of possible host-target combinations. This sometimes means you have to build the whole toolchain yourself, something that, unless you rock a quite beefy CPU, tends to be a massive waste of time and power.</p>

<h2 id="clang-as-a-cross-compiler">Clang as a cross compiler</h2>

<p>This annoying limitation is one of the reasons why I got interested in LLVM (and thus Clang), which is by-design a full-fledged cross compiler toolchain and is mostly compatible with GNU. A single install can output and compile code <em>for every supported target</em>, as long as a complete sysroot is available at build time.</p>

<p>I found this to be a game-changer, and, while it can’t still compete in convenience with modern language toolchains (such as Go’s gc and <code>GOARCH</code>/<code>GOOS</code>), it’s night and day better than the rigmarole of setting up GNU toolchains. You can now just fetch whatever your favorite package management system has available in its repositories (as long as it’s not extremely old), and avoid messing around with multiple installs of GCC.</p>

<p>Until a few years ago, the whole process wasn’t as smooth as it could be. Due to LLVM not having a full toolchain yet available, you were still supposed to provide a <code>binutils</code> build specific for your target. While this is generally much more tolerable than building the whole compiler (<code>binutils</code> is relatively fast to build), it was still somewhat of a nuisance, and I’m glad that <code>llvm-mc</code> (LLVM’s integrated assembler) and <code>lld</code> (universal linker) are finally stable and as flexible as the rest of LLVM.</p>

<p>With the toolchain now set, the next step becomes to obtain a sysroot in order to provide the needed headers and libraries to compile and link for your target.</p>

<h2 id="obtaining-a-sysroot">Obtaining a sysroot</h2>
<p>A super fast way to find a working system directory for a given OS is to rip it straight out of an existing system (a Docker container image will often also do).
For instance, this is how I used <code>tar</code> through <code>ssh</code> as a quick way to extract a working sysroot from a FreeBSD 13-CURRENT AArch64 VM <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ mkdir ~/farm_tree
$ ssh FARM64 'tar cf - /lib /usr/include /usr/lib /usr/local/lib /usr/local/include' | bsdtar xvf - -C $HOME/farm_tree/
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="invoking-the-cross-compiler">Invoking the cross compiler</h2>

<p>With everything set, it’s now only a matter of invoking Clang with the right arguments:</p>

<p>In the snipped above, I have managed to compile and link a C++ file into an executable for AArch64 FreeBSD, all while using just the <code>clang</code> and <code>lld</code> I had already installed on my GNU/Linux system.</p>

<p>More in detail:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>--target</code> switches the LLVM default target (<code>x86_64-pc-linux-gnu</code>) to <code>aarch64-pc-freebsd</code>, thus enabling cross-compilation.</li>
  <li><code>--sysroot</code> forces Clang to assume the specified path as root when searching headers and libraries, instead of the usual paths. Note that sometimes this setting might not be enough, especially if the target uses GCC and Clang somehow fails to detect its install path. This can be easily fixed by specifying <code>--gcc-toolchain</code>, which clarifies where to search for GCC installations.</li>
  <li><code>-fuse-ld=lld</code> tells Clang to use <code>lld</code> instead whatever default the platform uses. As I will explain below, it’s highly unlikely that the system linker understands foreign targets, while LLD can natively support <em>almost</em> every binary format and OS <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</li>
  <li><code>-stdlib=libc++</code> is needed here due to Clang failing to detect that FreeBSD on AArch64 uses LLVM’s <code>libc++</code> instead of GCC’s <code>libstdc++</code>.</li>
  <li><code>-lz</code> is also specified to show how Clang can also resolve other libraries inside the sysroot without issues, in this case, <code>zlib</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The final test is now to copy the binary to our target system (i.e. the VM we ripped the sysroot from before) and check if it works as expected:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>rsync zpipe FARM64:<span>"~"</span>
<span>$ </span>ssh FARM64
FreeBSD-ARM64-VM <span>$ </span><span>chmod</span> +x zpipe

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Success! It’s now possible to use this cross toolchain to build larger programs, and below I’ll give a quick example to how to use it to build real projects.</p>

<h3 id="optional-creating-an-llvm-toolchain-directory">Optional: creating an LLVM toolchain directory</h3>

<p>LLVM provides a mostly compatible counterpart for almost every tool shipped by <code>binutils</code> (with the notable exception of <code>as</code> <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>), prefixed with <code>llvm-</code>.</p>

<p>The most critical of these is LLD, which is a drop in replacement for a plaform’s system linker, capable to replace both GNU <code>ld.bfd</code> and <code>gold</code> on GNU/Linux or BSD, and Microsoft’s <code>LINK.EXE</code> when targeting MSVC. It supports linking on (almost) every platform supported by LLVM, thus removing the nuisance to have multiple specific linkers installed.</p>

<p>Both GCC and Clang support using <code>ld.lld</code> instead of the system linker (which may well be <code>lld</code>, like on FreeBSD) via the command line switch <code>-fuse-ld=lld</code>.</p>

<p>In my experience, I found that Clang’s driver might get confused when picking the right linker on some uncommon platforms, especially before version 11.0.
For some reason, <code>clang</code> sometimes decided to outright ignore the <code>-fuse-ld=lld</code> switch and picked the system linker (<code>ld.bfd</code> in my case), which does not support AArch64.</p>

<p>A fast solution to this is to create a toolchain directory containing symlinks that rename the LLVM utilities to the standard <code>binutils</code> programs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> <span>ls</span> <span>-la</span> ~/.llvm/bin/
Permissions Size User  Group Date Modified Name
lrwxrwxrwx    16 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  ar -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-ar
lrwxrwxrwx    12 marco marco  6 Aug  2020  ld -&gt; /usr/bin/lld
lrwxrwxrwx    21 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  objcopy -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-objcopy
lrwxrwxrwx    21 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  objdump -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-objdump
lrwxrwxrwx    20 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  ranlib -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-ranlib
lrwxrwxrwx    21 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  strings -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-strings
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>-B</code> switch can then be used to force Clang (or GCC) to search the required tools in this directory, stopping the issue from ever occurring:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> clang++ <span>-B</span><span>$HOME</span>/.llvm/bin <span>-stdlib</span><span>=</span>libc++ <span>--target</span><span>=</span>aarch64-pc-freebsd <span>--sysroot</span><span>=</span><span>$HOME</span>/farm_tree <span>-std</span><span>=</span>c++17 <span>-o</span> mvd-farm64 mvd.cc

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the past month, two things happened to me that made me realize how glad I'm for using a password manager, namely <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>.</p>
<p>First thing is about a login page. I was searching for a Github repo on DuckDuckGo, and I clicked on a link in the search results. As I was about to fill in the password with a 1Password shortcut, I noticed that 1Password wasn't filling in the login details. How strange, I thought. Puzzled, I looked at the url. And then I saw it—I almost fell for a phishing attack! The url was <a href="https://marcel.is/1password/github.com.cnpmjs.org">github.com.cnpmjs.org</a> instead of <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. I knew of phishing attacks, and thought I'd never fell for such a simple trick. Yet, I almost did.</p>
<p>Second thing is about email. As I'm migrating away from gmail, I thought I would check out the spam folder. I usually don't do that, but I thought I'd peek in. One email caught my eye: the email subject was my password. The site must have been compromised and the attacker got hold of my email and password. Fortunately, the damage radius was minimal, as I have generated unique passwords for each site.</p>

My approach to tackle some of those challenges was to solve them using Javascript (I use it in my day to day) first and then port the code to Rust.

    }

</code></pre></div><blockquote><p>Going back at the code, this binary search is done twice per iteration now multiply this by <code>50K</code> and we found the reason for the slow down.</p></blockquote><p>After some googling I found that I should use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/str/mod.rs.html#4006">eq_ignore_ascii_case</a> instead, which basically makes this operation in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.37.0/src/core/slice/mod.rs.html#2487">linear time</a> and for one character is nearly the same as saying constant time. I recompiled the code and run the benchmarks:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="xml">Node.JS

</code></pre></div><p>Now we are talking, profiling has pay its dividends and made the Rust program <code>2.5x</code> <em>faster</em> than the original and <code>91ms</code> faster than the Javascript version, I can start celebrating and telling my friends that I’m a Rust expert now. But this leaves me with some questions:</p><blockquote><p>The <code>91ms</code> is not bad, but I wonder how much effort it will take to optimize this code to make it <code>&gt;1.5x</code> faster than the Javascript counterpart?</p></blockquote><h2 id="performance-on-macos">Performance On MacOS</h2><p>While I was thinking of this and was in the middle of unpacking my Rust stickers and preparing my laptop for some re-branding, I decided to move the code (Javascript and Rust) from my Linux VM to my main OS (<strong>MacOS Catalina</strong>), once there I gave the benchmark another try because I <em>love</em> suffering:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">Node   0.17s user 0.03s system 101% cpu 0.209 total
Rust   0.23s user 0.01s system 98% cpu 0.238 total
</code></pre></div><p>After seeing this my confidence in my time measuring tool (<code>time</code>) started to fade a bit, but once I calm down and use the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AnalysisTools/Conceptual/instruments_help-collection/Chapter/Chapter.html">XCode Instrumentation</a> which point me in the right direction:</p><p><img src="https://github.com/cesarvr/hugo-blog/blob/master/static/rust/malloc-xcode-2.png?raw=true" alt=""></p><blockquote><p>The slowest part of the program (Rust version) is the part that does the allocation and deallocation of memory produced when calling MacOS <code>malloc</code>.</p></blockquote><p>To catch this one I'll need to dig more into Rust inner workings. Does this make it more expensive to get performance out of Rust? Did I choose the wrong abstractions? That's for another post.

<p><b>Summary: </b>While understanding the implementation of various security and privacy measures in telegram, I identified that telegram fails again in terms of handling the users data. My initial study started with understanding how self-destructing messages work in the secret chats option, telegram says that "<i>The clock starts ticking the moment the message is displayed on the recipient's screen (gets two check marks). As soon as the time runs out, the message disappears from both devices.</i>"&nbsp; <br></p><div><p>Telegram which has <span>500 million active users suffers from</span> a logical bug exists in telegram for macOS (7.3 (211334) Stable) which stores the local copy of received message (audio/video) on a custom path even after those messages are deleted/disappeared from the secret chat.</p></div>

  In my case the path was (<span><span>/var/folders/x7/khjtxvbn0lzgjyy9xzc18z100000gn/T/</span></span>). While performing the same task under secret chat option the

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>React revolutionized front end development as most people knew it when it was first released. This new approach to writing code triggered incredible innovation in how to handle state changes and UI updates.</p><p>This revolution had its downsides, too. One of them was a culture of over-engineering solutions to challenges that could be solved in simpler ways. A typical example of this is how state has been managed in React applications.</p><p>Redux has become a hallmark of many React applications created in the last couple of years. The allure of having a single state object, available everywhere in your application sure sounds nice. But has its time passed? Has React evolved to a point where these kinds of state management tools add more complexity than they solve?</p><p>This article aims to give you a deeper understanding of which situations warrants state management tools like Redux. We’ll discuss the reasons behind the rise of Redux, and what has changed in the last couple of years - both in React and in Redux. Finally, we’ll look into what might be coming in the future.</p><h2 id="redux---and-why-people-started-using-it">Redux - and why people started using it</h2><p>When it was first released , React didn’t have an officially supported way to pass data far down the component tree. If you had some kind of shared state, configuration or other information you would like to use anywhere in you application, you had to pass it down from parent to child to sibling to another child. There <em>was</em> a way to avoid it, but that way - the “legacy context API” was never officially supported, and was documented with a warning that it should not be used.</p><p>About the same time React was released to the public, some other Facebook engineers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS188xDYE-u1ShQmFFGbrk0v&amp;v=nYkdrAPrdcw&amp;feature=emb_title" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">introduced a blueprint</a> for how they created front end applications - the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Flux architecture</a>. It complimented React’s component-centric design by having a unidirectional data flow, which made things both easy to follow and simple to understand.</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/176421ef1740882c46b0283385b27764/ff5cf/d97c68cc0c034806aa6ff882a5f51995.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/176421ef1740882c46b0283385b27764/ff5cf/d97c68cc0c034806aa6ff882a5f51995.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" alt="Flux Architecture">
<em>(photo borrowed from <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview</a>)</em></p><p>While many famous open sourcerers were busy fighting over which slightly different implementation of this was the best, a young Russian developer named Dan Abramov introduced an implementation based on the <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Elm architecture</a>, called Redux.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/xsSnOQynTHs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://youtu.be/xsSnOQynTHs</a></p><p>Redux was a pretty simple system, with a single state object, encased in a “store”, which could be updated by dispatching actions on it. The actions were sent to a “reducer” function, which returned a brand new copy of the entire application state, which would then propagate across your application.</p><p>Another great feature of Redux was how easy it was to use with React. Not only was it a great match with the programming model of React, it also solved the prop drilling issue! Just “connect” whatever component you want to a store, and you had access to any part of the application state you wanted. It was like magic!</p><h2 id="context-hooks-and-why-it-solved-much-of-what-redux-did">Context, hooks, and why it solved much of what Redux did</h2><p>With all its elegance and popularity though, Redux did have a few major downsides. For each new way of changing the state, you had to add a new action type and action creator, probably a dispatcher and a selector, and then you’d have to handle that new state change in an existing reducer, or create a new one. In other words - lots and lots of boilerplate.</p><p>When the 16.3 version of React was released, it finally shipped with a fully redesigned context API. With this new feature, prop drilling was suddenly as easy as wrapping any subsection of your application in a context provider, and fetching it again with a context consumer component.

Hooks made using state and side effects much easier, and made away with the need for class components altogether.

The elegance of reducers were suddenly built into React itself, and prop-drilling was a solved challenge. New projects were started without having Redux in the stack - a previous no-brainer - and more and more projects started to consider moving away from Redux altogether.</p><p>As a response, the team currently maintaining Redux (led by a gentleman named Mark Eriksson) started two different efforts. They introduced an opinionated toolkit named <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Redux Toolkit</a> that did away with most boilerplate code through conventions, and they added a <a href="https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">hooks-based API</a> for reading state and dispatching actions.</p><p>Together these two new updates simplified Redux codebases substantially. But is it really enough to defend introducing the added complexity of the concepts in Redux to a new project? Is the value Redux adds more than the added cost of teaching new employees about Yet Another Tool?</p><p>Let’s look at where React does a great job by itself, and in what cases the tradeoff of complexity vs power is worth it.</p><h2 id="when-react-is-enough">When React is enough</h2><p>Most React applications I’ve worked with have been pretty small in scope. They’ve had a few global pieces of state that was used across the application, and some data that was shared across a few different views.</p><p>Besides from this though, many React applications don’t have a lot of shared state. Most state  like the content of input fields or whether a modal is open, is only interesting to the component that contains them! No need to make that state globally available. </p><p>Other pieces of state might be shared, but only by a part of the application. Perhaps a particular page requires a piece of state to be shared across several of its components, or a sidebar needs to expose some remote status to all of its children. Either way, that’s not global state - it’s state scoped to a part of the application.</p><p>By keeping state co-located, or as close to its dependents as possible, you ensure that it’s deleted whenever the feature requiring it is deleted, and that it’s discoverable without leafing through tens of different reducers.</p><p>If you need to share app-wide settings that rarely change, React’s context API is a great tool to reach for. One example of this is what locale is currently active:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>LocaleContext</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>createContext</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  locale</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"en-US"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  </span><span>setLocale</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>LocaleProvider</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>locale</span><span>,</span><span> setLocale</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>"en-US"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>LocaleContext</span><span>.</span><span>Provider</span><span> value</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>{</span><span> locale</span><span>,</span><span> setLocale </span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>...</span><span>props</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>useLocale</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useContext</span><span>(</span><span>LocaleContext</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>Other use cases can be what color theme is active, or even what experiments are active for a given user.</p><p>Another very useful approach is using a small data-fetching library like <a href="https://swr.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SWR</a> or <a href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">React-Query</a> to handle fetching and caching your API responses for you. To me, cached data isn’t really global state - it’s just cached data. This is much simpler to handle with these small single-use libraries, than introducing async thunks or sagas to your Redux rig. Also, you don’t have to handle all the complex variations of isLoading, hasError and what not. With these libraries, it works out of the box.</p><p>A thing these context use cases have in common is the fact that they represent data that rarely updates. Rarely in the context of computer science is a bit vague, but in my mind, less than a couple of times every second is pretty rare. And as it turns out, that’s the way the React Context API works best!</p><p>The use cases summarized above covers most of the situations I’ve met in real world applications. Actual global state is rare and far between, and is often better off being co-located with the code that actually uses it, or provided through the context API.</p><h2 id="situations-where-redux-might-be-warranted">Situations where Redux might be warranted</h2><p>With all that said, Redux is still a great product. It’s well documented, adopted by many, and can be combined with the approaches posted above. But what use cases warrants the added complexity and learning curve of adding Redux to your stack in 2021?</p><p>One of the use cases I see most in the projects I’m involved with is when you have advanced data fetching scenarios that requires a lot of cascading network communication. One might argue that this is best done on the server side, but there are definitely use cases where handing this on the client is warranted. Redux, particularly in combination with so-called thunks, is extremely versatile and flexible when it comes to such orchestration.</p><p>Another use case is for very interdependent states, or states that are derived from several other states. This is possible to handle in React as well, but the end result is still much easier to both share, reuse and reason about in Redux.</p><p>A third use case is for those where the state of your application can change very rapidly.

<div>

<p><strong>Update 1:58 AM PT:</strong> <em>Updated the post to clear confusion about how Google’s Safe Browsing feature works.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Apple’s privacy push is much more widespread than it seems at the surface. A perfect example is the new privacy feature in <a href="https://the8-bit.com/ios-14-5-changes/">iOS 14.5 Beta 1 (V2)</a> which redirects Google Safe Browsing traffic through Apple’s own proxy servers to enhance users’ privacy and to not let Google see your IP address. </p>
<p>Google Safe Browsing is a security service created by Google that checks whether a website is malicious. When you access a website on the desktop version of Chrome on your Mac or PC, for instance, Google Safe Browsing checks if a website is safe to browse and displays a warning accordingly. The user ultimately has the choice, however.</p>
<p>As Reddit user u/jaydenkieran explains, Apple uses Google Safe Browsing when you enable “Fraudulent Website Warning” within the Safari settings in the Settings app on iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p><a aria-label="According to Google (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.google.com/transparencyreport/answer/7380435?hl=en#zippy=%2Chow-do-you-determine-that-a-site-is-unsafe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Google</a>, its Safe Browsing system works by scanning sections of Google’s web index and “identifying potentially compromised websites.” Then, Google tests those websites by using a virtual machine to check if the website compromises the system. If it does, it’s added to Google’s online database. Google also identifies phishing websites by using statistical models. </p>
<p><a aria-label="According to Apple (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.apple.com/en-ae/HT210675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Apple</a>, before visiting a website, Safari may send hashed prefixes of the URL (Apple terms it “information calculated from the website address”) to Google Safe Browsing to check if there’s a match. </p>
<p>Since Apple uses a hashed prefix, Google cannot learn which website the user is trying to visit. Up until iOS 14.5, Google could also see the IP address of where that request is coming from. However, since Apple now proxies Google Safe Browsing traffic, it further safeguards users’ privacy while browsing using Safari.</p>
<p>Apple has been intensifying its push for privacy with iOS 14 what with the <a href="https://the8-bit.com/app-tracking-transparency-guide/">App Tracking Transparency update and the inclusion of App Privacy Reports in the App Store</a>. </p><div><p>See also</p><div id="block-wrap-39225" data-id="39225" data-base="0"><div><div><div><article><div><p><a href="https://the8-bit.com/siri-now-allows-setting-a-default-music-streaming-service-on-ios-14-5/" title="Siri_Default_Music_App"><img width="100" height="100" src="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-100x100.jpg" alt="Siri Default Music App" srcset="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-100x100.jpg 100w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-80x80.jpg 80w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-293x293.jpg 293w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px"></a></p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div>
<p>At the same time, companies like Facebook are actively opposing the Cupertino giant, accusing it of negatively affecting the advertising industry. Apple’s response has been simple: </p>
<p>“We believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users. Users should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites — and they should have the choice to allow that or not. App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 does not require Facebook to change its approach to tracking users and creating targeted advertising, it simply requires they give users a choice.” </p>
<p>Google itself <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/04/google-still-hasnt-updated-its-ios-apps-while-pondering-android-privacy-controls" target="_blank" aria-label="had been holding off (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been holding off</a> on updating its host of apps on the App Store due to the App Privacy Health Reports in the App Store that lets users view how an app tracks them. However, Google later disclosed that it will update its apps to include as little tracking as possible.</p>
<p>Having said that, it’s interesting to see Apple focus on enhancing user privacy as much as they can. And setting up a proxy server to filter Google Safe Browsing traffic just so Google cannot see users’ browsing activity will be a welcome move for a lot of users.</p>

<p>A Python library for unevenly-spaced time series analysis.</p>
<div id="why">
<h2>Why?<a href="#why" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Taking measurements at irregular intervals is common, but most tools
are primarily designed for evenly-spaced measurements. Also, in the
real world, time series have missing observations or you may have
multiple series with different frequencies: it’s can be useful to
model these as unevenly-spaced.</p>
<p>Traces aims to make it simple to write <em>readable code</em> to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wrangle</strong>. Read, write, and manipulate unevenly-spaced time series data</li>
<li><strong>Explore</strong>. Perform basic analyses of unevenly-spaced time series
data without making an awkward / lossy transformation to
evenly-spaced representations</li>
<li><strong>Convert</strong>. Gracefully transform unevenly-spaced times series data to
evenly-spaced representations</li>
</ul>
<p>Traces was designed by the team at <a href="https://datascopeanalytics.com/">Datascope</a> based on several practical
applications in different domains, because it turns out
<a href="https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/unevenly-spaced-time-series/">unevenly-spaced data is actually pretty great, particularly for
sensor data analysis</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="installation">
<h2>Installation<a href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To install traces, run this command in your terminal:</p>

</div>
<div id="quickstart-using-traces">
<h2>Quickstart: using traces<a href="#quickstart-using-traces" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To see a basic use of traces, let’s look at these data from a light
switch, also known as <em>Big Data from the Internet of Things</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="light switch trace" src="https://traces.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/trace.svg"></p>
<p>The main object in traces is a <a href="https://traces.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html#timeseries"><span>TimeSeries</span></a>, which

<h2>What is the “magic kernel”?</h2>

<p>The “magic kernel” is, today, a colloquial name for
Magic Kernel Sharp+, an image resizing algorithm
that is fast and efficient yet produces amazingly clear and sharp
results, and has helped
power the two largest social media photo sites in the world.</p>

<p>I first came across what I dubbed at that time
“the magic kernel” in 2006 in
the source code for what is now the standard JPEG library.
This “kernel”—essentially just
the weights 1/4 and 3/4—allowed
an image to be doubled in size, as many times as desired, astonishingly
clearly.
Experts pointed out, however, that the resulting images were
slightly blurrier
than an ideal resizer would produce.</p>

<p>In 2011 I investigated its remarkable properties
in depth, as a hobby, and generalized it to allow resizing
an image to any size.</p>

<p>In early 2013, while working with another Software Engineer at Facebook
to address some quality issues with the back-end resizing of all
photos uploaded to Facebook,
I realized that adding a simple three-tap sharpening step to
the <em>output</em> of a magic-kernel-resized image
yielded a fast and efficient resizing algorithm with close to
perfect fidelity.
I dubbed the combined algorithm “Magic Kernel Sharp.”</p>

<p>Furthermore, this factorization of the algorithm into two
independent parts—the original
Magic Kernel resizing step, plus a final Sharp step—allows
one to make use of hardware acceleration libraries that provide
only same-size filtering functions and non-antialiased resizing functions.</p>

<p>As a consequence of these properties,
by mid-2013 we were able to deploy Magic Kernel Sharp
to the back-end resizing of images on Facebook—with
not only better quality but also greater CPU <em>and</em> storage efficiency
than the code stack it replaced.

</p><p>When in early 2015 another Software Engineer sought to migrate Instagram
across to Facebook’s back-end image resizing infrastructure,
we realized that the existing Instagram
stack provided extra “pop” for the final image
through extra sharpening.
I simply adjusted the Magic Kernel Sharp code to include this additional
sharpening as part of the Sharp step, which allowed us to deploy
this “Magic Kernel Sharp+” to Instagram—again,
with greater CPU and storage
efficiency <em>and</em> higher quality and resolution
than the code stack it replaced.</p>

<p>In 2021 I derived a small refinement to the
2013 version of Magic Kernel Sharp, which yields a kernel that is
still completely practical, but can moreover be shown to be
mathematically ideal to at least nine bits of accuracy.</p>

<p>In the rest of this page
I provide a historical overview of
this development of
the magic kernel, together with some totally irrelevant and ignorable
(but hopefully amusing to some) personal
history.
(Alternative title: “How a colorblind Australian ended up
fixing most of the cat photos on the Internet.”)</p>


<h2>1982–2006: Pre-history</h2>

<p>(This section has nothing to do with the magic kernel, and can be
skipped.)</p>

<p>By September 1983, after
five months of working after school a couple of days a week
at McDonald’s, I had
saved the $620 I needed to buy an Apple&nbsp;II clone
(manufactured illegally in Asia) out of the
<em>Trading Post</em>, the weekly Melbourne newspaper
that listed mainly second-hand
items for sale.
(It was not dissimilar to my
saving my pocket money for six months in around 1973
to buy the latest in digital technology then available:
a $9.99 four-function calculator, the dog-eared K-Mart catalog page for
which I lovingly
kept next to my piles of pen-and-paper written calculations.)
The Apple&nbsp;II had just 48&nbsp;KB of RAM, and no floppy disk drive—programs were
saved to and reloaded from audio cassettes, if you had a tape recorder
handy to connect to the computer with an audio cable—but
I finally had my own
computer.</p>

<p>Bitmapped graphics caught my attention immediately (it even had six
different colors!).
After exhausting what I could do with the very slow
graphics functionality contained in
Applesoft BASIC (I think my first graphics
program on a school Apple&nbsp;II computer in early
1982—the earliest chance I had to use a computer—was
a graph of
“biorhythms,” which seemed quite advanced to a
15-year-old kid who didn’t even know what a sine function was),
I moved on to machine code,
even building a simple but visually accurate
emulation of one part of Pac-Man. (Without sounds.)</p>

<p>By 1985 I had dropped out of a Science/Engineering double degree at
Monash University (before the
“census date,” so officially I never went there;
having been expelled from a school in 1981 had reduced my sensitivity
to such future-changing decisions).
As well as climbing to management at McDonald’s, I
was building my own interface cards for my
Apple&nbsp;II, making use of those graphics programming skills
to create the circuit board
layouts, which I would print out at larger scale
on a dot-matrix printer,
have photographically reduced at a photo store
to transparencies at the final size, and then
expose (using a 240&nbsp;V ultra-violet fluorescent light mounted in
a beer cooler!) onto the circuit board blank
before exposing it to the chemicals needed to etch away the copper.

<img src="http://www.johncostella.com/magic/circuit-3.jpg" width="495" height="180">
</p>

<p>(Photographed decades later, by which time
the unprotected copper had been
attacked by the elements.)
My cousin
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/stephen.koekoek">Stephen</a>
liked this digital drum machine so much (I can still hear
his compositions of Phil Collins’ <em>Sussudio</em> drums in
my head, even today)
that four years later he bought
the computer and the final iteration of the digital sampling card off me
for his own use.
But I am getting ahead of myself.</p>

<p>My interest in pursuing electronics led a family friend to suggest that I
apply to restart my university studies in 1986 in
an Electrical Engineering degree at the University of Melbourne.
It may have been the best advice that I ever received.</p>

<p>By December 1989, three summers of interning at IBM during
that degree
had allowed me to save enough money to
follow the trend of my university peers in moving
away from the Apple&nbsp;II, and upgrade
to (what else?) an IBM PC (actually a
genuine PS/2 Model&nbsp;50—no clone this time around).
I now had the opportunity to use VGA graphics—space-age
science fiction
compared to the graphics of the Apple&nbsp;II.
I decided to move from the machine code of the Apple&nbsp;II to a new language
that I had learned the previous year in my Engineering degree,
which was close enough
to machine code that it was in many cases just as fast, but which
worked across different machines and microprocessors—and had
just been standardized by the American National Standards Institute: C.
I even went to a computer shop and bought a copy of
Microsoft QuickC—the first time that I had paid money for
software.</p>

<p>Having now <em>spent</em> money on software,
I soon thought up an idea for <em>making</em> money from this new technology,
leveraging my growing proficiency with computer graphics
(something I needed to do, as I had perhaps foolishly gotten the bug for
theoretical physics, starting the process of doing a Ph.D. in the field,
which basically eliminated my chance of earning any real money for the
foreseeable future, and ending my prospects for any more internships at IBM).
My mother had for decades done cross-stitch embroideries, buying the
printed
“patterns” for them from handcraft stores, and
I knew that there was a small but dedicated cadre of embroiderers who
did likewise.
I had also had the chance, while interning at IBM, to use a new device that
would scan a piece of paper and convert it to a digital bitmapped image
on a computer:
a “scanner.”
By 1990, HP had just released the first color scanner cheap enough
for the domestic market, and laser printers were also becoming cheap enough
to not just be the domain of huge companies.
Could I write a program that scanned photographs and converted them to
laser-printed cross-stitch design patterns?</p>

<p>Before laying out any hard cash for a color scanner,
I decided to try out the process on
a test image that was on a floppy disk accompanying
a book on computer graphics that I had bought.
(There was no World Wide Web in 1990.)
It worked: my mother actually stitched it (I still have it hanging on our
wall):</p>

<p>
<img src="http://www.johncostella.com/magic/frog-test-image.jpg" width="400" height="300">
<img src="http://www.johncostella.com/magic/frog-cross-stitch.jpg" width="400" height="300">
</p>

<p>After talking to the folks who ran the embroidery shop where my mother
bought her patterns and materials, it seemed likely that
I could sell such a service for $50 per design.
I did a quick break-even analysis, and decided to make the investment in
the HP scanner.</p><p>And in the years to follow,
“Costella Design” (just a name, not a real company)
did recoup that investment, and then some.</p>

<p>My C graphics programming moved on
to visually simulating the motion and spinning
of particles that I was deriving
equations of motion for in my Ph.D. studies (I still have a VHS
videotape of a simulation I showed in one presentation).
In early 1994, with government funding running out for me to complete
my Ph.D. thesis by June 30, I estimated that it would take me at least
another year or two to finish the algebraic calculations.
So I wrote C programs to perform
the algebra for me—and then wrote some more
to actually write the appendixes to
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.johncostella.com/physics/Single-particle%20electrodynamics.pdf">my
  Ph.D. thesis</a>.
(My offer to post a floppy disk with the C code on it to anyone who emails a
request for it is still, I think, enforceable—I do still have the
code, but I no longer have any devices capable of reading or writing
floppy disks.)</p>

<p>By 1997, my postdoctoral research
position in theoretical particle physics had come
to an end, and to make ends meet I enrolled in a teaching qualification
and started teaching mathematics at a high school in Melbourne.
My “few years in teaching to get by”
ultimately stretched to nine years.</p>

<p>To keep myself sane, I kept doing some research in theoretical physics,
writing C programs to explore various ideas.
Then in the summer school vacation of 2000 I got an idea for deblurring images,
after borrowing a picture book from the local library about the
JFK assassination.
That led to a four-year hobby of studying the photographic evidence
of the assassination, writing increasingly sophisticated image processing</p></div>

<p>Nouriel Roubini, an economics professor at New York University, thinks Tether is issuing fake money. And that nothing short of an audit will prove the $30 billion in USDT the BVI-registered company has spewed out into the crypto markets thus far are even 74% backed. (Stuart Hoegner, the firm’s general counsel, claimed they were three-quarters backed in April 2019 court documents.)</p>



<p>Tether is a “criminal enterprise,” he bluntly told reporters on <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/video/nouriel-roubini-reacting-to-teslas-big-bitcoin-buy-sec-should-investigate-market-manipulation">Coindesk TV</a>. In a 10-minute interview, Roubini predicted Tether’s looming demise, called for the SEC to look into <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-twitter-elon-musk-has-mused-about-bitcoin-11612821103">Elon Musk’s bitcoin tweets,</a> and claimed that central bank digital currencies will spell the end for crypto. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Dr. Doom, as Roubini is called, talks quickly, doesn’t mince words, and his face barely changes expression. He has a reputation as a perpetual pessimist. Ask him a question, and he will give you a straightforward, often bleak, answer. Though he might argue, he is simply being a realist. </p>



<p>I am not sure why Coindesk had him on their program. Roubini hates bitcoin and his responses elicited laughter—though it wouldn’t be the first time. Roubini “sounded like a madman in 2006,” when he stood before economists at the International Monetary Fund and announced a crisis of solvency was brewing, IMF economist Prakash Loungani <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/magazine/17pessimist-t.html">told the NYT in August 2008.</a> “He was a prophet when he returned in 2007.”</p>



<p>Anyhow, I transcribed the talk only because I thought Roubini’s points made sense. He was interviewed by Coindesk’s Lawrence Lewitinn, Christine Lee, and Emily Parker.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>Lee</strong>: The narrative on bitcoin has shifted from a means of payment to a store of value for some. It is not so much used as a currency as a digital gold. Institutions and public companies are buying this thesis and we are seeing bitcoin hit records as a result. What do you make of this institutional and corporate interest in bitcoin, underlined by <a href="https://amycastor.com/2021/02/08/tesla-spent-1-5b-in-clean-car-credits-on-bitcoin-the-filthiest-asset-imaginable/">Tesla’s $1.5 billion bitcoin investment</a> on Monday?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Roubini</strong>: As you suggested, bitcoin and crypto is not a means of payment. It is not a currency. It is not a unit of account. Is not a scalable means of payment. It is not a single <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/numeraire.asp">numeraire.</a> Now, people say it is an asset. But think of it. What are assets? Assets like stocks, bonds and real estate give you income or give you some use, like real estate. And, therefore, they give you capital gain. Gold does not give you income but it has other uses,—industrial activity and jewelry—and therefore, has some value. It used to be used as a means of payment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of bitcoin, it does not have any income. It doesn’t have any use. It doesn’t have any utility. So the value of it based on what? Based on no intrinsic value and purely a speculative bubble. That is why I argue that bitcoin, like all the other shitcoins, are worth zero. [Coindesk reporters giggle.]&nbsp;</p>



<p>Actually, negative given the hogging of energy and the environmental cost. If there was a carbon tax on crypto, the value of these assets would be negative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what is the fundamental value? What is the use? What is the utility that justifies the capital gain? None. It is a speculative bubble that is based on pump-and-dump, spoofing, wash trading and manipulation by Tether, which is a total scam.&nbsp;[More giggling from Coindesk crew.]</p>



<p>So, for institutional investors, saying we are going to invest in crypto doesn’t make any sense. You have a failing company that had a flat stock market like MicroStrategy for a decade, and its head was a coke addict who decided to bet the entire house on bitcoin. [CoinDesk crew really losing it.] That is irresponsible behavior. It is not gonna be any corporate head that is going to put his cash, as you point out, into something that is so volatile. You put your cash into something that is stable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And for someone like Elon Musk who knows he has a market impact to manipulate to first, take an individual position to bitcoin, pump the price up, and then say that Tesla is invested. And Tesla doesn’t make money yet. It is also irresponsible and it is market manipulation.&nbsp;[Note: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/bitcoin-spikes-20percent-after-elon-musk-adds-bitcoin-to-his-twitter-bio.html">Musk was tweeting about BTC,</a> pushing up the price, before Telsa announced it had purchased $1.5 billion worth.]</p>



<p>The SEC should be looking at people that have a market impact that manipulate the price of assets. That is also criminal behavior. It is totally a criminal enterprise. Tether is a criminal enterprise, and a bunch of whales and insiders are manipulating the price of bitcoins and other shitcoins day in and day out. That is a fact.</p>



<p><strong>Lewitinn</strong>: Dr. Roubini, always a ray of sunshine, of course. The question about Tether is this: We have known for a while now that it has been backed entirely by dollars. It is something like 70-some-odd percent. That came out a while ago. There have been questions about its backing for some time, for several years. Yet it is still trading on par with the US dollar. Conceivably, they have enough assets at least for a while to keep the peg going with the dollar. How much of a real worry is it for crypto if there is even a small run on tether?</p>



<p><strong>Roubini</strong>: First of all, we don’t know if it is backed 70% or not. Their lawyer says 70% but we have no idea. It doesn’t mean any[thing] absolute independent audit of it. [A bit garbled here, but he is saying, outside of a third-party audit, which Tether has never had, there is no way of knowing what’s backing tethers.]</p>



<p>We also know they are really issuing, literally, at an exponential rate, new tethers. In the last year alone, something like 25 billion. And in the last few weeks, a billion per week. So it looks like they are getting desperate, and it is a typical Ponzi scheme, in which you maintain the value of something by issuing more of it and more of it and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lewitinn</strong>: How different is that from what is going on right now from the money printing happening in Washington?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Roubini</strong>: The money printing in Washington is happening at a rate that is much less than the issuance of fiat by Tether and other shitcoins. If you look at the chart of it, literally, the case of Tether is exponential. Second, central banks, if you know, their assets are matching their liabilities. For every dollar of currency in excess of reserves that are in the central bank balance sheet there is an asset, foreign reserve, or gold or treasury assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the idea that fiat currencies are not backed by anything is utterly false. If you look at the balance sheet of any central bank, there are assets and there are liabilities. And actually, there is a positive net worth most of the time. But in the case of Tether there is nothing backing it. Again, even 70% is not true. And we know that every fixed exchange rate that is based on not-full-backing and not fully collateralized eventually collapses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The entire monetary history, every fixed exchange that is not backed has collapsed. It is only a matter of time. And the trigger is gonna be when the indictments of Tether and Bitfinex are going to occur, and it is only a matter of time this year. Because we know that there are investigations occurring.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Parker</strong>: Let’s move to central bank digital currencies for a moment. We know that China is moving quite rapidly in this area. Do you think that the US dollar will remain the world reserve currency?</p>



<p><strong>Roubini</strong>: I think that the Chinese are going to go ahead. [Sweden’s] Riksbank bank is going to go ahead. The [European Central Bank] is going to go ahead. And until now the US was behind the curve, but they realize that the Chinese had a plan to dominate the global financial system. It’s their e-commerce. It is their own platform of private payment systems like AliPay and WeChat Pay and that is going to be the e-RNB. And it is only a matter of time before we are going to phase out cash all over the world. And if the US wants to maintain the role of the US dollar as a major global reserve currency, they will have to move to an e-dollar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem with that is that people get excited in the crypto world when central banks end up talking about a central bank digital currency. A CBDC, first of all, has nothing to do with blockchain. It is going to be private. It is going to be centralized. It is going to be permissioned. And it is going to be based on a bunch of trusted authority verifying transactions. </p>



<p>It has nothing to do with blockchain. It has nothing to do with crypto. And as a payment system, it is going to dominate, not only crypto, which has absolutely no payment services, but also any private form of payment system that is digital, from credit cards to bank deposits to AliPay to WeChat pay to Venmo to Square to PayPal, and so on. Because it is going to be cheap, it is going to be instantaneous clearing and settlement. It is going to be a system that is going to dominate any form of private money</p>



<p>If and when a central bank currency is going to be introduced, the problem is going to be that any form of private digital payment system is going to be crowded out, starting with crypto, which doesn’t have any payment service in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lee</strong>: Dr. Roubini, it sounds like you believe that the technology underlying bitcoin is at least sound and that governments and central banks around the world will adopt it, and if that is the case, what happens to privacy? And you also mentioned something about negative rates becoming the norm. Tell us about that?</p>



<p><strong>Roubini</strong>: First of all, I said the opposite of the technology. The central bank digital currencies will not be based on blockchain. They are going to be private, not public. They are going to be centralized, not decentralized. They are going to be permissioned, not permissionless. They are going to be a bunch of central banks and private banks that are trusted verifiers of the transaction, rather than being trustless. So the technology is not going to be blockchain. It is not going to be crypto. That is my point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secondly, the advantage of having a central bank digital …</p></div></article></div>

<p>In my first week on the job as a software developer, I deleted an entire table’s worth of data from a client’s database. Luckily, we had a backup from the night before and that table was low traffic. What happened was that I <em>thought</em> I was on the staging server and I was doing some testing and needed to clear out the existing data. I was not on staging. I was on production. I learned a valuable lesson and I was determined never to make the same mistake again.</p>



<p>Enter, color coded SSH sessions:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="686" height="607" src="https://stevenwadejr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/EB9DL-_XkAEbAYp.png" alt="" srcset="https://stevenwadejr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/EB9DL-_XkAEbAYp.png 686w, https://stevenwadejr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/EB9DL-_XkAEbAYp-300x265.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px"></figure>



<p>I developed color schemes for different environments that would easily stand out and alert me of where I was.</p>



<p>For my local environment, I use a black background with green text. This is part Matrix and part me not having a computer growing up in the 90s and missing out on the nostalgia of pre-GUI terminals. On staging, I use a blue/violet mix that isn’t jarring to the eye or mind but still catches my attention and makes me aware of the environment. Lastly, for production-based servers I use a red background which definitely stands for “ALERT, whatever you do will have consequences!”</p>



<p>To color code the environments I use separate profiles within <a href="https://iterm2.com/documentation-dynamic-profiles.html">iTerm</a>. Once I customized the profiles to my liking, I needed a way to easily and dynamically switch between them. I did some googling and came across a bash function on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53683101">StackOverflow</a> called it2prof. Essentially this function is a shortcut to an iTerm command to switch profiles but the function is a lot cleaner to use: <code>it2prof staging</code>. That command will then switch the current iTerm window’s profile to the profile and color scheme of my “staging” profile.</p>



<p>To connect to an environment, I use shortcuts and aliases to run my commands at once, for instance: <code>ssh staging</code> aliases to <code>it2prof staging &amp;&amp; ssh steven@stage01</code> which will change the terminal profile and then ssh into my staging server.</p>



<p>This level of safe guarding will likely do for most people, however, I am paranoid and now I have multiple production environments to deal with. For instance, at work, we use a control box to do our releases, but we also have individual production servers that you can log into. So I wanted an extra notification of where I was to pop up.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="174" src="https://stevenwadejr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/production-1024x174.png" alt="" srcset="https://stevenwadejr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/production-1024x174.png 1024w, https://stevenwadejr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/production-300x51.png 300w, https://stevenwadejr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/production-768x130.png 768w, https://stevenwadejr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/production-1536x261.png 1536w, https://stevenwadejr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/production-2048x348.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Text to ASCII! I wanted a proper warning message to pop up and be as in my face as possible to let me know which boxes I was on. I used <a href="http://ascii.mastervb.net/">this tool</a> to convert my text to ASCII art which I then saved to text files either on my local machine or the remote server.</p>



<p>If you have your own user on a server you could do like what I did on the staging environment and update the .bashrc file to output the contents of a file when your Bash profile is loaded (upon log in). To do this, update your .bashrc file with a line like <code>cat env_msg.txt</code> where “env_msg.txt” is the text file containing your ASCII art.</p>



<p>My production servers use different user permissions so instead, I stored those warning files locally and just updated my aliases. For work, I created a <code>fub</code> (short for <a href="https://www.followupboss.com/">Follow Up Boss</a>) function that helps me do various things, one of them being ssh-ing into a server. I simply updated each SSH command with a call to <code>cat</code> my text file like so: <code>it2prof control &amp;&amp; cat /Users/steven/production-warning.txt &amp;&amp; ssh production01</code>. Now all I have to type into my terminal is <code>fub ssh prod01</code> and my terminal profile turns red, I get the boldface production warning, and I’m ssh’d into the proper machine.</p>



<p>Now, I’m always aware of what machine I’m working on and I haven’t made the same mistake again as I did all those years ago.</p>



<p>Do what you need to to guard/help yourself. Remember, stay safe out there.</p>

        <p>Over the past year and a half, I've been collaborating with <a href="https://darklang.com/">Dark</a> (a new programming language startup) to research programming languages and tools. Today we are sharing these reviews publicly.</p>
        <p>The Whole Earth Catalog was before my time, but I grew up immersed in many of the conversations it began. This series borrows its name, and continues in its tradition of "access to tools". Stewart Brand’s original inspiration for the Catalog was helping his "friends who were starting their own civilization hither and yon in the sticks." This series is likewise designed to help visionary friends, but where his friends were living off-the-grid, my friends are creating the programming environments of the future. This series is democratizing access to tools one-step removed. These reviews are for the makers of tools, those that are pushing our computational interfaces forward. The goal of the Whole Code Catalog is to provide inspiration for the tools you will one day create.</p>
        <p>Other similar efforts to catalog futuristic computational interfaces include:

    <p>In my <a href="https://paranoidenough.com/2021/01/25/The-Battle-of-Gamestop.html">last post</a>, I wrote about the GameStop short squeeze, the allure of Wall Street Bets, and how the theory of reflexivity can teach us about the broader societal implications of the trading frenzy. Two weeks later, the party is over and (once again) retail investors <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/02/gamestop-story-you-think-you-know-wrong/617905/">got the short end of the stick</a>.</p>

<p>Small investors were inveigled into a trade where they lost their shirts and some <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-hedge-fund-made-700-million-on-gamestop-11612390687">big players</a> and market makers made out like bandits. For about two days, buying GameStop stock was a “movement”. That is, until it became clear that the market is brutally efficient and doesn’t care about populist rhetoric. At that point, the GameStop trade turned into a game of “who is holding the bag”. When your investment thesis depends on the assumption that the mainstream media is outright lying to you and that massive fraud exists in the market, it’s time to get out.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>How did this happen? I’m not going to go into a play-by-play of what happened – enough has been said about this.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Rather, I’ll use GameStop as a case study for how reasonable, smart people get caught up in manias, cults, and mass movements.</p>

<h3 id="wall-street-bets-is-dead">Wall Street Bets is Dead…</h3>

<p>…and we have killed her. A month ago, Wall Street Bets was a subreddit with some stupid memes and outlandish options bets, but also with people who actually knew something about finance LARPing as “retards”.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> There was solid due diligence: in-depth analysis of companies’ financial statements along with market sizing and strategic growth prospects. Some of the analysis wasn’t that much different from the first draft of an investment memo for a buy-side firm.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l7bl3z/brokers_of_reddit_how_crazy_is_it_where_you_work/gl64yau/">this Reddit comment</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Redditors never seem to stop and think about why the WSB guys know so much about derivatives trading. Or how they seem to know how to access and read from a Bloomberg terminal. Or why there are so many users there that can seemingly drop tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on complicated meme plays.</p>

  <p>How do you think that WSB knew that GME was open to a short squeeze and a gamma squeeze play?</p>

  <p>WSB’s power users are younger finance bros. It’s 30-something investment bankers and portfolio managers memeing with each other and cosplaying as “autists.”</p>

  <p>If you didn’t know what a gamma squeeze was 48 hours ago, you are their exit strategy and the down payment on their next Porsche.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the subreddit was a fringe group of people who actually knew something about finance, there was alpha to be found in its insights. Wall Street Bets was about getting some laughs in the pursuit of fuck-you money. However, over the past few weeks, Wall Street Bets was flooded with newcomers (it <a href="https://subredditstats.com/r/wallstreetbets">quadrupled in size over the course of about a week</a>) who, along with the mainstream media, turned the GameStop trade into a “movement” and “taking on the hedge funds”.</p>

<p>In retrospect, this was the writing on the wall:<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="we-are-all-monkeys">We Are All Monkeys</h3>

<p>Let’s revisit a classic psychology experiment, which <a href="https://www.throwcase.com/2014/12/21/that-five-monkeys-and-a-banana-story-is-rubbish/">apparently never happened</a>. Nevertheless, it is a good allegory for the GameStop trade (and the business world in general).</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/monkey_mirror.jpg" alt="Monkey Looking in Mirror"></p>

<p>A scientist places five monkeys in a locked room. Inside the room, there is a ladder with a bunch of bananas at its top. Each time a monkey climbs the ladder to try to reach the bananas, the scientist pulls him down and sprays him – as well as all of the other monkeys in the room – with a stream of cold water.</p>

<p>After this cycle repeated a few times, the monkeys learn that climbing the ladder leads to a faceful of cold water. So, each time that a monkey begins to climb the ladder, the other monkeys in the room pull him down so they can avoid being sprayed.</p>

<p>The scientist removes one of the original monkeys from the room. The monkeys’ self-policing continues. When the new monkey tries to climb the ladder, the others pull him down. The new monkey learns that he shouldn’t climb the ladder.</p>

<p>Here’s the kicker: The scientist replaces all of the monkeys in the room, one by one. By the end of the experiment, none of the original monkeys (the ones that had been sprayed with cold water) are left in the room. But all of the new monkeys continue to pull down any monkey that climbs the ladder, without knowing why they are doing it.</p>

<p>Now we modify this experiment slightly. Rather than replacing the monkeys in the room, the scientist simply adds new monkeys. But midway through the experiment, the power goes out! The scientist can’t see any monkeys climbing the ladder. The original monkeys realize that this is their opportunity – they scramble up the ladder and eat all of the bananas. By the time the power comes back on, the new monkeys continue to pull one another down from the ladder and are left <a href="https://paranoidenough.com/2021/01/25/The-Battle-of-Gamestop.html#the-allure-of-wall-street-bets">diamond-handing</a> (💎 🤲) banana peels.</p>

<p>It’s fun to be one of the monkeys in this room. You’re among a group of people who are excited about something; they have some special knowledge that promises to make them fabulously wealthy. Their knowledge is doubted by the mainstream, but their prophecies keep coming true.</p>

<p>They have a special language that distinguishes them from the outgroup. You are welcomed as a part of the tribe, you start to lose yourself in the fantasy of becoming rich and become swept up in the mob, experiencing a bit of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_psychology">loss of self</a> that comes from being a part of a mass movement.</p>

<p>There is a huge sense of urgency. You can get in on this thing, but only if you act <strong>now</strong>. Your heart beats a little bit faster – that’s FOMO. You’re experiencing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias">optimism bias</a> – because you understand what is happening, this is bound to work out for you.</p>

<p>All you need to do is buy in and hold on. Anyone who defects from the party line is subject to ad hominem attacks. They are relegated to the outgroup.</p>

<p>The goalposts keep moving. Every time a price target is reached, the ceiling is raised. $100 is not a meme. $420.69 is not a meme. $1,000 is not a meme. $10,000 is not a meme!</p>

<p>The mainstream media is not to be trusted. They weren’t on your side to begin with – why would they be now? There is a disinformation campaign going on – your group has been infiltrated. You don’t know who and what to trust, so you need to stop thinking for yourself and have blind faith in the process. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink">Groupthink</a> abounds.</p>

<p>Retail investors are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop">selling more than they’re buying</a>? That data is suspect. You choose to ignore information from sources that you previously considered valid because this doesn’t fit the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/narrative-fallacy#:~:text=The%20narrative%20fallacy%20addresses%20our,help%20them%20make%20more%20sense">narrative (fallacy)</a> that you and the others have created.</p>

<p>As you begin to lose money (or unrealized gains) on your position, you dig in deeper. You become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)">anchored</a> to the gains that you were already counting in your head. You won’t settle for anything less! You’d never buy in at these levels, but what you already have? Of course you let it ride – the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect">endowment effect</a> in action. You fall for the <a href="https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/sunk-cost-fallacy/">sunk cost fallacy</a> and throw good money after bad to double down on your position.</p>

<p>It’s hard to exit the echo chamber. You don’t want to admit to yourself that you were taken for a ride; that you only have yourself to blame for the losses you endured. You want to keep believing. The ending to the story is so much better if you keep believing.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/creed.gif" alt="Creed on Cults"></p>

<p>Originally I included this gif simply because it was funny, but in writing this essay, I realized that it’s actually quite apt. The people who got in and out of this trade early made a boatload. The followers had a lot of fun (for a while), got caught up in the mania, and lost money.</p>

<h3 id="cults-abound">Cults Abound</h3>

<p>We all want to belong to something greater than ourselves. Smart people are no different – they are drawn to cults all of the time.</p>

<p>Look at the annual mass exodus from San Francisco to Black Rock City to celebrate Burning Man. Or Silicon Valley executives who wear <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90334124/from-hacking-the-mind-to-punishing-ennui-techs-brightest-are-taking-to-silent-retreats">Vipassana retreats</a><sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> as a badge of honor. The best startup cultures are often described as “cult-like”. You either fully buy into the mission or you’re out. Think Uber and its “you eat what you kill” attitude (at least until Travis left), or Roam Research, which fully embraces the #roamcult hashtag and even has a <a href="https://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1350645949513699331">compound in Utah</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/roam.jpg" alt="Roam Cult"></p>
<p>Cult Vibes (image via <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/a-200-million-seed-valuation-for-roam-shows-investor-frenzy-for-note-taking-apps">The Information</a>)</p>

<p>Zooming out a bit, <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22195549/soulcycle-decline-reopening-bullying-bike-explained">SoulCycle</a> and other premium fitness classes are both:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A signal of wealth and</li>
  <li>Cult-like in their intensity, adherence to strict guidelines, and hero worship of individual instructors.</li>
</ol>

<p>Even mainstream (i.e., moderate) organized religion is simply a cult that has stopped taking itself so seriously.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> Moving to extremist religion, terrorists are relatively wealthy and well-educated. They disproportionately <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2009/12/why-do-so-many-terrorists-have-engineering-degrees.html">hold engineering degrees</a>. Scott Alexander makes the compelling argument that this can, at least partially, be attributed to <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/03/repost-epistemic-learned-helplessness/">epistemic learned helplessness</a>, the idea that sometimes the most rational thing that someone can do is to ignore an argument that they can’t refute.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[A] sufficiently smart engineer has never been burned by arguments above his skill level before, has never had any reason to develop epistemic learned helplessness. If Osama comes up to him with a really good argument for terrorism, he thinks “Oh, there’s a good argument for terrorism. I guess I should become a terrorist,” as opposed to “Arguments? You can prove anything with arguments. I’ll just stay right here and not blow myself up.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So perhaps epistemic learned helplessness (or rather, lack thereof) can help explain why smart people can be so drawn to scams, cults, and mass movements. When one is used to seeing the world in a way that others don’t – and, quite frankly, feeling intellectually superior to others – it is easy to lose the humility and self-doubt that would have helped during the GameStop scenario. Being intellectually aware of the cognitive biases that we face as human beings is different from (and even perhaps inversely correlated to) the ability to step back and say, “This is crazy, I’m out.”<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup></p>

<p>Cults aren’t inherently a bad thing.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> Just know when you’re in one and have an exit strategy for when …</p></div></div>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/iot-header.png" width="100%" alt="SSH into a Self-driving Vehicle"></p>

<p>Over the last couple of years, we’ve started to see computers take to the street, and lucky for us, it’s been mostly to help us get deliveries or transport us around. These robots are a combination of sensors, compute units, and some form of connectivity. They have personalities, and if you look closely, two cute eyes on <a href="https://serve.postmates.com/">Postmates’ Serve</a> that provide it with stereo vision to navigate the streets.  While ‘Serve’ is fully equipped to navigate the streets, even the smartest robots need help from a human sometimes.</p>

<p>Many of us have taken accessing computers remotely for granted, despite the fact that our production servers are running behind NAT.  This has been made possible by SREs  who set up public endpoints and bastion hosts, and configure identity-based authentication as we’ve covered in a previous post called <em><a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-ssh-properly/">How to SSH properly</a></em>. But what if your computer is on the move? What happens if you have thousands of them in thousands of cities? How do you provide access for system-level debugging? Which technical hurdles will you have to overcome?</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/iot-1.png" width="100%" alt="SSH into a Robot"></p>

<h3 id="connectivity-and-the-network">Connectivity and the Network</h3>

<p>We are lucky to have a range of connectivity options available to IoT devices, from high speed LTE connections to new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa">LoRaWAN</a> networks. Once connected to a network, the next step is to get access to the device. This post will focus on using SSH by following best practices. Earlier, we’ve outlined how to configure the local ssh-agent to connect to a Bastion Host. This method works well, but unless you start off with a very good naming convention, it becomes much harder to find that one robot stuck in Berlin at 3am.</p>

<p>We’ve taken the best practices of accessing systems and rolled them into our open source project, Teleport. Teleport was designed as a drop-in <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/introducing-teleport-4-point-3-modern-replacement-for-openssh/">replacement for OpenSSH</a>, but with a focus on fleets of servers (clusters) where individual nodes such as self-driving trucks (or regular AWS instances) can be located anywhere in the world. The certificate authority and the audit log are deployed in secure networks with only the proxy available to the public internet. Let’s dive a bit deeper into it.</p>

<h3 id="ssh-into-a-self-driving-truck">SSH into a Self-driving Truck</h3>

<p>While the technical details of delivery robots are often kept under wraps, we know other people have gone to great lengths to be able to <a href="https://blogs.wcode.org/2015/04/howto-ssh-to-your-iot-device-when-its-behind-a-firewall-or-on-a-3g-dongle/">SSH into lamp posts</a> with David’s Awesome <a href="https://blogs.wcode.org/2015/01/playable-city-award-2014-shadowing-part-1-hardware/">Shadowing Project</a>. The same approach could be applied to self-driving robots using a reverse SSH tunnel, but this method only scales so far, and it requires more than 50 steps to set up.</p>

<p>A reverse SSH tunnel is an SSH connection initiated by the host (self-driving vehicle) to the proxy. This connection is maintained for as long as the host is online, and if an engineer or an Ansible script wants to connect to the vehicle, they connect to the proxy, which in turn proxies the connection through the tunnel to the host who initiated it.</p>

<p>We had many <a href="https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/803">long standing requests</a> to support reverse tunnels, and with OSS Teleport  4.0, we’ve made setting up and managing these reverse tunnels simpler. This can be set up on the node in a couple of quick steps.</p>

<p>On the robot/lamp post/self-driving truck, the Teleport daemon will be installed and will then dial back to a central Teleport Cluster.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">$ teleport start --roles=node
 --token=n92bb958ce97f761da978d08c35c54a5c --auth-server=teleport-proxy.example.com</code></pre></div>
<p>Extra configuration options can be set up to add labels and extra supporting metadata to help the operator.</p>

<p>After connecting to the proxy, the ‘node’ - in our case a single Raspberry Pi - will show in the Teleport web UI and you can see it by using the CLI client as well:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">➜  ~ tsh ls
Node Name             Address         Labels
--------------------- --------------- --------------------------------------------------

Truck-1821             ⟵ Tunnel      arch=Linux, hostname=postmate-serve-342145
                                      uptime=up 0 minutes, 📍=SF
                                      📶=5G</code></pre></div>
<p>I’m now able to SSH into the node using it’s node name.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">➜  ~ tsh ssh truck-1821
$truck-1821:~</code></pre></div>
<p>This has a few benefits</p>

<ul>
<li>You can ssh into truck-1821 using it’s nodename, meaning you no longer have to worry about IP addresses or having to setup Dynamic DNS at its location.</li>
<li>Labels can provide both system and location data. This makes managing a large fleet of devices much easier.</li>
<li>It allows for one centralized access system for ARM, Linux, and MacOS applications.<br></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="accessing-moving-kubernetes-clusters-in-a-self-driving-truck">Accessing moving Kubernetes Clusters in a self driving Truck</h3>

<p>Moving up in scale, we’ve started to see more computers move to the edge, and some have speculated that this could be the <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/15/the-end-of-cloud-computing-2/">end of cloud computing</a>. For context, a self driving truck generates 10 gigabytes of data per mile. Some self-driving companies have published how they manage and set up network infrastructure. Cruise has a <a href="https://medium.com/cruise/container-platform-networking-kubernetes-e888a07407ab">great blog</a> for anyone interested in the topic.</p>

<p>As these systems become more complex, having more compute and extra redundancy running a container-orchestration system makes sense to scale the workloads associated with many gigabytes of data every mile. Yet for operators, these systems can be increasingly difficult to update, debug, and access. Providing access opens Pandora’s box of issues. If robots or humans can access machines, there needs to be an audit trail, approval workflows, and full visibility into what’s been run on these clusters.</p>

<p>These problems can be easy to solve on a small scale, but become increasingly difficult with 100+ Clusters. Combining a large cluster with hundreds of employees can create extra operational complexity. We have had many users facing the same problem and by using external identity providers combined with a flexible Role Based Access Control (RBAC), They get access quickly and securely.</p>

<p>In this quick example we’ll show how a fictional company has deployed multiple kubernetes clusters into trucks, yet still require a centralized command and control over the cluster.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/iot-2.png" width="100%" alt="SSH into a Truck"></p>

<p>Teleport provides users two options for connecting to a Kubernetes cluster, it can be run as a proxy outside the cluster or deployed inside a cluster. We recommend deploying inside a cluster, then registering the cluster back to a central root cluster using t<a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/trustedclusters/">rusted clusters</a>.</p>

<p>All of these features are available in the OSS version of Teleport, using Github as an SSO provider. We’ve more information on our <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/kubernetes-access/">Kubernetes integration here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/iot-3.png" width="100%" alt="SSH into a K8s"></p>

<h3 id="connect-to-any-computer-anywhere">Connect to any computer anywhere</h3>

<p>No matter where you run a computer, be it a small home lab, a small robot or many thousands of self-driving trucks, these patterns can be used to get secure access quickly. The use of reverse tunnels to access infrastructure can be very powerful when you don’t have full control over the network.</p>

        <p>If you publish your roadmap, one of two good things will happen: your stakeholders will be happy and you can go forward, or you will learn that you got it wrong and you can correct it.</p>

<p>If you tell your team member that she’s not doing part of her job, one of two good things will happen: she’ll agree and work with you to improve, or she will disagree and you’ll learn she’s unwilling to improve.</p>

<p>If you tell your cofounder that your vision is different from his, one of two good things will happen: he’ll move toward you and you’ll find a common way forward, or you’ll learn that you have really different goals.</p>

<p>If you ask your tech team to explain the return on investment of their rebuild, one of two good things will happen: you’ll understand their thinking and the value of what they’re doing, or you’ll learn that they don’t have a financial justification for their work.</p>

<p>Every one of these is drawn from work with my clients in the last week. Every one represents a real opportunity to learn and improve. But the people involved needed to take action first to create that opportunity.</p>

      <p>I don’t think any little girl grows up with the goal of “I want to be an OSS Android browser developer” and to be totally honest, even as an adult I just kind of fell into it. I first joined Mozilla as an intern during my change-career journey mainly because I had taken one Android class, knew some Java, and applied on a whim at the right time to hit the recruiter’s inbox. Despite not actively seeking Mozilla or Android out, I immediately fell in love with the project and team and knew I had stumbled into a very special place. The problems were interesting, I had opportunities for leadership and growth from the start, and the people were kind, smart, and supportive.</p>

<p>At Mozilla you’ll meet the smartest and most passionate people who could be tech leaders at any other major company (and almost certainly make more money) but are choosing to work specifically on Firefox because they believe in the product and the mission. It’s definitely intimidating to come in as an intern to one of the original “software companies” but everyone I’ve met is truly wonderful and welcoming. It was (mostly) fun to be the underdog and celebrate our wins, large and small alike. I felt connected to the mission and the products we were creating. I felt like I had a large impact in my team after only a short amount of time (most teams are quite small and tight-knit). The fans and the community were passionate and many times I had the cool experience of wearing a Firefox t-shirt in public and people thanking me for my work (now that I’m writing this, it feels a bit odd. I guess you had to be there).</p>

<p>So if it’s so great then why am I leaving? I know it’s not a satisfying answer, verging on cliche, but I’m just looking to do something new. That and.. I am also extremely burnt out. The very small mobile team has been through a gauntlet in order to ship a full rewrite of the flagship Firefox for Android browser (partly during the pandemic no less). Working too much during the week for the last 2 years was normal for me and while never asked for from my team, I cared deeply about the product and the success and it would have been impossible to hit our deadlines and ship something I was proud of without it. And when we finally did ship, I WAS proud of our team and what we had accomplished, but the release just felt like a blip in our planned schedule before jumping into more sprints and fires and thinking about the next iteration.</p>

<p>I did take one week of PTO right after our release! … which just so happened to be the week that the large layoffs happened. I was safe from layoffs, but morale plummeted, and I was definitely not refreshed. The cherry on top was being specifically targeted for harassment that same week after the release by unhappy users of Firefox looking for someone to direct their frustrations at<sup><a href="#myfootnote1">1</a></sup>. There’s nothing that Mozilla really could have done in this scenario, but it left a terrible taste in my mouth after all of the blood, sweat, and tears I had put into this project. For someone who thought of themselves as an empathetic dev overworking myself FOR the end users and product, this hurt and I’m not sure I ever really recovered. While the pace is slowing down now and there’s a promise of no more deadline crunches, I just feel that I haven’t been able to catch my breath no matter how much time I take off. Whether that’s the project, pandemic fatigue, or all of the above, I’m very ready for a break, a fresh start, and a change of pace.</p>

<p>Working in open source full-time has been an incredible experience that has had its extreme ups and downs. On the positive side, I’ve loved mentoring new contributors to get their first open source PR merged. I’ve enjoyed all the positive interactions with the lovely community volunteers who care as much about making the product better as I do. On the negative side, it has become increasingly hard for me to separate work from not work. I found myself “contributing” (read - working) at all hours of the day. Replying to issues, emails, and public chats when I was in bed at midnight, when I just woke up at 7am, in the car on the way to go hiking on the weekend, and then while ON the hike. This might be a me problem, but boundary setting when there’s a public repo always getting new issues, comments, emails, and chatroom messages was difficult for me. And of course not all of those messages are nice; the constant stream of negative comments from unhappy and rude users during the work week and outside of it was extremely draining. Besides politicians, this might be one of the only jobs where you can wake up to an inbox full of emails and messages about how much everyone thinks you suck at your job. You definitely grow a thick skin quickly, but it’s still exhausting.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people tend to forget that Mozilla was also my very first job in tech. I learned so much there and there’s always more I could learn, but it’s good to try new experiences and face new problems, especially early in my career. I will be forever grateful for the experiences I’ve had at Mozilla and the people I’ve met. It was my “big break” into tech and I will never forget that! I will keep using and supporting Firefox and take a lot of the Mozilla ideals with me wherever I go. My experience was super formative for how I view ethics, privacy, and other important issues inside the tech space.</p>

<p>I am excited about my break and my next adventure but I’m definitely very sad to be leaving Mozilla and the wonderful people. The (good) problem with working with people who are true friends is it’s painful when people leave, including yourself. I will miss everyone dearly, especially all of my mobile team peers. I hope you all stay in touch and our paths cross again once conferences are a thing again (or maybe I’ll just crash the next All Hands, I’m not above it). If you’re at Mozilla and want to say goodbye, please ping me in the next 2 weeks! I’ve also heard I’m quite easy to find online! 😉</p>

<p><a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: EDIT: Saw this made it onto Hacker News and people in the comments were doubting this harassment happened. Classic. I documented it well on my Twitter at the time, but I’m happy to give more context. I tweeted around the time of release that I was proud of the team for all our hard work and I’m not “worrying about the haters” with a photo of me drinking a beer and flipping off the camera. I never referenced users. “Haters” is just a saying that the youngins say that isn’t specific but according to the internet, <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hater-4589594">“a hater is a slang term used in everyday language and especially online to describe an individual who talks and behaves negatively in response to other people’s success and goal achievement.”</a> It was a light-hearted joke for my Twitter friends after a year of hard work and constant negativity. In response this tweet was posted all over Reddit and 4chan and then there were coordinated doxxing attacks, multiple 4chan threads full of violent sexual and death threats, troll PRs opened in our repo, all of my photos pulled off of my Instagram and posted into these threads with disgusting commentary, and actual calls to my work from fake “journalists” to try to get me fired. I’m not going to post the comments here because they make me sick but feel free to search the archives to see for yourself. If you think this is ever an appropriate response to a dev on the team telling a joke online, I can’t help you.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Like many start-up stories, the co-founders of Routable, Tom and Omri began theirs in a basement that they entered each morning in the dark and left each evening... also in the dark. Over the course of 9 months and 300 customer development interviews, they realized that business payments were a <em>lot</em> like pull requests— the mechanism software engineers use to alert their team about changes to code and get it reviewed before it’s deployed. With the vision of building an engineering and technology-centered company for finance teams, this insight was key to making that vision a reality.</p><p>That insight has remained core part of Routable's DNA to this day — it influences not just our product development and design process, but also our hiring process. It's how we get the best engineers in the world to work on modernizing business payments with us.</p><p>Here’s how business payments are similar to pull requests.</p><h3 id="tickets-are-just-bills-and-invoices">Tickets are just bills and invoices</h3><p>If you're an engineer, you're probably familiar with tickets — at most of the places I've worked, we've had some form of ticket driven development where you begin coding a feature or fixing a bug after a ticket has been assigned to you. This is important to stop rogue coding and ensure that there is a record of every change in the product for compliance, debugging and more.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/cWSJpOY9sdmlK_UXj8GYiwR0tYiSwwEXolbgG4RwEzGFKjFN5fE85ubW8Tj6WBZb2elAqGFiuiX414TyynHsIEA8bCRZDeuDn4ffDXyrOcIajr4Og1RBSN_cO8ddoWa-JSi4ekux" alt=""><figcaption>These are basically tickets.</figcaption></figure><div><p>Like an engineering team is driven by tickets, finance teams are driven by bills and invoices. Before they can transfer or request money, they need to make sure there is a record of every transaction for compliance and reporting purposes.</p><p>Bills can come in at any time of day, in a million different formats, and from a bunch of different sources. Invoices that are sent out are hopefully in a more standardized format, but different vendors will still have different requirements that you must meet to get paid.</p></div><h3 id="new-code-and-new-payments-need-to-be-double-checked-for-validity">New code and new payments need to be double-checked for validity</h3><p>So let’s say you’re an engineer. &nbsp;You got a JIRA ticket and coded up a brilliant solution. The next step is to open up a pull request and share your work with the team for feedback.</p><p>The tests aren't passing. Your team has a continuous integration service that checks for known security vulnerabilities, style violations, and broken tests. Until you've made all those checks happy and gotten the ✅ s that you need, you can't send this out to your team to review.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NTRE0NFCc50DrbrTcmaUQU5EpZvoYlxZ-Ax4n5chap-TKOP5AOMKZY6K5w_GfsQcQ-FQ4lCeXNcLQSNfLIh51sXRDupz_9z1CYSmyr3a9XbiyCg-XjkrvW9B8ZKiwIyiwzO546NX" alt=""></figure><p>Finance is really similar. Before an invoice or payment can be submitted, someone on the team needs to check bank account validity, if there is money in the account to spend, if they’re past your bank's cut-off time for same day wires, and much much more. Finally, they need to ensure that the invoice or payment is properly recorded in your accounting software/ERP so there is a clear record of everything (especially come tax season).</p><h3 id="there-are-multiple-levels-of-approval">There are multiple levels of approval</h3><p>Excellent — the tests are passing! Now it's time to send this to your team to review. Depending on what part of the codebase you're working in, you might even need to satisfy that principal engineer that's held personally responsible for any defect that makes its way into production.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7G2S0taLHgcVyDdxKYHhMtZZFbBOOIfxhfjsoou-rnnLxW0UPBs_nqWgdj36QjKrKIa63CHPpKXIQPx07E7dYttuZvIDRGxfBSXOVuFuAFIAoZIAZK-xhMb2jTYvVGh76-oGRmkl" alt=""></figure><p><br>Again, finance is really similar — they can't just move $15,000 without at least one other set of eyes. For large transfers of money, expect multiple levels of approval all the way up to the CFO before an invoice can be sent or a bill can be paid. Just like in software, an extra 0 or a period in the wrong place can have a huge impact.</p><h3 id="shipping-code-is-just-like-sending-a-large-payment">Shipping code is just like sending a large payment</h3><p>In an incredible turn of events, the principal engineer loved your code and even gave you a little 🚢-it emoji. It's the end of the day Thursday though and you have a concert that evening — You're pretty sure your code is good to go, but you've been wrong before and you're not trying to get paged during the show. You hold off until Friday morning to merge.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5yuOH7t08tmfTYflhVymeLqu4Lf2bViyWgQwzjHh0InzMfa9bBqDNTjoa1SCsqnjKrsRK0B-eitdPFoVoeWYx9HquJECaJI7SwTTEm8v4f9gSjQBldZRiIJ7Avfs0cTMhT6OyedO" alt=""></figure><p><br>Same deal in finance — they’re pretty sure there’s enough to cover a large transfer, but they also know that a large transfer into the company account will clear tomorrow morning. So just to be safe, they schedule the payment to send tomorrow. ✨</p><h3 id="rolling-back-code-is-like-cancelling-a-payment-sort-of-">Rolling back code is like cancelling a payment (sort of)</h3><p>It turns out that you made the right decision to delay shipping your code... an hour after it went out. 💥 Luckily, it impacted very few users and you were able to roll back the code right away and mitigate the damage. The principal engineer is happy with your good judgement to ship in the morning and you'll live to code another day.</p><p>This is where finance really has a rough go of it — it's not always as convenient to roll back. Invoices are pretty straightforward to cancel, but payments are trickier. There's usually a window of only hours that they can cancel a check or ACH payment. That's why all the checks and processes that we've grown used to in software are even more important in the finance world!</p><h3 id="business-payments-as-prs-is-our-ethos">Business payments as PRs is our ethos</h3><p>Engineers are usually unaware of the complexities inherent in business payments. We're used to PayPal and Venmo where it's literally a click of a button to transfer money to a friend for lunch.</p><p>If you pause for a second to think about it though, it's obvious that there is a boatload of complexity that those companies are hiding behind a beautiful, simple interface.</p><p>It's the same at Routable — behind our simple UI, we've hidden away the complex problem of integrating with multiple accounting ledgers, legacy banking processes and managing the multi-step process of moving money between businesses.</p><p>Once we share this analogy, it's an aha moment for engineers — business payments become an interesting problem to solve. Not only that, it builds empathy for our customers and helps us build a better product.</p><p>It's also made product development really simple for us 👏</p><p>Interested in working at Routable?

<p>MetaMask is making about $170k per day thanks to its token swap feature, Tom Schmidt of Dragonfly Capital <a href="https://twitter.com/tomhschmidt/status/1359393949568303104">said in a tweet</a>, which was later confirmed with data the wallet’s team published in a <a href="https://duneanalytics.com/codefi/metamask-swaps-">Dune Analytics dashboard</a>.</p>



<p>The decentralized wallet and most popular gateway to DeFi is processing between $15M and $20M in daily trading volume through the swap feature <a href="https://thedefiant.substack.com/p/metamask-token-swaps-are-only-the">launched in October</a>, Dune Analytics data show. MetaMask takes 0.875% in fees from each trade, which resulted in as much as $198k of revenue from a record $22.7M in volume on Jan. 24.</p>



<h4>Sustainable Business</h4>



<p>These numbers show that wallets and decentralized exchanges and aggregators can grow into sustainable businesses. This contradicts the common take that open source protocols can’t be profitable because developers can easily copy the code and create a competitor with lower or no fees.</p>



<p>“I have a feeling that this is going to be good news for wallets everywhere. A lot easier to invest in something with a validated business model,” said MetaMask developer Dan Finlay, in response to a tweet.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/sSmypLPVEFAYsdj_gJG3DeGyzIlmkyy70FSUBkhhFTyd1fpOnkxZMBkXLxFMBEjOYz7dA3IPrlqEK3pdS_RUzHczEBwP6nY6-Ss7TtGdAVOrSvR8O9J6O2quUtJBdBu7Hs4JnkUD" alt=""></figure>



<p>Over 100K unique accounts have executed 236k swaps within MetaMask, the data show. That’s still a small portion of the ~1.3M total accounts interacting with DeFi protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MetaMask’s daily swap volume is 10 times lower than other aggregators, like 1inch Exchange, whose daily volume has fluctuated around $200M during January.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>All About The Fees</h4>



<p>MetaMask’s 0.875% in fees is nearly three times what flagship decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap does with its 0.3% cut.</p>



<p>The wallet’s token swaps feature serves as an aggregator, accessing many DEXs at once, some of which are themselves aggregators, in an attempt to be for token swaps, what Expedia is for travel quotes, Finlay <a href="https://medium.com/metamask/real-time-data-on-metamask-swaps-c50d2c9ab020">said in a post</a> yesterday. Perhaps convenience trumps low fees as users attempt to keep their trading processes simple.</p>



<p>The revelation that MetaMask is making ~170K a day in fees has some Twitter users asking “when airdrop.” Uniswap airdropped its UNI token to users in September and 1inch dropped did the same in late December, so doubtless others are hoping for a similar event with MetaMask.</p>

<p>Bad air is bad for you. The air purifier market, though, is a mess. Every purifier uses incompatible proprietary filters, presumably to lock you into buying replacements. How do we know these actually work? Few seem to publish lab tests. And why does it cost $100-$300 for a big plastic box with a fan and a filter inside?</p>

<p>It’s common to build DIY air purifiers by basically strapping a filter to a fan. I like the idea of these, but again, it’s hard to be confident they really work. There’s a few experiments out there, but not enough to make me comfortable. So I decided to do some experimenting of my own. I made a purifier, generated smoke, and measured how well it removes tiny particles.</p>



<p>If you’re in a hurry, this post says that if you strap two HEPA filters to a box fan, it will clear the air of basically all the particles we can measure, and it will do it faster than a commercial filter that costs twice as much.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/smallroom_log.jpg" alt="in a large room the DIY filter does slightly better than the commercial filter"></p>



<h3 id="diy-purifier">DIY purifier</h3>

<p>My DIY purifier was <em>very</em> simple. (I don’t want to promote any particular brands here. Contact me if you want the exact products.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>A standard box fan. (Cost: $19)</li>
  <li>Two HEPA air filters, each approximately 32 cm x 22 cm and 5cm thick. (Cost: $35 for both)</li>
  <li>A bungie cord. (Cost: Free)</li>
</ul>

<p>Assembly takes about 30s. You put the filters on the intake side of the fan and strap them on with the bungie cord. Here’s a picture:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/filter_notape.jpg" alt="DIY purifier" max-width="60%" min-width="35%"></p>

<p>Timeless elegance and grace, it is not. I get the shakes just looking at that bit of crinkled filter.</p>

<h3 id="commercial-purifier">Commercial purifier</h3>

<p>As a comparison, I got a $100 air purifier from a well-known brand that’s intended for small rooms. It uses uses a single HEPA filter that’s about 25cm x 12cm and 4cm thick. Replacement filters currently cost around $25.</p>

<h3 id="smoke">Smoke</h3>

<p>It’s surprisingly hard to repeatedly generate a consistent amount of smoke. I tried burning various things (paper, cardboard) and found that the number of particles generated can vary by an order of magnitude, depending on the burn pattern. This is difficult to control and effectively random.</p>

<p>Ideally, I’d have liked to burn some food product like oil, since the kitchen is usually the biggest source of indoor air pollution. I couldn’t figure out a good way of doing this, either: You’d need to have the same amount of oil distributed in the same way and heated to the same temperature.</p>

<p>I finally settled on using incense. I cut sticks to the length of a standard credit card and then attached the ends horizontal to the ground. This seemed to be pretty consistent. In retrospect, I bet that burning toast in a toaster would work well. (I didn’t have one on hand.)</p>

<h3 id="measurements">Measurements</h3>

<p>I borrowed a cheap-ish ($100) air quality monitor from a friend. I think it’s made by some company in China and then re-sold by various white-label brands. I can’t figure out who the original manufacturer is. Based on data I’ve seen for the reliability of other air quality monitors, I wouldn’t trust the absolute numbers, but the I think the <em>relative</em> measurements should still be OK.</p>

<p>The typical measurement for particulate pollution is “PM 2.5” which is in units of μg/m³. This is intended to measure what you’d get if you did the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take a cubic meter of air.</li>
  <li>Filter all the solid particles out of the air.</li>
  <li>Keep only the solid particles that are are 2.5 micrometers (μm) or smaller.</li>
  <li>Weigh all the particles you kept in micrograms (μg).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some ways to interpret these numbers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The EPA says yearly averages should be below 12 and daily averages below 35.</li>
  <li>The average outdoor level ranges from 6 in Finland to almost 100 in Nepal. Rich countries are typically under 15. The highest levels are typically found in Asia and Africa.</li>
  <li>Cooking can easily cause PM 2.5 measurements to spike into the hundreds. I’ve observed myself that this can happen with only a small amount of visible smoke.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="logging">Logging</h3>

<p>Since the air quality monitor doesn’t log data, I used an ultra-hacky alternative: I set the monitor next to a laptop running a stopwatch. I then aimed a tabet at both of those screens and took a timelapse video. Finally, I manually transcribed the data by going to each minute marker in the data. (This was even more tedious than it sounds.)</p>



<p>I ran a first experiment in a tiny room of around 8 ㎥. Due to worries that wind from the purifiers might change the speed the incense burned, I placed it on the opposite side of a wall, with a gap of around 20 cm near the ceiling.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/setup_tinyroom.jpg" alt="tiny room setup"></p>

<p>I repeated the experiment once with no filter, once with a commercial filter, and once with the DIY filter. Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/smallroom_linear.jpg" alt="smallroom measurements in linear space"></p>

<p>Things are a bit random around the beginning, probably due to the drifting of the smoke before it’s equalized in the room. With no filter at all, this spikes all the way to 1000 μg/m³, the maximum the instrument can show.</p>

<p>If we make the y-axis logarithmic, it becomes quite clear that the DIY filter is cleaning the air at a better rate. (This is the picture from the top of this page.)</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/smallroom_log.jpg" alt="smallroom measurements in log space"></p>

<p>If we take the EPA’s threshold of 12 μg/m³, the DIY filter gets there in around 15 minutes, while the commercial filter take around 25 minutes.</p>



<p>Thankfully, I don’t spend most of my time in an 8 ㎥ room. Thus, I repeated the experiment in a large room of around 100 ㎥. Here there was no wall between incense and purifier. Instead I left around a meter of distance between the incense and purifier and the purifier and the monitor.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/setup_largeroom.jpg" alt="large room setup"></p>

<p>Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/largeroom_linear.jpg" alt="large room measurements in linear space"></p>

<p>There’s even more randomness around the beginning, probably just due to how the smoke drifts around. Based on the room volume we’d expect a peak concentration with no filter of around 80 μg/m³ = 1000 μg/m³ * (8/100). Reassuringly, this is pretty close to what we see.</p>

<p>The DIY purifier looks a bit better. If we plot in log space, it’s more clear that it is indeed filtering at a better rate:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/largeroom_log.jpg" alt="large room measurements in log space"></p>



<p>It’s common advice for DIY purifiers like this to seal around the edges of the filter so that all air must pass through it.  I share the intuition that this would help, but it’s hard to be sure: If you block airflow, you slow down the fan. This could be counterproductive.</p>

<p>In this case at least, experiment is easier than theory. I took packing tape and carefully sealed around the intake side.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/filter_tape.jpg" alt="DIY purifier with tape" max-width="60%" min-width="35%"></p>

<p>And the results are…</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/taping.jpg" alt="taping around the filter has no effect"></p>

<p>…nothing!?</p>

<p>This was unexpected. I thought the tape would help, but I wouldn’t have been surprised if it hurt instead. Instead, there’s basically no difference at all. I don’t know enough about fluid dynamics to even speculate about what’s happening here, so I won’t try.</p>

<p>There could be some weird quirk in how I ran this experiment. This doesn’t necessarily mean that all the advice to tape around the filter is <em>wrong</em>. However, I’ve never seen any experriments that show taping helps either.</p>



<p><strong>Cost.</strong> The DIY purifier isn’t dramatically cheaper than the commercial one, but I expect the filters would need to be replaced much less often. The commercial purifier uses a single filter with an area of 300 cm², whereas the DIY purifier uses two filters with a total area of around 1400 cm², and also slightly thicker. It’s reasonable to assume the DIY filters could remove ~4 times as many particles before replacement.</p>

<p><strong>Durability.</strong> One concern is that box fans aren’t meant to be used with filters attached and could wear out. This is reasonable. However, box fans are much cheaper than commercial purifiers, and I’ve been using this particular fan with various filters attached for several years now without issue.</p>

<p><strong>Electricity.</strong> The cost of electricity is another factor. Typical box fans seem to use around 55W, whereas commercial purifiers typically use 30-45W. If electricity costs $0.13 / kWh, the box fan would cost around $62 to operate 24 hours a day for a year, while a 30-watt purifier would cost around $34. Obviously, these numbers decrease if you run the purifier less. Some (more expensive) commercial purifiers have air quality sensors built in and automatically turn on only when needed.</p>

<p><strong>MERV or HEPA?</strong> Most people who build box-fan purifiers use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_efficiency_reporting_value">MERV</a>-rated filters intended for furnaces. Commercial air purifiers use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEPA">HEPA</a>-rated filters. Roughly speaking, HEPA filters are “better” in that they are rated to remove a higher percentage of particles in one pass. It’s not clear that HEPA filter will actual perform better when attached to a fan, though: A filter that catches fewer particles in one pass might still be better if it allows for faster airflow.</p>

<p><strong>That one video.</strong> If you’re reading this article after it was linked from some forum, I’d bet you that someone in the comments links to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH5APw_SLUU">this video</a> from the Michigan Sinus Center. I found this inspirational, but note a couple of things: First, while the description says they use HEPA filter, the video clearly indicates a MERV filter. Again, that’s not necessarily bad! They claim that around 90% of particles sized 0.3 microns are larger are eliminated in a single pass. That’s good, but not totally reassuring. The question is, does it remove 99% in two passes? If 90% of the particles in the ambient air were large and the filter only catches large particles, then additional passes would never get rid of the most dangerous small particles. This is why I trust HEPA filters a bit more: since they remove almost all particles in one pass, I’m confident they should remove almost all particles eventually. This is also why I strongly prefer experiments that actually measure particles removed from the air in a room, rather than just the air coming out of the purifier.</p>

<p><strong>Further questions.</strong> There’s a lot of things that further experiments could look at:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Does the fan speed make a huge difference?</li>
  <li>How does the purifier compare to larger commercial purifiers?</li>
  <li>How do MERV-rated furnace-type filters compare under the same conditions?</li>
  <li>How can it not matter if there’s tape around the filters!?</li>
  <li>Does fan speed matter? (I always ran the box fan at maximum speed.)</li>
  <li>Is it better to put the filters on the intake or outtake side of the fan? Intuition suggests the intake …</li></ol></div></div></div></div>

<p>– <a href="https://youtu.be/O1kTTOdHgC4">745 sticky (Black Dresses Remix)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My previous post on <a href="https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/08/13/post-open-source.html">post-open source</a> appeared to resonate with a lot of people, but unsurprisingly, not much has changed since then.
Recently, the company Elastic, who makes the database Elasticsearch, changed the license on Elasticsearch from Apache to the Server-Side Public License, which (to oversimplify <a href="https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/06/13/SSPL-Not-Commons-Clause.html">the analysis of the excellent Kyle E. Mitchell</a>) is AGPL but even more so.
And unsurprisingly, as happened with Redis and MongoDB before it, everyone got mad.
When I wrote this snippet of my post-open source post, I was referring to Redis, but it's the exact same playbook that's happening again now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you made a cool database server that's under an open source license?
amazon's selling it as a service now, and they're not paying you a fuckin dime.
you want to change your license to stop them from doing that?
now the open source people are yelling at you, because when they say they're apolitical they mean they support the status quo.
and the free software people are also yelling at you, because you didn't do it their way with their license, you did it a different way with a different license, and that goes against amazon's freedom to screw you over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we're back here again.
Open source ideology leads to intra-corporate exploitation, the exploitees want to get out from under the exploiters, everyone gets mad that the status quo has been upset, and Amazon forks the last permissively-licensed version of the software and laughs all the way to the bank.
The only way for Elastic to win would've been to have licensed Elasticsearch under something restrictive like the SSPL from day one.</p>
<p>But since they didn't, we get shit like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capitalism concerns itself with making monopolies — FOSS instead concerns itself with the socialized creation of software wealth.</p>
<p>– some jackass who loves being wrong on the internet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FOSS is not socialist. The free software movement is <a href="https://lipu.dgold.eu/original-sin.html">right-libertarian / "anarcho"-capitalist</a>, and the open source movement is neoliberal; neither of these is even particularly close to socialism.
If you want a software ideology that is actually opposed to capitalism, instead of sucking up to capital, you might be looking for <a href="https://anticapitalist.software/">the Anti-Capitalist Software License</a>.
It's good, it links to my previous writing on post-open source (and the Fuck Around and Find Out License), and the FSF hate it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Anti-Capitalist Software License is a nonfree license because it extends the four freedoms only to some kinds of organizations, not to all.
Such a restriction in a software license, in the name of any cause whatsoever, imposes too much power over users.
Please don't use this license, and we urge you to avoid any software that has been released under it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's not to love!
As an author of some software released under the Anti-Capitalist Software License, I also urge people who take the FSF seriously to avoid my software which has been released under the ACSL.
And my software released under any other license.
And just me in general.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Richard M. Stallman (the "M" stands for "Making female students extremely uncomfortable <a href="https://selamjie.medium.com/remove-richard-stallman-appendix-a-a7e41e784f88">for 30 years</a>") has done some handwringing about the vital importance of Freedom 0's "for any purpose" that we can make fun of.
Essentially, his points are</p>
<ul>
<li>enforcement against governments or big corporations is impossible because they can just make excuses and dodge jurisdiction and accountability</li>
<li>for small stuff, ethics vary, so if we accept a thousand orthogonal usage restrictions ("only this music genre", "can't be used in meat processing because i'm vegan", etc) we'll have a shitshow of an ecosystem and everyone will just give up and go back to using "nonfree" software</li>
<li>who are we as developers to even tell users what they can and can't do with our software? you wouldn't buy a pen that had a "you can't use this pen to do X" on it, right? that'd be ridiculous!</li>
</ul>
<p>First, lmao, "don't bother doing this because enforcement is impossible" applies equally to copyleft and the GPL in general.
Second, if we set aside masturbatory trolling bullshit like Bruce Perens's "Vaccine License", nobody makes licenses that are that narrowly tailored to one specific thing - and even the Vaccine License is still a world away from a hypothetical Country Music Only License or Vegan Software License or what have you.
This is a textbook slippery slope argument, and if you think "you can't use this software to violate human rights" is anywhere near "you can't use this software to listen to BTS" then fuck all of the way off.
(Although, one time I mentioned on IRC that I was throwing a simple script together in Python, and someone said "Hopefully it's Python 2, but if not I'll just rewrite it in Python 2", so I threw together the <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~boringcactus/gotbruh/tree/main/item/LICENSE.md">Why The Fuck Would You Even Do That Holy Shit Public License</a> to prohibit exactly that.)
Third, god <em>damn</em> libertarians hate when anyone tells them that some actions are bad.
If I was going to buy a pen, and I saw that it had a "hey, don't use this pen to violate human rights" sticker on it, I would go "fair enough I guess" and just buy the damn pen.</p>
<p>The libertarian position here is that toolmakers should have no say in how those tools are used, and the only way they should control what can be done with their tools is by directly adding or removing capabilities from the tools.
Unsurprisingly, the libertarian position here is bullshit.
A tool is not a morally neutral thing, and toolsmithing is not an act which must by necessity end when the tool leaves the smith's hands.</p>
<p>Let me now list some of the ethical principles from the <a href="https://ethics.acm.org/">ACM Code of Ethics</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A computing professional should...</p>
<ol>
<li>Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.</li>
<li>Avoid harm.</li>
<li>Be honest and trustworthy.</li>
<li>Be fair and take action not to discriminate.</li>
<li>Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Points 1 and 2 are broadly aligned with the idea that software should be used for good, and point 5 suggests that authors should be compensated for their work.
As such, ethical restrictions in software licenses are perfectly compatible with this code of ethics, as are restrictions on commercial use.
It is possible to go even further than this, and I think I will, because I'm in the mood to start some fights:</p>
<p>In my view, <strong>it conflicts with the ACM Code of Ethics to release software under a license which permits ethical misconduct and economic exploitation.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/on_prem_to_cloud_header.png" width="100%" alt="teleport-cloud-design"></p>

<p>It seems like nowadays, every company is a SaaS company. We’ve even begun stratifying by what is sold, replacing the “software” in SaaS to whatever the product’s core competency is, <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">search-as-a-service</a>, <a href="https://sendbird.com/">chat-as-a-service</a>, <a href="https://corp.kaltura.com/">video-as-a-service</a>. So, when we, at <a href="https://goteleport.com/">Teleport</a>, set sail for the cloud after years of successfully navigating on-prem software, we came in with a different set of experiences.</p>

<p>Turns out, porting a tool designed to be self-hosted to something hosted isn’t as simple as pulling our build image from quay.io. Well, in a way it is, but what I mean is that the SaaS route poses a different series of design challenges than on-prem. The product is the same, but not how users interface with it. This post explores how we deployed <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/teleport-cloud/">Teleport Cloud</a> on Kubernetes, deliberately designing for maximizing security, minimizing resource consumption, and self-service.</p>

<h2 id="teleport-cloud-terminology">Teleport Cloud Terminology</h2>

<p>To follow along with Teleport-specific concepts and terms, we need to cover the basics.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/how_teleport_works_detailed_updated.png" width="100%" alt="simplified-teleport-architecture"></p>

<p>Figure 1: How Teleport Works</p>

<p>At its core, Teleport Unified Access Plane enables engineers to quickly access any computing resource anywhere.</p>

<ul>
<li>Teleport terminology includes:

<ul>
<li>Resource - Server, database, web app, or Kubernetes cluster</li>
<li>Client - Users and machines processes attempting to access resources</li>
<li>Proxy Service - Stands between users and resource</li>
<li>Auth Service - Responsible for issuing and authenticating certificates</li>
<li>Node Service - Daemon running on resource(s)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Client initiates connection to resources through the proxy service, either presenting a short-lived certificate or requesting one from the auth server</li>
<li>Auth service authenticates the digital signature on the certificate</li>
<li>Proxy service grants access resources behind it</li>
<li>Node service queries auth service API to check permissions described in the certificate</li>
<li>User has obtained role based access to the resource</li>
</ul>

<p>For all the <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/microservices-containers-kubernetes/">standard reasons</a>, we deployed Teleport Cloud as a Kubernetes cluster on AWS. Each customer is given their own Kubernetes namespace to isolate resources like pods, deployments and supporting services like load balancers, S3 buckets, and databases. Taken together, each customer has their own tenant within the Kubernetes cluster. Teleport Cloud is currently in a private beta, but is <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/preview/upcoming-releases/">slated for GA</a> on March 1st.</p>

<h2 id="self-service">Self-Service</h2>

<p>Our core design principle was to make it convenient for developers to use Teleport Cloud. Many of us use Teleport and other software in our home labs. We don’t want to have strings attached to play with new software. To meet this design principle, we had to remove ourselves entirely from the equation, leaving behind a functional closed system. We landed on introducing two new components between Teleport and Teleport Cloud, a single billing-service and single custom Kubernetes operator.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/teleport_deployment.png" width="100%" alt="cloud-components"></p>

<p>Figure 2: Teleport Deployment</p>

<p>The billing-service is a Go app complete with its own council of microservices and APIs to manage customer account information - think billing and subscription. When customers fill out the sign-up form and describe their tenants, the information gets propagated to the billing-service. Using a built in Kubernetes client, the billing-service creates a custom resource <code>kind: Tenant</code>.</p>

<p>The tenant-operator is a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-controllers">custom controller</a>, built using the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder">kubebuilder</a> framework. It extends the Kubernetes API to manage stateful operations - in this case, on AWS. Whenever a new state change is made to a <code>Tenant</code> resource in a cluster (like creating a new tenant), the tenant-operator responds by provisioning compute infrastructure to match the expected state. The Teleport instance itself communicates to the billing-service to report usage. Through an API in the billing-service, customers can review their usage and make changes to resource consumption as necessary, starting the loop all over again.</p>

<p>In the darkest timeline, we would take the place of the billing-service, forcing some contrived interaction. But with the billing-service, customers are mostly able to interact with their deployment without us.</p>

<h2 id="idle-resource-consumption">Idle Resource Consumption</h2>

<p>Just like every cloud-hosted offering in existence, Teleport Cloud needed to be lean, balancing a fine line between cost and availability. We had powerful tools at our disposal by deploying on Kubernetes, letting us monitor CPU usage and dynamically scale in real time. Problem is, we needed time to collect and draw conclusions from the data… But what do we do until then?</p>

<p>Figuring out how to allocate processing power was a bit of a guessing game for us. With our on-prem version, we never sent any data from Teleport back to us, obfuscating patterns in user behavior. We only had partial answers to questions like, “What’s the difference between a deployment of 5 Teleport proxies vs. 50 vs. 500?” and “How does usage change when Teleport is used for server access and Kubernetes access?” Having this information would give us some confidence in efficiently provisioning server resources to new sign-ups based on descriptive inputs, like number of users, resource type, region, and a dozen other details.</p>

<p>In time, we would collect this data. Not that it would be difficult. Running Prometheus to monitor our Kubernetes cluster lets us gather system data on containers, pods, and nodes. Once aggregated across resource consumption, requests, and limits, we could answer questions that we were previously in the dark about. Not to mention the basic promise of Kubernetes with horizontal and vertical autoscaling.</p>

<p>But we’re skipping a step here, attempting to run without learning to walk. Right now these metrics mean very little to us; the sample size is too small. Instead, we had to create a default state for creating new tenants. We needed a naive allocation policy. To this end, we had only one data point to work with, the cost of an idle Teleport instance, between the proxy and auth server, is roughly  50 millicores. Packing a core for 20 tenants would max out capacity, assuming no user activity. (This number goes down as more proxy/auth servers are added to a tenant, increasing idle consumption.) To account for activity, we used a 1:4 ratio of dedicated resources to pooled resources to be shared between tenants. In other words, we reserve 75% of CPU for bursts forcing the Kubernetes scheduler to only allocate ¼ of available compute. As new tenants are created, nodes are packed tighter and tighter until idle consumption reaches 25%. At this point, we manually provision a fresh CPU to begin packing, though at some point we’ll introduce an autoscaler to do the part.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/allocated_cpu_cores.png" width="100%" alt="millicores-tenants-graph"></p>

<p>Figure 3: Allocated CPU Cores</p>

<p>This ratio of 1:4 is somewhat the result of guesswork. After all, we made this approximation exactly because we haven’t had time to gather data. But as we learn how server resources are actually used by customers, we can tune their configuration and start to shrink that 75% down to something more reasonable.</p>

<h2 id="authentication-and-authorization">Authentication and Authorization</h2>

<p>It took us five years to join our peers in the cloud because cloud did not provide the security and privacy that necessitated a product like Teleport in the first place. Most of our early customers were uncomfortable letting Teleport call home, let alone exposing their bare-metal production environments to a public endpoint. As we grew, we began to be approached by companies without these limitations, but being a component of critical infrastructure still required strict security standards. Over the years we gained valuable experience going through dozens of vendor security reviews and compliance checks. And with that information, we designed Teleport Cloud to preempt any objections we could expect.</p>

<p>On the surface, we made sure tenants never shared resources or data. Recall each customer has their own Teleport instance and set of supporting services. All tenants are deployed on the same physical cluster, but by attributing individual namespaces to each, customers had their own dedicated virtual cluster.</p>

<p>Digging deeper, we see that the billing-service and tenant-operator have their own scope of responsibilities and permissions. For example, the tenant-operator has privileged access to databases, load balancers, and S3 buckets while the billing-service provides billing and usage information through the Teleport web UI. It follows that these components should have their own IAM policy, just like a sysadmin and QA tester have theirs. Using <a href="https://github.com/uswitch/kiam">kiam</a>, we can associate IAM roles to pods. Kiam adds a meta-data description to pods, which the agent reads as it intercepts requests to the AWS API, rejecting any that do not correspond to their IAM role. The pod below, belonging to the <code>billing_service</code> IAM role, would be prohibited from requesting database credentials from Amazon’s metadata services, something that could have saved <a href="https://goteleport.com/resources/white-papers/top-10-hacks-of-the-decade/">CapitalOne</a> a lot of trouble in their 2019 data breach.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: foo
  namespace: acme.corp
  annotations:
    iam.amazonaws.com/role: billing_service</code></pre></div>
<p>On the topic of secrets and credentials, another important security design choice was using <a href="https://github.com/external-secrets/kubernetes-external-secrets">kubernetes external secrets</a>, which extended the Kubernetes API to access external secret managers, like AWS Secret Manager or Hashicorp Vault. It’s main use case is to manage our support and sales access to customer account data. When spinning up a new database with Terraform, a random password is generated and stored as credentials in AWS Secret Manager. Using the kubernetes external secrets project to fetch credentials, they need not be stored in plaintext in the deployment file, and can be rotated and encrypted within the secret manager.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Teleport-ing to the cloud has been a dream of ours for a while, but just wasn’t viable at the time - we open-sourced Teleport back in 2016, just two years after Kubernetes was. In the four years we waited, the Kubernetes ecosystem has exploded in depth and breadth. Only recently have kiam and kubernetes external secrets become production ready. Without …</p></article></div>

This article discusses the choices and tradeoffs we made while standardizing the IAM policy format for access via SQL and shows off the potential of IAM Policy analysis when normalized.</p><br><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span>                                        </span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>  </span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span>     </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Sid"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"MustBeEncryptedInTransit"</span><span>,</span><span>   </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"s3:*"</span><span>,</span><span>                  </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Deny"</span><span>,</span><span>                      </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>                          </span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"arn:aws:s3:::vandelay-ind-bucket"</span><span>,</span><span>  </span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"arn:aws:s3:::vandelay-ind-bucket/*"</span><span> </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span>                                     </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Condition"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>   </span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"Bool"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span></p><p><span>          </span><span>"aws:SecureTransport"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"false"</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>}</span><span> </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Principal"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span> </span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span> </span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"s3:*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Condition"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"Bool"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>"aws:securetransport"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>            </span><span>"false"</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Deny"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Principal"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"AWS"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"arn:aws:s3:::vandelay-ind-bucket"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"arn:aws:s3:::vandelay-ind-bucket/*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Sid"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"MustBeEncryptedInTransit"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><br><h2 id="why-be-normal--">Why be Normal  ?</h2><p>AWS IAM policies can have multiple representations that mean the same thing. Converting to a standard, machine-readable format makes them easier to search, analyze, join with other data and to calculate differences.</p><p>When working through the normalization process for an API, we generally work with 3 forms of each response:</p><ol><li>The original <strong>source</strong> form, verbatim (or as verbatim as the API allows). This is usually a string, including whitespace, comments, etc. The value of the keeping the source format varies - it's usually important for YAML but less important for JSON, for example. </li><li>The <strong>object</strong> form - A 'usable' form where the source (which is usually a string) is transformed into an object that can be manipulated in a standard way. Such transformation may be lossy - duplicate keys may be removed, comments are typically not included, etc. For steampipe, this format is typically <code>jsonb</code>.</li><li>A <strong>standard</strong> form - A single, canonical form that objects are converted to. The <strong>source</strong> and <strong>object</strong> forms may allow multiple syntaxes to represent a single semantic meaning. In such cases, converting all of these equivalent syntaxes to a single format simplifies and optimizes searching, comparing, and analyzing the object. </li></ol><p>Note that which forms are important vary by API, object, etc. For AWS IAM policies, Steampipe currently returns the object form (in the <code>policy</code> column) and the standardized form as <code>policy_std</code>. Because the source form is JSON and it sufficiently similar to the object form, we do not currently include it. </p><p>Many of the AWS IAM policy elements in the object form may be single elements or arrays. To search these elements, you don't just need to look for values, you would need to evaluate the <strong>structure</strong> of the result as well. For example, let's says you want to search for policies that allow the <code>s3:DeleteBucket</code> action. Without the standard form, you would need to look for both cases:</p><ul><li>Where the action is a string, and has value <code>"s3:DeleteBucket"</code><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"s3:DeleteBucket"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div><br></li><li>Where the action is an array, and the array includes the value <code>"s3:DeleteBucket"</code><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"s3:CreateBucket"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"s3:DeleteBucket"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></li></ul><p>In fact, the real world situation is even more complex - The action value may be any case, the resource may also be either string or array, etc. By converting policies to a single, standardized format, Steampipe makes it easier to find what you are looking for regardless of the source format.</p><h2 id="baseline-normalization-rules">Baseline Normalization Rules</h2><p>The general guidelines for building the standard policy are:</p><ol><li>Normalize the structure. In IAM policies, many elements may optionally contain either a single item, or an array of items, in these cases <strong>convert any single item values into a single item  array</strong>.</li><li>Standardize the case. For values or keys that are case insensitive, <strong>convert to consistent case (lower case)</strong>.</li><li>Order the elements consistently. Generally, the order of array elements is not important in the IAM policy, so <strong>sort array elements alphabetically</strong> to make them easier to read and easier to to compare/diff. </li></ol><h2 id="applicability-for-each-aws-iam-policy-element">Applicability for each AWS IAM Policy Element</h2><p>The devil is in the details, and so it is worthwhile to consider each policy element individually.</p><h3 id="statement"><code>Statement</code></h3><p>A policy can contain a single <code>Statement</code> object or an array of <code>Statement</code> objects, thus the following are equivalent:</p><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"s3:PutObject"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"s3:PutObject"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>The standard form will always convert the <code>Statement</code> to the array format.</p><h3 id="action-and-notaction"><code>Action</code> and <code>NotAction</code></h3><p>Like <code>Statement</code>, a policy may represent a single <code>Action</code> as a string, or one or more actions as an array.

In the standard form, we convert all actions to <strong>lower case</strong> to simplify equivalency and matching operations. An argument could be made for camel case as well, as the documentation most frequently refers to them in camel case; however, we chose lower case because it is simple and unambiguous. This also has the benefit of avoiding stylistic choices that can arise in camel case (e.g. <code>IpAddress</code> v/s <code>IPAddress</code>).</p><p>Actions may appear in any order.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the past couple of months, we planned and implemented a move from a Slack group to a Discord server. There are many pros and cons of both platforms, and in fact, we covered them in detail, along with Discourse, in our blog post <a href="https://orbit.love/blog/slack-vs-discord-vs-discourse/">Slack vs Discord vs Discourse: The best tool for your community</a>.</p><p>But as our community grew, we began feeling the limitations of Slack as a community platform, and generally felt the need for more flexibility. That’s why we made the switch to Discord.</p><p>In this post, I’ll share our playbook for the move, along with several ideas and gotchas for anyone else considering setting up Discord for their own community.</p><h2>Early results</h2><p>As of this writing, the total number of members in Discord is smaller than the user count in Slack, but it’s catching up fast.</p><p>In that sense, we did take a short-term hit in terms of the gross user count. But as you know, not all user accounts represent actual engaged humans, so we’ve paid closer attention to the frequency and quality of conversation on the new platform, more than the simple total count of members.</p><p>Since the migration, we’ve received positive feedback form the community, and our community activity overall has increased, with more conversations happening across more channels.</p><p>In sum, the move has proven a success on all accounts, and I’m glad we made the move now rather than in the future.</p><p>Alright, how did we do it?</p><p><strong>Here’s the TLDR on our process</strong></p><ul><li>Invite community input and buy-in before making any moves</li><li>Design your Discord server well before migration day</li><li>Create incentives for early adopters</li><li>Phase the rollout</li><li>Bootstrap the initial interactions</li></ul><p>Before digging into the specifics of each step, let’s look at a few key points that drove our decision in the first place.</p><h2>Why we migrated our community from Slack to Discord</h2><p>There were several reasons, from tactical issues related to message history, to higher level concepts, like wanting more flexibility as the community grows.</p><h3><strong>No message limits</strong></h3><p>Most communities, including ours, are on Slack’s Free plan, which only allows you to see and search for the 10,000 most recent messages. More specifically:</p><blockquote>Members can send unlimited messages in Slack, but only the most recent 10,000 can be searched and viewed in your workspace. (<a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/115002422943-Message-file-and-app-limits-on-the-free-version-of-Slack#:~:text=Message%20visibility%20limit,your%20direct%20messages%20when%20searching.">source</a>)</blockquote><p>10k may sound like a lot, but by the time your community hits 250–300 members, you’ll blow right past the limit. We certainly did.</p><p>Discord enforces no such messaging limit, which means we don’t have to worry about losing context and conversations as the community grows.</p><h3><strong>Easy voice chat and screen share</strong></h3><p>In addition to the usual chat channels, Discord offers voice channels, which can be used for everything from casual chats to support to live discussions. These rooms also offer one-click video and screen sharing, making impromptu conversations fast and easy.</p><h3><strong>Moderation tools</strong></h3><p>As the community grows, moderation and permissions will become more important. Discord offers better capabilities along these lines.</p><h3><strong>More flexibility for everyone</strong></h3><p>Discord offers more options for channels and groups, allowing for a fine-grain architecture of channels. For example, we’ll be able to spin-up private chat and voice channels for customers inside of the server, while creating standalone public channels for events and more.</p><h2>Our playbook from migrating from Slack to Discord</h2><p>If you decide to make the move, here are my recommendations for planning and implementing the migration.</p><h3>Secure community buy-in</h3><p>As we thought about switching to a new platform, it was important for us to get community input and buy-in. After all, our members had been sharing ideas with each other and getting support in the Slack group for months.</p><p>And ultimately, there are way more community members than there are Orbit team members, so we didn’t want to just unilaterally impose the change.</p><p>Most agree that transparency should be a core value of any community, and this seemed like a great way to put that idea into action.</p><p>To do that, we drafted a proposal outlining our rationale, and left the Google Doc open to comment, so folks were able to add questions and ideas right in the doc. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PFHhZyyYmiIHNufYpS6fX7gUMEJVo3FM0Y0RZa7DuDo/edit?usp=sharing">Check out the proposal (now read-only) here ››</a></p><p>We then shared a post in the existing channel giving folks a heads-up.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/3c43a7f63c2ba85cc4393525b0a25be1de2584fd-1999x796.png" alt="Announcement in Slack" title="Announcement in Slack"></p><p>The comments were generally positive, with some asking questions about longevity and discoverability of discussions.</p><p>While we worked to secure community buy-in, we also got to work setting up our Discord server.</p><h3>Configure the Discord server for your needs</h3><p>Discord offers loads of flexibility for configuring your server, but with power comes complexity. In other words, there are lots of ways to fine-tune your server, but more thought and effort is required versus spinning-up a Slack instance.</p><p>By the way, in Discord world, <strong>"server" is just Discord's word for "workspace."</strong></p><p>To help us wrangle the moving parts of our server, we worked with <a href="https://twitter.com/domitriusclark/">Domitrius Clark</a>, who’s helped set up Discord servers for communities like Apollo GraphQL, Black Tech Pipeline, Open Sauced, Streaming in Color, and Rebuild Black Business, and for events like GraphQL Summit.</p><p>Working with Dom gave our team a <em>huge</em> head-start.</p><p>There are many things to keep in mind with your server setup, and the specifics probably warrant a separate post.</p><p>That said, let’s go into the weeds a bit on these points, since a broad understanding here will provide helpful context for the rest of the post.</p><p><strong>Roles basics</strong></p><p><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/214836687-Role-Management-101">Read the Discord docs on Roles ››</a></p><p>On a Discord server, permissions are associated with roles. A member can have multiple roles, affording them different abilities to do things like send messages, create channels, use voice and video, invite other members, and more.</p><p>Practically, here are few things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Roles are visible on member profiles, and, optionally, in the sidebar.</li><li>Channel permissions are associated with roles as well.</li><li>Roles are created and assigned manually.</li></ul><p>Here are some of the high-level roles and permissions we created:</p><p><strong>Orbit Employee</strong></p><p>This role is reserved for members of the Orbit team. With this role, all community members know immediately who actually works for Orbit.</p><p>From a safety perspective, this means it’s impossible for a nefarious actor to impersonate us. More often, though, it just means folks know who to turn to for help.</p><p>You can also configure roles to allow anyone to @mention everyone with that role. This is another quick and easy way to get the attention of all users with a certain Role.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/a664ea022409219c9d0d41f5902e2c23dba9fac8-1282x144.png" alt="Screenshot of the @Orbit Employee role" title="The Employee role"></p><p>In addition to a special color for our usernames, Orbit team members always appear at the top of the users list:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/787c8fe6818a0a5658631f4d2523ea0588a57eb9-570x532.png" alt="Screenshot of the user's list " title="User's List "></p><p><br><strong>Beta Program</strong></p><p>We work with a small subset of the community for quick feedback and iteration on new features and ideas. To facilitate easy discussion, we created a Beta Program category with two channels.</p><p>We also created a Beta Program role, which has access to the private channels.</p><p>With an understanding of Roles, let’s talk about the next key concepts: categories and channels.</p><p><strong>Setting up Categories and Channels</strong></p><p>Like Slack, Discord lets you create public and private channels, and group them into Categories. The two types of channels are chat and voice.</p><p><strong>The interesting thing about voice channels is that they can also turn into streaming and live video channels with a click or two.</strong> This facilitates super simple meetings and screen sharing, which can be great for general hangouts or to quickly troubleshoot an issue.</p><p>At the outset, we created several public and private categories and channels.</p><p>Our Core categories include #random, #general, and #orbit-model, where folks discuss concepts about the Orbit Model. There are also two special channel types in Core.</p><p>The first is #announcements, which is a read-only channel where we share product and community updates. The second is #voice-chat, where anyone can drop-in for an impromptu conversation. This is also where we hangout on community game days.</p><p>When someone joins the server, they land in the #getting-started channel, which is read-only:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/ff5173f4f8871251e7f7d985259b384f5613cdc2-1936x542.png" alt="Screenshot of the Orbit Discord server welcome message" title="Welcome Message"></p><p>We encourage folks to say Hello in #intros. Here are a few other key categories and channels:</p><p><strong>Product &amp; Support</strong> - channels for getting help and for talking about potential features</p><p><strong>Collaboration</strong> - for sharing integrations and apps built on top of Orbit</p><p><strong>Beta Program</strong> - a private category for folks in, well, the beta program</p><p>With your channels in place, there’s one more configuration choice you probably want to consider.</p><p><strong>Configure your server as a Community Server</strong></p><p>Discord offers a special designation for community servers, which unlocks several features highly relevant for you if you’re reading this article. This setting is not enabled automatically, but easy to do in Server Settings.</p><p>The first benefit is <strong>Membership Screening</strong>, which lets you require new members to verify their email for joining, and asks them to accept your guidelines before entering. This screen is fairly customizable and lets you spell out your expectations for behavior on your server. Here’s what ours looks like:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/579265a0e3294e9273fcee7679ab3c5aa7f9e292-1730x1702.png" alt="Screenshot of the Membership Screening dialogue " title="Membership Screening"></p><p>Additionally, community servers offer a customizable <strong>welcome screen</strong>, which lets you set context and point new members in the right direction upon joining. As your community grows, you’ll add more categories and channels, so the welcome screen will help reduce any feeling of overwhelm for new users joining for the first time. Here’s ours:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/b1408cc4fada97b8c676e1f45981a70b96abfdc6-1194x1548.png" alt="Screenshot of the Orbit Discord Welcome Message" title="Welcome Message"></p><p>Alright, you now have many of the key Disord concepts in mind. Let’s return to the implementation plan.</p><h3>Create incentives for early adopters</h3><p>To kickstart the move to Discord, we planned to offer several incentives to encourage early adopters to join us on Discord.</p><p><strong>First, we created a limited-run sticker commemorating the move.</strong> To get one, members had to join the Discord by February 1. Turns out, people like stickers! Here's our space canary, commemorating the migration 👇</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/3ad93f042804b265386f46417ab5fceacb772272-2400x812.png" alt="Illustration of a canary in a space suit " title="Canary sticker"></p><p>Second, <strong>we hosted a community game day in #voice-chat,</strong> and invited community members to join us for a few rounds of <a href="http://skribbl.io/">skribbl.io</a>. I can’t imagine trying to facilitate this kind of experience without Discord; setting up a Zoom call just feels too heavy.</p><p>Finally, we worked with …</p></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Since about 2017, I've been using <a href="https://cmder.net/">Cmder</a> almost daily as my console emulator of choice. There were a few key reasons why I gravitated towards it, and why it has stuck around for so long, but few issues have now led me elsewhere.</p><h2 id="would-i-still-recommend-cmder">Would I still recommend Cmder?</h2><p>After so many years of using Cmder, I actually still recommend it to newer analysts, people who migrate computers a lot, or folks who don't have administrative rights on their work computers. For anyone who is a little more settled in their development careers though, the question gets a little more complicated. Let's dive into some of the positives and negatives that in the end led to me searching for alternatives.</p><h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3><ul><li>It had a portable version! This was especially important since I was not allowed to have admin rights on my work computer and wanted the same terminal console everywhere.</li><li>It came with git and ssh out of the box.</li><li>The default theme settings looked pretty good particularly in comparison to PowerShell or the Windows Command Prompt.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/mridgers/clink">Clink</a> and the Git aware prompt were new to me at the time and really interesting.</li></ul><h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3><p>You might be thinking this all sounds great! It has some handy features to make it feel more like Linux and required minimal configuration! What went wrong?</p><ul><li>Speed - Cmder often feels slow. Really slow. Admittedly my work computer has a terrible hybrid drive which entirely negates the otherwise powerful machine, but when Windows Update runs in the background, I can barely open Cmder or run basic commands like <code>ls</code>. While admittedly not nearly as bad, it also feels slow on my home laptop and desktop even though they both have SSDs.</li><li>Settings Menu - Cmder offers a lot of customizability, but it presents so many options that I found it difficult to find what I wanted or to discover new features. As I got more comfortable setting up my own command line and dev tools, the sensible defaults that drew me to Cmder in the first place eventually led it to be a little more frustrating later on.</li></ul><h2 id="enter-alacritty">Enter Alacritty</h2><p>Alacritty initally made waves on Hacker News back in 2017 for being a fast GPU-accelerated terminal emulator written in Rust. It was fast, but didn't have some basic features like tabs or scrollback. I initially dismissed it since it also did not have Windows support, but I came across it while searching for a Cmder replacement.</p><p>Many of the initial positives for Cmder did not matter to me any more, and Alacritty addressed the negatives too. The minimal configuration Alacritty offers is through a YAML file, but the options are all clear and there are few enough that it is easy to look them up. It feels fast, even when working with files quickly in VIM something that was especially annoying in Cmder. I needed to install Git and OpenSSH anyway for other tools, so it didn't bother me not having it built in. I finally knew enough to set up a Git aware prompt myself.</p><h3 id="configuring-alacritty">Configuring Alacritty</h3><p>By default, Alacritty looks very plain out of the box.</p><figure><img src="https://justjensen.co/content/images/2020/05/Alacritty-Base-Opening.png"><figcaption>Alacritty Defaults</figcaption></figure><p>For a full list of configuration options, see the <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/alacritty.yml">example configuration file</a>, with all options commented out. For now, creating the config file:</p><pre><code>mkdir $env:APPDATA\alacritty
nvim alacritty.yml</code></pre><p>I started out by setting up the window defaults, fixing the font, and introducing a hint of transparency.</p><pre><code>window:
  title: SuperFun🚄
  dimensions:
    columns: 100
    lines: 30

font:
  normal:
    family: 'Source Code Pro for Powerline
 
background_opacity: 0.95</code></pre><p>I also copied the <code>gruvbox_dark</code> theme colors from the <a href="https://github.com/eendroroy/alacritty-theme">Alacritty Themes GitHub page</a>, since it is the theme I use for all of my other software. </p><p>Already we have an immediate improvement (in my eyes):</p><figure><img src="https://justjensen.co/content/images/2020/05/Alacritty-after-Visual-Configuration.png"><figcaption>Alacritty with Source Code Pro, Transparency, and Gruvbox Dark</figcaption></figure><p>Next, let's introduce a few functional changes to make it easier to use on my laptop:</p><pre><code>selection:
  # When set to `true`, selected text will be copied to the primary clipboard.
  save_to_clipboard: true
  
# Updating to PowerShell 7 (added to my PATH variable as pwsh)
shell:
  program: pwsh

# Paste text with right click, instead of the default middle mouse wheel
# click
mouse_bindings:
  - { mouse: Right, action: PasteSelection }</code></pre><p>And that's it! If all you wanted was a fast terminal emulator, this is pretty much all there is to it. There is some remaining work to do though to make it look especially good and add back in a Git aware prompt.</p><h3 id="powershell-oh-my-posh-and-posh-git">Powershell, Oh-My-Posh and Posh-Git</h3><p>Since Alacritty is just a terminal emulator, it still needs a shell to run inside it. Despite a pretty good experience with Clink in Cmder, I decided it was time to try out PowerShell. Microsoft has released it on MacOS and Linux too now, and honestly, I just felt like trying something new. Furthermore, WSL does not work well on my work computer, and WSL2 is not available on it yet at all. The new Windows Terminal looked interesting, but the Windows Store at work is limited to only a couple apps approved by the IT department, of which it is not one.</p><p>To make PowerShell look a little more attractive, you can install some <a href="https://github.com/powerline/fonts">P</a><a href="https://github.com/powerline/fonts">owerline fonts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh">Oh-My-Posh</a>, a prompt theming engine for PowerShell (it was designed for ConEmu intially, but it works on Alacritty too).</p><pre><code>Install-Module posh-git -Scope CurrentUser
Install-Module oh-my-posh -Scope CurrentUser</code></pre><p>Then, if you add the four lines below to your PowerShell profile, it will auto-import everything as soon as you open Alacritty. Rather than finding the profile file, you can just <code>nvim $PROFILE</code> instead.</p><pre><code>Import-Module posh-git
Import-Module oh-my-posh
Set-Theme Agnoster
$DefaultUser = $Env:UserName # Hide the username, since I only use one account</code></pre><p>I didn't seem to need it, but if you are running the PowerShell Core, you will apparently need this too:</p><pre><code>Install-Module -Name PSReadLine -AllowPrerelease -Scope CurrentUser -Force -SkipPublisherCheck</code></pre><p>So what does this all this work actually result in?</p><figure><img src="https://justjensen.co/content/images/2020/05/Alacritty-with-Oh-My-Posh.png"><figcaption>Alacritty with Oh-My-Posh</figcaption></figure><p>I think it looks good! And more importantly, it is faster to load than Cmder (even with Anaconda and Oh-My-Posh), more responsive, and styled to my own preferences. Hopefully this inspired you to switch up your setup too!</p><p>P.S. You might need to initialize Anaconda in Powershell for environments to work correctly:</p><pre><code>conda init powershell</code></pre><p>Note that this will slow down your PowerShell boot time significantly (about 1.5 seconds for me on Powershell v7.0.1 on my laptop SSD). I have not figured out how to only load it when I run <code>activate base</code> unfortunately.</p>

<h2> Command Line Programs for the Blind </h2>
<h4> by Karl Dahlke </h4>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

Word processors, Internet browsers, and email clients typically present information in two dimensions,
spreading text and icons across the screen.
This interface is remarkably efficient
thanks to the parallel processing capabilities of the retina and the visual cortex.
In fact this screen to brain interface is so efficient,
there is no need to count the bits as they fly by.
Amateur webmasters and professional software developers
routinely exploit this high band width channel, which is almost "too cheap to meter".
Web pages often present reams of irrelevant information
in the form of extraneous links and rarely used buttons and icons.
Carefully crafted applications are a little more organized,
but they still employ toolbars and widgits that clutter the screen.
This ancillary data is quickly tossed aside as your eyes focus on the item of interest.
However, a blind user cannot assimilate this data at a glance, and separate the wheat from the chaff.
He is forced to read every word on the page, using a voice synthesizer or braille display.
These adapters are imperfect at best,
as they ratchet the flow of information down to an agonizing crawl.
By analogy, a high speed cable modem has been replaced with a dial-up connection,
turning a rich multimedia experience into an exercise in frustration and futility.
Is there a practical alternative?
I believe there is, but certain critical applications must be rewritten from the ground up.
To this end, I have developed a combination editor/browser called edbrowse, which is 100% text based.
Output is measured and conserved like a precious commodity
as it passes through the narrow channel of speech or braille.
Edbrowse gives the blind user exactly what he asks for, no more and no less.
Sighted users also find its unique features helpful in certain situations, which will be described below.
This open source program is in the
<a href="http://edbrowse.org/">
public domain</a>,
and is bundled in several Linux distributions.
An early perl version (with limited functionality) runs on virtually any computer.

<p>
This has implications for software development in general.
When a program or utility is "web based",
i.e. accessible through a browser,
with some common sense restrictions on the underlying html and javascript,
it is easily adapted to a wide range of disabilities.
Each user employs the browser that caters to his particular needs and preferences.
The interface is automatically tailored to the individual -
no additional programming required.
The semantics of the data, and its representation on the screen, or in speech,
or on a braille display, have been neatly separated.
Of course this approach doesn't work for all applications,
(a blind user isn't going to play Flight Simulator),
but it can be employed in many situations.
Even a toolkit, such as Microsoft VB, might be enhanced
to create interactive web pages, instead of using the screen and the mouse.
If this project proves feasible,
a wide variety of common VB applications will become accessible over night.
The key is the accessible client, in this case a command line browser,
combined with a suite of streaming applications
that use these adapted clients as front end programs.

</p><p>
The benefits of this approach are not limited to the totally blind.
A color-blind individual might use his browser to change the color of the background,
text, headings, and hyperlinks to improve the contrast,
while A user with low vision might increase the font size.
Disabled users,
and folks who simply prefer their text in a particular font,
are hoping for a software revolution
that sequesters functionality within the application,
and leaves the details of the interface unspecified,
to be determined by the wants and needs of the individual.

</p><h3> The Early Human-Machine Interface </h3>

Today's computer professionals, with laptops in hand, can hardly imagine the awkward interfaces that prior generations had to endure.
When I was a freshman at Michigan State University,
I learned how to use a key punch machine and a card reader;
that was how you "talked" to the computer.
Each punch card represented one line of text,
and a stack of several thousand cards might hold the source code for your master's project.
There was no file server on campus;
you kept your box of cards with you at all times.
And if you ever dropped your box of cards in the snow
while walking from the dorm to the computer center in January,
you were in a world of hurt.
Even an accidental spill from table to floor was cause for consternation,
as you carefully put your cards back in order.
Apparently this scenario was not uncommon,
prompting more than a few students to place sequence numbers on their cards
in the rightmost columns -
columns that were ignored by the computer.
Some people left gaps in these numbers, e.g. counting by tens,
so that additional lines of code could be inserted as necessary.
My roommate, who did not bother to number his cards, always carried them in a sealed cardboard box.
This led to more than a few jokes on my part.
"Quit singing in the shower at 6 A.M., or i'll scatter your box of cards all over the floor."

<p>
Once a student arrived safely at the computer center with cards in hand,
he might make some last minute corrections to his stack,
then feed the cards, at a rate of ten per second, through the card reader.
This created a "batch job", which resulted in a printout some 20 minutes later.
Wait times were highly variable, depending on load,
which is why many students worked at night.
Having placed the cards carefully back in his box,
our weary student anxiously waits for the results of his labors.
Did the program compile?
Did it run?
Was there an error in logic?
Can he turn his printout in for a grade, or is there more work to do?
If anything has to be changed, he goes back to the punch machine,
hammers out new cards, slides them into position,
and walks back to the card reader for another run.
The smallest typo represents another hour's work.
It was not unusual to see bleary-eyed students stumbling back into the dorm at 2 or 3 in the morning,
card box under one arm and a stack of printouts under the other.

</p><p>
Imagine my joy when the University installed interactive teletypes!
These look like electric typewriters, but the keystrokes are transmitted directly to the central computer.
When you hit return, the computer responds, then waits for your next command.
The interface had become a dialog,
which clipped along at 110 bits per second, or 300 bits per second if you glommed onto one of the newer teletypes.
The paper retained a written transcript of the entire session;
your commands and the computer's responses.
These machines are all but forgotten, except for the vestigial letters tty, which are an abbreviation for teletype.
The software that facilitates communication between you and your computer, through the keyboard and screen,
is still called a tty today.
Type `tty' into any Unix or Linux computer, and it will tell you which tty driver you are using,
e.g. /dev/tty1 on console 1.
A large Unix machine can have hundreds of tty drivers, supporting hundreds of simultaneous users.

</p><p>
The clatter of the teletype was an annoyance for most, but it was a blessing for me.
I knew when the computer had responded, and the nature of that response.
If a volunteer reader was not available, and the homework assignment was modest,
I could log onto the system,
type my program into the editor,
compile the program,
and run the executable,
based solely on the clicks of the teletype.
After my roommate read through the printout and verified the results,
I tucked it away in my notebook and turned it in the next day for a grade.
Although I now have a speech synthesizer at hand,
I still miss the audio feedback that was an unintentional feature of the mechanical teletype.
To this end, I modified the Linux tty driver to create similar sounds using the PC speaker.
When the computer sends text to the screen, soft clicking sounds accompany the nonspace characters,
while a longer swoop indicates a new line,
as though the print head was swinging back to the left.
These modules are available from the drivers directory in the following project.

</p><p>
git clone https://github.com/eklhad/acsint

</p><p>
The chirps and clicks are subtle, and are easily ignored by those around me;
yet they form an important part of my audio interface.
Like the systems of yesteryear,
my tty tells me when the computer has responded to my commands,
and the quantity and format of that response,
even before my synthesizer has spoken a word.

</p><p>
This project also contains a linear speech adapter, the only one of its kind.
Like the paper teletype, this adapter retains a log of all tty output,
and allows the user to review that log,
reading the entered commands and the computers responses.
All other adapters,
whether on MS-dos, Windows, Mac-OS, or Linux,
read the words or icons on the screen.
My adapter can read screen memory as well, but it typically runs in linear mode, which is optimal for the command line interface.
This adapter, and various applications such as edbrowse, all work together to present a new
(i.e. old) paradigm,
a paper teletype inside your computer.

</p><p>
Over the next few years, universities around the country
replaced their paper teletypes with cathode ray tube terminals, also known as CRTs.
Trees everywhere heaved a sigh of relief;
yet the interface was still the same.
A user types a command, and the computer responds on the next line.
The dialog continues.

</p><h3> Early Editors and Word Processors </h3>

When I began my career at AT&amp;T Bell Labs,
I learned to use the standard Unix text editor, which is simply called ed.
This is a command line program, consistent with the interface of its day.
If you want to see the seventh line in a file, type 7 and hit return.
To find the line containing the string "xyz", type /xyz/.
Lines can be changed, deleted, moved, or copied using this program,
but you only …</div>

February 11, 2021 | https://blog.repl.it/alwayson | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.repl.it/alwayson">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Today we're excited to announce that Always On repls are available to all hackers! Anyone with <a href="https://repl.it/pricing">Hacker plan</a> can choose up to 5 repls and keep them running all the time. With Always On, you can for example spin up and host an app like a Discord bot in 30 seconds:</p>

<p>As a reminder, Replit gives you most of what you need to rapidly build and ship apps in the cloud -- at lightning speed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A blazing fast <a href="https://repl.it/site/ide">online IDE</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/packages">Package Management</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://repl.it/site/hosting">hosting</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">SSL/HTTPS</a></li>
<li>Domain <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">linking</a></li>
<li>A simple and fast <a href="https://docs.repl.it/misc/database">Database for persistence</a></li>
<li>A secure way to <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/secret-keys">store secrets</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The one missing piece was a reliable way to keep your apps from going to sleep. Always On means we host your code and keep it running even if you close your Replit browser tab.</p>
<p>Prior to Always On, you might have noticed that when your repl is inactive for a little while it automatically goes to sleep. Because Replit wants to give everyone in the world the ability to code and access cloud computing, this has been a super important cost-saving mechanism and vital to the design of our infrastructure (you can read about the technical details <a href="https://blog.repl.it/killing-containers-at-scale">here</a>). As much as we'd like it to, hosting 100 million repls all the time for free just wouldn't work out. Instead we've invested in getting really fast at starting repls when they're needed and pretending like they were up the whole time. It has served us and our users well, but doesn't work in every use-case. </p>

<p>Some repls expect to be running all the time (things like cron or Discord bots), and some apps can't afford to drop some requests as the repl wakes up. As our users built increasingly ambitious apps, the need for a repl to keep running all the time has become apparent. With Always On your repl will function mostly like before, but now it won't stop running when you close the workspace.</p>
<p>Always On repls can be incredibly useful for a variety of programs and unlocks many long-requested features. The most obvious and commonly requested is for web servers to stay up. If you're tired of waiting for your webserver to wake up every time you visit, Always On is a great way to fix that. But Always On isn't just for web repls, regular old repls work too! If you have a cron job you'd like to run on a schedule, Always On makes it super easy. Discord bots, Slack bots, and other chat bots with a persistent outbound connection are another great use for Always On. And if you have a workload that's taking a long time (like say scraping a site), you can Always On the repl and go one with your life.</p>
<p>Of course, it's worth noting a few limitations of Always On </p>
<ul>
<li>Your repl will be occasionally restarted as it is migrated between physical servers.</li>
<li>Changes your program makes to the filesystem won't persist, so we suggest you use <a href="https://blog.repl.it/database">Replit Database</a> rather than, for example, writing to text files.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/database/database1.gif" alt="Database"></p>
<p>We also want to make it clear that the use of pinging services will continue to work just as before.</p>
<p>Happy coding! If you create something interesting or novel using this technology then make sure to <a href="https://repl.it/talk/ask/Share-your-Always-On-repls/120784">share it with us</a>.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h2>
<p>Oh one more thing. right now replit doesn't differentiate between dev and prod apps. We're going to fix that too, and it will be epic. Stay tuned.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Class destructors have painful <a href="#The-trouble-with-class-destructors">limitations</a> when called by the GC.
</p>
<p>But there is a way to make a class holding a resource that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>works with scoped ownership (<code>std.typecons.RefCounted</code>, <code>std.typecons.Unique</code>, <code>std.typecons.Scoped</code>)
</li>
<li>works with manual release (<code>object.destroy</code>)
</li>
<li>warns when the GC call the destructor and then release the resource, which is <em>coincidental correctness</em> and dangerous to rely on.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The general idea behind the <strong>GC-proof resource class</strong> is to check why the destructor was called and act accordingly.
</p>
<pre><code>class MyGCProofResource
{
    void* handle;

    this()
    {
        // acquire resource
        handle = create_handle();
    }

    ~this()
    {
        // Important bit.
        // Here we verify that the GC isn't responsible
        // for releasing the resource, which is dangerous.
        import core.memory;
        assert(!GC.inFinalizer, "Error: clean-up of MyGCProofResource incorrectly" ~
                                " depends on destructors called by the GC");

        // release resource
        free_handle(handle);
    }
}
</code></pre><p>You'll get a clear message whenever you rely on the GC to release resources.
</p>
<p>This idiom was first introduced in the <a href="https://github.com/d-gamedev-team/gfm">GFM</a> library.
</p>
</div><div><p><a href="#Don't-use-@property">Link
</a></p>
<p>The current agreement on best practices with regards to <code>@property</code> is to <strong>not use it.</strong>
</p>
<p><code>@property</code> does very little and you can always avoid it.
</p>
</div><div><p><a href="#Parallel-foreach">Link
</a></p>
<p>This performs a parallel loop with a default task pool.
</p>
<pre><code>import core.atomic;
import std.parallelism;
import std.range;

void main()
{
    shared(int) A = 0;
    foreach(n; iota(2000).parallel)
    {
        atomicOp!"+="(A, 1);
    }
    assert(A == 2000);
}
</code></pre></div><div><p><a href="#Unittests-with-optimizations-:-the-Final-Frontier">Link
</a></p>
<p>DUB is an essential piece of the modern D language experience. <strong>However,</strong> that experience doesn't include <em>"Running unit tests with optimizations"</em> by default.
</p>
<p>So, how do you avoid surprises in production? What would Kent Beck do?
</p>
<p><strong>In this post, we unleash the jaleously-guarded secret behind the most successful organizations in the world: running unittests with optimizations ON and OFF.</strong> 
</p>
<h2 id="changes-to-dub-json"> Changes to <code>dub.json</code></h2>
<p>Create a new build type with the proper flags. This is also a good way to get to know the discreet <code>"buildTypes"</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>"buildTypes": 
{
    "unittest-opt": 
    {
        "buildOptions": ["unittests", "optimize", "inline"]
    }
}
</code></pre><p><strong>Because it doesn't have a</strong> <code>-release</code> <strong>flag</strong>, <a href="#So-what-does--release-do,-exactly?">asserts will still be enabled</a>. Hence, the <code>unittest</code> content is here.
</p>
<p>(Please, don't call this configuration <code>unittest-release</code>. Because flag <code>-release</code> not being there is the one important thing. This increase the confusion between "release" and "optimizations").
</p>
<h2 id="run-both-versions"> Run both versions</h2>
<pre><code>$ dub test 
$ dub test -b unittest-opt
</code></pre><p>You are now listed in Forbes.
</p>
</div><div><p><a href="#One-does-not-simply-call-new-for-static-arrays">Link
</a></p>
<p>It just happens that in D you can't use <code>new</code> to get a pointer to a newly allocated static array.
</p>
<pre><code>void main()
{
    alias T = int[4];

    // This line does not compile!
    // Error: new can only create structs, dynamic arrays or class objects, not int[4]'s
    auto t = new T; 
}
</code></pre><p><em>"You can only call new with structs, dynamic arrays, and class objects"</em> says the compiler.
</p>
<p><strong>Unrelated:</strong> actually the compiler is lying a bit, since it is possible to allocate a single (builtin type) value on the heap:
</p>
<pre><code>void main()
{
    int* p = new int;  // Works
}
</code></pre><p>But this can't be with static arrays, despite them being <a href="#Static-arrays-are-value-types">value types</a>. Doesn't that sound like an inconsistency? Something that would have to be <strong>explained.</strong>
</p>
<h2 id="why"> Why?</h2>
<p>The reasoning for <code>new</code> and static arrays was probably that you rarely really want to allocate a static array on the heap; it could just as well be a slice.
</p>
<p><strong>So there is no syntax to do this</strong>.<br>When you do write <code>new int[4]</code> this will instead return an <code>int[]</code> <em>slice</em> with a length of 4, which adds the benefits of holding a length.
</p>
<pre><code>writeln(typeof(new int[4]).stringof); // output: "int[]"

auto arr = new int[4];
writeln(arr.length); // output: "4"
arr ~= 42;
writeln(arr.length); // output: "5"
</code></pre><p>So far, so good. 
</p>
<p><a href="#Type-qualifiers-and-slices-creation">It gets weirder</a> whenever <code>shared</code>, <code>const</code> and <code>immutable</code> get introduced...
</p>
<h2 id="do-it-anyway"> Do it anyway</h2>
<p>If for some reason you really need a <em>static</em> array allocated on the heap instead of a slice, you can do it anyway by using <code>std.experimental.allocator</code> (or its DUB equivalent <a href="https://code.dlang.org/packages/stdx-allocator">stdx-allocator</a>):
</p>
<pre><code>import std.experimental.allocator;

void main()
{
    alias T = int[4];

 // T* t = new T;                 // Won't work.
    T* t = theAllocator.make!T;   // Fine!
    assert((*t).length == 4);     // Safe too.

    (*t)[1] = 42;                 // Needs pointer dereference and parentheses before use.
    assert(*t == [0, 42, 0, 0]);  // Features default initialization.
    
 // (*t) ~= 43; // Error: cannot append type int to type int[4]

</div><div><p><a href="#Voldemort-types">Link
</a></p>
<p>A <em>Voldemort type</em> is simply a type that can't be named by the user.
</p>
<h2 id="an-example-from-ae-utils-graphics"> An example from <code>ae.utils.graphics</code>:</h2>
<pre><code>template procedural(alias formula)
{
    alias fun = binaryFun!(formula, "x", "y");
    alias Color = typeof(fun(0, 0));

    // Returning auto is necessary here.
    // Procedural can't be named outside of the procedural function.
    auto procedural()
    {
        struct Procedural
        {
            auto ref Color opIndex(int x, int y)
            {
                return fun(x, y);
            }
        }
        return Procedural();
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Outside of the <code>procedural</code> function of this <a href="#Eponymous-templates">eponymous template</a>, there is no way to name <code>Procedural</code>. Therefore, <strong>Voldemort types can only be passed around in auto variables or auto returns.</strong>
</p>
<h2 id="why"> Why?</h2>
<p>Hiding information about types. Because the user can't name or instantiate Voldemort types at will, expressions in a Voldemort lazy computation chain can change types without changing user code.
</p>
<p>Voldemort types were promoted and named by Andrei Alexandrescu. They are typically used in chains of lazy computations, like ranges.
</p>

</p>
</div><div><p><a href="#Type-qualifiers-and-slices-creation">Link
</a></p>
<p>When a slice is created with <code>new</code> and a type qualifier, the qualifier applies to <em>pointed elements</em> <br>instead of the whole slice as would be expected.
</p>
<pre><code>import std.stdio;

void main(string[] args)
{
    // Output: "const(int)[]"
    writeln(typeof(new const(int[4])).stringof);
    
    // Output: "immutable(int)[]"
    writeln(typeof(new immutable(int[4])).stringof);
    
    // Output: "shared(int)[]"
    writeln(typeof(new shared(int[4])).stringof);
}
</code></pre><p><strong>Note:</strong> this syntax <a href="#One-does-not-simply-call-new-for-static-arrays">doesn't return pointers to static arrays</a> but indeed return a slice.
</p>
<p><em>This peculiarity was emphasized at DConf 2018 by Andrei Alexandrescu.</em>
</p>
</div><div><p><a href="#Static-arrays-are-value-types">Link
</a></p>
<p><em>(Note: on this whole website, with "static arrays" we mean fixed-size arrays, not arrays declared with</em> <code>static</code><em>).</em>
</p>
<p>It's important to note that D static arrays are value types.
</p>
<pre><code>void addFour(int[16] arr)
{
    arr[] += 4;           // Only the local version is modified.
}

void main()
{
    int[16] a;
    addFour(a);           // a is passed by value on the stack, not by pointer.
    assert(a[0] == 0);
}
</code></pre><p>That makes such declaration a trap when porting functions from C or C++.
</p>
<h2 id="static-arrays-convert-implicitely-into-slices"> Static arrays convert implicitely into slices!</h2>
<p>To pass static arrays by reference, either write a function taking a slice or use ref.
</p>
<pre><code>void addFive(ref int[16] arr)
{
    arr[] += 5;           // Caller parameter modified.
}

void addSix(int[] arr)
{
    arr[] += 6;           // Caller parameter modified.
}

void main()
{
    int[16] a;
    addFive(a);         // Works, a is passed by reference
    addSix(a);          // Works, a is converted into a slice referencing the same data
}
</code></pre><p>One of the oddities about static arrays is that <a href="#One-does-not-simply-call-new-for-static-arrays">you can't <code>new</code> them</a>.
</p>
</div><div><p><a href="#So-what-does--debug-do,-exactly?">Link
</a></p>
<p>In D compilers, the <code>-debug</code> switch does <strong>only one thing</strong>: compiling in code in <code>debug</code> clauses.
</p>
<pre><code>debug
{
    writeln("-debug was used");
}
else
{
    writeln("-debug was NOT used");   
}
</code></pre><ul>
<li><p>The <code>-debug</code> switch has <strong>nothing to do with debug information (-g)</strong> of lack thereof.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>-debug</code> switch has <strong>nothing to do with optimizations (-O)</strong> or lack thereof.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>-debug</code> switch has <strong>nothing to do with the -release switch</strong>, in fact both switches can be used at once, or none.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>There is no "debug mode" or "release mode" in D compilers</strong>, those are a DUB convention.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="debug-identifiers-who-are-they-and-what-do-they-want"> <code>debug</code> identifiers: who are they and what do they want?</h2>
<p>You can define a "debug identifier" <code>ident</code> that will be compiled in if <code>-debug=ident</code> is passed through the command-line.
</p>
<pre><code>debug(complicatedAlg)
    writeln("-debug=complicatedAlg was used"); // useful for debug logging
else
    writeln("-debug=complicatedAlg was NOT used");
</code></pre><p>That makes <code>debug</code> remarkedly similar to... <code>version</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="debug-is-indeed-strikingly-similar-to-version"> <code>debug</code> is indeed strikingly similar to <code>version</code></h2>
<p>The <strong>2 key differences</strong> between <code>-debug</code> and <code>-version</code> are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Semantic: <code>version</code> is for software features, and <code>debug</code> is to enable logging/information/statistics... about programs with no user-facing effect.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Quick printf-debugging: under a <code>debug</code> clause, …</p></li></ul></div></div></div>

While coding with Elixir and using ExUnit to write tests nowadays, I caught myself finding ways to nest RSpec "context" blocks inside each other. Let's look at a simple example: you wanted to build a chef robot to prepare dinners based on the leftover food in your fridge. Depending on what's available in your kitchen, it'll choose how to prepare the appropriate dishes.</p><h3>Nested contexts in RSpec</h3><p>This is how I would write TDD tests for this scenario in RSpec.</p></div><div><div><pre data-enlighter-language="ruby">ruby
  describe "make_dish_from_left_over" do
    context "with dishes that are served cold" do
    # before: set up cold dishes
    # ...
    # end
    context "seasoning available" do
      # before: set up seasoning
      # ...
      # end
      expect(add_seasoning).to be_truthy
    end
    context "extra protein available" do
      # before: set up extra protein
      # ...

    end
    context "microwave NOT available" do
      # before: set up stove top

      # end
      expect(warm_up_by_stove_top).to be_truthy
    end
  end
end
</pre></div></div><p>As you can imagine, if these tests are filled up and more nested contexts are added, such as microwave settings depending on size of dishes, stove top heat amount and time, etc... they will eventually become too long and too complicated to read and follow. This readability problem is then compounded for other developers who haven't worked on this area of the robot. But there's another issue in moving from Ruby to Elixir; there is no way to write nested "contexts" like this in Elixir's ExUnit — and there is a good reason for that.</p><div data-inherit-lp-settings="1" data-css="tve-u-1778e041318" tcb-template-name="Quote 05" tcb-template-id="60950" data-keep-css_id="1"><div data-css="tve-u-1778e0414c4"><div data-css="tve-u-1778e04131b"><div data-css="tve-u-1778e04131d"><div data-css="tve-u-1778e04131e"><div data-css="tve-u-1778e04131f"><div data-css="tve-u-1778e041320"><div><p><span><img alt="" data-id="60893" width="99" data-init-width="175" height="77" data-init-height="137" title="quotation_mark_afs" loading="lazy" src="https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/tcb_content_templates/images/quotation_mark_afs.png" data-src="//vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/tcb_content_templates/images/quotation_mark_afs.png" data-width="99" data-height="77" ml-d="0" data-css="tve-u-1778e041322"></span></p></div></div></div></div><p data-css="tve-u-1778e04132a">By forbidding hierarchies in favor of named setups, it is straightforward for the developer to glance at each describe block and know exactly the setup steps involved.</p></div></div></div></div><div><p>With ExUnit, what you can (and will want to) do is to use named setups.</p><h3>What are named setups?</h3><p>If you haven't come across this, it's not surprising. The documentation for named setups in ExUnit is <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/master/ExUnit.Case.html#describe/2" target="_blank">kind of buried</a> somewhere in the middle of ExUnit.Case docs. Named setups are simply configurations of tests used to put together test data for the tests that follow. Each setup is actually just a function that configures the test data and returns the variables to be used in the tests themselves. If you are familiar with writing tests in ExUnit then these configuration functions are exactly the setup blocks. For example:</p></div><div><div><pre data-enlighter-language="ruby">elixir
defp setup_cold_dishes(context) do
temp = 35
size = if context.size, do: size, else: :small
dish = set_temperature(temp)
|&gt; set_size(size)
|&gt; set_time_in_fridge(:15_hours)
|&gt; build_dish


%{temp: temp, size: size, cold_dish: dish}
end
</pre></div></div><p>Note that a <span data-css="tve-u-1778e57900e">context</span> variable is passed in this setup function so that the previous configurations can be accessed in this setup as <span data-css="tve-u-1778e57c597">context.size</span> in this case. You can also grab the <span data-css="tve-u-1778e57ea83">size</span> variable out of this <span data-css="tve-u-1778e580e83">context</span> right in the function signature like so:</p><div><div><pre data-enlighter-language="ruby">elixir
defp setup_cold_dish(%{size: size}) do
end</pre></div></div><p><h3>How do I use it in the tests?</h3></p><div><div><pre data-enlighter-language="ruby">elixir
describe "make COLD dishes from left over" do
  setup [:setup_cold_dish]
  it "", context do
    ...
  end
end
</pre></div></div><p>Let's make it even nicer by combining the condition "seasoning available":</p><div><div><pre data-enlighter-language="ruby">elixir
describe "make COLD dishes from left over when seasoning available" do
  setup [:setup_cold_dish, :set_seasoning]
  it "", context do
    assert add_seasoning
  end
end
</pre></div></div><p><h3>Passing variables to other setup functions</h3></p><p>Note that if you have multiple setup functions in sequence like this, <strong>the latter ones on the right can read the "context" variables returned by the previous ones on the left</strong>. So <span data-css="tve-u-1778e46a275">:set_seasoning</span> can actually access <span data-css="tve-u-1778e4728d6">temp</span>, <span data-css="tve-u-1778e470109">size</span> and <span data-css="tve-u-1778e474efb">cold_dish</span> variables from <span data-css="tve-u-1778e478abc">:setup_cold_dish</span>, but we just not doing anything with them in this scenario.</p><div><h4>Putting the pieces together</h4><p>Now let's write the whole thing with combined conditions!</p></div><div><div><pre data-enlighter-language="ruby">elixir
describe "make COLD dishes when seasoning available" do
  setup [:setup_cold_dish, :set_seasoning]
  it "", context do
    assert add_seasoning
  end
end

describe "make COLD dishes when extra protein available" do
  setup [:setup_cold_dish, :set_protein]
  it "", context do
    assert add_protein
  end
end

describe "make HOT dishes when microwave available" do
  setup [:setup_hot_dish, :set_microwave]
  it "", context do
    assert use_microwave
  end
end

describe "make HOT dishes when stove top available" do
  setup [:setup_hot_dish, :set_stove_top]
  it "", context do
    assert use_stove_top
  end
end
</pre></div></div><div><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The tests are now flattened, much cleaner and easier for other developers (and, of course, for me at a later time) to read and follow at a glance. And the beauty of it is that there are no more nested context/describe blocks, no more mazes but with shared setup functions and cleaner code!</p><p>Although the above example scenario is &nbsp;very simple to demonstrate the basic functionalities of named setups, I hope you can build on these ideas and apply them to your test suite when you need it.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

    <div id="post-body">
        <p>&lt;rant&gt;Two years ago I sat in on a security meeting. The subject was protecting the code and associated websites from attack.</p><p>"I'd just attack the npm packaging system, introducing subtle changes in several that would work together to do whatever I wanted."</p><p>All I got was blank stares, and this was from professionals. From <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/researcher-hacks-over-35-tech-firms-in-novel-supply-chain-attack">this week's reading</a>:</p><blockquote>Unlike <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-npm-project-steals-discord-accounts-browser-info/">traditional typosquatting attacks</a> that rely on social engineering tactics or the victim misspelling a package name, this particular supply chain attack is more sophisticated as it needed no action by the victim, who automatically received the malicious packages.<p>This is because the attack leveraged a unique design flaw of the open-source ecosystems called <strong>dependency confusion.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Even using things like Test-Driven Development, programmers can only reason about a small part of the code in front of him in the IDE. (In fact, one of the reasons TDD is so successful is because programmers have no idea at how much they suck at actually understanding what they're doing).</p><p>From a recent study:</p><figure><img src="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png" alt="" srcset="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1000w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1890w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Here's the takeaway graphic:</p><figure><img src="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg 600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg 678w"></figure><p>Note: this result is seeking out a mean, regular coders writing regular code. Your mileage may vary.</p><p>Why is this? Let's take two code samples:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>echo Hello World
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>#include &lt;cstdio&gt;

int main()
{
    printf("hello from %s!\n", "HelloWorld");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In the first example, how many symbols is the programmer manipulating to reach their goal? Only one, "echo" In the second example, how many symbols are being manipulated?</p><p>I counted seven, but I wasn't trying to be strict.</p><p>What do these seven involve? There's namespaces, libraries, standard function signatures, string substitution, OS return values, and so on.</p><p>Do any of these matter to the new C# programmer? Of course not! That's why it's called "Hello World". You're supposed to be able to type in a few symbols and start doing something useful right away.</p><p>The waters get murky very quickly after that. Let's say your boss sends you an email:</p><p>"Jenkins, add the cover sheet to all of those TPS reports"</p><p>Something goes wrong. The boss is unhappy. You two have a conversation about what you did that was mistaken.</p><p>Suppose instead you're looking at the following code:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>WorkingStack.Reports.AddSheet(cover);
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The boss is mad because it's not working right.</p><p>You can certainly go into the boss's office and have that same conversation, just this time over code instead of an email. <em>In fact, that's what you have to do</em>. Without a bunch more source code, what the hell does that C# code do, anyway? You don't know. It says it does the same thing as the boss wanted, but for all you know it's mailing off your tax returns to Russian hackers.</p><p>Most of modern programming is spent creating and consuming fake abstractions that are much more leaky and buggy than we'd like admit. In fact, it's grown far, far beyond our ability to reason about. It's magic. We spend a lot of time pretending that this isn't the case, then cursing when reality rears its ugly head again.</p><p>When I was writing <a href="https://leanpub.com/info-ops2">my second book</a>, I had to address this problem because reasoning about code and controlling complexity is the number one problem in software development today. It's the reason we have buildings full of hundreds of developers wasting a lot of time and money. Our incentives are wrong.</p><p>The best thing to look for in any professional, doctor, lawyer, coder, etc is their ability to not engage with a problem, instead solving it in a simple and non-intrusive way. The worst behavior from professionals are the folks who are going to do a lot of work no matter what. These guys look busy, and they’re deep in a bunch of technically wonky stuff that nobody understands, so naturally they look like they know what they’re doing and are doing a good job. The guy who shows up in flip-flops and after a five-minute conversation solves your problem? He’s just some smart eleck showman, probably a con man.</p><p>We don’t teach coders the one skill they need most of all: adding incremental complexity as-needed. Nobody talks about choosing what to add and why. Nobody talks about ways to understand you’ve gone too far (except for a few folks like me. Apologies for the shameless plug.)</p><p>For some odd reason, discussions on frameworks and complexity always devolve into some version of “Dang kids!” vs. “Talentless luddite!” As many people have pointed out, not only do we not teach or talk about incremental complexity, if you don’t have the appropriate buzzwords in your CV, you don’t get hired. So BigCorps naturally end up with scads of people who did well on scads of tech that somebody decide they had to use/learn but nobody very good at actually making things happen.</p><p>This can't continue, and I want to do my part in making it end. The answer I came up is something I call it <strong>Code Cognitive Load (CCL)</strong>. It's the amount of risk you take on as a programmer looking at any piece of code to manipulate it, whether coding fresh or doing maintenance on existing code.</p><ol><li>It's scoped first by method/function and then by compilation unit. There's no other scoping (namespace, class, module, etc.)</li><li>To compute, you add up four things: symbols you are required to look at to do your work, exceptions that using those symbols may throw, &nbsp;any editable code underneath that you may have to read or write for those symbols to work, and exceptions that code may throw</li></ol><p>You can see for the first Hello World example, there's only one symbol, echo, and there's only one general type of exception, and that's related to system resources. For the second example, the count easily goes into the dozens.</p><p>Why is this related to the security problem I led off with? Because if you have code you can't reason about, you don't just have a risk for bugs, it's a security risk too. The code doesn't care whether it's busy screwing up your beautiful solution or hacking your local network. You can't reason about it. Period. That's the problem. It's doing whatever it's coded to do.</p><p>Do npm packages count as "editable code underneath that I have to read or write for these symbols to work"? Sure, if you're downloading code and compiling it, you may have to edit it. It's a risk. If you're just hotlinking to a dll or something, that's different. If you're using precompiled code, whatever you've got, you've got. It may be buggy as hell and it may do nasty things that make you sad and drink by yourself late at night, but it's not a complexity issue, it's some other kind of issue, security, performance, and so on. Don't confuse them. You address and work with the problems of that precompiled library in a totally different way than you would with code you may one day have to plow through.</p><p>Code Cogntivie Load (CCL) is not a good/bad metric. It's a measure of the risk in complexity you're assuming to do whatever work you have to do. Some problems may naturally require a great deal of complexity risk. Others not so much. That's your call, not mine.</p><p>The point is that you're measuring it, instead of just ignoring it until something goes wrong. Is your solution doing mostly the same thing but your CCL is going through the roof? You're most likely doing something wrong, since your code's value is staying the same while your coding risk is dramatically increasing. </p><p>There's no way of knowing whether code is appropriately complex or not, but we can (and should) measure how much <em>complexity risk</em> we're taking on ourselves and our downstream maintenance workers.</p><p>This will change the way you code and the way you think about coding. Good. Looking at the software landscape today, things need changing.</p><p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>    </div>

                    <div><p>Operational analytics is a type of analytics that informs day-to-day decisions with the goal of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of your organization’s operations. Now, that’s a fairly boring definition for an idea that I sincerely believe has the potential to change how organizations use data. </p><p>Instead of using dashboards or reports to understand your data, operational analytics drives action by automatically delivering real-time data to the exact place it’ll be most useful, no matter where that is in your organization. </p><p>And when implemented well, this flow of real-time data (from data warehouses to people who can actually do something with that data) becomes an undercurrent of insights powering important daily decisions, both big and small.</p><p>Here’s a quick thought experiment. What if you could do the following?: &nbsp;</p></div><ul><li>Prioritize support tickets by product usage</li><li>Use sales outreach data to segment audiences for marketing email drip campaigns</li><li>Plug early churn indicators right into your customer relationship management platform</li></ul><div><p>I could go on (and I just might, if you want to <a href="https://getcensus.com/demo">hop on a call</a>), but the point is that operational analytics can make all of what I just listed happen automatically behind the scenes. When it’s time to resolve a support ticket, create an email list, or give a customer a call, team members can jump right into action without having to mess with emails, dashboards, reports, or spreadsheets.</p><p>At its core, operational analytics is about putting an organization’s data to work so everyone can make smart decisions about your business. You might’ve heard such a promise before from other technologies or platforms, but operational analytics is the <em>only</em> way to accomplish this at scale, because it introduces a set of fundamentals for leveraging data across your organization. </p><p>Put simply, if you want data-driven decision-making at scale, operational analytics is the way.</p></div><figure><img

alt="image.png"></figure><h2 id="traditional-analytics-vs-operational-analytics">Traditional Analytics vs. Operational Analytics</h2><div><p>Traditional analytics uses data to <em>understand </em>business operations, while operational analytics uses data to <em>drive </em>business operations. This difference may seem subtle at first glance, but it cuts deep into the role data plays within your company.</p><p>I’m defining traditional analytics here as the data presented viabusiness intelligence (BI) dashboards and static reports created at a regular cadence (weekly/monthly/quarterly). Broadly speaking, the job of traditional analytics is to use data to provide an understanding of what’s going on in your business to inform strategic decisions over time.</p><p>The types of questions traditional analytics answers are along the lines of “Is this product line generating revenue?”</p><p>Operational analytics is a flow of data from your data warehouse into other tools, like <a href="https://getcensus.com/integrations/zendesk">Zendesk</a>, <a href="https://www.getcensus.com/integrations/hubspot">Hubspot</a> or <a href="https://getcensus.com/integrations/intercom">Intercom</a>. The job of operational analytics is to inform specific activities inside your company, whether that's sales, marketing, support, or customer success. </p><p>The types of questions operational analytics answers are something like “Which support ticket should I tackle first?” </p><p>The difference is in what you use the data to achieve. Traditional analytics looks at data over time to inform long-term strategy; operational analytics looks at data in the moment to inform strategic action. </p></div><h3 id="a-specific-example-of-traditional-analytics-vs-operational-analytics">A Specific Example of Traditional Analytics vs. Operational Analytics</h3><div><p>Let’s take a customer success (CS) team at a growing startup as an example. This team would use traditional analytics to measure performance and plan ahead while using operational analytics to get stuff done.</p><p>A CS director might need a BI dashboard to track how long it would take to resolve support tickets on average. Ticket resolution time is a good metric for measuring past performance while providing a rough indication of future CS team workload. These insights can inform staffing decisions or changes in CS team processes, but they won’t help individual CS reps resolve more tickets in the next hour.</p><p>To resolve more tickets in the next hour, a CS rep might need help with support ticket prioritization. Operational analytics can pull customer information into each support ticket and automatically prioritize them based on a few key characteristics, like if the customer is part of a VIP program, if they’ve shown risk of churn, or if they might be open to an upsell. </p><p>For the CS rep, this might look like a few more fields plugged into each support ticket, while the list of tickets overall is automatically ranked by importance. As they settle in over their morning coffee, the CS rep doesn’t have to think through “Which ticket should I tackle first?” Operational analytics answers this question for them, so they can take action.</p><p>Over time, the performance of your CS team will improve, leading to higher retention, less churn, and more satisfied customers overall — all because each CS rep will know which support ticket to tackle first in order to have the most impact on your business’s bottom line.</p><p>If you empower every team in a similar way as this CS team example, you can start to see the overall impact operational analytics can have.

From this hub extends “spokes,” which are places that data comes from and places that data goes to (e.g., CRMs, marketing automation platforms, a/b testing software). </p><p>It’s the job of Fivetran to move data from the spokes into Snowflake. Once the data is in Snowflake, dbt helps make all that data ready for use. Then, Census moves the prepared data from Snowflake to the spokes it needs to go to. </p><p>Traditional analytics sends data out of your data warehouse for very specific tools, like a BI platform. Operational analytics sends data out of your data warehouse to just about whichever spoke needs it. They’re essentially different types of spokes that extend out of a single source of truth: your data warehouse.</p><p>None of the tools listed here will break the bank (although <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/snowflake-vs-redshift-just-choose-snowflake/">Snowflake can get expensive</a> if you’re not careful). And they’re easy to set up —<a href="https://www.hashpath.com/2020/11/build-a-modern-data-analytics-stack-from-scratch-in-under-an-hour/"> Seth Rosen proved it can be done in around 40 minutes</a> — and modular, so if you need to swap them out for another tool you can. The point is that this data stack’s barrier for entry is fairly low.</p></div><h2 id="why-you-should-use-operational-analytics">Why You Should Use Operational Analytics</h2><div><p>Any company with more than a handful of customers will likely need operational analytics. Once you reach a point of having a few customers’ data flowing into your data warehouse, you’ll quickly find the limitations of the individual tools you’re currently using. Operational analytics not only provides a way to overcome these limitations at scale but also allows your data team to step up and take a more proactive role in how your business uses data.</p><p>Without operational analytics, you have to rely on the analytics capabilities of your individual tools (aka spokes, as we outlined above). There are two types of limitations this places on your team’s capabilities:</p></div><ol><li><strong>You’re limited by the data you have in that system. </strong>If you’re running a complex email drip campaign in Marketo, you need to segment your audiences using Marketo.</li><li><strong>You have to connect the dots on your own. </strong>Say you need to call a customer to prevent churn because they haven’t used your product in a while. First, you need to identify that they’re not using your product in your product analytics tool, and then you need to convey that message to your CS team so they can make the call.</li></ol><div><p>Companies will often use spreadsheets as a work-around. Which can work well, up to a point. But once you start dealing with any sort of scale (think 5-10 customers), the data quickly outgrows the capabilities of a Google Sheets doc and some filtering.</p><p>Even worse, you’re relying on overworked operations people to manage how those tools work together. There’s a marketing operations person wrestling with Marketo day in and day out, managing these audiences and lists manually. There are CS reps swapping between dashboards, email, the help desk, and spreadsheets, trying to prioritize what to do next.</p><p>With operational analytics, you can automate all of these daily brain-draining tasks so these employees can actually start doing their work. </p><p>Marketo can now include ad campaign and sales outreach data to help your marketing ops person create hyperspecific drip campaigns, all within Marketo. The CS team can know, without any extra work on their part, which customers are at risk of churn by importing product-usage data — all without wading through miles of spreadsheets or relying on traditional analytics that are just not suited for these types of use cases. The data is just there.</p><p>The “X factor” making all of this possible …</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<h3>heic2103 — Science Release</h3>




<p>11 February 2021</p>






<p>Scientists were expecting to find an intermediate-mass black hole at the heart of the globular cluster NGC 6397, but instead they found evidence of a concentration of smaller black holes lurking there. New data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope have led to the first measurement of the extent of a collection of black holes in a core-collapsed globular cluster.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Globular clusters are extremely dense stellar systems, in which stars are&nbsp; packed closely together. They are also typically very old — the globular cluster that is the focus of this study, NGC 6397, is almost as old as the Universe itself. It resides 7800 light-years away, making it one of the closest globular clusters to Earth. Because of its very dense nucleus, it is known as a core-collapsed cluster.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When Eduardo Vitral and Gary A. Mamon of the Institut d’Astrophysique de Paris set out to study the core of NGC 6397, they expected to find evidence for an “intermediate-mass” black hole (IMBH). These are smaller than the supermassive black holes that lie at the cores of large galaxies, but larger than stellar-mass black holes formed by the collapse of massive stars. IMBH&nbsp; are the long-sought “missing link” in black hole evolution and their mere existence is hotly debated, although a few candidates have been found (see <a href="#1">[1]</a>, for example).&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">To look for the IMBH, Vitral and Mamon analysed the positions and velocities of the cluster’s stars. They did this using previous estimates of the stars’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_motion">proper motions</a> <a href="#2">[2]</a> from Hubble images of the cluster spanning several years <a href="#3">[3]</a>, in addition to proper motions provided by ESA’s <a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia">Gaia space observatory</a>, which precisely measures the positions, distances and motions of stars. Knowing the distance to the cluster allowed the astronomers to translate the proper motions of these stars into velocities.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<em>Our analysis indicated that the orbits of the stars are close to random throughout the globular cluster, rather than systematically circular or very elongated,</em>” explained Mamon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<em>We found very strong evidence for invisible mass in the dense central regions of the cluster, but we were surprised to find that this extra mass is not point-like but extended to a few percent of the size of the cluster,</em>” added Vitral.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This invisible component could only be made up of the remnants (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf">white dwarfs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star">neutron stars</a>, and black holes) of massive stars whose inner regions collapsed under their own gravity once their nuclear fuel was exhausted. The stars progressively sank to the cluster’s centre after gravitational interactions with nearby less massive stars, leading to the small extent of the invisible mass concentration. Using the theory of stellar evolution, the scientists concluded that the bulk of the unseen concentration is made of stellar-mass black holes, rather than white dwarfs or neutron stars that are too faint to observe.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Two recent studies had also proposed that stellar remnants and in particular, stellar-mass black holes, could populate the inner regions of globular clusters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<em>Our study is the first finding to provide both the mass and the extent of what appears to be a collection of mostly black holes in a core-collapsed globular cluster,</em>” said Vitral.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<em>Our analysis would not have been possible without having both the Hubble data to constrain the inner regions of the cluster and the Gaia data to constrain the orbital shapes of the outer stars, which in turn indirectly constrain the velocities of foreground and background stars in the inner regions,</em>” added Mamon, attesting to an exemplary international collaboration.</p>
<p>The astronomers also note that this discovery raises the question of whether mergers of these tightly packed black holes in core-collapsed globular clusters may be an important source of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave">gravitational waves</a> recently detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) experiment.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3><p dir="ltr"><a name="1"></a>[1] In 2020, new data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope provided the strongest evidence to date for a mid-sized black hole. Read the full press release on this result <a href="https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic2005/">here</a>.</p>

<p>How big is big data <i>really</i>? From time to time, various organizations brag about how much data they have, how big their clusters are, how many requests per second they serve, etc. Every time I come across these statistics, I make note of them. It's quite amazing to see how these numbers change over time... looking at the numbers from just a few years ago reminds you of this famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTmXHvGZiSY">Austin Powers scene</a>. Here's another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs">gem</a>.</p>

<p>Without further adieu, here's "big" data, in reverse chronological order...</p>

<h3>Twitter Infrastructure (January 2017)</h3>

<p>Overview of Twitter's current infrastructure:</p>

<img src="https://lintool.github.io/my-data-is-bigger-than-your-data/images/Twitter2017-infra-distribution.png">

<p>Highlights:</p>

<ul>

<li>Hadoop: We have multiple clusters storing over 500 PB divided in four groups (real time, processing, data warehouse and cold storage). Our biggest cluster is over 10k nodes. We run 150k applications and launch 130M containers per day.</li>

<li>Manhattan (the backend for Tweets, Direct Messages, Twitter accounts, and more): We run several clusters for different use cases such as large multi tenant, smaller for non common, read only, and read/write for heavy write/heavy read traffic patterns. The read/only cluster handles 10s of millions QPS whereas a read/write cluster handles millions of QPS. The highest performance cluster, our observability cluster, which ingests in every datacenter, handles over tens of million writes.</li>

<li>Graph: Our legacy Gizzard/MySQL based sharded cluster for storing our graphs. Flock, our social graph, can manage peaks over tens of million QPS, averaging our MySQL servers to 30k - 45k QPS.</li>

<li>Logging (Scribe, but transition over the Flume): We handle over a trillion messages per day and all of these are processed into over 500 categories, consolidated and then and selectively copied across all our clusters.</li>

<li>Caching: We operate hundreds of clusters with an aggregate packet rate of 320M packets/s, delivering over 120GB/s to our clients. We logically partition our caches by users, Tweets, timelines, etc. and in general, every cache cluster is tuned for a particular need. Based on the type of the cluster, they handle between 10M to 50M QPS, and run between hundreds to thousands of instances.</li>

<li>Haplo: Primary cache for Tweet timelines and is backed by a customized version of Redis (implementing the HybridList). Haplo is read-only from Timeline Service and written to by Timeline Service and Fanout Service. Aggregated commands between 40M to 100M per second. Aggregated service requests 800K per second.</li>

<h3>Internet Archive (October 2016)</h3>

<p>In October of 2012, we held just over 10 petabytes of unique content. Today, we have archived a little over 30 petabytes, and we add between 13 and 15 terabytes of content per day (web and television are the most voluminous).</p>

<p>Currently, Internet Archive hosts about 20,000 individual disk drives. Each of these are housed in specialized computers (we call them “datanodes”) that have 36 data drives (plus two operating systems drives) per machine. Datanodes are organized into racks of 10 machines (360 data drives), and interconnected via high-speed ethernet to form our storage cluster. Even though our content storage has tripled over the past four years, our count of disk drives has stayed about the same. This is because disk drive technology improvements. Datanodes that were once populated with 36 individual 2-terabyte (2T) drives are today filled with 8-terabyte (8T) drives, moving single node capacity from 72 terabytes (64.8T formatted) to 288 terabytes (259.2T formatted) in the same physical space! This evolution of disk density did not happen in a single step, so we have populations of 2T, 3T, 4T, and 8T drives in our storage clusters.</p>

February 11, 2021 | https://pii-tools.com/detect-person-names-in-text/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pii-tools.com/detect-person-names-in-text/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
Detecting people’s names is part and parcel of PII discovery. Traditional techniques like regexps and keywords don’t work, because the set of all names is too varied. How do open source Named Entity Recognition (NER) engines compare, and can we do better?</p><p>
<em>This Part 1 has NER results and benchmarks. There’s also <a href="https://pii-tools.com/detect-person-names-in-text-part-2-technical/">Part 2 with technical neural network details</a>.<br>
</em></p><h2 id="sota_ner">Developing a state-of-the-art named entity recognizer</h2><p>
A good named entity recognizer (NER) is essential for detecting names, home addresses, <a href="https://twitter.com/PII_tools/status/1230905790745260032">passport scans</a> etc, for purposes of compliance or <a href="https://pii-tools.com/pii-exclusions-data-breach/">breach incident management</a>.</p><p>
One could use a prepared list of names and surnames for this task, but such gazetteer obviously cannot be exhaustive and will fail on sentences like this:</p><blockquote><p>“<b>Calvin Klein</b> founded Calvin Klein Company in 1968.”</p></blockquote><p>Humans recognize easily what is a person’s name and what isn’t. For machines, the task is more difficult because they have trouble understanding context. This leads to the famous two types of errors:</p><ul><li><strong>False positives</strong>: words detected as personal names that are not, typically because they’re capitalized (<code>"Skin Games and Jesus Jones were one the first western bands."</code>); as well as</li><li><strong>False negatives</strong>: names missed by the detection, typically because they’re lowercased, foreign or uncommon. Example: <code>"bill carpenter was playing football."</code></li></ul><p>
So in order to recognize person names in text it is necessary to know not only what names look like, but also in what context they’re used and have a general domain knowledge.</p><h2 id="motivation">Why not just use open source?</h2><p>
NER is a well-studied task in academia. Naturally, we turned to open source NER solutions first. We evaluated the most popular ready-made software: Stanford NER and Stanza from the Stanford University, FLAIR from Zalando Research, spaCy from Explosion AI.</p><p>
To cut the story short, <strong>none of these open source tools were precise and fast enough</strong> for our purposes. While they work great on well-behaved data such as news articles or Wikipedia, their academic pedigree implodes when applied to the wild, messy documents of the real world.</p><p>
For this reason we developed our own NER, with special focus on <strong>names as they appear in real company documents</strong>. The resulting NER is proprietary (part of <a href="https://pii-tools.com/">PII Tools</a>) but we decided to share some technical design tips and results here, in the hope they help others.</p><p>
In this article, we’ll compare our creation against popular open source options. Additionally, we’ll benchmark a simple gazetteer-based NER that uses a predefined list of names, to serve as a <strong>baseline</strong>.</p><table><caption>Description of tested NERs</caption><tbody><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>version</th><th>type</th><th>language</th><th>source</th></tr><tr><th>list</th><td>–</td><td><abbr title="contains 5.6M unique names">list of names</abbr></td><td>multi-language</td><td>inhouse</td></tr><tr><th>stanford</th><td>4.1</td><td>CRF classifier</td><td><abbr title="each language has a separate model">single</abbr></td><td><a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html">https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html</a></td></tr><tr><th>stanza</th><td>1.1.1</td><td>neural network</td><td><abbr title="each language has a separate model">single</abbr></td><td><a href="https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/">https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/</a></td></tr><tr><th><abbr title="ner-multi-fast model">flair</abbr></th><td>0.6.1</td><td>neural network</td><td>multi-language</td><td><a href="https://github.com/flairNLP/flair">https://github.com/flairNLP/flair</a></td></tr><tr><th><abbr title="xx_ent_wiki_sm model">spacy</abbr></th><td>2.3.2</td><td>neural network</td><td>multi-language</td><td><a href="https://spacy.io/">https://spacy.io/</a></td></tr><tr><th>pii-tools</th><td>3.8.0</td><td>neural network</td><td>multi-language</td><td><a href="https://pii-tools.com/">https://pii-tools.com/</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>
Our requirements for the new NER were:</p><ul><li><strong>multi-language</strong>, with special focus on English, Spanish, German and Portuguese/Brazilian;</li><li>to accept <strong>arbitrary document contexts</strong>: text coming from PDFs, Word documents, Excel, email, database field, OCR…;</li><li><strong>efficient</strong>, to process <strong>large amounts of text quickly on a CPU</strong> (no need for specialized GPU hardware) and with a <strong>low memory footprint</strong>,</li><li><strong>flexible</strong> to be able to evolve the model behaviour: retraining, adding new languages, correcting detection errors;</li><li>and of course to be <strong>accurate</strong>, to minimize false positives and negatives.</li></ul><p>
To compare our NER we evaluated performance on standard benchmark datasets, <a href="https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2002/ner/">CoNLL-2002</a> (for Spanish), <a href="https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner/">CoNLL-2003</a> (English, German) and <a href="https://cic.unb.br/~teodecampos/LeNER-Br/">LeNER-Br</a> (Portuguese).</p><p>We also included a manually annotated <code>openweb</code> dataset, to make sure we test on data that no NER system (including ours!) has seen during training. Text for this dataset was randomly sampled from the English <a href="https://skylion007.github.io/OpenWebTextCorpus/">OpenWebTextCorpus</a>. We value results on <code>openweb</code> the most, because OpenWeb reflects the real (messy) data found in real documents the closest, among these public datasets.</p><h2 id="accuracy">Accuracy</h2><p>
We measured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score">F1 scores</a> for person names detected by each software. F1 scores range from 0 to 100, the higher the better. A “hit” (true positive) means the entire name was matched exactly, beginning to end. This is the strictest metric; we specifically <emph>don’t</emph> calculate success over the number of correctly predicted tokens, or even individual characters.</p><table><caption>Performance benchmark [F1 score – higher is better]</caption><tbody><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>English</th><th>Spanish</th><th>German</th><th>Portuguese</th><th>openweb</th></tr><tr><th>list</th><td>59.1</td><td>62.3</td><td>54.9</td><td>45.2</td><td>74.5</td></tr><tr><th>stanford</th><td>94.9</td><td>91.1</td><td>93.6</td><td><abbr title="no model available">—</abbr></td><td>92.6</td></tr><tr><th>stanza</th><td>82.2</td><td>98.4</td><td>87.6</td><td><abbr title="no model available">—</abbr></td><td>86.7</td></tr><tr><th>flair</th><td>95.8</td><td>96.9</td><td>91.3</td><td>62.9</td><td>90.6</td></tr><tr><th>spacy</th><td>86.1</td><td>87.0</td><td>74.1</td><td>42.0</td><td>81.3</td></tr><tr><th>pii-tools</th><td>92.3</td><td>90.6</td><td>89.3</td><td>85.9</td><td>95.7</td></tr></tbody></table><div id="attachment_4542"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4542" loading="lazy" src="https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1.png" alt="F1 scores for NER software that detect personal names." width="1015" height="482" srcset="https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1.png 1015w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-300x142.png 300w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-768x365.png 768w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-100x47.png 100w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-924x439.png 924w" sizes="(max-width: 1015px) 100vw, 1015px" data-srcset="https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1.png 1015w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-300x142.png 300w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-768x365.png 768w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-100x47.png 100w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-924x439.png 924w" data-src="https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p><p id="caption-attachment-4542">F1 scores of NER software that detect person names.</p></div><p>
In all tests our NER is among the top contenders – but keep in mind that accuracy was just one of our 5 design goals. For example, we “lost” a few F1 points on purpose by switching from Tensorflow to TF lite, trading accuracy for a much smaller &amp; faster model.</p><p>
For the Portuguese language (Brazil, LGPD) and <code>openweb</code> dataset, PII Tools is the clear winner. As mentioned above <code>openweb</code> reflects “real data” the closest, so this is great.</p><p>
Let’s look at some concrete examples:</p><table><caption>Text samples and NER detections (actual expected names are <strong>in bold</strong>)</caption><tbody><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>stanford</th><th>stanza</th><th>flair</th><th>spacy</th><th>pii-tools</th></tr><tr><td><b>Calvin Klein</b> founded Calvin Klein Company in 1968.</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td></tr><tr><td><b>Nawab Zulfikar Ali Magsi</b> did not see <b>Shama Parveen Magsi</b> coming.</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>fail</td><td>ok</td></tr><tr><td><b>bill carpenter</b> was playing football.</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td></tr><tr><td><abbr title="a village in Wales">Llanfihangel Talyllyn</abbr> is beautiful.</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>ok</td></tr><tr><td>Skin Games and Jesus Jones were one the first western bands.</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td></tr></tbody></table><p>
These samples are rather edge cases, but serve to get an idea of what detectors have to deal with, and how successful they are.</p><h2 id="performance">Performance</h2><p>
Now we will look into other aspects of our requirements. Detection performance was measured on CPU, our <code>pii-tools</code> NER was artificially restricted to a single process with a single thread, others were left in default settings.</p><table><caption>Speed and memory comparison</caption><tbody><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th><abbr title="short documents of ~500 bytes">speed short [kB/s]</abbr></th><th><abbr title="long documents of ~2.5 kB">speed long [kB/s]</abbr></th><th><abbr title="time to initializate NER + tag a 20 character text">startup time [s]</abbr></th><th><abbr title="peak RAM while tagging 270 kB of text">RAM usage [MB]</abbr></th></tr><tr><th>list</th><td>350.0</td><td>1100.0</td><td>1.1</td><td>1420</td></tr><tr><th>stanford</th><td>30.0</td><td>30.0</td><td>1.5</td><td><abbr title="for one language only">248</abbr></td></tr><tr><th>stanza</th><td>0.4</td><td>1.2</td><td>6.1</td><td><abbr title="input had to be chunked to limit RAM">1073</abbr></td></tr><tr><th>flair</th><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>5.2</td><td><abbr title="input had to be chunked to limit RAM">5341</abbr></td></tr><tr><th>spacy</th><td>70.0</td><td>200.0</td><td>0.5</td><td>123</td></tr><tr><th>pii-tools</th><td>35.0</td><td>230.0</td><td>1.3</td><td>387</td></tr></tbody></table><p>
Overall FLAIR and Stanza are definitely out, due to their super slow speed and high RAM usage. A worthy competitor from the performance perspective is spaCy, whose authors put a great deal of effort into optimization. Unfortunately spaCy’s tokenization quirks and opinionated architecture proved too inflexible for our needs.</p><p>
Likewise, Stanford NER is the most accurate among the open source alternatives, but is quite rigid – it’s really hard to update its models or add a new language. Plus its GNU GPL license won’t be to everyone’s liking.</p><h2 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h2><p>
Our focus on industry use calls for frequent model modifications: adding new languages, new kinds of documents (document contexts in which names may appear), fixing detection errors.</p><p>
In order to adapt the PII Tools NER model quickly, we built a pipeline that utilizes several “weaker” NERs and automatic translation tools to build a huge training corpus from varied sources. This focus on real-world data, along with a robust automated Tensorflow training pipeline allows adding new languages and controlling NER outputs more easily than the open source solutions.</p><p>
While developing our <code>pii-tools</code> NER we implemented most components from scratch, including:</p><ul><li>a large scale annotated dataset (proprietary data)</li><li>a tokenizer (critical; none of the open source variants do this part well)</li><li>token features (input to the neural network)</li><li>convolutional neural network (NN architecture)</li><li>data augmentation and training pipeline (for grounded model updates)</li><li>various tricks to push performance or to squeeze a lot of information into a smaller parameter space</li></ul><p>

<p>I want to outline the tools I use to consume textual content, and why it <em>perfectly</em> fits my needs.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe this can be helpful for you too.</p>

<p>(This should have been a pun on “HTTPS everywhere”…)</p>
<p>Been an avid RSS consumer for the past years.</p>
<p>But I’ve always encountered the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>lost RSS feeds while distro-hopping (either forgot or lost backups of the config files)</li>
<li>didn’t like the RSS reader’s UI</li>
<li>needed to install an extra native application for reading my news (both on my PC and phone)</li>

<p>I am a web-guy (whatever that means).</p>
<p>I almost exclusively use the Web, be it for apps one would have a native app for or browsing in general.</p>
<p>Lately I’ve found my perfect stack for keeping up to date with the latest news:</p>
<p>RSS for</p>
<ul>
<li>blogs (obviously)</li>
<li>HackerNews frontpage (yes, there is an RSS for it)</li>
<li>Twitter (although I added only a few feeds, via Nitter RSS)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hackernews-frontpage"><a href="#hackernews-frontpage">#</a> HackerNews frontpage</h3>
<p>I found myself checking the HN frontpage <strong>way</strong> too often, only to make a visual diff in my brain to skim through the articles I already read.</p>
<p>This changed finally once I discovered HN-RSS:</p>
<p>E.g. I get all posts that make it to the HackerNews frontpage via this RSS feed</p>
<pre><code>https://hnrss.org/frontpage
</code></pre>
<h3 id="tweets"><a href="#tweets">#</a> Tweets</h3>
<p>And the tweets from a handful of Twitter users through Nitter’s RSS feeds:</p>

<p>The awesome part of <a href="https://miniflux.app/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external">miniflux</a> is that I can</p>

<li>self-host it (a baby could run it via docker and set up a reverse-proxy with nginx)</li>
<li>Integrate Pocket (<a href="https://getpocket.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external">getpocket.com</a>) for bookmarking articles or reading them later on</li>
<li>Read the whole article without leaving Miniflux</li>
</ul>
<p>(The last point is because Miniflux will fetch the original article automatically if the RSS entry only contains a summary)</p>
<p>You want other reasons?</p>
<p>Privacy, simplicity, clean and no-frills UI, FOSS</p>
<p>This is how the UI looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://cri.dev/assets/images/posts/miniflux-example.png" alt="miniflux example"></p>
<p>By clicking on the article I can read it in full.</p>
<p>I use the <code>Save</code> button to offload the articles to Pocket, and read them later.</p>
<h3 id="bookmarklet"><a href="#bookmarklet">#</a> Bookmarklet</h3>
<p>Through a simple bookmark in my browser (both on PC and phone), I can simply subscribe to any website or blog that has an RSS feed.</p>
<p>This makes it super easy to subscribe to someone’s RSS feed.</p>
<p>You stumble upon an article, click on the bookmarklet, and Miniflux will find the RSS feed(s) for that website automatically.</p>
<p>No searching for the RSS icon no more.</p>
<p><img src="https://cri.dev/assets/images/posts/miniflux-bookmarklet.png" alt="miniflux bookmarklet"></p>
<h2 id="pocket-(%23longreads)"><a href="#pocket-(%23longreads)">#</a> Pocket (#longreads)</h2>
<p>I set up the Pocket integration mainly for reading longer articles, in a deferred fashion.</p>
<p>Pocket’s UI and reading experience suits me very well.</p>
<p>This part is totally optional, as you could get away with it by just using Miniflux.</p>
<p>You could also customize the CSS to make the font-rendering more pleasant and use custom fonts for example.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><article data-theme="classic" id="article"><header><h2>Or, "Any excuse to talk about folk music"</h2><h3>by <a href="https://senryu.pub/users/robotmay">Robert May</a> on <a href="https://senryu.pub/afternoonrobot/articles">Afternoon Robot</a></h3></header><section><h2>Background</h2>

<p>A few years ago I had quite bad RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury) caused by working entirely on a small laptop for 6 months. It was a mistake for many reasons, but the major one was that I had inadvertantly changed my typing style to work with it. I was resting my wrists on the laptop case, I was using the touchpad, and I had it quite close to my body because it was small. I had to make a fairly dramatic change to halt the onset of the RSI, but at the time I didn't understand what I had done to cause it - after all, I've been typing a lot, at a reasonable speed, since I was ~10 years old.</p>

<p>It took 20 years, but finally I had suffered the consequences of my constant computer use.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>Immediately I set out to spend money. The first change I made was to buy an "ergonomic" keyboard, and I went for an <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox EZ</a>, which is a nice bit of kit. I also bought a wireless trackball; a <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.910-005179.html">Logitech MX Ergo</a>. I'm now on my second of these and I really like it.</p>

<p>At the same time I started trying to learn the <a href="https://workmanlayout.org/">Workman</a> layout, which I think is largely rather smart, and which focuses on home-row typing. I initially tried Colemak but that seems oddly flawed in applying too much frequency to keys under the little fingers.</p>

<p>After some time, rather wonderfully, my RSI was substantially improved.</p>

<p>However, it wasn't actually for the reasons I originally thought. In fact, the RSI started disappearing because I essentially took a 3 month break from typing a lot, due to the high learning curve of swapping to a split board and new layout at the same time. Once I was back up to speed, the RSI started coming back.</p>

<h2>Why does it still hurt?</h2>

<p>Had I broken my body irreparably? No, as it turns out. In fact, all I had to do was just go back to everything I was doing before the laptop incident, and give myself time.</p>

<h3>As in all things, folk music is the cure</h3>

<p>Discovering the real cause of the problem came about by comparing typing on a computer to my musical instruments. I never get RSI on my diatonic accordions, or on the piano. Why are they different? Surely they use the same muscles, more or less. In fact their key weight is notably heavier. Even more weirdly, my RSI was non-existent when I played on them, even when it was at its worst on the computer.</p>

<p>There are a variety of ways to play the diatonic accordion but I tend to use a single strap and use the weight of the instrument to allow me to shift my hands whilst still holding it relatively still; I prefer this to strapping it tightly to my body and having entirely free hands. Here's an example video from a few years back:</p>



<p>There are better tunes and examples I could make but that would involve filming something new and I had this lying about. This video is a fairly good example in that I regularly slide my hand quickly downwards instead of stretching. It's more tempting to stretch when first learning the instrument as you don't want to lose your reference point, but learning to shift up and down the keys makes more difficult passages playable and actually quite comfortable. It's generally more comfortable to keep your fingers straight-ish and shift your hand up and down in that position. I now do this even more than in this video and regularly play tunes that use the full length of the keyboard. In fact, they're often my favourite ones to play! I now usually play with my thumb behind the keyboard, which I find makes it very easy to slide up and down. Here's another, rougher, old example, sure to give you motion sickness, from when I was selling an unwanted instrument:</p>



<p>Yes, accordions are a very quick way to ruin a motion-stabilisation algorithm-writer's day.</p>

<p>The hands aren't as free-floating as on a piano, as you have to hold the instrument at the same time. The key weight is actually fairly comparable to a computer keyboard, though at the heavier end. The piano is different, in that the key weight is actually pretty immense, particularly at the lower-end on a grand piano keyboard, and therefore requires a somewhat different method of striking the keys to a computer keyboard - the strength doesn't come from moving your finger up and down (but I won't go into that here as there are a million piano ergonomics articles).</p>

<h3>Problems with ergonomic or split keyboards</h3>

<p>The primary goal of many ergonomic keyboard enthusiasts is to reduce movement entirely and to move everything onto modifier layers. The Ergodox is known to be flawed in this regard as the thumb cluster is a bit of a stretch for most people, as well as the larger keys around the outside being a bit of an odd stretch. It's almost like it has two competing designs: one to reduce movement entirely, and the other to require movement in order to hit these extra buttons.</p>

<p>But the major flaw for me is that it ensures you can only ever use each hand on one half of the keyboard, and this means that keys which could often be a shared workload, such as <code>T,Y,G,H,B</code> are now dedicated to a hand. This is also a flaw I see with the "ortho-linear" layouts which remove key staggering. The argument for these optimisations is to remove stretching, which I agree with, but they do it by reducing movement, which I don't.</p>

<p>Instead of forcibly splitting the workload, I share it even more between my hands. But not by stretching! Instead my hands move freely over the keyboard, picking up letters or symbols in awkward places without having to perform difficult stretches with my fingers.</p>

<h3>The problem with home-row typing</h3>

<p>In my personal experience I found home-row typing to actually be unergonomic mostly because of the additional bend required from moving both hands closer together. This produces more strain on your wrist in order for your hand to be straighter on the keyboard. This is one aspect the split-keyboard design does solve, but it's also solvable on a normal keyboard.</p>

<p>It can be alleviated somewhat by moving the keyboard further away from you, allowing your wrists to be straighter. This however often means applying more pressure to the under-side of the wrist or arm as holding the weight of your hands further from your body is more tiring.</p>

<p>Instead I looked back at how I used to type, and realised that although my left hand sat more-or-less in the home-row position, i.e. with the index finger on <code>F</code>, my right hand sat further to the right, with the index finger somewhere between <code>K</code> and <code>L</code>. This is a wider "stance" and results in straighter wrists, as well as less stretching required for the <code>Enter</code> and <code>Right Shift</code> keys.</p>

<h2>This is the Way</h2>

<p>Looking at both instruments and reflecting on how I had typed before <em>The Laptop, First-born of Satan</em>, I settled on some ideas that are completely contrary to the accepted ergonomics of typing:</p>

<ol>
<li>The wrists themselves should not be under strain or pressure, including wrist-rests</li>
<li>The hands should move freely over the keyboard</li>
<li>The idea of "less movement" is incorrect, and instead I should aim for "less stretching"</li>
</ol>

<p>So I eBay'd the Ergodox, and used the money to buy a RealForce Topre keyboard. Weirdly, I bought a Japanese layout keyboard, which has some very slight advantages specific to my work that I'll explain shortly. I also ditched the Workman layout - it's nice, and I would recommend it, but most likely for those writing more prose than those programming. It flows well for words and becomes more awkward when using, say, <code>vim</code>, but it was particularly awkward in combination with the flaws of the Ergodox. Ultimately I dropped it because I realised my issues weren't down to QWERTY.</p>

<p>One aspect of the Ergodox which is nice is the ability to cant the keyboard over or away from you - I recommend doing this. If you raise a keyboard up, say with the feet usually attached at the back, you apply extra strain to the back of your hands to accommodate for the extra angle. Having a flatter keyboard is better in this regard.</p>

<h3>So this weird choice to use a Japanese layout keyboard huh?</h3>

<p><img title="RealForce Topre R2" alt="RealForce Topre R2" src="https://img.senryumedia.net/1ed11afe34645b232188eab4a32ce7d7.jpg"></p>

<p>So I bought a <a href="https://www.realforce.co.jp/products/R2TL-JPV-IV/">Japanese layout RealForce Topre R2 keyboard</a> with variably weighted springs. I love it, it's by far the best keyboard I've ever used. It was also hideously expensive, so if anyone from RealForce is out there and wants to supply me with keyboards to shill I am 100% <em>on-board</em>.</p>

<p>The Japanese layout both is and isn't odd. The extra keys for kana writing can be ignored, I just rebind them in <code>.Xmodmap</code> and use them for things like push-to-talk on Discord. The rest of the layout isn't too far from the UK ISO layout. Where it gets interesting is in the symbols.</p>

<ol>
<li>Double-quotes are above <code>2</code>, which I like as it splits them between the hands. I typically use <code>Right Shift</code>+<code>2</code> to type it</li>
<li>Single-quotes are above <code>7</code>, which is hella weird at first, but actually I now really like it. I use it 50/50 with left or right shift, always using both hands</li>
<li>Both semi-colon and colon are first-level keys. This is awesome for programming</li>
<li><code>@</code> is a first-level key. This is particularly nice for <em>Ruby</em></li>
<li>Underscore is a bit weird, and sits directly next to a shortened shift. This was the hardest key to get used to. I tend to move my right hand over and use two fingers to press the combination</li>
<li>Everything else is slightly shifted from the UK ISO layout but not weirdly so</li>
</ol>

<p>Because I like it so much now, I also have a Bluetooth Japanese-layout HHKB for a travel keyboard, which is very nice. I just stick it on top of any laptop I might have to use, to show who's in charge.</p>

<h3>Demonstration</h3>



<p>This was surprisingly easier to film than I expected. You'll have to forgive me the dusty desk, I currently don't have a carpet in my office so it's almost entirely pointless dusting as it's back to this state within 2 days.</p>

<p>I've noticed my left hand moves less than my right, but you can see that it often covers over to <code>Y</code> and I also move frequently to <code>7</code> for the single-quote on this keyboard. I rarely use my pinky fingers on either hand for letters. The right hand moves very freely across <code>Enter</code>, modifiers, punctuation, and …</p></section></article></section></div></div>

          <p>Istio is one of the most popular and <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/2019/" target="_blank">fast growing</a> open-source projects in the
cloud-native world; while this growth speaks volumes about the value users get from Istio, its rapid release cadence can
also be a challenge for users who may be managing several different versions of Istio clusters at the same time and
manually configuring CA certificates for cloud platforms.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>We launched a new open-source project called GetIstio today, offering users the easiest way to install and upgrade
Istio. GetIstio provides a vetted, upstream distribution of Istio – a hardened image of Istio with continued support
that is simpler to install, manage, and upgrade. It will have integrations with cloud native and popular on-prem
certificate managers (e.g., AWS ACM, Venafi, etc). This launch includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>GetIstio CLI, the easiest way to install, operate, and upgrade Istio. GetIstio provides a safe, vetted, upstream Istio
distro, tested against AKS, EKS, and GKE.</li>
<li>A free, online course on Istio Fundamentals, that is available now at Tetrate Academy.</li>
<li>A new community to bring together Istio and Envoy users and technology partners.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getistio-cli">GetIstio CLI</h3>
<p>GetIstio is an integration and lifecycle management CLI tool that ensures the use of supported and vetted versions of
Istio. Enterprises require the ability to control Istio versioning, support multiple versions of Istio, easily move
between the versions, integrate with cloud providers’ certification systems, and centralize config management and
validation. The GetIstio CLI tool supports these enterprise-level requirements as it:</p>
<ul>
<li>enforces fetching certified versions of Istio and enables only compatible versions of Istio installation</li>
<li>allows seamlessly switching between multiple istioctl versions</li>
<li>Includes a FIPS-compliant flavor</li>
<li>delivers Istio configuration validations platform based by integrating validation libraries from multiple sources</li>
<li>uses a number of cloud provider certificate management systems to create Istio CA certs that are used for signing
Service-Mesh managed workloads, and</li>
<li>provides multiple additional integration points with cloud providers</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="quick-start">Quick start</h3>
<p>The command below obtains a shell script that downloads and installs the GetIstio binary that corresponds to the OS
distribution detected by the script (currently macOS and Linux are supported). Additionally, the most recent supported
version of Istio is downloaded. Also, the script adds the GetIstio location to the PATH variable (re-login is required
to get PATH populated)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"> curl -sL https://tetrate.bintray.com/getistio/download.sh | bash
</code></pre></div><p>The following video shows the basic use of the GetIstio command line tool.</p>

<h3 id="get-involved">Get involved</h3>
<p>As part of GetIstio we are also launching a new community for developers, end users and technology partners of Istio,
Envoy, and service mesh. Community is open to all. The GetIstio.io website also includes
<a href="https://getistio.io/istio-in-practice/">practical tutorials</a> for using Istio.</p>
<p>If you want to take your learning to the next level, we have also prepared a free <a href="https://certifications.tetrate.io/" target="_blank">Learn Istio Fundamentals course</a> as part of Tetrate Academy. It is a self-paced
course that has 8 modules with theoretical lessons where we explain the theory and concepts, practical lessons which
consist of labs, and quizzes so you can check your knowledge. Join our weekly meetings, file issues, or ask questions in
Slack. No contribution is too small and your opinions and contributions matter!</p>
<h3 id="getistio-subscription">GetIstio Subscription</h3>
<p>Tetrate provides commercial support for GetIstio for direct access to Istio experts, priority bug fixes and 24/7
support. More details <a href="https://www.tetrate.io/getistio" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Historically, I’ve struggled to find a concise, simple way to explain what it means to practice type-driven design. Too often, when someone asks me “How did you come up with this approach?” I find I can’t give them a satisfying answer. I know it didn’t just come to me in a vision—I have an iterative design process that doesn’t require plucking the “right” approach out of thin air—yet I haven’t been very successful in communicating that process to others.</p>

<p>However, about a month ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/lexi_lambda/status/1182242561655746560">I was reflecting on Twitter</a> about the differences I experienced parsing JSON in statically- and dynamically-typed languages, and finally, I realized what I was looking for. Now I have a single, snappy slogan that encapsulates what type-driven design means to me, and better yet, it’s only three words long:</p>

<p><strong>Parse, don’t validate.</strong></p>
<!-- more-->



<p>Alright, I’ll confess: unless you already know what type-driven design is, my catchy slogan probably doesn’t mean all that much to you. Fortunately, that’s what the remainder of this blog post is for. I’m going to explain precisely what I mean in gory detail—but first, we need to practice a little wishful thinking.</p>

<h2 id="the-realm-of-possibility">The realm of possibility</h2>

<p>One of the wonderful things about static type systems is that they can make it possible, and sometimes even easy, to answer questions like “is it possible to write this function?” For an extreme example, consider the following Haskell type signature:</p>



<p>Is it possible to implement <code>foo</code>? Trivially, the answer is <em>no</em>, as <code>Void</code> is a type that contains no values, so it’s impossible for <em>any</em> function to produce a value of type <code>Void</code>.<sup><a href="#2019-11-05-parse-don-t-validate-footnote-1-definition" name="2019-11-05-parse-don-t-validate-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup> That example is pretty boring, but the question gets much more interesting if we choose a more realistic example:</p>



<p>This function returns the first element from a list. Is it possible to implement? It certainly doesn’t sound like it does anything very complicated, but if we attempt to implement it, the compiler won’t be satisfied:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>head</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>head</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span><span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<pre><code>warning: [-Wincomplete-patterns]
    Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive
    In an equation for ‘head’: Patterns not matched: []</code></pre>

<p>This message is helpfully pointing out that our function is <em>partial</em>, which is to say it is not defined for all possible inputs. Specifically, it is not defined when the input is <code>[]</code>, the empty list. This makes sense, as it isn’t possible to return the first element of a list if the list is empty—there’s no element to return! So, remarkably, we learn this function isn’t possible to implement, either.</p>

<h2 id="turning-partial-functions-total">Turning partial functions total</h2>

<p>To someone coming from a dynamically-typed background, this might seem perplexing. If we have a list, we might very well want to get the first element in it. And indeed, the operation of “getting the first element of a list” isn’t impossible in Haskell, it just requires a little extra ceremony. There are two different ways to fix the <code>head</code> function, and we’ll start with the simplest one.</p>

<h3 id="managing-expectations">Managing expectations</h3>

<p>As established, <code>head</code> is partial because there is no element to return if the list is empty: we’ve made a promise we cannot possibly fulfill. Fortunately, there’s an easy solution to that dilemma: we can weaken our promise. Since we cannot guarantee the caller an element of the list, we’ll have to practice a little expectation management: we’ll do our best return an element if we can, but we reserve the right to return nothing at all. In Haskell, we express this possibility using the <code>Maybe</code> type:</p>



<p>This buys us the freedom we need to implement <code>head</code>—it allows us to return <code>Nothing</code> when we discover we can’t produce a value of type <code>a</code> after all:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>head</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>a</span>
<span>head</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span><span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>x</span>
<span>head</span> <span>[]</span>    <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Problem solved, right? For the moment, yes… but this solution has a hidden cost.</p>

<p>Returning <code>Maybe</code> is undoubtably convenient when we’re <em>implementing</em> <code>head</code>. However, it becomes significantly less convenient when we want to actually use it! Since <code>head</code> always has the potential to return <code>Nothing</code>, the burden falls upon its callers to handle that possibility, and sometimes that passing of the buck can be incredibly frustrating. To see why, consider the following code:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>getConfigurationDirectories</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>[</span><span>FilePath</span><span>]</span>
<span>getConfigurationDirectories</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>configDirsString</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getEnv</span> <span>"CONFIG_DIRS"</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>configDirsList</span> <span>=</span> <span>split</span> <span>','</span> <span>configDirsString</span>
  <span>when</span> <span>(</span><span>null</span> <span>configDirsList</span><span>)</span> <span>$</span>
    <span>throwIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>userError</span> <span>"CONFIG_DIRS cannot be empty"</span>
  <span>pure</span> <span>configDirsList</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>configDirs</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getConfigurationDirectories</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>head</span> <span>configDirs</span> <span>of</span>
    <span>Just</span> <span>cacheDir</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>initializeCache</span> <span>cacheDir</span>
    <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>error</span> <span>"should never happen; already checked configDirs is non-empty"</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>When <code>getConfigurationDirectories</code> retrieves a list of file paths from the environment, it proactively checks that the list is non-empty. However, when we use <code>head</code> in <code>main</code> to get the first element of the list, the <code>Maybe FilePath</code> result still requires us to handle a <code>Nothing</code> case that we know will never happen! This is terribly bad for several reasons:</p>

<ol>
 <li>
  <p>First, it’s just annoying. We already checked that the list is non-empty, why do we have to clutter our code with another redundant check?</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Second, it has a potential performance cost. Although the cost of the redundant check is trivial in this particular example, one could imagine a more complex scenario where the redundant checks could add up, such as if they were happening in a tight loop.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Finally, and worst of all, this code is a bug waiting to happen! What if <code>getConfigurationDirectories</code> were modified to stop checking that the list is empty, intentionally or unintentionally? The programmer might not remember to update <code>main</code>, and suddenly the “impossible” error becomes not only possible, but probable.</p></li></ol>

<p>The need for this redundant check has essentially forced us to punch a hole in our type system. If we could statically <em>prove</em> the <code>Nothing</code> case impossible, then a modification to <code>getConfigurationDirectories</code> that stopped checking if the list was empty would invalidate the proof and trigger a compile-time failure. However, as-written, we’re forced to rely on a test suite or manual inspection to catch the bug.</p>

<h3 id="paying-it-forward">Paying it forward</h3>

<p>Clearly, our modified version of <code>head</code> leaves some things to be desired. Somehow, we’d like it to be smarter: if we already checked that the list was non-empty, <code>head</code> should unconditionally return the first element without forcing us to handle the case we know is impossible. How can we do that?</p>

<p>Let’s look at the original (partial) type signature for <code>head</code> again:</p>



<p>The previous section illustrated that we can turn that partial type signature into a total one by weakening the promise made in the return type. However, since we don’t want to do that, there’s only one thing left that can be changed: the argument type (in this case, <code>[a]</code>). Instead of weakening the return type, we can <em>strengthen</em> the argument type, eliminating the possibility of <code>head</code> ever being called on an empty list in the first place.</p>

<p>To do this, we need a type that represents non-empty lists. Fortunately, the existing <code>NonEmpty</code> type from <code>Data.List.NonEmpty</code> is exactly that. It has the following definition:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>:|</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Note that <code>NonEmpty a</code> is really just a tuple of an <code>a</code> and an ordinary, possibly-empty <code>[a]</code>. This conveniently models a non-empty list by storing the first element of the list separately from the list’s tail: even if the <code>[a]</code> component is <code>[]</code>, the <code>a</code> component must always be present. This makes <code>head</code> completely trivial to implement:<sup><a href="#2019-11-05-parse-don-t-validate-footnote-2-definition" name="2019-11-05-parse-don-t-validate-footnote-2-return">2</a></sup></p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>head</span> <span>::</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>head</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:|</span><span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Unlike before, GHC accepts this definition without complaint—this definition is <em>total</em>, not partial. We can update our program to use the new implementation:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>getConfigurationDirectories</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>FilePath</span><span>)</span>
<span>getConfigurationDirectories</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>configDirsString</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getEnv</span> <span>"CONFIG_DIRS"</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>configDirsList</span> <span>=</span> <span>split</span> <span>','</span> <span>configDirsString</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>nonEmpty</span> <span>configDirsList</span> <span>of</span>
    <span>Just</span> <span>nonEmptyConfigDirsList</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>pure</span> <span>nonEmptyConfigDirsList</span>
    <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>throwIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>userError</span> <span>"CONFIG_DIRS cannot be empty"</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>configDirs</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getConfigurationDirectories</span>
  <span>initializeCache</span> <span>(</span><span>head</span> <span>configDirs</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Note that the redundant check in <code>main</code> is now completely gone! Instead, we perform the check exactly once, in <code>getConfigurationDirectories</code>. It constructs a <code>NonEmpty a</code> from a <code>[a]</code> using the <code>nonEmpty</code> function from <code>Data.List.NonEmpty</code>, which has the following type:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>nonEmpty</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>The <code>Maybe</code> is still there, but this time, we handle the <code>Nothing</code> case very early in our program: right in the same place we were already doing the input validation. Once that check has passed, we now have a <code>NonEmpty FilePath</code> value, which preserves (in the type system!) the knowledge that the list really is non-empty. Put another way, you can think of a value of type <code>NonEmpty a</code> as being like a value of type <code>[a]</code>, plus a <em>proof</em> that the list is non-empty.</p>

<p>By strengthening the type of the argument to <code>head</code> instead of weakening the type of its result, we’ve completely eliminated all the problems from the previous section:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>The code has no redundant checks, so there can’t be any performance overhead.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Furthermore, if <code>getConfigurationDirectories</code> changes to stop checking that the list is non-empty, its return type must change, too. Consequently, <code>main</code> will fail to typecheck, alerting us to the problem before we even run the program!</p></li></ul>

<p>What’s more, it’s trivial to recover the old behavior of <code>head</code> from the new one by composing <code>head</code> with <code>nonEmpty</code>:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>head'</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>a</span>
<span>head'</span> <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> <span>head</span> <span>.</span> <span>nonEmpty</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Note that the inverse is <em>not</em> true: there is no way to obtain the new version of <code>head</code> from the old one. All in all, the second approach is superior on all axes.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3><strong>Remote Friendly is a Vague Term</strong></h3><p>Remote friendly is a term that has abruptly outlived its usefulness. In today's world where <a href="https://www.shinkim.io/posts/shift-to-remote-work-based-on-7-000-hacker-news-job-posts">70% of companies hiring on Hacker News are open to permanent remote positions</a> as of January 2021, one could argue that most of the tech industry is remote friendly. Remote friendly is ambiguous — it could mean that remote candidates are welcome to apply. It might mean that remote employees are surely first-class citizens. Or that the team is remote only.</p><p>Many companies have made formal transitions to embrace remote work in 2020 and they've spelt out their intentions in announcements and interviews. Going through these and the Hacker News job posts in documenting the <a href="https://www.shinkim.io/posts/shift-to-remote-work-based-on-7-000-hacker-news-job-posts">shift to remote during the pandemic</a>, I've noticed that more nuance and specificity had developed to describe a company's stance on remote work. The binary labeling of remote friendly or not doesn't cut it — remote friendliness is a spectrum.</p><p>In 2021, as founders look to guide their onsite team back to the office while blending them with the permanent remote team, they will feel pressure to clarify the company's stance towards remote work. My hope is that the full remote spectrum presented in this article can serve as a framework to help founders decide and articulate where they want to land.</p><h3><strong>The Remote Spectrum</strong></h3><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e12757f0227d019c07ef2b9/6012e857dbc713f0884b771b_yHHoiiAiDWqBx11G5_pfplTa5yzrcRg7L8OmrBPQgWuyE2oi4ehTQ4Rh5WkbmOM5JYUjIj_Z1ERpALJgF-3ipYS7dE9fmcoQfUW2pnIwkhHUDNeS-FB5ve42KOTJ5D7QlYvmwzPi.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Broadly speaking, once the pandemic is over, I propose that all companies should fall under one of the five categories on the remote spectrum. The most remote friendly companies are on one end and the least remote friendly companies are on the other end. Here are descriptions of each of the archetypes:</p><p><strong>Onsite Only</strong></p><p>Onsite only companies will not hire permanent remote employees. Some allow a flexible schedule where employees are free to work from home a few days a week. But employees are not allowed to work remotely indefinitely. A new employee must be either local or willing to relocate.</p><p>Many small startups fall under this category. I could not confirm any scaled technology company (500+ employees) having a 100% onsite employee base. Please correct me if you know otherwise.</p><p><strong>Remote OK</strong></p><p>Remote OK companies are comfortable with having some permanent remote employees. Certain functions like engineering or sales may even have a substantial remote contingent. However, the default mode of work is office-centric. Workflows, collaboration, communication, and events are planned around the onsite team. The remote minority often has a sense of missing out. Founders and most members of the executive team are onsite.</p><p>Examples include<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflixs-reed-hastings-deems-remote-work-a-pure-negative-11599487219"> Netflix</a> and<a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/locations/virtual-locations"> Amazon</a>. Most technology companies belong to this segment of the spectrum.</p><p><strong>Remote Equal</strong></p><p>Remote equal companies take the affirmative stance that remote employees are first class citizens and want to ensure that they are as empowered and productive as onsite employees. The remote employee experience is proactively designed from onboarding and team-building to meeting policies. Personnel — a head of remote or a remote council — and resources are dedicated to ensure remote employees are supported. However, many non-engineering roles may only be offered in an onsite format.</p><p>Examples are<a href="https://stripe.com/blog/remote-hub-one-year"> Stripe</a> and<a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-work-is-changing-at-figma/"> Figma</a>.</p><p><strong>Remote First</strong></p><p>Remote first companies assume the vast majority of employees including the leadership team are remote and remote is the default mode of work. Offices are encouraged to be used for in-person collaboration and team-building activities instead of individual work. Efforts are made to erase synchronous meetings and emphasize documentation. Companies choose remote first over remote equal because they do not have to maintain two modes of work or worry about subtle inequities developing against remote employees.</p><p>Examples are Shopify, Dropbox, Coinbase, Brex, and Quora.</p><p><strong>Remote Only</strong></p><p>Remote only companies exist without an office — the purest form of remote. Some companies were remote only from founding (e.g.<a href="https://getshogun.com/remote-work-guide"> Shogun</a>) and others became incrementally embraced remote (e.g.<a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/our-journey-to-all-remote/"> Sourcegraph</a>). Many companies that started during the pandemic are remote only by accident. Remote only companies may have aligned working hours (e.g. InVision does 10am to 6pm EST) or not (e.g. GitLab). Rapport building and social interactions cannot be left to spontaneous hallway interactions, so remote only companies will regularly host in-person offsites and virtual events.</p><p>Gitlab and InVision are scaled examples (~1,000 employees) of remote only.</p><h3><strong>Traversing the Spectrum</strong></h3><p>Many companies have moved to a different part of the spectrum during the pandemic, with the vast majority moving to a more remote friendly stance. For example, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-21/shopify-is-joining-twitter-in-permanent-work-from-home-shift">Shopify</a>,<a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/dropbox-goes-virtual-first"> Dropbox</a>,<a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/post-covid-19-coinbase-will-be-a-remote-first-company-cdac6e621df7"> Coinbase</a>,<a href="https://www.affirm.com/careers"> Affirm</a>,<a href="https://www.quora.com/q/quora/Remote-First-at-Quora"> Quora</a>,<a href="https://medium.com/building-brex/remote-first-at-brex-1252cb30e347"> Brex</a> have all announced their decision to be remote first. As more management teams update and clarify their post-COVID remote stance, here are some questions that are worth asking.</p><p>First, how will you make sure remote employees aren't second-class citizens? The inequities will surface in subtle but pervasive ways — remote employees may feel harder to interject during meetings, only onsite employees may hold the marker if you use a physical whiteboard, and onsite employees may have better access to onsite leadership. This is a tricky problem that requires commitment from onsite and remote employees to address.</p><p>Second, what is the role of the office? The office will continue to host day-to-day work for onsite employees. But as a company hires more remote employees, the office will also take on the role of a home base for remote teams to hold off-sites like for<a href="https://www.fullstory.com/blog//fullstory-goes-remote/"> FullStory</a>. And as the company further leans into remote, the office may become purely a place for in-person collaboration and team-building, like for<a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/dropbox-goes-virtual-first"> Dropbox</a>. Consequently, you may need less office space.</p><p>Third, how are you reallocating your budget based on cost-savings from shifting to remote work? Immediate savings will be from reduced office rent, which is estimated to be $1,100-1,400 per employee per month in large cities. In addition, adopting location-based compensation could result in up to 15% compensation adjustment for US companies if an employee moves out of SF or NYC. Companies should partially re-allocate cost-savings into home office or co-working subsidies, travel budgets for team get-togethers, and best-in-class collaboration software.</p><p>Fourth, should you re-think communication protocols? A unanimous refrain among seasoned remote forward companies is the importance of written asynchronous communication. Remote first Grafana Labs anticipates "you will need to persist and distribute more data than you can imagine". And as for synchronous meetings, meeting etiquettes need to be reexamined. For example,<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/meetings/#avoid-hybrid-calls"> GitLab</a> encourages everyone to use their own camera even if a subset of meeting attendees are sitting in the same room to provide equal footing for everyone.</p><h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p>As companies start charting their paths back to the office, management teams that have not figured out a formal go-forward stance on remote work should do so now. Just like the exit from the office happened swiftly across the board, so will the return back to the office. But this time the transition need not be so chaotic and disorderly. Your employees and candidates will rightly be asking to clarify your remote work stance. Where does your company stand on the remote spectrum? The only wrong answer is to not have an answer.</p><p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/_shinkim">Twitter @_shinkim</a> as I&nbsp;continue exploring these trends.</p><p>Thanks to Yin Wu and Chris Cheng for reviewing drafts of this article.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whoishiring">Hacker News: Who is Hiring</a>.

Babelfish “<em>adds an endpoint to PostgreSQL that understands the SQL Server wire protocol Tabular Data Stream (TDS), as well as commonly used T-SQL commands used by SQL Server.

Wow. <strong>SQL Server wire and application compatibility for PostgreSQL!</strong></p>
<p>What this means is that Babelfish will be able to “impersonate” a SQL Server database. Applications may be able to run unchanged, believing that they are connecting to SQL Server, when they will actually be connecting to PostgreSQL-Babelfish.</p>
<p>Surely, compatibility will not be 100% at the beginning. But it will keep improving, and <strong>as long as it provides enough compatibility for a nice set of applications to run unchanged on Babelfish, it will open the door to migrations and replacing SQL Servers with Babelfish</strong>.

<p>The trends for the last 8 years are clear: Oracle and SQL Server are constantly declining in popularity; MySQL is slightly declining; and PostgreSQL is clearly growing in popularity. But while PostgreSQL almost tripled in popularity in these eight years, it is still far behind the other three.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL became the database of 2020 because its popularity grew the most in the last year. The other three mentioned databases declined in popularity during 2020. If we assume the same rate of change in popularity will continue for the upcoming years, by 2025 PostgreSQL would still remain in the 4th place, albeit close to SQL Server. It won’t overtake SQL Server until 2026, and by 2030 PostgreSQL would still lag behind Oracle and MySQL.</p>

<p>How is this analysis related to Babelfish? <strong>Babelfish opens the door to new users, new markets, new opportunities. <strong>Babelfish may bump PostgreSQL’s popularity further, targeting use cases that either PostgreSQL is not able to reach today; or can only reach via complex technology migrations.</strong> Babelfish could be one of the many potential boosts that PostgreSQL needs in order to become a more universally used database</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="to-fork-or-not-to-fork-thats-the-question">To fork, or not to fork, that’s the question</h2>
<p>In their announcement, AWS said that “<em>We are open sourcing Babelfish in 2021. […] We are releasing Babelfish under the Apache 2.0 license. We invite others to become active in the project, and we will see it as a sign of success when developers outside of AWS become committers or maintainers. You can help by adding or extending Babelfish functionality, submitting feature requests, working on documentation, and contributing test cases</em>”. They also mentioned the code will be published on GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>At the time Babelfish will be published, it will likely require changes to PostgreSQL to enable Babelfish to be an extension</strong>. Some people may call that a “fork” of PostgreSQL, and others may call it a “development branch”. The difference between the two will only be clear over time. Note that PostgreSQL development model doesn’t use feature branches, and in my opinion it’s a great model –but this is an entirely different topic. It is really appreciated that AWS is releasing the code as open source, and under a permissive license (that should be compatible with PostgreSQL’s). <strong>If AWS developers work with the PostgreSQL Community to get the necessary changes merged into PostgreSQL core, then it would have been a development branch, and not a fork. This is something that the PostgreSQL Community and all parties involved need to figure out</strong>.</p>
<p>On January 25th, Amazon AWS made a first move. In an <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CAGBW59d5SjLyJLt-jwNv%2BoP6esbD8SCB%3D%3D%3D11WVe5%3DdOHLQ5wQ%40mail.gmail.com">email to PostgreSQL’s hackers mailing list</a>, Jan Wieck, a well-known Postgres-er, proposed to start discussing the implementation of protocol hooks. These hooks would enable to implement SQL Server’s protocol as an extension, rather than a fork.</p>
<p>Protocol hooks are, possibly, not the only hooks or modifications to PostgreSQL core that would be required to integrate the whole Babelfish project. With those changes to the core most of the Babelfish code could possibly be integrated in core as an extension(s). I cannot estimate the complexity of these core changes. But I believe that it would be a worthwhile effort, an effort that may further increase PostgreSQL outreach.</p>
<p>Only very recently (Feb 10th, 11th) some initial, very interesting, discussion around this proposal has started (including a very interesting offer to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CADUqk8UndFi7WHVNZscs4ZCk37_2aBUw-K32QA7sQd_3cJ%2Bqng%40mail.gmail.com">open source MySQL protocol compatibility for Postgres!</a>). It’s understandable, it’s a very busy time for PostgreSQL hackers (the last Commitfest for feature inclusion into PostgreSQL 14 is ongoing). But Babelfish was already announced more than two months ago; and it could be published anytime. I believe we need to start a deeper conversation about Postgres-Babelfish integration sooner than later. And what is being discussed so far are mainly technical considerations around the integration of one of the possibly several integration points that may be required. <strong>I’d love to also have a strategic discussion, where the Community would address, from a leadership perspective, what would be the plans for integrating, or not, Babelfish</strong>. <strong>Is Babelfish the Elephant in the Room?</strong> Probably not anymore, but I anyway hope this post will help, at the very least, to spark the strategic discussion.</p>
<p>What is the alternative? What will happen if PostgreSQL would not implement such hooks or will not pursue understanding with AWS, for the common benefit, and help Babelfish and PostgreSQL cooperate and allow for code bases integration?</p>
<p><strong>Under this scenario, AWS will probably have to keep Babelfish as a fork</strong>. For one, AWS already keeps Aurora as a fork, even though it’s an internal one. Given AWS’ well-known customer obsession and that AWS doesn’t kill services that they started offering, I think that if given no other chance they will keep Babelfish as a separate fork, getting its own share of features and contributors. Surely AWS knows that maintaining a fork is expensive. And I believe they have no intention to have it as a fork (otherwise, they won’t be publishing it as open source). So there will be serious intentions and efforts to merge it into PostgreSQL, for the benefit of all. But the recent Elastic case has demonstrated that AWS is committed to the open source software that is part of their managed services, and are willing to step up with a lot of resources when they are required to continue serving their customers. Apparently AWS has around 200 open job positions (!!) for developers working on Elasticsearch. Surely they can do the same for Babelfish, especially given that RDS Postgres/Aurora/Babelfish is probably a much larger business for them than Elastic.</p>
<h2 id="on-protocol-hooks">On protocol hooks</h2>
<p>Jan also argued that “<em>Creating the necessary infrastructure in the postmaster and backend will open up more possibilities, that are not tied to our compatibility efforts. Possible use cases for wire protocol extensibility include the development of a completely new, not backwards compatible PostgreSQL protocol or extending the existing wire protocol</em>”. I cannot agree more. This effort not only benefits the Babelfish integration; but also opens the door for new PostgreSQL protocols.</p>
<p>The current PostgreSQL protocol (v3) <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/release-7-4.html">has been in use since PostgreSQL 7.4</a>, released in 2003. It works well, and has spun the broadest possible set of drivers, tools and even compatible databases that use it (like CockroachDB, Crate.io or NoisePage, for example). But it also has some limitations and well-known problems. There is an entry in PostgreSQL “TODO” about <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Todo#Wire_Protocol_Changes_.2F_v4_Protocol">proposed changes for an eventual v4 version of the protocol</a>. I also participated in another <a href="https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/blob/95ba7b261e39754674c5817695ae5ebf9a341fae/backend_protocol_v4_wanted_features.md">“brain dump” on v4 proposed features</a>. But despite much talk, v4 has not happened and there’s no ongoing effort to make it happen. v3 is to stay for long.</p>
<p>Why is that, why can’t the protocol evolve? Have a look at <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CD5C1525-8B2C-4986-87F0-B1CB3B52ACA7%40wa-research.ch">this thread</a>, where a proposal to implement an HTTP protocol for PostgreSQL was made. Other than the proposal about HTTP itself –which has its own merits, and is a topic that I believe should definitely be discussed again–, the general sentiment was that <strong>any new protocol would have to provide all the features that the current protocol has, work for every use case, do not disrupt existing drivers or provide good means for driver rewrites; and do it significantly better than the current one</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-innovators-dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</h2>
<p>I don’t have an MBA, but this to me is a clear case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a>. PostgreSQL protocol v3 is the incumbent, and protocol v4 and/or other protocols like HTTP are the potential disruptive innovators. In what looks like a perfect match for Christensen’s book, a disruptive protocol innovation “<em>would not initially satisfy the demands of even the high end of the market</em>”. In other words, initial versions of these protocols should not target feature parity with the incumbent. They should rather focus on doing the basics, but much better, with a compelling higher value proposition.</p>
<p>Eventually, these protocols “<em>will surpass sustaining technologies</em>” and may end up replacing the current v3 protocol. This was very well explained by Prof. Clayton and is represented on his famous graph comparing the product …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div>

    <p><strong><em>This is a part of the ongoing <a href="https://zverok.github.io/spellchecker.html">“Rebuilding the spellchecker”</a> series, dedicated to explaining how the world’s most popular spellchecker Hunspell works, via its Python port called <a href="https://github.com/zverok/spylls">Spylls</a>. You can start reading from the <a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-05-spellchecker-1.html">first part</a> (or look into the series <a href="https://zverok.github.io/spellchecker.html">TOC</a>), but this is not a requirement: I provide here all the necessary context to follow this article.</em></strong></p>

<p>In the heart of every spellchecker is the algorithm for suggesting corrections, called just <strong>suggest</strong> in Hunspell. Ideally, it should provide a list of suggestions that is comprehensive yet concise, trying hard not to miss the right suggestion for a severely misspelled word, and at the same time not to overwhelm the user with too many variants.</p>

<p>As we’ve seen in the <strong><a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-21-spellchecker-4.html">suggest overview</a></strong>, the task is not only complicated, but also it doesn’t have a singular right answer, and the quality of the solution is quite hard to estimate objectively.</p>

<h2 id="full-dictionary-search">Full dictionary search</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-28-spellchecker-5.html">previous part</a> demonstrates Hunspell’s approach to simple misspellings: it generates a list of “edits” (like inserting one letter, removing one letter, and so on), and tries to find out whether some of them are correct dictionary words. Too often, though, it is not enough: all corrections found via edits are one or two characters different from the misspelling, so the search space is limited. In real life, even the accidental typos of the perfectly educated writer will not always be possible to correct this way. If we consider genuine spelling mistakes, we’ll see a wide range of possibilities for how severely a word can be corrupted while still staying recognizable to the human reader.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When all attempts to generate suggestions based on edits have failed, Hunspell uses another strategy: just stop guessing and <strong>search for similar words through the entire dictionary</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://zverok.github.io/img/spellchecker-6-akchualy.png" alt=""></p>

<!--
```python
from spylls.hunspell import Dictionary

english = Dictionary.from_files('en_US')

print(*english.suggester.suggestions('akchualy'))
# Suggestion[ngram](actually)
# Suggestion[phonet](catchall)
# Suggestion[phonet](actionable)
```
-->

<p>Those who follow the series long enough might remember that we have a problem here: there is <strong>no complete list of all possible words</strong>. Hunspell’s dictionary is <a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-09-spellchecker-2.html">a list of stems and affixes</a> that can be attached to them. Iterating through all possible word forms is computationally expensive—not even mentioning the problem of iterating through <a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-14-spellchecker-3.html">compound words</a>… because the lookup through entire dictionary ignores them completely.</p>

<p>Another problem is how to estimate the similarity of suggestion to a misspelling so it will be aligned with the user’s intuitive understanding. Hunspell uses two approaches (the first one much more often): lexicographical, or <strong>n-gram-based</strong> similarity; and <strong>phonetic</strong> similarity.</p>



<p>For a full-dictionary similarity search, Hunspell first needs to handle the problem of the efficient iteration through the list of possible word forms. Producing them all on the fly is unrealistic performance-wise, so when the <strong>n-gram similarity</strong> is used, Hunspell (and Spylls) acts this way:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Iterate through all the stems and find 100 of them most similar to a misspelled word (with rough-and-quick scoring formula)</li>
  <li>For those 100 stems, generate all possible affix forms and find 200 of them most similar to a misspelled word (with another rough-and-quick scoring formula)</li>
  <li>Calculate a very sophisticated similarity score for those 200 chosen forms</li>
  <li>Sort by the final score, and return the best ones (up to 4)</li>
</ol>

<p>This “funneling” approach—first choosing stems, and then only looking at forms of those stems—means that the whole algorithm is only suitable for dictionaries with long stems and short affixes (where “misspelled word is similar to a stem” = “misspelled word is similar to most of the word”). This assumptions is wrong, for example, for Korean (very short words), or Brazilian Portuguese (“longuissimamente” = “longo” + “uissimamente”).</p>

<p>Scoring formulae are based on <strong>n-gram counting</strong> (though there are more components to each formula). Thus, Hunspell (and Spylls) colloquially refer to this stage of suggestion algorithm as “n-gram search” or “n-gram suggest”. It is just counting <code>n</code>-letter combinations that are common for two different words: the higher the score, the more they are similar. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>spylls.hunspell.algo.string_metrics</span> <span>import</span> <span>ngram</span>

<span>ngram</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>'actually'</span><span>,</span> <span>'akchualy'</span><span>)</span> <span># n is up to 3
# 11 = a, c, u, a, l, l, y, ua, al, ly, ual
</span>
<span>ngram</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>'actually'</span><span>,</span> <span>'akshuly'</span><span>)</span>
<span># 6 = a, u, a, l, l, y, ly
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The full scoring formulae, though, use not only n-gram counting but several other lexicographical metrics—and are, if I may say, <em>beautifully ad-hoc</em>. It seems that they were grown through years of trial-and-experimentation to choose the coefficients and the order of summands—not related to any theoretical linguistic meaning but just found empirically. Those parts of the algorithms strongly resemble how machine learning works; only, in this case, it were Hunspell developers who adjusted “weights” after each evaluation. <strong>ML analogy is an interesting topic</strong> that we’ll investigate in one of the later chapters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just to have a taste of it: the detailed similarity score of step 3 is calculated based on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the longest common substring length of the misspelled word and candidate;</li>
    <li>leftmost common substring length;</li>
    <li>the number of same characters in same positions;</li>
    <li>ngram score with N=4;</li>
    <li>and <em>weighted</em> ngram score (absent ngrams add negative points) with N=2.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It also adds a reward for words with long common substring (putting the candidate in the “very good” bag), and a penalty based on too low 2-gram score and <code>MAXDIFF</code> setting of aff-file (typically putting the candidate in the “very questionable” bag).</p>

  <p>For those more in favor of formal descriptions, <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hunspell/algo_ngram_suggest.html#spylls.hunspell.algo.ngram_suggest.precise_affix_score"><code>ngram_suggest.precise_affix_score</code></a> code provides one.</p>

  <p>And the <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hunspell/algo_ngram_suggest.html#spylls.hunspell.algo.ngram_suggest.ngram_suggest"><code>ngram_suggest.ngram_suggest</code></a> method gives a full definition of the algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The math typically pays off:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'procudur'</span><span>))</span>
<span># procedure
# ...
</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'madnifisent'</span><span>))</span>
<span># magnificent
# ...
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>…but some unexpected results are also quite possible:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>'rielistik'</span><span>))</span>
<span># Suggestion[ngram](Kristie)      # The first ones feel "just wrong" for a human :(
# Suggestion[ngram](Christlike)
# Suggestion[ngram](relist)
# Suggestion[ngram](Listerine)
# Suggestion[phonet](realistic)   # Oh, here we are -- phonetic suggestion
# Suggestion[phonet](moralistic)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last example brings us to…</p>

<h3 id="phonetic-similarity-useful-yet-unused">Phonetic similarity: useful yet unused</h3>

<p>The “rielistik” example shows a very typical spelling error of a child or non-native language user: the word is spelled close to its remembered pronunciation. Correcting this class of errors requires understanding of the <strong>phonetic similarity</strong> of two lexicographically different words. It is an important feature of a spellchecker—and Hunspell actually implements it… But it so happens that almost no Hunspell user can make use of it. We’ll discuss the reason in a few paragraphs, but first, let’s see how it works.</p>

<p>Phonetic similarity suggestion, like the n-gram-based suggestion, is performed via a full dictionary search. But the similarity is calculated between <em>metaphones codes</em> of misspelled word and each stem, instead of their literal values. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphone">Metaphone</a> is defined in Wikipedia as “a phonetic algorithm […] for indexing words by their English pronunciation”: it is a way of converting words into such representation (metaphone code) that similarly-pronounced words have same or similar representations.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>spylls.hunspell.algo.phonet_suggest</span> <span>import</span> <span>metaphone</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>metaphone</span><span>(</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>aff</span><span>.</span><span>PHONE</span><span>,</span> <span>'rielistik'</span><span>))</span>
<span># RLSTK
</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>metaphone</span><span>(</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>aff</span><span>.</span><span>PHONE</span><span>,</span> <span>'realistic'</span><span>))</span>
<span># RLSTK
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hunspell/algo_phonet_suggest.html#spylls.hunspell.algo.phonet_suggest.metaphone"><code>metaphone</code></a> (which is the method used by phonetic suggest internally) needs data from aff-file. <code>PHONE</code> directive stores the table of phonetic equivalence in <a href="http://aspell.net/man-html/Phonetic-Code.html">quite complicated format</a>, which was initially designed for aspell spellchecker. Hunspell is an international product, so it can’t include the data for language-specific algorithms in its code and transfers the responsibility of providing it to the dictionary authors.</p>

<p>And here lies the <strong>first problem</strong> of the phonetic suggestions: of all LibreOffice and Firefox dictionaries I’ve checked, only one has <code>PHONE</code> table defined, namely, <code>en_ZA</code> (South African English). Even other English dictionaries—American, British, Canadian, etc.—don’t use this table for reasons that are a mystery for me (but the table is definitely not SA-English specific). I am also not aware of any attempt to create a <code>PHONE</code>-table for languages other than English, though there are several pronunciation-encoding algorithms. Many are multi-lingual or designed for languages other than English (for example, <a href="https://abydos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abydos.phonetic.html">abydos</a> Python package lists and implements two dozens of state-of-the-art ones).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>en_US</code> dictionary that is distributed with Spylls and used for examples in this article is a Frankenstein made from the latest dictionary from the <a href="http://wordlist.aspell.net/dicts/">SCOWL</a> project (it doesn’t have <code>PHONE</code>), plus <code>PHONE</code> table from the dictionary <a href="http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/en_US.zip">stored</a> on Hunspell’s site which is recommended by Hunspell for suggestion quality testing (the README says it is OpenOffice dictionary from 2007).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>second problem</strong> with Hunspell’s implementation is that, unlike n-gram-based suggestion search, it iterates <strong>only through root stems</strong>. E.g., no word with suffix or prefix would ever be found this way, significantly limiting the probability of a relevant suggestion.</p>

<p><em>Akchualy</em>, I had to spend some time to find the misspelling of “actually” for this article’s title: most of the others wouldn’t have “actually” in a list of suggestions. The phonetic suggestion could’ve solved the issues (as all misspellings have metaphones very similar to the correct word):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>([</span><span>metaphone</span><span>(</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>aff</span><span>.</span><span>PHONE</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span><span>)</span>
      <span>for</span> <span>word</span> <span>in</span> <span>[</span><span>'actually'</span><span>,</span> <span>'akshually'</span><span>,</span> <span>'akchualy'</span><span>,</span> <span>'akshully'</span><span>]])</span>
<span># ['*KTL', '*KXL', '*KXL', '*KXL']
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>…but the expected suggestion isn’t provided by Hunspell (or Spylls):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>'akshually'</span><span>))</span>
<span># Suggestion[ngram](squally)
# Suggestion[phonet](eggshell)
# Suggestion[phonet](catchall)
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>…because stem “actual” + suffix “ly” will never be considered by phonetic suggest. The same is true for, say, the word “excersized” …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p>Thought experiment: should the use of non-cryptographically secure <code>random()</code> be flagged to developers (examples: <a href="https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blacklists/blacklist_calls.html#b311-random" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bandit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/securego/gosec/blob/a4746e18e3df52bfb21f59420d2c57cb12ef40ec/rules/rand.go#L44" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gosec</a>)? Assume we find the function calls 100% accurately (all true positives, no false positives), and we prevent merging when it’s present.</p>
<p>Academics would say yes — the <code>random()</code> rule always detects what it promises and could be a vulnerability. But the practitioners amongst us are likely to hesitate — does it matter enough to stop engineers’ work? Isn’t <code>random()</code> often used for non-cryptographically sensitive operations?</p>
<p>Herein lies the disconnect between static analysis theory and practice: the world’s most accurate static analysis rule is valueless if developers don’t agree the result has impact, yet as an industry we use the rate of true vs. false positives as the measure of quality.</p>
<p>At r2c we wanted to know how static analysis rules for Semgrep perform in practice. So we set out to create a better metric for <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs/managing-findings/#analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semgrep App</a> users. We call it Fix Rate.</p>
<p>Fix Rate is the percentage of merge-blocking findings that are fixed (i.e., not muted*) in CI. We believe this is a proxy for engineering value. As we run our own developer-focused security programs, we’re obsessing over how to increase the Fix Rate for the rules on our projects.</p>

<p>Observing a bad 0% Fix Rate for <code>random()</code> (with only 7 data points from our projects), we decided to silence the rule for r2c developers but send a Slack notification to the security team using <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs/managing-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-policy projects</a> and <a href="https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-action/#audit-mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CI audit mode</a>. Even in this first version, we’re finding Fix Rate incredibly powerful for evolving our own rules, policies, and development practices.</p>
<p>We shared Fix Rate with the Figma security team early on, which they used for rule development.</p>

<p><em>With its GitHub integration, Semgrep brings security analysis to where development happens. Figmates get security feedback in their PRs, while rule analytics gives the security team feedback on the effectiveness of our rules and patterns. The simple grep like syntax allows us to extend Semgrep to catch new patterns, going from idea to live in an hour.</em></p>

<p>We’re excited for developer action to determine the efficacy of static analysis rules. For this you need to surface real findings to real engineers writing real code; no pre-existing benchmark will suffice.</p>

      <div>
  
  <p><span>09 Feb 2021</span></p><p>Anyone who ever tried to cross-compile a C/C++ program knows how big a PITA the whole process could be. The main reasons for this sorry state of things are generally how byzantine build systems tend to be when configuring for cross-compilation, and how messy it is to set-up your cross toolchain in the first place.</p>

<p>One of the main culprits in my experience has been the GNU toolchain, the decades-old behemoth upon which the POSIXish world has been built for years.
Like many compilers of yore, GCC and its <code>binutils</code> brethren were never designed with the intent to support multiple targets within a single setup, with he only supported approach being installing a full cross build for each triple you wish to target on any given host.</p>

<p>For instance, assuming you wish to build something for FreeBSD on your Linux machine using GCC, you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A GCC + binutils install for your host triplet (i.e., <code>x86_64-pc-linux-gnu</code> or similar);</li>
  <li>A GCC + binutils complete install for your target triplet (i.e. <code>x86_64-unknown-freebsd12.2-gcc</code>, <code>as</code>, <code>nm</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>A sysroot containing the necessary libraries and headers, which you can either build yourself or promptly steal from a running installation of FreeBSD.</li>
</ul>

<p>This process is sometimes made simpler by Linux distributions or hardware vendors offering a selection of prepackaged compilers, but this will never suffice due to the sheer amount of possible host-target combinations. This sometimes means you have to build the whole toolchain yourself, something that, unless you rock a quite beefy CPU, tends to be a massive waste of time and power.</p>

<h2 id="clang-as-a-cross-compiler">Clang as a cross compiler</h2>

<p>This annoying limitation is one of the reasons why I got interested in LLVM (and thus Clang), which is by-design a full-fledged cross compiler toolchain and is mostly compatible with GNU. A single install can output and compile code <em>for every supported target</em>, as long as a complete sysroot is available at build time.</p>

<p>I found this to be a game-changer, and, while it can’t still compete in convenience with modern language toolchains (such as Go’s gc and <code>GOARCH</code>/<code>GOOS</code>), it’s night and day better than the rigmarole of setting up GNU toolchains. You can now just fetch whatever your favorite package management system has available in its repositories (as long as it’s not extremely old), and avoid messing around with multiple installs of GCC.</p>

<p>Until a few years ago, the whole process wasn’t as smooth as it could be. Due to LLVM not having a full toolchain yet available, you were still supposed to provide a <code>binutils</code> build specific for your target. While this is generally much more tolerable than building the whole compiler (<code>binutils</code> is relatively fast to build), it was still somewhat of a nuisance, and I’m glad that <code>llvm-mc</code> (LLVM’s integrated assembler) and <code>lld</code> (universal linker) are finally stable and as flexible as the rest of LLVM.</p>

<p>With the toolchain now set, the next step becomes to obtain a sysroot in order to provide the needed headers and libraries to compile and link for your target.</p>

<h2 id="obtaining-a-sysroot">Obtaining a sysroot</h2>
<p>A super fast way to find a working system directory for a given OS is to rip it straight out of an existing system (a Docker container image will often also do).
For instance, this is how I used <code>tar</code> through <code>ssh</code> as a quick way to extract a working sysroot from a FreeBSD 13-CURRENT AArch64 VM <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ mkdir ~/farm_tree
$ ssh FARM64 'tar cf - /lib /usr/include /usr/lib /usr/local/lib /usr/local/include' | bsdtar xvf - -C $HOME/farm_tree/
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="invoking-the-cross-compiler">Invoking the cross compiler</h2>

<p>With everything set, it’s now only a matter of invoking Clang with the right arguments:</p>

<p>In the snipped above, I have managed to compile and link a C++ file into an executable for AArch64 FreeBSD, all while using just the <code>clang</code> and <code>lld</code> I had already installed on my GNU/Linux system.</p>

<p>More in detail:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>--target</code> switches the LLVM default target (<code>x86_64-pc-linux-gnu</code>) to <code>aarch64-pc-freebsd</code>, thus enabling cross-compilation.</li>
  <li><code>--sysroot</code> forces Clang to assume the specified path as root when searching headers and libraries, instead of the usual paths. Note that sometimes this setting might not be enough, especially if the target uses GCC and Clang somehow fails to detect its install path. This can be easily fixed by specifying <code>--gcc-toolchain</code>, which clarifies where to search for GCC installations.</li>
  <li><code>-fuse-ld=lld</code> tells Clang to use <code>lld</code> instead whatever default the platform uses. As I will explain below, it’s highly unlikely that the system linker understands foreign targets, while LLD can natively support <em>almost</em> every binary format and OS <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</li>
  <li><code>-stdlib=libc++</code> is needed here due to Clang failing to detect that FreeBSD on AArch64 uses LLVM’s <code>libc++</code> instead of GCC’s <code>libstdc++</code>.</li>
  <li><code>-lz</code> is also specified to show how Clang can also resolve other libraries inside the sysroot without issues, in this case, <code>zlib</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The final test is now to copy the binary to our target system (i.e. the VM we ripped the sysroot from before) and check if it works as expected:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>rsync zpipe FARM64:<span>"~"</span>
<span>$ </span>ssh FARM64

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Success! It’s now possible to use this cross toolchain to build larger programs, and below I’ll give a quick example to how to use it to build real projects.</p>

<h3 id="optional-creating-an-llvm-toolchain-directory">Optional: creating an LLVM toolchain directory</h3>

<p>LLVM provides a mostly compatible counterpart for almost every tool shipped by <code>binutils</code> (with the notable exception of <code>as</code> <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>), prefixed with <code>llvm-</code>.</p>

<p>The most critical of these is LLD, which is a drop in replacement for a plaform’s system linker, capable to replace both GNU <code>ld.bfd</code> and <code>gold</code> on GNU/Linux or BSD, and Microsoft’s <code>LINK.EXE</code> when targeting MSVC. It supports linking on (almost) every platform supported by LLVM, thus removing the nuisance to have multiple specific linkers installed.</p>

<p>Both GCC and Clang support using <code>ld.lld</code> instead of the system linker (which may well be <code>lld</code>, like on FreeBSD) via the command line switch <code>-fuse-ld=lld</code>.</p>

<p>In my experience, I found that Clang’s driver might get confused when picking the right linker on some uncommon platforms, especially before version 11.0.
For some reason, <code>clang</code> sometimes decided to outright ignore the <code>-fuse-ld=lld</code> switch and picked the system linker (<code>ld.bfd</code> in my case), which does not support AArch64.</p>

<p>A fast solution to this is to create a toolchain directory containing symlinks that rename the LLVM utilities to the standard <code>binutils</code> programs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> <span>ls</span> <span>-la</span> ~/.llvm/bin/
Permissions Size User  Group Date Modified Name
lrwxrwxrwx    16 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  ar -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-ar
lrwxrwxrwx    12 marco marco  6 Aug  2020  ld -&gt; /usr/bin/lld
lrwxrwxrwx    21 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  objcopy -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-objcopy
lrwxrwxrwx    21 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  objdump -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-objdump
lrwxrwxrwx    20 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  ranlib -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-ranlib
lrwxrwxrwx    21 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  strings -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-strings
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>-B</code> switch can then be used to force Clang (or GCC) to search the required tools in this directory, stopping the issue from ever occurring:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> clang++ <span>-B</span><span>$HOME</span>/.llvm/bin <span>-stdlib</span><span>=</span>libc++ <span>--target</span><span>=</span>aarch64-pc-freebsd <span>--sysroot</span><span>=</span><span>$HOME</span>/farm_tree <span>-std</span><span>=</span>c++17 <span>-o</span> mvd-farm64 mvd.cc

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>What would happen if a &lt;iframe&gt; tag on a page pointed to the same page ? In HTML, iframes are elements designed to display documents under an URL, as if we would load it as we normally do in our browsers. See it as a small window within a web document which can display another web document. For instance, what you see here is an &lt;iframe&gt; pointing to the homepage of this website, <strong>https://ciphrd.com</strong>:</p>







<p><em>On a side note, the technique I am going to present is not really “feedback” per say, it’s more like a regular loop, but it reminds so much of a feedback effect that I found the name appropriate.</em> <strong>Source code at the end.</strong></p>



<h4>1. The most basic &lt;iframe&gt; loop</h4>



<p>Just as a quick reminder, this is how an iframe can be used:</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;iframe src="https://ciphrd.com"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre>



<p>The browser, when coming accros this tag, reads the <em>src</em> attribute and loads the web document under the URL into the area available for the iframe. Such area can be defined with <strong>CSS</strong> rules, or by setting a width and height attribute to the tag. For more informations, see the article about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp" target="_blank">html iframe on W3Schools</a> [1].</p>



<p>Now, the idea behind &lt;iframe&gt; feedback: let the src attribute point to the same location as the page in which the &lt;iframe&gt; is displayed. To experiment with such idea, I built a very simple html page and I hosted it on a local server at <strong>http://localhost:8080/</strong></p>



<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;!doctype&nbsp;html&gt;
&lt;html&nbsp;lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;charset="UTF-8"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;name="viewport"&nbsp;content="width=device-width"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;iframe loop&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;iframe&nbsp;loop&lt;/h1&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;iframe&nbsp;src="http://localhost:8080"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>



<p>By loading http://localhost:8080/ in the browser, the document should be displayed and the &lt;iframe&gt; should display the same document, over and over. With some very simple rules we can define the size of our iframe:</p>



<pre><code lang="css">iframe&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;width:&nbsp;500px;
&nbsp;&nbsp;height:&nbsp;320px;
}

h1&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin:&nbsp;20px;
}</code></pre>



<p>Let’s see how it is handled by chrome (88.0.4324.150):</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="350" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg 922w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-300x181.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-768x464.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"><figcaption>1. Our most basic example</figcaption></figure>



<p>Oh, that’s weird. It looks like the browser only loads the first &lt;iframe&gt; and then prevents an infinite loop from happening by removing the contents of the 2nd nested &lt;iframe&gt;. A quick inspection of the HTML tree will confirm our hypothesis:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="734" height="459" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tree-inspection.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tree-inspection.jpg 734w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tree-inspection-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px"><figcaption>2. Inspecting the HTML tree computed by Chrome</figcaption></figure>



<p>So, the hypothesis is verified. We cannot nest infinite &lt;iframe&gt; tags because the browser prevents it, which is normal if we think about it. We wouldn’t want our computer to freeze if we were to load a webpage using such a trick.</p>



<h4>2. How to nest any number of &lt;iframe&gt;</h4>



<p>The issue here, is that the &lt;iframe&gt; tag is already present on the document loaded by the browser. Let’s see what happens if we insert the tag after the page has loaded, using javascript. Let’s reduce our HTML page to the following:</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;!doctype&nbsp;html&gt;
&lt;html&nbsp;lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;charset="UTF-8"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;name="viewport"&nbsp;content="width=device-width"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;Iframe&nbsp;loop&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;iframe&nbsp;loop&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>



<p>And let’s write some Javascript which will insert the tag as soon as the page is loaded:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">const&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;=&nbsp;document.createElement('iframe')
iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.href
document.body.append(iframe)</code></pre>



<p>The following javascript code needs to be loaded in the page somehow, the &lt;script&gt; tag can be used in that matter. However, because I am using <strong>webpack</strong>, my javascript gets automatically added to the document. The project I created for you to experiment with iframe feedback has the same feature, I’ll explain in <strong>on the last part of this article</strong>. For now, just assume that the javascript is added to the page. Let’s see what happens now:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="922" height="557" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg 922w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-300x181.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-768x464.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px"><figcaption>3. Inserting the &lt;iframe&gt; tag programatically</figcaption></figure>



<p>The same issue remains. Maybe we can try with a delay ?</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">setTimeout(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;this&nbsp;code&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;executed&nbsp;1000ms&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;script&nbsp;has&nbsp;loaded</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;=&nbsp;document.createElement('iframe')
&nbsp;&nbsp;iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.href
&nbsp;&nbsp;document.body.append(iframe)
},&nbsp;1000)</code></pre>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="922" height="557" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg 922w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-300x181.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-768x464.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px"><figcaption>4. Inserting the &lt;iframe&gt; tag after a delay of 1sec</figcaption></figure>



<p>Okay, so it looks like we cannot just nest infinite &lt;iframe&gt; this way. Maybe we need to trick the browser into thinking that the page displayed is not the same. To do that, I configured my local server so that any path provided after the URL will point to the index.html. So, if I try to load <strong>http://localhost:8080/home</strong>, <strong>http://localhost:8080/cucumber</strong>, <strong>http://localhost:8080/zeagjaga/ergjergeg/erg</strong>,… , the same index.html file will be loaded. We can now configure our script to set the <strong>src</strong> tag to the same domain plus a random string of characters:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">setTimeout(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;=&nbsp;document.createElement('iframe')
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;adds&nbsp;a&nbsp;random&nbsp;string&nbsp;of&nbsp;7&nbsp;characters&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;domain</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.origin&nbsp;+&nbsp;'/'&nbsp;+&nbsp;Math.random().toFixed(7).replace('.',&nbsp;'')
&nbsp;&nbsp;document.body.append(iframe)
},&nbsp;1000)</code></pre>



<p>Let’s see what happens…</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="921" height="558" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-its-looping.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-its-looping.jpg 921w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-its-looping-300x182.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-its-looping-768x465.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 921px) 100vw, 921px"><figcaption>5. Iframes with a different URL pointing to the same page</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hehehe</strong>… It’s working. A quick inspection of the DOM can confirm this hypothesis:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="687" height="533" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5-looping-DOM.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5-looping-DOM.jpg 687w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5-looping-DOM-300x233.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px"><figcaption>6. The DOM of our infinite nested iframes</figcaption></figure>



<p>Wonderful ! So, to nest “<em>self-replicating</em>” &lt;iframe&gt; tags, the constraints are the following:</p>



<ul><li>the URL path must be different</li><li>a server must be configured so that different URL points to the same document</li></ul>



<p>That’s it. We don’t even need the delay before inserting the &lt;iframe&gt;. I will keep it though, I don’t really want the browser to crash because of that (not that it will, but if we want to do more fun stuff than just adding a new &lt;iframe&gt;, it might).</p>



<h4>3. Having fun</h4>



<p>Now that we found a way to load as many nested &lt;iframe&gt; as we want, let’s have some fun ! First, let’s change the size of an &lt;iframe&gt; so that its dimensions are relative to the viewport area it renders to:</p>



<pre><code lang="css">iframe&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;width:&nbsp;90vw;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;90%&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;width</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height:&nbsp;90vh;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;90%&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;height</em>
}

h1&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;position:&nbsp;absolute;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;makes&nbsp;the&nbsp;title&nbsp;"float"&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;top&nbsp;left</em>
}</code></pre>



<p>Which will give us a way better result in terms of space occupation of the iframe elements:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="921" height="559" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-better-size.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-better-size.jpg 921w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-better-size-300x182.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-better-size-768x466.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 921px) 100vw, 921px"><figcaption>7. &lt;iframe&gt; dimensions are related to their parent dimensions</figcaption></figure>



<p>I guess you understand now why I called this technique <em>iframe feedback</em>. It just looks like it. However, <strong>this is by no mean true feedback</strong>.</p>



<p>We can remove the title and assign a random color to the background of the body to create a simple color effect:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript"><em>//&nbsp;set&nbsp;a&nbsp;random&nbsp;color&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;body&nbsp;background,&nbsp;&nbsp;x|0&nbsp;removes&nbsp;the&nbsp;decimal&nbsp;part&nbsp;of&nbsp;x</em>
document.body.style.backgroundColor&nbsp;=&nbsp;`rgba(${(Math.random()*255)|0},&nbsp;${(Math.random()*255)|0},&nbsp;${(Math.random()*255)|0},&nbsp;1)`

setTimeout(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;=&nbsp;document.createElement('iframe')
&nbsp;&nbsp;iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.origin&nbsp;+&nbsp;'/'&nbsp;+&nbsp;Math.random().toFixed(7).replace('.',&nbsp;'')
&nbsp;&nbsp;document.body.append(iframe)
},&nbsp;200)</code></pre>



<figure><video controls="" muted="" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8-simple-colors.mp4"></video><figcaption>8. Setting a random color to the body of the document</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you are familiar with writing web applications, you may see now how much fun we can have with this technique. Let’s try adding some <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations" target="_blank">CSS animations</a></strong> [2] to the position of the &lt;iframe&gt;:</p>



<pre><code lang="css">body&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin:&nbsp;0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;overflow:&nbsp;hidden;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;hides&nbsp;the&nbsp;scrollbar&nbsp;if&nbsp;window&nbsp;gets&nbsp;too&nbsp;small</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;width:&nbsp;100vw;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;set&nbsp;the&nbsp;body&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;same&nbsp;size&nbsp;as&nbsp;the&nbsp;viewport</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height:&nbsp;100vh;
}

<em>@keyframes</em>&nbsp;move&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top:&nbsp;0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left:&nbsp;0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top:&nbsp;10vh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left:&nbsp;10vw;
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}

iframe&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;width:&nbsp;90vw;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;90%&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;width</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height:&nbsp;90vh;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;90%&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;height</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;position:&nbsp;absolute;
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;the&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;with&nbsp;receive&nbsp;animation&nbsp;move&nbsp;and&nbsp;loops&nbsp;by&nbsp;alternating&nbsp;directions</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;animation:&nbsp;move&nbsp;1s&nbsp;ease-in-out&nbsp;0s&nbsp;infinite&nbsp;alternate-reverse;
}</code></pre>



<p>I’m not going into in-depth details about what this CSS animation does. But here is the result:</p>



<figure><video controls="" muted="" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9-animatee-position.mp4"></video><figcaption>9. Animating the iframe position using CSS rules</figcaption></figure>



<p>We can add some rotation to the animation:</p>



<pre><code lang="css"><em>@keyframes</em>&nbsp;move&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top:&nbsp;0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left:&nbsp;0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transform:&nbsp;rotate(-20deg);
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top:&nbsp;10vh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left:&nbsp;10vw;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transform:&nbsp;rotate(20deg);
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</code></pre>



<figure><video controls="" muted="" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9-adding-rotation.mp4"></video><figcaption>10. Adding rotation to the CSS animation</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pretty fun ! What’s great is that we can take fulfill of all the sweet features made available by our browsers to have fun with this technique. Some issues remain though:</p>



<ul><li>&lt;iframe&gt; tags are added indefinitely</li><li>each &lt;iframe&gt; is independent, we have no way to know its position in the tree</li></ul>



<p>Let’s solve those issues and create a basic starting point from which <strong>experimentation with this technique can safely be done </strong>!</p>



<h4>4. Improving the solution</h4>



<p>First of all, we can define an easy solution to prevent iframes from being inserted indefinitely. If the viewport size reaches 0, there is no need to insert an iframe because it won’t have any effect on the screen:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript"><em>try</em>&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>if</em>&nbsp;(window.innerWidth&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;window.innerHeight&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;1)&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>throw</em>&nbsp;new&nbsp;Error()&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;exit</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}

&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;otherwise&nbsp;add&nbsp;the&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;as&nbsp;usual</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;...</em>
}
<em>catch</em>&nbsp;(error)&nbsp;{}&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;exit</em></code></pre>



<p>The trick I am using here provides a way to <em>exit</em> the main script by using the try… catch mechanism. If we throw an error in the <strong>try</strong>{} block, what’s after will be skipped and the <strong>catch</strong>{} block will be triggered. If there were no catch block, the script would still stop but the error would be sent to the <strong>console as “Uncaught Error”</strong>. Yes, that’s what it is.</p>



<p>We now have a safe guard to prevent infinite looping in most cases. What we could need is to find a way to get the index of the document in the &lt;iframe&gt; <strong>nested nightmare</strong>. Remember, we currently use the following trick to call for a new iframe:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.origin&nbsp;+&nbsp;'/'&nbsp;+&nbsp;Math.random().toFixed(7).replace('.',&nbsp;'')</code></pre>



<p>The <strong>location </strong>object [3] has different properties we can use to solve our problem. Let’s see what the <strong>location object</strong> is on the page <em>https://ciphrd.com/category/laboratory/</em> :</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="565" height="286" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-location.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-location.jpg 565w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-location-300x152.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px"><figcaption>11. The Location object on <em>https://ciphrd.com/category/laboratory/</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It seems like the <strong>origin </strong>property stores whats before the first <strong>/</strong> and the <strong>pathname</strong> stores what’s after the origin (https://ciphrd.com), including the first <strong>/</strong>. Let’s use those properties to keep track of the index of each frame:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript"><em>//&nbsp;gets&nbsp;what's&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;first&nbsp;/&nbsp;,&nbsp;so&nbsp;the&nbsp;first&nbsp;url&nbsp;path</em>
<em>//&nbsp;or&nbsp;0&nbsp;if&nbsp;the&nbsp;path&nbsp;is&nbsp;empty&nbsp;(so&nbsp;t…</em></code></pre></div></div>

ago. You can eliminate much of your complexity and cost by using SQLite &amp;
Litestream for your production applications.</em></p><h2 id="when-i-was-your-age">When I was your age…</h2><p>I can tell I’m getting old because I talk about the “good old days” of computing.
Back when knowing a single programming language and SQL was good enough to work
at most jobs. Back when you could build all your web pages with basic HTML skills.</p><p>But the good old days weren’t actually that good.</p><p>They kinda sucked.</p><p>In 1995, the <a href="https://tedium.co/2019/10/01/lamp-stack-php-mysql-apache-history/">LAMP stack</a> emerged. It was a combination of Linux, Apache,
MySQL, &amp; PHP. It’s a simple stack that all lived on one box. Unfortunately, that
box was stocked with a CPU that was measured in megahertz and memory that was
measured in megabytes. It was dog slow.</p><p>But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s Law</a> promised a better future as computers became
exponentially faster. So why do we need more computers than ever before?</p><h3 id="where-it-went-wrong">Where it went wrong</h3><p>Since early web languages like PHP and Ruby were slow, you didn’t want them
running on your database server so you moved them to their own servers in what
is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture">n-tier architecture</a>. Now you can keep adding more
stateless Ruby servers to this <em>presentation layer</em> and scale your application.</p><p>Database servers like Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL tended to be complicated to
operate so this architecture helped to isolate them. Scaling and managing
a fleet of database servers is a nighmare so organizations scale up their
database machine vertically as much as possible before they scaled horizontally
to multiple servers.</p><p>This n-tier architecture sounds simple at first but it has hidden complexity. On
a single machine, our server could add an in-memory cache to speed up requests
but now data is shared across multiple machines so we must add a <a href="https://memcached.org/">memcached</a>
or <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> server to share cached data. Database servers are easily overloaded
by numerous connections so we have to add intermediate services like
<a href="https://www.pgbouncer.org/">PgBouncer</a> to pool connections. If we have events in our system that must be
communicated to all our nodes then we need a cluster of <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> machines.</p><p>Now we have a fleet of machines to manage. These systems have then caused an
explosion in infrastructure automation with tooling like <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>. All of
these layers slow us down from our job of writing software systems that solve
real problems.</p><p>What started as a simple two-tier software system has grown into a behemoth with
a dozen layers of complexity.</p><p>Complexity begets complexity.</p><h2 id="building-litestream">Building Litestream</h2><p>My background is in writing databases. Seven years ago, I wrote a pure Go,
embedded key/value store called <a href="http://github.com/boltdb/bolt">BoltDB</a> that has seen success in other
open-source applications that use it such as <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a>.</p><p>For a while, I used Bolt when writing applications and it was refreshing because
there were no depedencies to set up and performance was <em>blazingly fast</em>.
However, it lacked features like schema migration, a query language, or a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> so it made application development difficult. But instead of going back
to database servers like Postgres, I turned to <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>.</p><h3 id="moving-to-sqlite">Moving to SQLite</h3><p><em>“But nobody writes production applications with SQLite, right?"</em></p><p>No, there’s a growing movement of people that see the value of single process
applications. Expensify has run tests of <a href="https://blog.expensify.com/2018/01/08/scaling-sqlite-to-4m-qps-on-a-single-server/">4 million queries per second on a

<a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> that’s built on SQLite.</p><p>SQLite is known for being bulletproof and having an <a href="https://litestream.io/blog/why-i-built-litestream/sqlite-testing">absurdly in-depth testing
suite</a>. It’s motto is <em>“Small. Fast. Reliable. Choose any three."</em></p><p>So why is SQLite considered a “toy” database in the application development
world and not a production database?</p><h3 id="that-one-big-issue">That one big issue</h3><p>The biggest problem with using SQLite in production is disaster recovery. If
your server dies, so does your data. That’s… not good.</p><p>Other database servers have replication so they can stream database changes to
another server in case one goes down. The best you can hope for with standard
SQLite is to run a nightly backup. Solutions like <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite">rqlite</a> are great but
it requires a 3-node cluster.</p><p>Why can’t SQLite have a replication tool that’s as easy to use as SQLite?</p><h3 id="the-problem-litestream-solves">The problem Litestream solves</h3><p>I built Litestream to bring back sanity to application development. Litestream
is a tool that runs in a separate process and continuously replicates a SQLite
database to Amazon S3. You can get up and running with a few
lines of configuration. Then you can set-it-and-forget-it and get back to
writing code.</p><p>You might think this sounds expensive to continuously write to cloud storage
that provides <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/">99.99% uptime</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/">99.999999999% durability</a> but
it’s astoundingly cheap. Typical costs are only about $1 per month. Litestream
is free and open-source too so there’s never a license to pay for.</p><h3 id="but-i-need-100-uptime">But I need 100% uptime…</h3><p>The software industry has chased uptime as a goal in and of itself over the last
several decades. Solutions such as Kubernetes tout the benefits of zero-downtime
deployments but ignore that their inherent complexity causes availability
issues. <a href="https://k8s.af/">There’s even a web site dedicated to public postmortems related to
Kubernetes.</a></p><p>Most cloud providers provide multiple layers of redundancy in their systems to
protect against individual node and network failures. This doesn’t provide a
100% guarantee but will provide you with very high uptime servers. Anecdotally,
I’ve run several VPS servers over the years which all have well over 99.9%
uptime and have suffered no catastrophic failures.</p><h3 id="sounds-good-but-how-do-you-scale-this">Sounds good, but how do you scale this?</h3><p>Developers always want to know how to scale but that depends on their particular
application. Typically, you want to scale vertically first by simply increasing
amount of CPUs cores and RAM on your machine first.</p><p>Servers these days have a <em>ton</em> of power. I recently wrote a Go web application
with a SQLite database that would serve an HTTP request with multiple database
queries in under <em>50µs</em> on a $5/month VPS. That translates to thousands of
requests per second per core. SQLite scales reads well with the number of cores
on a machine. Amazon AWS has machines that can then scale up to 96 CPU cores and
hundreds of gigabytes of RAM.</p><p>If you exceed the capacity of a single node, sharding your data can allow you to
scale horizontally to multiple nodes. This works particularly well for SaaS
applications where each customer is isolated from one another. Because SQLite
and Litestream simplify deployment, managing a cluster of several isolated nodes
is easy to maintain.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-litestream">The Future of Litestream</h2><p>Litestream is helping to simplify application development but that’s only the
start of it. There are exciting features coming including replication to
<a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/issues/8">read-only replicas</a>. This will give you the ability to run local
copies of your database at the edge to deliver requests instantly.</p><p>If you’re interested in trying out Litestream, the <a href="https://litestream.io/getting-started">Getting
Started</a> can get you up and running in less than 10 minutes.</p><p>I’m interested to hear from others that want to simplify and improve application
development. If you have ideas or thoughts about the future of Litestream,
please get in touch on the <a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/discussions">GitHub Discussions board</a> and drop me a

<p>
  Cosmopolitan lets you build executables that run natively on seven
  operating systems. One of the first questions C/C++ developers ask is
  how much bloat does that entail? Is the Cosmopolitan Runtime lean and
  mean like Go's 2mb Hello World executables? Or is it a monster like
  Electron or those hundred megabyte OpenJDK shell scripts.

</p><p>
  The answer is it takes about 12kb. That's how big a statically-linked
  executable needs to be to run natively without dependencies on Linux,
  Mac, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and BIOS. Cosmopolitan is
  designed to let you build such programs. This page will demonstrate
  why the portability benefits Cosmopolitan provides have negligible
  performance impact and therefore only serve to save time while
  ensuring your work can reach a broader audience.

  The form below lets you build and visualize hello world programs with
  a customized support vector. It will show you exactly what goes into
  an <a href="https://justine.lol/ape.html" title="Actually Portable Executable">αcτµαlly
  pδrταblε εxεcµταblε</a> that lets it integrate with so many systems.
  Since seeing is believing, the hope is that you'll choose to trust
  Cosmopolitan as your POSIX-comforming systems abstraction.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>React was introduced in May 2013. Its paradigm shift was that <strong>your UI was a function of your state</strong>. Given some component state, React can determine what your component will look like. React is <em>built</em> upon the idea of state. However, state has long been one of the most difficult parts of building a React application.</p><p>Let's imagine state management in React as a rugged tool belt. You've used this tool belt for years, slowly adding new tools as needed. Each tool serves a very specific purpose. You don't use your hammer to screw in bolts. As a craftsman, you've learned the right time and place to use each tool.</p><p><strong>State management with React is a rugged tool belt, but not everyone has the prior experience to know which tool to reach for.</strong> This post will explain the past, present, and future of state management to help you make the correct decision for your team, project, or organization.</p><h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2><p>Before we begin, it's critical you understand some of the terms commonly used. These aren't the canonical names. A few different variations of each float around, but the underlying ideas are the same:</p><ul><li>UI State â€“ State used for controlling interactive parts of our application (e.g. dark mode toggle, modals).</li><li>Server Cache State â€“ State from the server, which we cache on the client-side for quick access (e.g. call an API, store the result, use it in multiple places).</li><li>Form State â€“ The many different states of a form (e.g. loading, submitting, disabled, validation, retrying). There's also <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html">controlled &amp; uncontrolled form state</a>.</li><li>URL State â€“ State managed by the browser (e.g. filter products, saving to query parameters, and refreshing the page to see the same products filtered)</li><li>State Machine â€“ An explicit model of your state over time (e.g. a stoplight goes from green â†’ yellow â†’ red, but never green â†’ red).</li></ul><h2 id="past">Past</h2><p>React's component model helped create reusable, composable applications. Each component had its own local state. As web apps became more complex, new solutions emerged to more easily share logic between components.</p><h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3><p>To help you understand how state management has evolved over time, here's a rough timeline of popular state management solutions in React. This list is heavily focused on UI State. This list is not comprehensive, but is enough to give context.</p><ul><li>2013 â€“ Introduction</li><li>2014 â€“ Flux (many libraries)</li><li>2015 â€“ Redux</li><li>2016 â€“ MobX</li><li>2018 â€“ Context</li><li>2019 â€“ Hooks Introduced (+ React Query, SWR)</li><li>2019 â€“ Zustand</li><li>2019 â€“ xState</li><li>2020 â€“ Jotai, Recoil, Valtio</li><li>2021 â€“ useSelectedContext</li></ul><p>Just because an item is listed on this timeline does not mean you need to learn it. More on this later. Let's dive into the history of state management in React.</p><h3 id="redux">Redux</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/">Redux</a> was originally created as an implementation of the "<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/#redux-was-built-as-a-flux-architecture-implementation">Flux Architecture</a>", which was a pattern first suggested by Facebook in 2014. Redux came out in 2015 and quickly became the most popular of many Flux-inspired libraries. It's ecosystem of tools and libraries encapsulated both UI state and server caching state. <strong>Redux is still extremely popular and widely used.</strong></p><div><p><img alt="Redux Growth" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><h3 id="server-caching-state">Server Caching State</h3><p>In the early days of React, lots of state management boiled down to fetching data from APIs and caching it for use across the application. The community leaned heavily on libraries like Redux because there wasn't an easy, widely used way to manage <em>just</em> the server cache state.</p><p>With the release of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html">React Hooks</a>, encapsulating logic into shared hooks became much easier and accessible. Libraries like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://swr.vercel.app/">SWR</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/">React Query</a> emerged to solve this problem specifically.</p><p>You might think "Why have a separate library just for server caching state?". Well, <strong>caching is hard</strong>. Server caching state solves different problems than UI state. Here's a shortlist of some of the things these libraries handle for you:</p><ul><li>Polling on interval</li><li>Revalidation on focus</li><li>Revalidation on network recovery</li><li>Local mutation (Optimistic UI)</li><li>Smart error retrying</li><li>Pagination and scroll position recovery</li></ul><p>Do you want to implement those yourself? <em>Probably not.</em></p><h3 id="react-context">React Context</h3><p>With <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/29/react-v-16-3.html">v16.3</a>, React Context gave us a first-party solution to share logic between components. This also prevented passing values down as props through multiple levels of nested components (i.e. "<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling">prop-drilling</a>").</p><p>React Context itself is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2021/01/context-redux-differences/">not state management</a>. It can, however, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react">be paired with hooks</a> like <code>useReducer</code> to become a state management solution. This combination solved UI state for many common use cases.</p><div><p><img alt="React Context" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><h2 id="present">Present</h2><p>In 2021, there are various ways to handle state management in React. As the community has grown to understand the different types of state, more granular libraries have been created solving very specific use cases.</p><h3 id="state-machines">State Machines</h3><p>Let's consider a switch statement. If the value of <code>state</code> matches any <code>case</code>, the corresponding code runs. There's a finite set of cases. This is the most simple state machine â€“ an explicit model of your state.</p><pre><code><span>switch</span> <span>(</span>state<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>case</span> state <span>===</span> <span>'loading'</span><span>:</span>
    
    <span>break</span><span>;</span>
  <span>case</span> state <span>===</span> <span>'success'</span><span>:</span>
    
    <span>break</span><span>;</span>
  <span>default</span><span>:</span>
  
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://xstate.js.org/docs/about/concepts.html#finite-state-machines">Finite State Machines</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://xstate.js.org/docs/about/concepts.html#statecharts">Statecharts</a> are fundamental Computer Science concepts, so this isn't anything React specific. You can turn <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer"><code>useReducer</code></a> into a state machine without any third-party libraries.</p><p>State Machines are well-adopted everywhere, including databases, electronics, cars, and more. As state management evolved in the React ecosystem, we realized these old ideas could solve modern state management issues. State Machines are most prevalent for solving form state.</p><p>With a Finite State Machine, you have a finite number of states your application or component could be in. In practice, State Machines help you uncover bugs as you're required to think through and define edge cases. For much more information on this, I'd recommend checking out the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://xstate.js.org/docs/">xState</a> docs or watching <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-state-machines-using-xstate">this course</a>. You can also <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://xstate.js.org/viz/">visualize entire state machines online</a>.</p><div><p><img alt="State Machines" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><h3 id="zustand-recoil-jotai-valtio-oh-my">Zustand, Recoil, Jotai, Valtio, Oh My!</h3><p>Why do so many different libraries for React state management even exist?</p><p>Let's consider Figma (or any other design tool). You have a toolbar of controls that affect other elements outside of its "local" state, or where the component is rendered.</p><div><p><img alt="Figma" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>As you can imagine, an application of this scale would require a complex state management solution. Performance and frame rate are critical for a good user experience here, so you want control over when &amp; how to re-render. Unique use cases like this have led to lots of exploration in the state management space.</p><p>To summarize the differences between these libraries, let's hear from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/dai_shi/status/1348257768130560008">Daishi Kato</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Valtio</strong> uses proxies to provide a mutation-style API</li><li><strong>Jotai</strong> is optimized for "computed values" and async actions</li><li><strong>Zustand</strong> is a very thin library specifically focused on module state</li><li><strong>Recoil</strong> is an experimental library using a data-flow graph</li></ul><p>Having complex state doesn't necessarily mean you <em>have</em> to pull for a third-party library. You can start with React and JavaScript and see how far it takes you. If optimizing requires a state management library, you can track that metric (e.g. frame rate), measure it, and verify it solves a real problem.</p><p><strong>Don't choose one of these libraries unless there's an obvious need.</strong></p><h3 id="immutable-state">Immutable State</h3><p>Another debate is mutable vs. immutable state. There's no right answers, just opinions. If you were doing state management with vanilla JavaScript, you'll likely have mutable state. You initialize a variable, and then later set it equal to some new value. There are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://overreacted.io/on-let-vs-const/">entire debates</a> on <code>let</code> vs. <code>const</code>.</p><p>Immutable state gained a lot of popularity with React. The immutable crowd argues that allowing your state management solution of choice to mutate state directly results in more bugs. The mutable crowd argues it's not worth the complexity trade-off. Direct manipulation will always be less safe than indirect manipulation. It's a tradeoff between convenience and risk, which is up to you and your team.</p><p>Solutions like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://overreacted.io/on-let-vs-const/">Immer</a> allow you to write mutable code but <em>execute</em> it immutably. Fancy. The basic idea is you apply your changes to a <em>draft state</em>, which is a proxy of the <em>current state</em>. Once the mutations have completed Immer will produce the <em>next state</em> based on the changes to the draft state.</p><div><p><img alt="Immer Immutable State" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><h3 id="url-state">URL State</h3><p>Let's say you're building an e-commerce website like Amazon. You search for React books and filter by 4+ stars. This state is persisted as query parameters and managed by the browser. When you refresh the page, you see the same list of products. You can share this URL with others and they also see the same results.</p><div><p><img alt="Amazon URL State" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Another interesting example of this is Nomad List. We can transform the browser URL state into a function of our data. Plus, we can make human-readable URLs (which Google prefers).</p><div><p><img alt="Nomad List URL State" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><h3 id="future">Future</h3><p>For large applications, it's possible a naive Context-based state management solutions (e.g. with <code>useReducer</code>) could have issues with excessive re-rendering. When a context value changes, all components that <code>useContext</code> will re-render. This makes UI interactions feel slow and janky. If you can't visually notice it, you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://brycedooley.com/debug-react-rerenders/">use React Dev Tools</a> to investigate re-rendering.</p><p>The React team has proposed a <code>useSelectedContext</code> hook to prevent performance issues with Context at scale. This <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/119">RFC was introduced</a> in July 2019 and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20646">progress has started</a> as of January 2021 behind a feature flag. This hook allows you to select a "slice" of Context and only re-render when that piece changes.</p><p>There are ways to work around re-rendering performance already (e.g. <code>useMemo</code>) but a first-party solution for Context is preferred. There's also a community library <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector">useContextSelector</a>, which takes a similar approach (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/usecontextselector-demo-sixdr?file=/src/App.js">demo</a>). <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai">Jotai</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://formik.org/blog/formik-3-alpha">Formik 3</a> use this under the hood. Having <code>useSelectedContext</code> as part of the React standard library will eliminate complexity and code size in external libraries, as well as provide more performant options by default.</p><p>In the longer-term future, React will automatically figure out which components to re-render ("<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/119#issuecomment-586390430">auto-memoization</a>").</p><h2 id="state-management-options">State Management Options</h2><p>This is not a comprehensive list. It's also open-source, so please open a PR if you disagree or if something is …</p></div></div></div>

<h2><strong>While war corporations, or so-called “defense contractors,” make <u><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/02/21/military-spending-defense-contractors-profiting-from-war-weapons-sales/39092315/">billions in profits</a></u>, Wall Street is the ultimate beneficiary of today’s nonstop wars. The prosaic nature of war profiteering—far from the work of a shadowy cabal—is precisely why the collusion is so destructive and should be outlawed.</strong></h2>



<p>The U.S. ruling class deploys the military for three main reasons: (1) to forcibly open up countries to foreign investment, (2) to ensure the free flow of natural resources from the global south into the hands of multinational corporations, and (3) because war is profitable. The third of these reasons, the profitability of war, is often lacking detail in analyses of U.S. imperialism: The financial industry, including investment banks and private equity firms, is an insatiable force seeking profit via military activity.</p>



<p>The war industry is composed of corporations that sell goods and services to the U.S. government and allied capitalist regimes around the world. Investment banks and asset management firms hold most shares of every major public war corporation. </p>



<blockquote><p>The best-known financial firms holding the stock of war corporations include: Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Wellington Management.</p></blockquote>



<p>Consider Parsons, a corporation that sells goods and services pertaining to construction, command and control, espionage, and day-to-day military operations. Parsons’ initial public offering in May 2019, valued at roughly $3 billion, <a href="https://www.parsons.com/2020/09/parsons-ipo-recognized-as-deal-of-the-year-by-acg-national-capital/">earned it</a> an industry Corporate Growth Award. The top <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/psn/holders">holders</a> of Parsons stock are investment banks and asset management firms—including the familiar Vanguard Group, BlackRock, and State Street.</p>

<h2><strong>Cyber Wars and Intelligence Go Mainstream as Emerging Corporate Frontiers</strong></h2>



<p>New business sectors of war are created and then flooded. For example, the provision of “cyber” was virtually nonexistent in U.S. military contracting until roughly four years ago. A war industry push to militarize IT infrastructure has yielded a bonanza in cyber contracts. Today, “cyber” goods and services are sold stand-alone or as additions to previous contracts.</p>



<p>Nearly every major war corporation sells cyber goods and services. </p>



<blockquote><p>The top public war corporations include Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Technologies, Boeing, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, L3Harris, Textron, SAIC, Booz Allen Hamilton, Leidos, CACI, Honeywell, PAE, Accenture, KBRWyle, Amentum, Jacobs, and AECOM.</p></blockquote>



<p>They all sell cyber. The main exception is Huntington Ingalls, a major shipbuilder, which does not sell stand-alone cyber goods, although it does mandate cybersecurity as part of its supply chain. The top private war corporations—Sierra Nevada Corp. and General Atomics, run by the billionaire Ozmens and Blue Brothers, respectively—also sell cyber goods and services.</p>



<p>This single business sector of war, cyber, is worth billions annually. <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2020/12/20/vips-memo-to-biden-dont-be-suckered-on-russia/">Claims</a> of Chinese and Russian cyber hacks, fabricated or hyped by war industry think tanks and media affiliates, fuel government purchases of cyber goods and services. For its part, the U.S. government—first to use devastating new weaponry, from <a href="https://libcom.org/history/1945-us-responses-atomic-bombing-hiroshima-nagasaki">atomic weapons</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/obama-ordered-wave-of-cyberattacks-against-iran.html">cyber weapons</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/us/politics/trump-cyber-russia-grid.html">first to attack</a> Moscow with cyber weapons—positions its aggression as purely defensive.</p>

<p>In November 2018, Parsons—whose <a href="https://www.parsons.com/about/leadership/">leadership</a> is packed with bankers, career war profiteers, military and intelligence retirees, and a coal tycoon—was <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/1686733/">contracted</a> for cyberspace operations mission planning in Centerville, Virginia. In May 2019, Parsons was <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/1842189/">contracted</a> with nine other corporations to expand the cyberspace backbone of the Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific of San Diego, California, a military unit whose mandate is to dominate all forms of space (cyberspace, airspace, and Earth’s orbit).</p>



<p>In January 2020, Parsons and other corporations were <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2069174/">contracted</a> by the same unit to further develop, oversee, and employ broad cyber technology integral to that mandate, from the continental United States, to Guam, Japan, Australia, and Singapore, to Bahrain, Djibouti, and Italy. This is just one example of one corporation. Corporate America blankets U.S. military cyber operations worldwide.</p>

<p>No business sector of war is off limits. </p>



<blockquote><p>As recently as the early 1990s, it was considered sacrilege for corporate employees (“contractors”) to be involved in intelligence matters. Not anymore. U.S. intelligence (both civilian and military) is corporatized. </p></blockquote>



<p>Consider the Defense Intelligence Agency. DIA was established in the 1960s to consolidate the military’s disparate intelligence activities. It did not consolidate much, as the individual military branches continued to run distinct military-intelligence operations.</p>



<p>Since the 1960s, DIA has expanded dramatically in size. Corporations carrying out DIA’s activities during the most recent fiscal year included work in its Science &amp; Technology <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2099625/">Directorate</a> (five years, $990,000,000), its <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2190758/">National Media Exploitation Center</a>, and its <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2006604/">Missile &amp; Space Intelligence Center</a> (MSIC).</p>



<p>Parsons <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Contracts/Contract-View/Article/1515278/">carries out</a> modeling and simulation and analysis within DIA’s MSIC. Corporations also run planning and analysis of DIA’s <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2006604/">workforce</a>, sell <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2047884/">technical support</a> to DIA, <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2367105/">conduct</a> employee vetting and background investigations, and work on technology transfer analysis and assessment.</p>

<p>Corporations even develop and run <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2269384/">software</a> that aids “in the identification of intelligence requirements, management of priorities, planning and production of intelligence products, enterprise data analytics, communication and other associated processes,” offering further opportunities for profit-hungry entities to steer the espionage ship.

<h2><strong>Wall Street: the Ultimate War Profiteers</strong></h2>



<p>Wall Street plays the foundational role in the war industry by outright owning war corporations. Consider PAE, a subtle, potent corporation, which operates such diverse business sectors of war as vehicle maintenance, base operations, military construction, and military training. Gores Holdings III acquired PAE from Platinum Equity in early 2020. Gores then adopted the name PAE and took PAE public. PAE has since acquired the corporations CENTRA and Metis Solutions, which further increase PAE’s operations carrying out former governmental tasks within the U.S. military establishment and espionage agencies.</p>

<p>Again, all military and intelligence activity is up for grabs, even the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC), a military range for testing and evaluating the war industry’s technology (e.g., anti-submarine weapons, sonar tracking, and communications). Some have nicknamed AUTEC the “Navy’s Area 51” because of the testing of high-tech unconventional weapons. [Area 51 is a testing range in Nevada where classified programs are worked on and experimental aircraft are flown.]</p>



<p>The Navy established AUTEC on Andros Island in the Bahamas to take advantage of the deep oceanic trench that runs along the east coast of the island. PAE is traditionally the go-to corporation that operates and maintains AUTEC, though a newly formed corporation known as Amentum recently <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2310984/">took over</a> some of these functions.</p>

	<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The mission of the PMDK team has always been and will always be to make programming persistent memory
easier for the community of software developers. One of our goals is to help simplify the integration
of persistent memory into software solutions by making it transparent as possible.
Adopting ground-breaking  and disruptive technology creates a chasm, which is
challenging to cross at first. To help with that, PMDK offers a multi-layered stack of solutions
so that developers can choose a library that is the best fit for their desired level of abstraction and purpose.</p>

<p>Intel Optane persistent memory (PMem) can be configured in two modes: Memory Mode or App Direct Mode.
In Memory Mode, the system’s DRAM behaves as a cache while PMem provides large memory capacity.
When configured for Memory Mode, applications and the operating system perceive a pool of volatile memory
no different than on DRAM-only systems. Use of PMem in Memory Mode is transparent to applications and
the operating system, so no specific persistent memory programming is needed. When configured in App Direct Mode,
however, the applications and operating system are explicitly aware that there are two types of memory on
the platform, and can direct which type of data read or write is suitable for DRAM or PMem.
PMDK is a suite of software libraries designed to take advantage of persistent memory when using App Direct Mode.</p>

<p>In this post, we will present how the cooperation between <a href="https://hazelcast.com/">Hazelcast</a> and the PMDK team
improved Hazelcast’s overall performance with PMem. We will also showcase how to mitigate one
of the most common problems with Java applications and garbage collection limitations.
This post also demonstrates how an efficient use of hardware enables solutions to 
scale better while retaining low tail latency.</p>

<p>In this article, we will focus on using Persistent Memory directly, through App Direct Mode.
One of the easiest ways to adopt PMem is to use it as a volatile extension of the existing memory
where applications use PMem as regular memory without any intention of retaining data
across power or restart cycles. The adoption barrier of integrating PMem this way
is relatively minimal, but there are some important technical considerations we discuss
in this post.</p>

<h2 id="about-hazelcast">About Hazelcast</h2>

<p>Hazelcast IMDG (In-Memory Data Grid) is a leading open source in-memory solution written in Java,
capable of storing a large amount of data in an elastic distributed cluster with a rich set
of functionality for operating on the stored data such as querying with SQL,
performing distributed computations and many more. Operating entirely in the memory is
the central concept of Hazelcast to guarantee that these operations are done with a low
and predictable latency and with a stable throughput. Hazelcast is widely used as a caching layer,
for storing web sessions, for efficient fraud detection and for many other use cases.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-big-data-in-the-java-virtual-machine">Working with Big Data in the Java Virtual Machine</h2>

<p>Given that Hazelcast is written in Java, it is inherently sensitive to the unpredictability
of the garbage collection (GC) algorithm used by the Java Virtual Machine.
The traditional GC algorithms are famously known to put a practical limit on the usable heap size.
This practical limit can manifest itself in the so-called stop-the-world GC pauses,
which means the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) suspends the application threads to ensure nothing mutates the heap
while certain phases of the GC algorithms are doing their job. The bigger the heap,
the bigger these pauses, which may render the hosted application unresponsive,
lagging or just not operating with predictable response times. This problem led the JVM vendors
to research and implement a new generation of the GC algorithms, the concurrent GC algorithms,
such as the C4 (Azul), ZGC (Oracle) and Shenandoah (Red Hat). These GC algorithms all focus on
eliminating or limiting the aforementioned pauses in order to be able to manage huge heaps,
up to terabytes in size. This is already a big enough heap for Hazelcast, but these algorithms
have their trade-offs as well. The threads of the concurrent GC algorithms run concurrently with
the application threads and can steal precious resources from them. Given that freeing up the unused
memory is done while the application threads are running - therefore, the application threads allocate
concurrently - it is possible that even these clever GC algorithms are unable to keep up with the pace
of the allocations and need to employ their so-called failure modes, which is a well-controlled form
of impacting the application to get the control back over the allocation/reclamation dynamics.
As the worst case option, these algorithms may need to suspend application threads as well.</p>

<p>To overcome the above limitations with the GC, and to guarantee the low and predictable response times,
Hazelcast improved its enterprise offering years ago by implementing an in-memory
storage that stores the data outside of the Java heap. This feature is named
High-Density Memory Storage (HDMS or just HD), also known as native or off-heap storage.
While there is still GC involved, the data Hazelcast stores in its HD storage is not subject to the GC,
therefore, that data can be very big in size without running into the problems of the GC mentioned above.
For more details on HD, refer to the <a href="https://hazelcast.org/blog/introduction-hazelcast-hd-memory/">blog post introducing HD</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p>First launched in 2019, Intel Optane persistent Memory offers DIMM-compatible non-volatile memory-modules.
While the biggest breakthrough of these modules is their persistent capability, using them in
a volatile App Direct Mode is also attractive in some use cases. These modules are available with
greater capacities than that of DRAM DIMMs. Therefore, the total achievable capacity is bigger than
with DRAM modules alone, while the modules operate with near-DRAM performance, at a lower cost per gigabyte.
These advantages make the Intel Optane PMem modules a good fit for Hazelcast and after some research,
Hazelcast 4.0 added support for these persistent memory modules - in addition to DRAM - as its HD backend.
The initial implementation in 4.0 used <a href="https://pmem.io/pmdk/libvmem/">libvmem</a> for using Intel Optane persistent
memory modules in volatile App Direct Mode. Since then, Memkind became the go-to library
for using the PMem in volatile mode, therefore, Hazelcast dropped libvmem
and replaced it with Memkind in its 4.1 version.</p>

<h2 id="integration-with-memkind">Integration with Memkind</h2>

<p>Memkind is a library for managing multiple types of memory (e.g., DRAM, MCDRAM, PMem),
with different performance characteristics. This solution enables applications
to use persistent memory as the capacity tier for memory resident data.
In heterogeneous memory systems, where two or more memory types are present,
memkind is a solution that helps applications to overcome the challenge of managing
complex memory architectures.</p>

<p>In memkind, memory is managed as independent heaps, called <em>memory kinds</em>.</p>

<p>Hazelcast takes advantage of both solutions libmemkind provides for using PMem.
The PMEM kind let’s the user application allocate from the PMem medium if it is
mounted with a DAX-aware file system. The <a href="https://pmem.io/2020/01/20/memkind-dax-kmem.html">KMEM-DAX</a> mode
combines the advantages of the Linux kernel’s KMEM feature and the direct access (DAX)
capabilities of PMem by transparently allocating PMem memory from the system memory
consisted of DRAM and PMem backed regions after preliminary configuration of PMem.
The two modes will be discussed in detail later.</p>

<p>To leverage the advanced heap management offered by Memkind, Hazelcast needed to
build a Java Native Interface (JNI) bridge. Integrating Memkind was a straightforward task
since Hazelcast’s HD memory manager interacts with the memory allocators through a malloc-like
internal abstraction with an API that is similar to standard memory allocation API’s.
The notable difference with Memkind is that the caller should define a kind for an allocation,
and also may define the kind when freeing or reallocating a memory block. If the kind is not defined,
Memkind detects which kind should be used. This kind detection feature turned out to be a very
useful feature for Hazelcast, even though at the time of writing this post Hazelcast exclusively
use the <code>PMEM</code> or the <code>MEMKIND_DAX_KMEM_ALL</code> kinds.</p>

<p>Looking forward, this could help Hazelcast build a tiered HD storage feature,
for example with DRAM and PMem tiers, to take advantage of the heterogeneous platform architectures.
Implementing such a tiered storage is inherently difficult with heterogeneous memory allocators,
since allocating, freeing and reallocating a memory block has to use the same allocator.
Otherwise, various problems may occur potentially crashing the application.
To deal with this problem, one can track the allocator used for every memory block. The disadvantage
of this approach is a significant increase of the fragmentation. Since memkind internally
tracks the dedicated memory kind of a given object from the allocation metadata, it can detect the kind
for every object allocated with the library. This is a great help for the applications dealing with
heterogeneous memory resources as memkind eliminates the aforementioned problem entirely.
To learn more on kind detection, please see this <a href="https://pmem.io/2020/01/20/libmemkind.html">post</a>.</p>

<p>The collaboration between the PMDK team and Hazelcast helped streamline PMem integration into the
<a href="https://hazelcast.com/product-features/high-density-memory-store/">High-Density Memory Store</a>. The Hazelcast team uses the memkind library
to explicitly allocate PMem space. When using the FS-DAX base memory kind, the Hazelcast team analyzed
memkind performance in the context of shutdown times and found the bottleneck in the form
of a punch hole operation when destroying the file-based memory kind. Punch hole operation is
used to deallocate blocks presented on filesystem and is called during deallocating memory using
memkind API so the underlying pages could be returned to …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Technology is merely a tool. It can work for us or against us. If we use it with agency, we can leverage the world’s information to better our lives. If we use it indiscriminately, we find ourselves at the mercy of the Algorithm, passively consuming content. Our generation is at an inflection point - either we use technology intentionally or it uses us.</p>

<p>This post is about one principle that transformed my relationship with technology: feeds considered harmful. Feeds slow you down, take you in unwanted directions and encourage consumption over action. Adopting the principle enabled me to effectively focus, prioritize and act on my goals.</p>

<p>A feed is a set of algorithmically generated content provided to the user without explicit input. Almost all of our interactions with services begin with a feed - Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitch, Netflix, Reddit, Amazon, News. You name the app, it has a feed front and center. (Although this definition doesn’t include messaging apps or RSS feeds, some of the concerns below still hold.)</p>

<p>Feeds distract and slow you down. Ever catch yourself binging on The Office clips an hour after you open YouTube to learn how to revive your dying succulent? This is no accident - it’s the digital equivalent of placing the milk in the back of the grocery store. Even if you have a clear purpose for navigating to a site, it hijacks your attention with content the Algorithm has concluded you can’t resist. Instant gratification is only a click away.</p>

<p>If you’re mindlessly browsing, the effect of feeds is even more potent. The brief dopamine hit triggered by fresh content quickly evolves into analysis paralysis. Ever spend a half hour on Netflix just deciding what to watch? Then, shortly after a decision is made, feel a pang of buyer’s remorse? The abundance of options challenges the optimality of your choice, and in the face of the slightest obstacle, lures you to a replacement. Greener pastures are only a click away. And so begins the endless cycle of novelty and disillusion. The only way out is through - establishing an intent and following through.</p>

<p>You may be asking: don’t feeds broaden our exposure to new ideas? Yes, they do. But there’s no free lunch. Time spent consuming is time not spent doing. Taking meaningful action requires a delicate balance of explore and exploit. Feeds uproot this balance, disproportionately encouraging discovery instead of focused execution. This is best explained with a navigation analogy - explore is direction, exploit is movement. Explore is necessary in small doses, to make sure we’re moving in the right direction. Too much explore though, and we’ve over calibrated to our orientation - we’re no closer to our goal, but left with the illusion of progress (<em>cough</em> productivity porn <em>cough</em>).</p>

<p>You can still explore without feeds. New ideas surface everywhere. In everyday conversations, which are inherently tailored to mutual interests. From resources in the exploit phase, as a springboard into complementary subjects. By browsing the library, a physical feed optimized for education instead of engagement. Instead of preventing exploration altogether, eliminating feeds recalibrates our explore-exploit balance by compelling us to adopt healthier forms of discovery that inevitably leave more energy for execution.</p>

<p>Speaking of execution, here’s how to reduce your dependence on feeds:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Identify your triggers</strong>: What feeds consume your attention the most? As a proxy, check your most visited sites on desktop (yes, that is a feed too!) or most used apps on mobile (Screen Time for iOS, Digital Wellbeing for Android).</li>
  <li><strong>Eliminate the feed.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>(Ideal) Remove the feed entirely. The ideal page is blank, save for a search bar - intentional begins with intent! Such Chrome extensions exist for the most popular services: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remove-youtube-recommende/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid?hl=en" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, etc.</li>
      <li>(Backup) If the above isn’t entirely possible (say because you’re an active mobile user), add friction. A very effective solution is to uninstall the app and only access the service through the browser. Your muscle memory in the first few days will be a great reminder of how unconsciously you used these feeds, but it won’t take long to unlearn.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Repeat for the new triggers that emerge.</strong> As your usual suspects are solved for, you will reach for new distractions. It will take a few cycles to fully eliminate them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Side effects may include mild FOMO (which will soon subside), an enhanced feeling of control and excessive amounts of spare time to live life on your terms, not the Algorithm’s.</p>

        <section>
            <p>The ability to do precise Google searches and getting relevant results is a superpower that is easy to acquire  but most people don't have it. </p>

<p>The goal of this post is:</p>

<ul>
<li>to provide simple and tangible examples to help you gain this superpower </li>
<li>to show you how you can leverage Google for prospecting.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="googlesearchoperators">Google Search Operators</h5>

<p>Google search operators (also known as “advanced operators”) are commands that extend the capabilities of regular text searches.  With Google search operators you can do anything from market analysis, prospecting people on LinkedIn, retrieving fundraising news, finding emails, etc. Understanding the basics of Google search operators will drastically improve the quality of your search results. </p>

<h5 id="howdogooglesearchoperatorswork">How do Google search operators work?</h5>

<p>Even though there are lots of search operators for you to use, they usually follow a similar syntax like this one:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IuxJhKz.png" alt="<image>"></p>

<p><strong>Some of the most common search operators are:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>site</code>: Limit results to those from a specific website</li>
<li><code>intitle</code>: Web pages with a certain keyword in the title</li>
<li><code>inurl</code>: Web pages with a certain keyword in the URL</li>
<li><code>filetype</code>: web pages with a certain file type, such as pdf or png</li>
<li><code>[number]..[number]</code>: restricts the search to a certain range of numbers</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="examplesforsalesgrowthandmarketingusecases">Examples for sales, growth, and marketing use cases:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Find: Google spreadsheets that include “startups” and “2020” in the title</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site:docs.google.com/spreadsheets+intitle:startups+2020&amp;rlz=1CAZAQH_enPT910&amp;oq=site:docs.google.com/spreadsheets+intitle:startups+2020&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i58.1251j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><strong><code>site:docs.google.com/spreadsheets intitle:startups 2020</code></strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Use case: This search will provide you with several links to lists of Google spreadsheets with data about startups and the year 2020. For example, if you offer services for startups that are hiring remotely you’ve just found a list with 900+ potential leads.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Find: List of LinkedIn profiles that mention “Founder” and the words “We’re hiring”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1CAZAQH_enPT910&amp;ei=W91-X8nzAYbkU8eTv4AN&amp;q=site%3Alinkedin.com%2Fin%2F+%22founder+We%27re+hiring%22&amp;oq=site%3Alinkedin.com%2Fin%2F+%22founder+We%27re+hiring%22&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoHCAAQRxCwA1Ck6ARYpOgEYKXwBGgDcAB4AIABPogBPpIBATGYAQCgAQKgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEIwAEB&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJjfno2KTsAhUG8hQKHcfJD9AQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5"><strong><code>site:linkedin.com/in/ "founder We're hiring"</code></strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Use case: This search should retrieve a list of founders at startups/companies that are hiring and managing a growing team. For example, if these founders match with your ICP you can directly click on the link and reach out to this person.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Find: Google docs that contain the words “SaaS”, “conference” and “2020” in the body</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1CAZAQH_enPT910&amp;ei=td1-X8POA4Wzgwe3x6rADA&amp;q=site%3Adocs.google.com+saas+conferences+2020&amp;oq=site%3Adocs.google.com+saas+conferences+2020&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoHCAAQRxCwA1DozgRY6M4EYK3WBGgDcAB4AIABQ4gBQ5IBATGYAQCgAQKgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAECwAEB&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD_e-T2aTsAhWF2eAKHbejCsgQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5"><strong><code>site:docs.google.com saas conferences 2020</code></strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Use case: This search should find you documents related to SaaS conferences in 2020. For example, you can find lists to make sure you don’t miss out on any important event in your industry. Furthermore, you can connect with thousands of potential customers by making sure you attend and reach out to the people participating in these conferences.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Find: Airtable bases/lists that contain “investors” in the URL</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1CAZAQH_enPT910&amp;ei=At5-X-KMHfrOgweEvp7YDA&amp;q=site%3Aairtable.com+inurl%3Ainvestors&amp;oq=site%3Aairtable.com+inurl%3Ainvestors&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA1D3jgJY944CYLGSAmgDcAB4AIABRogBRpIBATGYAQCgAQKgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6wAEB&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjileW42aTsAhV65-AKHQSfB8sQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5"><strong><code>site:airtable.com inurl:investors</code></strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Use case: Airtable has been creating tons of content with relevant lists that help you access more information about companies. For example, here you can find lists of investors that may be relevant to your fundraising needs or that fit your ICP. Keep in mind that these lists not only provide you with the names of the investors, but they also share relevant information about each one of them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Find: Find industry reports from multiple sources</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1CAZAQH_enPT910&amp;ei=Jt5-X7fyGLOcjLsP6Oy_gA0&amp;q=inurl%3Areport+intitle%3A%22SaaS+trends%22+filetype%3Apdf&amp;oq=inurl%3Areport+intitle%3A%22SaaS+trends%22+filetype%3Apdf&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoHCAAQRxCwA1CH8gFYh_IBYMj0AWgDcAB4AIABQYgBQZIBATGYAQCgAQKgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEDwAEB&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3nfbJ2aTsAhUzDmMBHWj2D9AQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5"><strong><code>inurl:report intitle:"SaaS trends" filetype:pdf</code></strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Use case: This search will help you stay up to date with your industry trends. With a quick search you can immediately find the most relevant docs for your market research activities.</p>

<h4 id="wrappingup">Wrapping up…</h4>

February 11, 2021 | https://engineering.skroutz.gr/blog/uncovering-a-24-year-old-bug-in-the-linux-kernel/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://engineering.skroutz.gr/blog/uncovering-a-24-year-old-bug-in-the-linux-kernel/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>As part of our standard toolkit, we provide each developer at Skroutz
with a writable database snapshot against which she can develop. These
snapshots are updated daily through a pipeline that involves taking an
LVM snapshot of production data, anonymizing the dataset by stripping
all personal data, and transferring it via rsync to the development
database servers. The development servers in turn use ZFS snapshots to
expose a copy-on-write snapshot to each developer, with
self-service tools allowing rollback or upgrades to newer snapshots.</p>

<p>We use the same pipeline to expose MariaDB and MongoDB data, with a
full dataset size of 600GB and 200GB respectively, and a slightly
modified pipeline for Elasticsearch. While on-disk data changes
significantly for all data sources, rsync still saves significant time
by transferring roughly 1/3 of the full data set every night. This
setup has worked rather well for the better part of a decade and has
managed to scale from 15 developers to 150. However, as with most
systems, it has had its fair share of maintenance and has given us
some interesting moments.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting issues we encountered led to the discovery
of a fairly old bug in the Linux kernel TCP implementation: every now
and then, an rsync transfer from a source server would hang
indefinitely for no apparent reason, as — apart from the stuck transfer —
everything else seemed to be in order. What’s more, for reasons that became
apparent later, the issue could not be reproduced at will, although
some actions (e.g. adding an rsync-level rate limit) seemed to make
the issue less frequent, with frequency ranging from once or twice per
week to once every three months.</p>

<p>As is not unusual in these cases, we had more urgent systems and issues to
attend to, so we labeled this a “race condition in rsync” that we
should definitely look into at some point, and worked around it by
throttling the rsync transfers.</p>

<p>Until it started biting us every single day.</p>

<h2 id="rsync-as-a-pipeline">rsync as a pipeline</h2>

<p>While not strictly necessary, knowing how rsync works internally will help
understand the analysis that follows. The rsync site contains <a href="https://rsync.samba.org/how-rsync-works.html">a thorough
description</a> of rsync’s internal architecture, so I’ll try to
summarize the most important points here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>rsync starts off as a single process on the client and a single
process on the server, communicating via a socket pair. When using
the rsync daemon, as in our case, communication is done over a
plain TCP connection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Based on the direction of sync, after the initial handshake is
over, each end assumes a <em>role</em>, either that of the <em>sender</em>, or
that of the <em>receiver</em>. In our case the client is the receiver,
and the server is the sender.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The receiver forks an additional process called the <em>generator</em>,
sharing the socket with the <em>receiver</em> process. The <em>generator</em>
figures out what it needs to ask from the <em>sender</em>, and the
<em>sender</em> subsequently sends the data to the <em>receiver</em>. What we
essentially have after this step is a pipeline, <em>generator</em> →
<em>sender</em> → <em>receiver</em>, where the arrows are the two directions of
<em>the same</em> TCP connection. While there is some signaling involved,
the pipeline operates in a <em>blocking</em> fashion and relies on OS
buffers and TCP receive windows to apply backpressure.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="a-ghost-in-the-network">A ghost in the network?</h2>

<p>Our first reaction when we encountered the issue was to suspect the
network for errors, which was a <em>reasonable</em> thing to do since we had
recently upgraded our servers and switches. After eliminating the
usual suspects (NIC firmware bugs involving TSO/GSO/GRO/VLAN
offloading, excessive packet drops or CRC errors at the switches etc),
we came to the conclusion that everything was normal and something
else had to be going on.</p>

<p>Attaching the hung processes using strace and gdb told us little: the
generator was hung on <code>send()</code> and the sender and receiver were hung
on <code>recv()</code>, yet no data was moving. However, turning to the kernel on
both systems revealed something interesting! On the client the rsync
socket shared between the <em>generator</em> and the <em>receiver</em> processes was
in the following state:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>ss -mito dst :873

<p>while on the server, the socket state was the following:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>ss -mito src :873
State      Recv-Q Send-Q                Local Address:Port                                 Peer Address:Port

<p>The interesting thing here is that there are 3.5MB of data on the
client, queued to be sent (❶ in the first output) by the
<em>generator</em> to the server; however, while the server has an empty <code>Recv-Q</code>
and can accept data, nothing seems to be moving forward. If <code>Recv-Q</code>
in the second output was non-zero, we would be looking at rsync on the
server being stuck and not reading from the network, however here it
is obvious that rsync has consumed all incoming data and is not to
blame.</p>

<p>So why is data queued up on one end of the connection, while the other end is
obviously able to accept it? The answer is conveniently hidden in the <code>timer</code>
fields of both <code>ss</code> outputs, especially in
<code>timer:(persist,1min56sec,0)</code>. Quoting <code>ss(8)</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="man">-o, --options
              Show timer information. For TCP protocol, the output format is:

              timer:(&lt;timer_name&gt;,&lt;expire_time&gt;,&lt;retrans&gt;)

              &lt;timer_name&gt;
                     the name of the timer, there are five kind of timer names:

                     on : means one of these  timers:  TCP  retrans  timer,  TCP
                     early retrans timer and tail loss probe timer

                     keepalive: tcp keep alive timer

                     timewait: timewait stage timer

                     persist: zero window probe timer

                     unknown: none of the above timers</code></pre></div>

<p><code>persist</code> means that the connection has received a zero window
advertisement and is waiting for the peer to advertise a non-zero
window.</p>

<h2 id="tcp-zero-windows-and-zero-window-probes">TCP Zero Windows and Zero Window Probes</h2>

<p>TCP implements flow control by limiting the data in flight using a sliding
window called the <em>receive window</em>. Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Flow_control">good description</a>, but in short each end of a TCP connection advertises how much
data it is willing to buffer for the connection, i.e. how much data the other
end may send before waiting for an acknowledgment.</p>

<p>When one side’s receive buffer (<code>Recv-Q</code>) fills up (in this case
because the rsync process is doing disk I/O at a speed slower than the
network’s), it will send out a zero window advertisement, which will
put that direction of the connection on hold. When buffer space
eventually frees up, the kernel will send an unsolicited window update
with a non-zero window size, and the data transfer continues. To be
safe, just in case this unsolicited window update is lost, the other
end will regularly poll the connection state using the so-called Zero
Window Probes (the <code>persist</code> mode we are seeing here).</p>

<h2 id="the-window-is-stuck-closed">The window is stuck closed</h2>

<p>It’s now time to dive a couple of layers deeper and use <code>tcpdump</code> to
see what’s going on at the network level:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="text">[…]

[… repeats every 2 mins]</code></pre></div>

<p>The first packet is the rsync client’s zero window probe, the second
packet is the server’s response. Surprisingly enough, the server is
advertising a non-zero window size of 13831 bytes¹ which the client
apparently ignores.</p>

<p>¹ actually multiplied by 128 because of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_window_scale_option">window scaling</a> factor
of 7</p>

<p>We are finally making some progress and have a case to work on! At
some point the client encountered a zero window advertisement from the
server as part of regular TCP flow control, but then the window failed
to re-open for some reason. The client seems to be still ignoring
the new window advertised by the server and this is why the transfer
is stuck.</p>

<h2 id="linux-tcp-input-processing">Linux TCP input processing</h2>

<p>By now it’s obvious that the TCP connection is in a weird state on the
rsync client. Since TCP flow control happens at the kernel level, to
get to the root of this we need to look at how the Linux kernel
handles incoming TCP acknowledgments and try to figure out why it
ignores the incoming window advertisement.</p>

<p>Incoming TCP packet processing happens in

Because <a href="https://www.inc.com/molly-reynolds/how-to-spot-visual-auditory-and-kinesthetic-learni.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">65% of us are visual learners</a>! We like to see “the big picture” and can absorb information faster from images (vs. text).&nbsp; And, it helps us retain and recall those ideas better.</p><p>Visual storytelling is about using a <em>visual vocabulary</em> (with colors, fonts, icons, and graphical elements) to capture core information (e.g., by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchnoting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sketchnoting</a>) or communicate complex ideas (e.g., using <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/visual-metaphor-1692595" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visual metaphors</a>). Our brains are wired to detect patterns and “connect the dots” to familiar images or concepts, helping us <em>transfer learning</em> to better understand new things.</p><p>Here’s an example of a visual <em>transport </em>metaphor that I use to understand cloud computing. By definition, cloud computing is the “<strong>delivery of computing services over the internet, using a pay-as-you-go pricing model</strong>.” What related concepts can help us make other connections?</p><p>For me, it was the term “<em>delivery” </em>that inspired this metaphor. In my mind, I envisioned cloud servers (<em>trucks</em>) delivering the services (<em>products)</em> over the internet (<em>public roadways</em>) from the businesses (<em>on-premises</em>) to the customers (<em>in regions)</em>.

Businesses can <em>rent resources</em> (access to bridges, spaces) rather than own them outright. In return, they waste fewer resources (no idle time for owned assets) and are more agile with changes (take a different route at rush hour).</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="420" src="https://acloudguru.com//app/uploads/2021/02/Visual-Intro-to-Azure-1-A-Cloud-Guru-1.png?x64326" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/02/Visual-Intro-to-Azure-1-A-Cloud-Guru-1.png 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/02/Visual-Intro-to-Azure-1-A-Cloud-Guru-1.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/02/Visual-Intro-to-Azure-1-A-Cloud-Guru-1.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></figure></div><h3>Visualize IT: “From Fixed Trucks To Flexible Tractor-Trailers!”</h3><p>Still with me?

It is accessible to businesses (aka cloud <em>tenants</em>) and business clients (aka cloud <em>customers</em>) over the internet, supplying global access to those resources.</p><p>I think of a “server” as having three parts: the physical hardware (<em>infrastructure)</em>, the business applications (<em>software)</em>, and the operations middleware (<em>platform</em>) between them.</p><ul><li>Infrastructure = processing, storage, networking</li><li>Platform = operating system, application runtime, and value-added support services</li><li>Sofware = business applications (user interfaces and experiences + interaction data)</li></ul><p>In a <em>physical machine,</em> the infrastructure and platform are tightly coupled. The resource can be under-utilized (when the load is light) or under-performant (when the load is heavy) — making it less cost-effective in the long run.</p><p>A <em>virtualization layer</em> abstracts the hardware (infrastructure) from the middleware (platform), creating a <em>virtual machine (VM)</em> “sandbox” that can run on different hardware “chassis” without the platform components necessarily being aware of underlying changes or differences. Now, the same physical hardware can host multiple VMs that optimize resource usage, and a VM can be spun up on different physical host machines on demand to support load or requirement changes.</p><p>Great! But how does this fit our transport analogy. Let’s see if this analogy works:</p><ul><li><em>A physical machine is like a single-body truck</em>. The cab (“tractor”) and the platform (“trailer”) can’t be used separately here — so our truck capacity may be under-utilized (in light load) and over-loaded (insufficient space) as customer demands rise.</li><li><em>A trailer hitch is like a virtualization layer. </em>By separating tractor from trailer, we can now support more flexible configurations to suit the demand. The business can scale up (add more trailers to the same tractor) or scale out (add more tractor-trailer instances) to suit demand changes or requirements. And, we have more flexibility in trailer types now.</li></ul><p>Chances are, if you think about it more, you might be able to explore other analogies in context.</p><h2>Why Move to the Cloud: “Cheap + Unlimited Tractors/Trailers – Worldwide!”</h2><p>Traditionally, businesses owned and ran their own servers “<em>on-premises,” </em>taking on all the costs and effort for server maintenance and upgrades. It’s analogous to owning a fleet of trucks so you can deliver your services. With virtualization, businesses can separate their infrastructure (truck) from their platform (trailer) options and gain the flexibility to <em>rent (vs. own)</em> either resource from third party providers. Services can still be delivered —but outsourcing maintenance reduces their operating costs and gains them the ability to scale usage as needed.</p><p>Here, cloud providers are like global transport companies with<em> nearly unlimited </em>tractors, trailers at their disposal, available in <em>locations worldwide. </em>Cloud tenants (businesses) can rent what they need (resources), when they need it (demand-driven, configuration-based), where they need it (geo-distribution), to supply the best delivery performance and experience to their customers.</p><p>Cloud providers are now also like <em>utility companies</em> who attach <em>meters</em> to all the resources they rent, so that you get charged only for what you use. The <em>economies of scale </em>(“the more you make of something, the less it costs to make it”) makes <em>renting cloud resources cheaper </em>in the long run when compared to overheads of buying, and maintaining, your own server resources.</p><h2>Cloud Computing Types: Understanding Deployment Models</h2><p>Armed with this analogy, let us tackle <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/what-is-cloud-computing?WT.mc_id=mobile-12359-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cloud deployment models</a>! There are 3 cloud types:</p><ul><li><em>Private =</em> computing resources are used exclusively by users from one business or org.<em></em></li><li><em>Public</em> = services offered over public internet, to anyone who wants to rent them.<em></em></li><li><em>Hybrid =</em> environments combine both, sharing data and applications between them.<em></em></li></ul><p>Now let’s look at this through the lens of our tractors and trailers analogy.</p><ul><li>Private cloud = business owns and manages its own fleet of trucks. You have full control (data, security) and take on all responsibility (cost, maintenance).</li><li>Public cloud = you rent trucks from a global company that everyone else uses as well. Resources may be shared or reused, and SLAs help you set up cost-security tradeoffs.</li><li>Hybrid cloud = you own some trucks/trailers and rent others – so your products and customer data may be used with both. Gives you a good migration path from private to public cloud, where you transition your operational responsibilities incrementally.</li></ul><h3>Cloud Computing Service Models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS</h3><p>The deployment models enable <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/business/what-is-cloud-migration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cloud migration</a> paths (from on-premises to public cloud) iteratively, helping you balance security-cost tradeoffs while evaluating impact on your business.</p><ul><li>Virtualize physical machines = replace <em>owned</em> single-body trucks with tractor-trailers</li><li>Move virtual machines to cloud = hitch <em>owned</em> trailers onto <em>rented</em> tractors (hardware)</li><li>Move to virtual cloud services = replace owned trailers with <em>rented</em> trailer services</li><li>Focus on innovating my software = focus on improving products, not managing infra</li></ul><p>Now, I <em>pay-as-I-go</em> for things I rent, and no longer have to pay for (or think about) maintenance of hardware or platform components. And I can effortlessly take advantage of the latest new hardware or platform enhancements for performance or innovation improvement.</p><p>This leads to our next topic: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/what-is-cloud-computing?WT.mc_id=mobile-12359-ninarasi">Cloud Computing Service Models</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="english-version">
                        <p>As the global economy becomes increasingly technology-driven and less trade-driven, the most important demographic to understand is developers. These are not just underground hackers or hoodie-wearing code monkeys; they are creative problem solvers who use digital technology to build things. In my last deep-dive, <a href="https://interconnected.blog/what-does-agora-api-do/">I profiled Agora</a>, the API platform company for building apps with real-time audio and video capabilities. One of the reasons behind its current success is its product’s developer-friendliness.</p><p>So how many developers are there? How many will there be to power this global economy? And where will the next generation of developers come from?</p><p>There are currently 56 million developers on GitHub, the world’s dominant developer collaboration platform, according to its own “<a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">2020 State of the Octoverse</a>” report. GitLab is a fierce competitor of GitHub. BitBucket and SourceForge are both still around. Alternatives like Gitee are also being fostered. Thus, there are likely more than 56 million developers total at this moment.</p><p>GitHub predicts having 100 million developers on its platform by 2025, so we are looking at an almost <strong>doubling</strong> of the number of developers in the next five years. That’s why in my “Global by Nature” series -- my investment and opportunity set for the next 10 years -- <a href="https://interconnected.blog/global-by-nature-developers/">I placed understanding developers</a> at the very top of all considerations.</p><p>Digging deeper into GitHub’s report, there are some fascinating trends to illuminate where these next 50-million-plus developers will come from and what that means for the next phase of globalization.</p><h2 id="from-2015-to-2030">From 2015 to 2030</h2><p>The 2020 State of Octoverse report provides a nice visual of where open source contributors were coming from and where they may be from in the future -- from 2015 to 2020 and projecting into 2025 and 2030. Open source technologies are powering the world’s economy. Thus, open source contributor count is both an effective heuristic of developer growth (most developers use or contribute to open source) and overall economic growth.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/uZ5ZFGEadcpbUXWKQV3FL19XvkpN8NtWbcw7rJuIULZer0LSCgvtiDeLsb_rjPgmwIZNyCCKfKfSr9n3f_2SzSp5cVDS99zf5cuRX1YS6nu2iqM4LEwa7Cs3zbrNSmUwun1LwYsD" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://octoverse.github.com/</figcaption></figure><p>In 2015, <strong>the US </strong>was the lone bright spot, accounting for <strong>30.4% </strong>of the world’s open source contributors. <strong>Germany</strong> and <strong>the UK </strong>were number 2 and 3 with <strong>7.3%</strong> and <strong>5.8%</strong> respectively.</p><p>However, in just five years, that distribution has shifted quite significantly. By 2020, <strong>the US</strong> is still number 1 but its proportion of contributors has fallen to <strong>22.7%</strong>, while <strong>China</strong> and <strong>India</strong> raced ahead to <strong>9.76%</strong> and <strong>5.2%</strong> respectively. Being the two largest developing countries, China and India’s growth shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. What may be surprising is the growth of other smaller countries and regions. Here’s the top five in terms of year-on-year growth rate in 2020:</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/emsaIgXNDs_JLXSW_Yr0T2VfAnca-avcXy9vsU2cAba2jyaboAoA8qf2hJBpJsgPWeFQ8BhuEvC8RmiCe5kl46WMln-2AjdQjrV2R3oUapBJVsW6nGmvyZfh1Dno54FerDR8bMHt" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://octoverse.github.com/</figcaption></figure><p>Pakistan, Indonesia, Turkey, Colombia, and Peru round out the second half of the top 10. It’s also important to keep in mind that huge growth rates are usually the result of a small base number, so take that into account when you think about these rather large growth numbers. What’s more interesting to me is that the fastest growing developer clusters are coming from Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.</p><p>Looking into GitHub’s “crystal ball,” by 2025, <strong>the US</strong>’s open source contribution is expected to decrease and stabilize to around <strong>16.4%</strong>. <strong>China</strong>’s share will continue to increase to <strong>13.3%</strong>, <strong>India</strong>’s to <strong>7.9%</strong>, while <strong>Brazil</strong> and <strong>Nigeria</strong> may register <strong>3%</strong> and <strong>1.5%</strong> respectively.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Wi1jkKjwv40iKBLyCMRK2irELRF7_SOZeQkeSJPUwDrrNHwkv2jb6YDmBSuLyj5MEm0latqa3JfFDljRy4eEZpwUCOhCdRCwnn1drWAsTJHLENTH4vwXqyRtbXiBudA_SvHk-xwK" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://octoverse.github.com/</figcaption></figure><p>GitHub did not provide a prediction for 2030, but its report did provide the same visual for what 10 years from now may look like. If you squint hard enough, <strong>China</strong> appears to be a brighter spot than <strong>the US</strong>, while <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Brazil</strong>, <strong>Russia</strong>, and <strong>Nigeria</strong> continue to get noticeably brighter. One other country that looks more visible is <strong>Indonesia</strong>.</p><p>With the exception of South Africa, this trend aligns well with the overall growth of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS">BRICS</a> countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). It’s a short-hand of the major emerging economies, which became a loose international group that was first organized back in 2009. Its developed economies counterpart, the G7, appears to not be a part of this global developer growth wave; only the US and Germany look to maintain significant open source contributor shares.</p><h2 id="emerging-market-developers-impact">Emerging Market Developers’ Impact</h2><p>Of course, squinting is not real analysis. But it is clear that the distribution of developers will be more widespread around the world. What’s not so clear is where and how they will make economic impact.</p><p>I see the emerging market developers’ impact falling into three buckets in the next 10 years: <strong>outsourcing outposts, building domestic markets, founding global-scale startups.</strong></p><p><strong>Outsourcing outposts:</strong> this category is the easiest to understand, because it has been happening for a long time. Large, mature tech companies like IBM and Intel will continue to move low-end non-core technical jobs to cheaper locations with a large pool of technical workforce. India has been a big beneficiary of this trend. Other countries like Brazil and Nigeria may soon follow. Unless there are policy changes in the US that force these companies to onshore more jobs back to America to boost domestic employment, offshoring will continue, just to different locations depending on the price and size of the developer pool. The local economic impact of these “offshore developers” will be somewhat limited, as most of the savings and efficiency gains will be accrued to the multinationals doing the offshoring.</p><p><strong>Building domestic markets:</strong> more and more tech startups are being founded in emerging markets to serve those emerging markets. I briefly <a href="https://interconnected.blog/southeast-asia-pacific-light-cable-network/">profiled four tech giants in Southeast Asia</a> in a previous post -- Grab, Gojek, SEA Group, Tokopedia. SEA Group is already a publicly traded company in New York and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/grab-is-said-to-pick-morgan-stanley-jpmorgan-for-u-s-ipo">Grab may soon do the same</a>. India also has a strong corp of high-growth tech companies with 21 unicorns to date, which I wrote a deep dive on in July of last year in “<a href="https://interconnected.blog/unicorns-entanglement-india-china-america/">Unicorns Entanglement: India, China, America</a>”. Companies like Mercado (e-commerce), Rappi (delivery service), and Nubank (neobank) lead the way in the LATAM region. Jumia (e-commerce) is the current standout in Africa. While none of these markets are anywhere near the same level as the US, the EU or China when it comes to technological sophistication or output, they all have high-growth developer clusters, as we saw above. That means they will catch up fast, particularly as more of these emerging market developers learn, use, and contribute to best-in-class open source projects, which are a big equalizer of technology access. These developers will have plenty of great companies to work for to build their domestic markets.</p><p><strong>Founding global-scale startups: </strong>this last scenario will take the longest time to play out but, from an investor’s point of view, is also the most attractive to me. As a developer hub matures and levels-up, it will solve harder and harder problems -- first for the outsourcers, then its domestic emerging markets to bring them up-to-par with mature markets, then ultimately tackling problems that even the mature markets might need solutions to! These developers’ economic impact will be global.</p><p>It’s not unfathomable to imagine some cloud computing, enterprise tech, and AI products being built by developers in India or Brazil and selling well in the US and EU. (After all, most technology spending is still happening in developed countries.) Climate change technology is another sector where emerging market solutions can flow to developed markets. The Israeli developer ecosystem is already creating startups that are serving markets well-beyond its own border or Europe. Enterprise tech companies founded in Russia and China are also making progress in the US and EU, though they are facing unprecedented geopolitical headwinds.</p><p>This future creates both the exciting prospect of global companies being built outside of wealthy countries and the tough challenge of building, scaling, and operating global companies from places where there was no history of having done so. And much of how this future will play out will depend on how this next crop of developers use the technological superpower at their fingertips, now that we know where they will come from.</p><p><em><strong>If you like what you've read, please <a href="https://interconnected.blog/#subscribe">SUBSCRIBE</a> to the Interconnected email list.

<p>Let me say up front, I’m <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/09/a-word-on-anti-furry-sentiments-in-the-tech-community/">no stranger to negative or ridiculous feedback</a>. It’s incredibly hard to hurt my feelings, especially if you intend to. You don’t openly participate in <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/04/23/never-underestimate-the-furry-fandom/">the furry fandom</a> since 2010 without being accustomed to malevolence and trolling. If this were simply a story of someone being an asshole to me, I would have shrugged and moved on with my life.</p>



<p>It’s important that you understand this, because when you call it like you see it, sometimes people dismiss your criticism with <a href="https://www.takethis.org/2016/04/triggered-a-personal-response-to-a-popular-meme/">“triggered” memes</a>. This isn’t me being offended. I promise.</p>



<hr>



<p>My recent blog post about <a href="https://soatok.blog/2021/02/09/crackpot-cryptography-and-security-theater/">crackpot cryptography</a> received a fair bit of attention in the software community. At one point it was on the front page of Hacker News (which is something that pretty much never happens for anything I write).</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that also means I crossed paths with Zed A. Shaw, the author of <em>Learn Python the Hard Way</em> and other books often recommended to neophyte software developers.</p>



<p>As someone who spends a lot of time <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/06/08/furward-momentum-introduction/">trying to help newcomers acclimate to the technology industry</a>, there are some behaviors I’ve recognized in technologists over the years that makes it harder for newcomers to overcome anxiety, frustration, and Impostor Syndrome. (Especially if they’re LGBTQIA+, a person of color, or a woman.)</p>



<p>Normally, these are easily correctable behaviors exhibited by people who have good intentions but don’t realize the harm they’re causing–often not by what they’re saying, but by how they say it.</p>



<p>Sadly, I can’t be so generous about… whatever <em>this</em> is:</p>

</div><figcaption>What the fuck.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Having never before encountered a living example of a poorly-written villain towards the work I do to help disadvantaged people thrive in technology careers, I sought to clarify Shaw’s intent.</p>

<p>This is effectively a very <em>weird</em> hybrid of an oddly-specific purity test and a form of hazing ritual.</p>



<p>Let’s step back for a second. Can you even fathom the damage attitudes like this can cause? I can tell you firsthand, because it happened to me.</p>



<h2 id="interlude">Interlude: Amplified Impostor Syndrome</h2>



<p>In the beginning of my career, I was just a humble web programmer. Due to a long story I don’t want to get into now, I was acquainted with the culture of black-hat hacking that precipitates the DEF CON community.</p>



<p>In particular, I was exposed the writings of a malicious group called <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/ezines/kr5hou2zh4qtebqk.onion/ZF0/">Zero For 0wned</a>, which made sport of hunting “skiddiez” and preached a very “shut up and stay in your lane” attitude:</p>



<blockquote><p>Geeks don’t really come to HOPE to be lectured on the application of something simple, with very simple means, by a 15 year old. A combination of all the above could be why your room wasn’t full. Not only was it fairly empty, but it emptied at a rapid rate. I could barely take a seat through the masses pushing me to escape. Then when I thought no more people could possibly leave, they kept going. The room was almost empty when I gave in and left also. Heck, I was only there because we pwned the very resources you were talking about.</p><cite>Zero For 0wned</cite></blockquote>



<p>My first security conference was B-Sides Orlando in 2013. Before the conference, I had been hanging out in the #hackucf IRC channel and had known about the event well in advance (and got along with all the organizers and most of the would-be attendees), and considered applying to their CFP.</p>



<p>I ultimately didn’t, solely because I was worried about a ZF0-style reception. </p>



<p>I had no reference frame for other folks’ understanding of cryptography (which is my chosen area of discipline in infosec), and thought things like timing side-channels were “obvious”–even to software developers outside infosec. (Such is the danger of being self-taught!)</p>



<p>“Geeks don’t really come to B-Sides Orlando to be lectured on the application of something simple, with very simple means,” is roughly how I imagined the vitriol would be framed.</p>



<p>If it can happen to me, it can happen to <em>anyone</em> interested in tech. It’s the responsibility of experts and mentors to spare beginners from falling into the trappings of other peoples’ grand-standing.</p>



<h2 id="arrogance">Pride Before Destruction</h2>



<p>With this in mind, let’s return to Shaw. At this point, more clarifying questions came in, this time from Fredrick Brennan.</p>



<figure><div>

<p>What an arrogant and bombastic thing to say!</p>



<p>At this point, I concluded that <a href="https://twitter.com/SoatokDhole/status/1359703488998105090">I can never again, in good conscience, recommend any of Shaw’s books to a fledgling programmer</a>.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever published book recommendations before, I suggest auditing them to make sure you’re not inadvertently exposing beginners to his harmful attitude and problematic behavior.</p>



<p>But while we’re on the subject of Zed Shaw’s behavior…</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>This is actually the dude’s pinned tweet.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If Shaw thinks of himself as a superior cryptography expert, surely he’s published cryptography code online before.</p>



<p>And surely, it will withstand a five-minute code review from a gay furry blogger who never went through Shaw’s prescribed hazing ritual to rediscover specifically the known problems in OpenSSL circa Heartbleed and is therefore not as much of a cryptography expert?</p>







<h2 id="zero-day">May I Offer You a Zero-Day in This Trying Time?</h2>



<p>One of Zed A. Shaw’s Github projects is <a href="https://github.com/zedshaw/srpmin">an implementation of SRP</a> (Secure Remote Password)–an early Password-Authenticated Key Exchange algorithm often integrated with TLS (to form TLS-SRP).</p>

<p>Without even looking past the directory structure, we can already see that it implements <a href="https://github.com/zedshaw/srpmin/blob/master/t_truerand.c">an algorithm called TrueRand</a>, which cryptographer Matt Blaze has this to say:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/tqbf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tqbf</a> Also: please nobody use truerand.

</div><figcaption>You should be <a href="https://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/">using /dev/urandom</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As noted by the README, Shaw stripped out all of the “extraneous” things and doesn’t have all of the previous versions of SRP “since those are known to be vulnerable”.</p>



<p>So given Shaw’s previous behavior, and the removal of vulnerable versions of SRP from his fork of Tom Wu’s libsrp code, it stands to reason that Shaw believes the cryptography code he published would be secure. Otherwise, why would he behave with such arrogance?</p>



<h3>SRP in the Grass</h3>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/ScruffKerfluff/">Scruff</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>When I say SRP, I’m referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol">SRP-6a</a>. Earlier versions of the protocol are out of scope; as are proposed variants (e.g. ones that employ SHA-256 instead of SHA-1).</p>



<p>Professor Matthew D. Green of Johns Hopkins University (who incidentally used to proverbially shit on OpenSSL in the way that Shaw expects everyone to, except productively) <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/should-you-use-srp/">dislikes SRP but considered the protocol “not obviously broken”</a>.</p>



<p>However, a secure protocol doesn’t mean the implementations are always secure. (Anyone who’s looked at older versions of OpenSSL’s BigNum library after reading my <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/08/27/soatoks-guide-to-side-channel-attacks/">guide to side-channel attacks</a> knows better.)</p>



<p>There are a few ways to implement SRP insecurely:</p>



<ol><li>Use an insecure random number generator (e.g. TrueRand) for salts or private keys.</li><li>Fail to use a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5054#appendix-A">secure set of parameters</a> (q, N, g).<p>To expand on this, SRP requires q be a Sophie-Germain prime and N be its corresponding Safe Prime. The standard Diffie-Hellman primes (MODP) are not sufficient for SRP.</p><p>This security requirement exists because SRP requires an algebraic structure called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)">ring</a>, rather than a cyclic group (as per Diffie-Hellman).</p></li><li>Fail to perform the critical validation steps <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5054#section-3.1">as outlined in RFC 5054</a>.</li></ol>



<p>In one way or another, Shaw’s SRP library fails at every step of the way. The first two are trivial:</p>



<ol><li>We’ve already seen the RNG used by srpmin. <a href="https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/paper-prngs.pdf">TrueRand is not a cryptographically secure pseudo random number generator</a>.</li><li>Zed A. Shaw’s srpmin <a href="https://github.com/zedshaw/srpmin/blob/217ec0a968a551fe6452c9bef7b37b38e165c94f/t_conf.c#L39-L107">only supports unsafe primes</a> for SRP (i.e. the ones from RFC 3526, which is for Diffie-Hellman).</li></ol>



<p>The third is more interesting. Let’s talk about the RFC 5054 validation steps in more detail.</p>



<h4 id="srp6a-validation">Parameter Validation in SRP-6a</h4>



<p>From a client’s perspective, you must verify that <code>(B % N) != 0</code>. This is critical to the security of SRP. This check <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu/ndss.html#SECTION00043000000000000000">prevents dictionary attacks on the password from a man-in-the-middle</a>.</p>



<p>From the server’s (or a peer’s) perspective, you must also verify <code>(A % N) &gt; 0</code> to prevent the server’s session key from being forced to a known value (i.e. zero).</p>



<p>Additionally, the value <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu/ndss.html#SECTION00032400000000000000"><code>u</code> must not be revealed by the server until the client has sent <code>A</code></a>. It must also not be set to <code>0</code>. Failure to uphold these constraints can allow clients to impersonate their peers.</p>



<p>These are obvious and well-known SRP constraints first published in 1997 by Tom Wu.</p>

    <img src="https://neonmirrors.net/images/2021-02/kubernetes-policy-comparison-opa-gatekeeper-vs-kyverno/featured.png">
    
    <p>With the upcoming <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97171">deprecation and subsequent removal</a> of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/">Pod Security Policies (PSPs)</a> in Kubernetes, the time is near to find suitable alternatives. Those alternatives, it seems clear at present anyway, will need to be sourced from outside the Kubernetes project itself as there will be no replacement provided. The two leading CNCF projects which are prime candidates for PSP replacement are <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/">Open Policy Agent (OPA)</a> via <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper">Gatekeeper</a> and <a href="https://kyverno.io/">Kyverno</a>, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. But it is confusing and daunting to compare and contrast them given that no comparisons presently exist. Not only are these projects viable replacements for PSPs, they are vastly more capable than simply acting on Pods alone--they are full Kubernetes policy engines. The goal of this article is to provide a neutral and impartial comparison between Gatekeeper and Kyverno so users may make the most informed selection decision for themselves. It will be an evaluation of each project's merits assuming only the Kubernetes angle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because this article is being written with Kubernetes in mind, the OPA/Gatekeeper project will simply be referred to as Gatekeeper henceforth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This comparison article is organized into two main sections bookended by an introduction and closing. The first is an objective comparison, in tabular format, of Gatekeeper and Kyverno focusing on three main categories of attributes and capabilities reflecting, as best as possible, only the facts. The second is my subjective analysis given the earlier comparison and will provide personal opinion and commentary as to use case and recommendations of the ideal user.</p>
<p>I'd like to openly state my own personal bias in the interest of transparency. I am a Kyverno contributor and not a Gatekeeper one. I have authored a few blogs on Kyverno at this point and none on Gatekeeper. I have also been somewhat critical of OPA/Rego in the past. However, my goal here is to put all that plus any personal feelings aside and attempt to approach both projects fresh, with no bias and no preference for one over another.</p>
<p>This article has been written by equally engaging both the Kyverno and Open Policy Agent communities, giving the maintainers and contributors a fair and equal opportunity to comment on the comparison criteria as well as the final results of this article. No preference has been given to either project in terms of engagement or consideration either in regards to the time to comment or the methods in which to engage.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-a-kubernetes-policy">What is a Kubernetes Policy</h3>
<p>While Pod Security Policy in Kubernetes is a set of mechanisms for ensuring validating controls over Pods and their attributes, as the name would imply, it only operates on Pods and nothing else. Further, PSP can only block their creation; it does not perform any remediation thereof. Contrast that with policy engines such as Gatekeeper and Kyverno, and the capabilities are far more broad (i.e., applicable to more than just Pods) and deep (i.e., more than just simple validation). Having a policy engine for Kubernetes can be thought of as a way to more holistically control the Kubernetes environment and not just a single domain.</p>
<h3 id="gatekeeper-introduction">Gatekeeper Introduction</h3>
<p>Gatekeeper is an open-source project and collaboration between a number of companies including Google and Microsoft, later donated to the CNCF. Now in its third iteration, Gatekeeper is the Kubernetes-specific implementation of Open Policy Agent (OPA), a general-purpose policy engine. Because of the relationship between Open Policy Agent with Gatekeeper, the project is often written "OPA/Gatekeeper" to acknowledge these ties. Gatekeeper enables request validation and, most recently, mutation.  A major defining characteristic of Open Policy Agent is its reliance upon the use of a specialized programming language called Rego in order to implement the logic necessary for policy decisions. Through Rego, OPA is designed to be broadly applicable to disparate software and not Kubernetes exclusively, as well as achieve a high level of logic execution.</p>
<h3 id="kyverno-introduction">Kyverno Introduction</h3>
<p>Kyverno is an open-source project originally from Nirmata and later donated to the CNCF. Like Gatekeeper, Kyverno is a Kubernetes policy engine with validation and mutation abilities, however it adds resource generation in addition to, most recently, API object lookups. Unlike Gatekeeper, Kyverno was written from the start solely for use in Kubernetes. A major defining characteristic of Kyverno is its generation ability and the architecture which does not require specialized knowledge of a programming language to render policy decisions. Primarily as a reaction to this requirement of a specialized language, Kyverno differentiates itself from Gatekeeper through its model of simplicity.</p>
<h2 id="comparison">Comparison</h2>
<p>The following are a set of three tables which attempt to categorize and enumerate the features and qualities of each project in the most objective manner possible. The categories are features/capabilities which describe technical attributes; community/ecosystem which describe adoption and organizational attributes; and meta/misc which describe cognitive or miscellaneous attributes.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>Based upon the earlier table of feature comparisons between Gatekeeper and Kyverno, I have put together a concise list of the main advantages and disadvantages of each project. This is not an exhaustive list, only the large topics.</p>
<p><strong>Gatekeeper Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Capable of expressing very complex policy</li>
<li>More establishment in the community</li>
<li>Supports multiple replicas for availability and scale</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gatekeeper Disadvantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requiring a programming language is a serious learning curve which generates large amounts of technical debt and increases time to value</li>
<li>Mutation ability is in nascent stage</li>
<li>No generation ability means its usefulness is limited to predominantly validation use cases</li>
<li>Policy is complex, often lengthy, and requires multiple documents to implement</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kyverno Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dramatic simplicity of policy expression allowing Kubernetes-style composition</li>
<li>Solid mutation abilities</li>
<li>Generation and syncing ability is unique and allows new use cases</li>
<li>Quick time to value and high degree of flexibility</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kyverno Disadvantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Highly complex policy generally not possible since no programming language exposed</li>
<li>Young, still largely unproven due to lower establishment</li>
<li>API lookup ability is in nascent stage</li>
<li>Not HA capable presently (road map)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: The following is my opinionated analysis synthesized of the previous comparison table and advantages/disadvantages list in addition to my own experiences with both tools and time spent in the cloud-native community. If you are not interested in reading my opinion, this is the end of the article for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kubernetes is a declarative system in which the user's desires are stated and Kubernetes, through its various controllers, goes to work reconciling the observed state in order to bring it into alignment with the desired state. This is the core value proposition of a cloud-native platform. In order to achieve this, the onus of the logic is shifted away from the user and into the platform itself. For each resource type, there exists some internal logic which houses the intelligence needed to remediate its state. With Gatekeeper, by far the largest weakness is its requirement of a purpose-built programming language called Rego, which can be used nowhere else, in order to implement this logic. This is a reality because OPA is a general purpose policy engine. Only through Gatekeeper is its ability harnessed by adapting it into a Kubernetes form factor. Effectively then, the user is responsible for describing the object (policy) they wish reconciled as well as providing the logic necessary (Rego) to reconcile it. Using an external DSL to manage Kubernetes policies can become cumbersome and complex in a number of respects and add technical debt to projects. As a tradeoff, the distinct advantage is that it enables very powerful policies. After all, when one is required to write a programming language, one is only limited by the capabilities of that language and its inputs. This cost can be reduced if OPA can be leveraged elsewhere, however.</p>
<p>Kyverno is seen as a direct reaction to the complex technical demands required by Gatekeeper. Because it was built specifically for Kubernetes and expresses policy declaratively, its mental model is identical to the way Kubernetes objects are described and reconciled. The logic needed to carry out the policy decision is removed from the burden of the user and becomes the domain of the tool itself. This model results in an overwhelming simplification of how policy is written, which in turn makes policy easier in a number of respects. By having mutation and generation abilities, Kyverno is transfigured away from a simple admission …</p></article></div></div></div>

<p>Is it still wrong if everyone is doing it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The Gang of Four book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Design Patterns</a> gives us common vocabulary to understand basic patterns in Object-oriented programming. It helps all of us use the same terms when discussing our software and prevents confusion.</p>
<p>Sadly, this book seems to cause a whole hell of a lot of confusion.</p>
<p>They say "prefer composition over inheritance." That's great, there's good reason for that.</p>
<p>They say to use "delegation." That's great. Although there's not a single example of delegation in their book.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/24897267.jpg" alt="I do not think it means what you think it means"> Delegation is a technique often cited as a way to create flexibility in your programs. That is to say, delegation is often given as the way to composition.</p>
<p>But delegation isn't what you think it is. The Gang of Four have lead you astray.</p>
<p>Worse still, almost every reference you'll find for "delegation" shows you examples of just object collaboration with message forwarding. They are examples of plain old method calls and not delegation.</p>
<p>Now imagine what your mentor would say about understanding basic programming concepts...</p>
<p>Don't have a mentor? That's ok. Imagine that you do. Now imagine what your mentor would say about understanding basic programming concepts...</p>
<p>You should probably understand them correctly, right?</p>
<h2 id="so-what-is-delegation-">So what is Delegation?</h2>
<p>Delegation is easy to understand but we're so used to hearing and reading it in reference to something else. Let's fix that.</p>
<p>Henry Lieberman coined the term "delegation" in <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=960112.28718">Using prototypical objects to implement shared behavior in object-oriented systems</a> released with the OOPLSA '86 Conference proceedings on Object-oriented programming systems, languages and applications. That content is behind a pay wall, but you can read similar and updated content on <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~lieber/Lieberary/OOP/Delegation/Delegation.html">his website</a></p>
<p>In there, you'll find exactly what delegation is, but I'm not sending you away to pore over another long article; I can simplify it for you. When you have time, however, go read Lieberman's own words.</p>
<p>Lieberman discussed this in terms of a GUI drawing tool. Here's the key idea behind delegation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a pen delegates a draw message to a prototypical pen, it is saying "I don't know how to handle the draw message. I'd like you to answer it for me if you can, but if you have any further questions, like what is the value of my x variable, or need anything done, you should come back to me and ask." If the message is delegated further, all questions about the values of variables or requests to reply to messages are all inferred to the object that delegated the message in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, when you send a message to an object, it has a notion of "self" where it can find attributes and other methods. When that object delegates to another, then any reference to "self" <strong>always</strong> refers to the original message recipient. Always.</p>
<h2 id="the-other-inheritance">The other inheritance</h2>
<p>Class-based inheritance isn't the only game in town. Prototype-based inheritance is another way to structure your objects for behavior sharing. One approach sets behaviors in an abstract location (the class) and another sets it on instances (the objects).</p>
<p><a href="http://selflanguage.org/">Self</a> is a programming language which implements what Lieberman defines. Self has objects which contain <em>slots</em>. Each slot can contain a method, or a reference to a prototype object in a <em>parent</em> slot. If an object received a message it didn't understand, it could delegate to an object in its parent slot.</p>
<p>This is prototypical inheritance, not class inheritance. It is similar, although not the same, as saying that an object has a class (like Ruby objects) which contains additional behavior.</p>
<p>Self giving us objects with a parent slot is he equivalent of <a href="http://mozilla.org/js/">JS</a> giving us an object with a <em>prototype</em> reference.</p>
<p>JS is the most popular prototype-based language and is much easier for you to try, so rather than teach you Self, we'll look at JS. You can even open up your browser's console and try this out right now.</p>
<p>In JS we can assign a prototype: the equvalent of the parent slot in Self.</p>
<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">function Container(){};
Container.prototype = new Object();
Container.prototype.announce = function(){ alert("these are my things: " + this.things) };

function Bucket(things){this.things = things};
Bucket.prototype = new Container();

bucket = new Bucket("planes, trains, and automobiles")
bucket.announce() // alerts "these are my things: planes, trains, and automobiles"</code></pre>

<p>In delegation parlance the <code>bucket</code> object is the <em>client</em> which forwards a message to the <em>delegate</em>. </p>
<p>In the above example, you can see that the evaluation of <code>this.things</code> was done in the context of the client object. When we called the <code>announce</code> function, it was found on the delegate object. When the function was evaluated, <code>this</code> refered to the client.</p>
<p>When a JS object's prototype contains a functon, the function is evaluated as if the object has that method. The first example showed that <code>this</code> (which is just <code>self</code> in JS) always referred to the original message recipient.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-ruby-">What about Ruby?</h2>
<p>First, understand forwarding. Forwarding is passing a message from one object to another. The Ruby standard library <code>forwardable</code> is aptly named and allows you to forward messages from one object to another.</p>
<p>Now, let's take the poorly named <code>delegate</code> library from the Ruby standard library which also allows you to forward messages from one object to another.</p>
<pre data-preserve-html-node="true">require 'delegate'

# assuming we have a Person class with a name method
person = Person.new(:name =&gt; 'Jim')

class Greeter &lt; SimpleDelegator
  def hello
    "Hi! I'm #{name}."
  end
end

greeter = Greeter.new(person)

greeter.hello #=&gt; "Hi! I'm Jim."
</pre>

<p>What happens inside that <code>Greeter</code> is that when the <code>greeter</code> instance is initialized it contains a reference to the <code>person</code>. When an unknown method is called, it is <em>forwarded</em> to the target object (which is <code>person</code>). Remember, we're still looking at the <code>delegate</code> library, which helps us forward messages... Confused? Yeah, I was too. So, it seems, is the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Forwarding is just the passing of a message to an object: a method call.</p>
<p>The difference between this and <strong>delegation</strong> is that these libraries allow you to easily forward messages to additional objects, rather than executing the method of another object in the context of the first like we saw with prototype-based inheritance in JS.</p>
<p>We are often barely aware of this because Ruby's <code>method_missing</code> power does the trick in <code>SimpleDelegator</code>. We think about methods automagically going to the object we want. </p>
<p>Even though our <code>Greeter</code> method refers to <code>self</code>, the message is forwarded to the other object and handled there when, of course, the method is missing on the client.</p>
<p>If we want to share behavior without extending an object with additional methods, then <code>method_missing</code> and/or <code>SimpleDelegator</code> can do the trick nicely. This works well for simple uses. It does, however, break references to an object's class. </p>
<p>Suppose, for example, we want to reference the client object's class with some new kind of greeting. And instead of the normal greeting, let's make it say "Hi! I'm the esteemed Person, Jim." </p>
<p>We don't want to completely rewrite the method, so we'll rely on <code>super</code> to get whatever is implemented in the regular <code>Greeter</code>.</p>
<pre data-preserve-html-node="true">class ProperGreeter &lt; Greeter
  def name
    "the esteemed " + self.class.name + ", " + super
  end
end

proper_greeter = ProperGreeter.new(person)

proper_greeter.hello #=&gt; "Hi! I'm the esteemed ProperGreeter, Jim."
</pre>

<p>Hmmm. That's not what we expected. What we wanted to see was "the esteemed Person". </p>
<p>This is a simple illustration of the fact that we have <strong>two</strong> objects and is an example of <strong>self-schizophrenia</strong> in Object-oriented design. Each object has its own identity and notion of <code>self</code>. We can fix that by changing the reference to use <code>__getobj__</code> (the way SimpleDelegator expects) instead of <code>self</code>, but this is an illustration of how <code>self</code> does not refer to what we want. We must explicitly work with two objects and our mental model <strong>always</strong> requires that we think about two objects interacting when we only really care about altering the behavior of one.</p>
<p>This is not delegation. This is always two objects collaborating. Despite the numerous books, articles, and software libraries telling you otherwise. The Gang of Four got Delegation wrong, but that's OK because now you know better.</p>
<h2 id="whatever-i-ll-call-it-what-i-want">Whatever, I'll call it what I want</h2>
<p><em>Who cares. Let's not rock the boat. Everyone is doing it.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, Design Patterns showed examples in C++. And C++ can't do delegation. So is that a valid argument for rewriting the meaning of a term?</p>
<p>If the language you use can't provide it, don't just call what the language <em>can</em> do "delegation."</p>
<h2 id="get-the-concepts-right">Get the concepts right</h2>
<p>Developing an application requires that you understand not only your business domain concepts, but also understand many tools and approaches to your design. Software design patterns are common ways to solve common problems. Understanding what they are and when to use them is a key part of being an efficient developer.</p>
<p>The Design Patterns book is often lauded for giving names to commonly used software design patterns. This helps all of us use the same terms when discussing our software and prevents confusion.</p>
<p>Of course, as I began research for <a href="http://clean-ruby.com/">Clean Ruby</a> I picked up the Design Patterns book for some clarity. "Surely this book will help guide the discussion and understanding of how to approach different patterns," I thought. Sadly, it contains a glaring mistake that has been repeated and codified in numerous books, articles, and software libraries. Again and again I've read the same description of a behavior sharing and object composition pattern in software that is almost always given the wrong name.</p>
<p>The Design Patterns book is great for having pushed the idea of "composition over inheritance." In fact, so many …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></main></div></div>

is that we’re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of
locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least
energy to move a kilometer. Humans came in with a rather unimpressive
showing about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a
showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good.</p><p>But then, somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the
efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a
human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the
charts.</p><p>And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the
most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with.</p><p>It’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lvMgMrNDlg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=322">Steve Jobs (1980)</a></p></blockquote><p>* * *</p><p><a href="https://www.it-hiroshima.ac.jp/institution/library/pdf/research52%5F007-013.pdf">No one knows</a> when or how we, the human species, started talking to each
other. It is likely a natural progression from gesturing, but we can only
speculate about it.</p><p>Language allowed us to break out of our brains and reveal the inner
workings of our consciousness to others.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/language_speech.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Scott H.

Young</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Language is the vessel that carried us from the stone age through the
agricultural revolution, the development of written language, the
scientific and industrial revolutions, and now, the digital age.</p><p>Writing allowed us to <em>offload</em> memories to the physical world—outside of
our brains. Through our collective and external memories, each generation
has a head start on the previous one. Little by little, standing on the
shoulders of taller and taller giants, we accumulate knowledge about
ourselves and everything around us.</p><p>We’ve been for long using tools to help us think: notebooks help us
calculate formulas, reason geometrically and preserve our ideas. With
computers, our <em>thinking</em> is now occurring outside of our brains.</p><p>Computers are extensions of our minds in that they allow us to store,
process, and retrieve information from them. With the advent of the
internet we now have immediate access to not only almost all of the
information ever produced by humankind but also to reproducible <em>thinking</em>
encoded into these machines: algorithms.</p><p>Our brain is still a much more impressive device than any of today's
computers. Computers learn
<a href="https://www.davidsilver.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nfsp-1.pdf">mostly</a>
by finding patterns in massive
quantities of examples given by us. Teaching a young kid about cars—how
to recognize one, what they are, what their purpose is, and how they're
related to other things—requires little supervision. Noam Chomsky talks
about it in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdUbIlwHRkY&amp;t=1462">this interview</a>.</p><p>Each of these processes—storing, processing and retrieving
information—have concrete effects on the physical world: if I’m in
Munich, saying “show route to Hamburg” to my phone will immediately show me
the distance, ETAs and paths for different types of transport to reach my
destination. Not only do I now suddenly know how to navigate across the
country to reach another city, I’m also able to follow through the exact
path via GPS—a sixth sense giving me perfect geolocation!</p><p>These <em>things</em> that we created—computers, and the internet—are literally
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502424/">rewiring our brains</a>, right now, shaping how we think, and engage in social
relationships, changing not only our individual selves but the societies we
live in.</p><p>They started as mechanical machines that filled entire laboratories, turned
into beige boxes in our homes and places of work, and are now sleek slabs
of plastic, metal and glass in everyone’s pockets. Step by step they get
closer to our bodies, their interfaces more intuitive and natural.</p><p>The way we communicate with them is changing: before, we could only
interact with them by speaking their language. We have now taught them
ours. The torch of progress blazes on: it’s a matter of <em>time</em> until they’re
connected directly with our brains—which is equally terrifying and
awe-inspiring.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/neuralink.jpg" alt="Figure 3: Neuralink"><figcaption><p>Figure 3: <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Brain-computer interfaces present a monumental scientific and engineering
challenge, and brain-to-brain, a whole other category of difficulty.</p><p>First, we have no idea how information is encoded in the brain. That needs
to be understood. Second, even assuming we’re able to take a perfect
snapshot of a piece of information in someone’s brain—for example, how a
particular movie scene makes them feel—we still need to be able to encode
it in a way that includes the full context of their subjective experiences.
Maybe the scene evokes unique memories of their childhood or is somehow
entangled with the smell of a particular cinema’s leather seats. Third, we
need to figure out how to safely write this perfect snapshot into someone
else’s brain in a way that can be perceived identically.</p><p>Which is to say, it’s a difficult problem. But a worthwhile one: imagine
having the capability to suddenly become aware of answers for questions you
just thought about. To expertly control <a href="https://youtu.be/PLk8Pm%5FXBJE?t=13">truly integrated</a> prosthetics giving
you superhuman abilities. To give movement to the paralized, sound to the
deaf, and sight to the blind.</p><p>What would be the impacts on society if we were able to communicate an
order of magnitude more effectively? What if <em>everyone</em> was equipped with
the same undisputed basic knowledge of history and science?</p><p>There are internal thoughts that we can attempt to describe with a thousand
words, but ultimately fail to capture in a way that’s precise, much less
comprehensible by someone else. Words and sentences are an incomplete
representation of our internal thoughts. In the same way that 3D objects
cast 2D shadows (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0WjV6MmCyM">and 4D, 3D</a>) communicating through language doesn’t carry
all of our cultural and developmental context—transmitting all of that
along with every phrase would be impractical. Language is in this sense,
lossily compressed thought.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/tesseract_shadow.jpg"></figure><p>Inert strings of words of ink and paper take a life of their own inside our
heads. It’s why the exact same information can be interpreted completely
differently by different people.</p><p>Before language, fire and cooking technology allowed us to reallocate
energy usage from the digestive system to the brain by outsourcing
digestion to outside of our bodies, making macronutrients more efficiently
absorbable. Almost all of a cooked meal is metabolized by the body, whereas
raw foods yield less than half of their nutrients.</p><p>Cooking is an extension of our digestive system, and enabled us to develop
large, calorie-hungry brains. It also gave us time to think: our primate
cousins spend half of their days chewing raw food to consume enough
calories to stay alive.</p><p>Brains can be seen as <em>survival machines</em>, locked inside dark skulls,
constantly building a model of the outside world by predicting and learning
through senses and memory. The biological human brain evolved to have the
necessary sophistication to not only expertly navigate and understand the
brute physical reality but also to construct <em>social</em> reality. Democracy,
religion, money: all made up by us, for us.</p><p>We remember the past so that we can predict the future, and by doing so, we
thrive.</p><p>We create technology, which functions as a non-biological extra layer to
our brains and bodies, augmenting, complementing, and sometimes replacing
our natural capabilities.</p><blockquote><p>The wheel… is an extension of the foot.</p><p>The book… is an extension of the eye…</p><p>Clothing, an extension of the skin…</p><p>Electric circuitry, an extension of the central nervous system.</p><p>—
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media">Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (1964)</a></p></blockquote><p>Relatively speaking, we are done evolving <em>biologically</em>. Further adaptations
and enhancements to our bodies and minds will come through technology.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/brain_layers.jpg" alt="Figure 5: Check out &amp;ldquo;Neuralink and the Brain&amp;rsquo;s Magical Future&amp;rdquo; for a very entertaining primer on the brain."><figcaption><p>Figure 5: Check out “<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">Neuralink and the Brain’s Magical Future</a>” for a very entertaining primer on the brain.</p></figcaption></figure><p>To be human is to have the ability to change the world around us. The shift
from hunting and gathering to farming allowed us to spend less energy to
acquire food while giving us a predictable calorie supply.</p><p>The resulting food surplus made it possible for populations to settle down
and grow quickly while supporting people not being directly involved in the
production of food—before agriculture that was everyone’s job. For one,
it allowed some to specialize and focus on developing better farming tools
and more resistant crops, starting a vicious cycle of improvement and
consumption that continues until today.</p><p>The transition from active foraging to a more sedentary lifestyle resulted
in worse health for the general population. The average farmer worked
harder than the average forager and got a worse diet in return. Our teeth,
bones and joints became more fragile, and we became afflicted by novel
diseases coming from newly domesticated animals, carriers of pathogens that
incubated in our new densely populated cities.</p><p>Owning land suddenly became really important. Agriculture and the concept
of private property reinforced each other and grew together, allowing us to
create value and secure the fruits of our labor. It also created the
circumstances for slavery to arise, and wars to be waged.</p><p>The groups of people growing the first crops could not have anticipated all
of the collateral effects of their breakthrough. They just wanted more
food.</p><p>If the past has taught us anything is that we have to be mindful of the
consequences of our progress. In an increasingly connected world, change is
often <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/linear-thinking-in-a-nonlinear-world">nonlinear</a> and unpredictable. Cars didn’t just replace horses—they
forever changed the entire outlook of every city. Did Tim Berners-Lee
anticipate his invention adding to forces pulling whole countries apart?</p><p>Our progress will continue to bring us previously unimaginable challenges.
Against an unknowable future, it doesn’t hurt to keep improving our
capabilities to adapt and, more difficultly, to cooperate—especially at
scale.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/humanity.jpg" alt="Figure 6: &amp;ldquo;Humanity&amp;rdquo; by Pawel Kuczynski"><figcaption><p>Figure 6: “<a href="https://www.pictorem.com/24592/humanity.html">Humanity</a>” by Pawel Kuczynski</p></figcaption></figure><p>Computers are getting pretty good at driving cars—even in the most

              <p>Q: Do I need to know electronics? What skills are required for
                assembly? Can anyone build it?</p>
              <p> A: This was designed to be an easy-build kit. No soldering is
                required, nor glue, nor cutting. One should be able to put it
                together in a short afternoon with a screwdriver or two,
                tweezers, and a careful hand.</p>
              <p>Q: What comes with the kit?</p>
              <p>A: Everything you need to make a complete, working phone. Just
                supply a SIM card from your cell carrier.</p>
              <p>Q: Will a ready-built version be available in the future?</p>
              <p>A: Possibly. There are bureaucratic reasons that this is not
                straight-forward (i.e. FCC licensing). Besides, selling a
                ready-to-use cellphone would warrant a level of customer support
                which I'm not currently able to provide.</p>
              <p>Q: What size SIM card does it take?</p>
              <p>A: The standard/full-size one.</p>
              <p>Q: Who designed this?</p>
              <p>A: All design -- electrical, mechanical, and software -- was
                entirely by Justine Haupt (Sky's Edge is my creative outlet).</p>
              <p>Q: Can I order specific parts (not the whole kit), and make the
                rest myself? </p>
              <p>A: Sure! Or, if you love doing things from scratch, you can use
                the design files to make the entire thing on your own. It's open
                source.</p>
              <p>Q: What's the chipset? </p>
              <p>A: The microcontroller is an AtMega2560 running an Arduino
                bootloader. The cellular module is a uBlox TOBY-L2. The specific
                model depend on region.</p>
              <p>Q: In what ways is it a more functional telephone than a
                smartphone?</p>
              A:
              <ul>
                <li>Better reception because the antennas aren't packed against
                  the electronics. </li>
                <li>You don't have to navigate an operating system to get to the
                  phone "application". </li>
                <li>You can assign two buttons to be hard-coded for quick
                  dialing your favorite people. Your spouse, parent, or child
                  can be a single button-press away.</li>
                <li>The point of the phone isn't to use the rotary dial every
                  time you call someone, which would get tiresome fast. You can
                  store your contacts list and then dial up your friends with
                  just two spins of the dial. When the less frequent need to
                  dial a new number arises, the novelty of the satisfying-to-use
                  rotary dial is fun rather than annoying.</li>
                <li>Previously, phones with physical keys required a clamshell
                  (flip) form-factor to prevent unintended dialing. Rotary dials
                  are naturally resistant to butt dialing.</li>
                <li>Nearly instantaneous 10-segment display of signal strength
                  or battery level. Compare to typical 4-bar signal meters.</li>
                <li>The rear ePaper display (for displaying contacts) is
                  bistatic, meaning it doesn't take any energy to display a
                  fixed message.</li>
                <li>The power switch is an actual slide switch. No holding down
                  a stupid button to make it turn off and not being sure it
                  really is turning off or what.</li>
                <li>Physical cut-off switch for the microphone. Thank you Edward
                  Snowden.</li>
              </ul>

<p>In 2020 Laurent Bercot, the developer of the <a href="https://www.skarnet.org/software/s6-linux-init/">s6 init tools</a>, was contacted by a recruiter at Google. He wrote an answer which he made public. That answer deserves to be spread far and wide. I present the answer here as a direct copy from the original.</p>

<p>
 Hi XXXXX,
</p>

<p>
 Thanks for reaching out. I am safe and healthy, and I hope the current
situation finds you safe as well. The timing is not insensitive at all,
I am lucky to be working in an industry that is not significantly
impacted by the sanitary crisis, because in most cases it is possible
for us tech people to work from home, and we have teleconference
software, Google Meet being one of the popular ones. :)
</p>

<p>
 You are asking me if I would be interested in chatting about options
for joining Google again, either in your growing Warsaw site or in
other Google locations.
</p>

<p>
 Since I left Google in 2014, I have undergone quite a bit of growth,
certainly in technical skills, but also in the way that I see and
understand the world, and how I can strive to make it better, and how
technology can make it better, and how powerful tech companies such as
Google can have an impact and use their power for good.
</p>

<p>
 As a result, I would certainly be interested in helping Google make
the world better. But I am not sure that what I have in mind is in line
with what Google has in mind. If I were to work for Google again, in
any capacity, I would first need the assurance that I am working in the
right direction, and that my work will actually bring positive change.
And so far, the direction that Google has taken in recent years does
not give me that assurance. Let me guide you through a few examples.
</p>

<ul>
 <li> I am a big proponent of diversity and inclusion in the workspace.
There was a time where Google was a major voice for progress in this
domain, and my SRE team in Dublin in 2013-2014 was pretty diverse and
inclusive (at least, if you consider that 0 women out of 9 people is
diverse enough). However, this claim for support for inclusion seems
to be changing: <br>
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/current-ex-employees-allege-google-drastically-rolled-back-diversity-inclusion-n1206181">
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/current-ex-employees-allege-google-drastically-rolled-back-diversity-inclusion-n1206181</a><br>
Why has Google rolled back the Sojourn project and cut back other
diversity initiatives? I've heard that it was due to the programs not
scaling, but why does scalability matter more than maintaining programs
that work? Isn't doing good at a small scale better than doing nothing
at a large scale? </li> 

 <li> If you know anything about me, you know that I am extremely
sensitive to user privacy issues. When I joined the Web SRE team in
2013, I was pleased to see the lengths that Google would go to in
order to strip personally identifiable information from the access logs
of the Google servers. But these last few years, the efforts have seemed
to diminish. For instance, this is what happened a few days ago: <br>
<a href="https://forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2020/05/15/google-home-hub-shows-random--nest-cam-footage-on-familys-device">
https://forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2020/05/15/google-home-hub-shows-random--nest-cam-footage-on-familys-device/</a><br>
Back in 2013, with the architecture that Google was using, leaking some
user's data to another user was simply inconceivable. I shiver to
think of the changes, not only at the tech level, but also at the policy
level, that have had to occur in order for such an accident to be
possible. </li>

 <li> In the same vein, in 2016, Google's commitment to user privacy with
respect to online advertising was silently dropped: <br>
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking">
https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking</a><br>
So, the very policy that was the pride and joy of every privacy-conscious
Google worker, the thing that made Google different from Facebook and
other mega tech corporations, not only was dropped, but was dropped
<em>silently</em>. Such a decision seems too important to be kept quiet; it is
a significant change. Could this be that Google did something they
<em>knew</em> was wrong? If both the commitment to user privacy and the
commitment to transparency were abandoned, what makes Google different
from Facebook today? </li>

 <li> Another recent example that shows Google is not the privacy-conscious
company it once was: <br>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-13/google-faces-eu-privacy-complaint-for-tracking-users">
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-13/google-faces-eu-privacy-complaint-for-tracking-users</a><br>
Privacy is not only important to me, it is also important to the
EU jurisdictions. What assurance could I get that my work would not be
used for illegal purposes? </li>

 <li> A lot has been written about YouTube in these recent years, and in
particular its recommendation algorithm. YouTube has the manpower to
tweak its recommendation algorithm, as it has shown recently by
deprioritizing independent content in favor of "authoritative sources",
i.e. corporate sources. Still, back when it was crucial and could
impact the world for the better in a very real, very significant way,
YouTube refused to tweak the levers. For instance, this is what
happened: <br>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/world/americas/youtube-brazil.html">
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/world/americas/youtube-brazil.html</a><br>
At the time, YouTube (and more generally, Google) spokespeople said
that they did not want to be censors, they did not want to have a hand
in what content was favored and what content was not. A principled
stance, which can be argued against but which can also be argued for,
and principles are generally a good thing. However, these principles
did not seem to hold any water, because YouTube is now happily tweaking
its algorithm, not to silence anti-science voices, but to silence
dissident voices in an increasingly authoritarian world. What happened,
and why is it looking so bad? </li>

 <li> Climate change is real. It is important that everyone understands
this. Yet, last year, Google sponsored a conference hosting climate
change denialists: <br>
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18194432/facebook-google-microsoft-libertycon-climate-change">
https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18194432/facebook-google-microsoft-libertycon-climate-change</a><br>
I can certainly think of other, better ways of using Google money to
make a positive change in the world. If I can, why can't the decision
makers at the top levels of Google? </li>

 <li> An important way for rich people, and rich companies, to be a part
of the collective effort to make the world a more just, more equitable
place, is to pay their fair share of taxes. Unfortunately, it seems
that Google does not do that, either: <br>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/16/google-told-by-mp-you-do-do-evil">
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/16/google-told-by-mp-you-do-do-evil</a><br>
As per the article, it was <em>already</em> not doing that when I was hired in
2013. At the time there was a widely publicized claim among Googlers
that once you were hired, you could have access to <em>any</em> information
about the workings of Google. I did inquire a bit about the financing
models and the revenue flow, and I find it curious that I never heard
anything about tax avoidance. It may be that the clamored openness was
not as thorough as everyone pretended to believe it was. </li>
</ul>

 <p>
 All those items are pretty damning, if we are looking at how Google
impacts the world at large. But you could still have a chance at
appealing to the nerd in me, the person who loves technology and who
wants to make cool things. Because at least at Google we make
good tech, right? Well, about that...<br>
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/when-it-comes-to-gorillas-google-photos-remains-blind/">
https://www.wired.com/story/when-it-comes-to-gorillas-google-photos-remains-blind/</a><br>
How is it possible to be so short-sighted with regards to testing
software as to fail to include black people in the Photos AI training
set, with such an embarrassing result? How can I pretend to be one of
the top engineers in the world if I'm working at a company that makes
this kind of rookie mistake?
</p>

<p>
 Oh, and wouldn't an initiative such as the Sojourn project, the one
that was abandoned, have precisely prevented that fiasco, by making
sure that an appropriately diverse sample of subjects would be
submitted to the training set?
</p>

<p>
 And it is far from the only example. There are other fundamental,
elementary mistakes, some of which are much more related to my skill set and
that I am much more qualified to talk about in detail, but since I am
a systems engineer, these are not the things that get much publicity
and are widely available on the Web. I will still give the following
example:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2137r0.html#platforms">
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2137r0.html#platforms</a><br>
This proposal, for the next standard of C++, which is a general-purpose
programming language, lists hardware architectures, OS platforms,
and environments that should be prioritized. <br>
From a technical point of view, this is absolute nonsense. It is not
the place of a programming language to prioritize hardware architectures
or OS platforms. It is the job of a compiler for this language to
implement the specification for various platforms and the implementation
may be more or less optimized depending on the backend, but the language
itself should be entirely agnostic. <br>
And even if you accept the premise that it makes sense to define a list
of priorities, let's take a look: none of the various BSD operating
systems have made the list, despite having significant, vibrant
communities and a long history of working, but Fuchsia, Google's own,
not-ready-yet operating system, has. Hmmm. Also, there is a curious
insistence on prioritizing little-endian hardware, which would be
detrimental to a certain number of embedded systems and other platforms,
but it so happens that Google uses none of them.
</p>

<p>
 And it just so happens that out of the 17 authors of that document,
8 of them are working at Google.
</p>

<p>
 So even in my narrow, restricted field, what I witness of Google's
influence in the world is an attempt to infiltrate and subvert
communities and standards committees, in order to influence them
towards goals that directly benefit Google, and without any care or
consideration for the rest of the community, or for the actual technical
quality of the results.
</p>

<p>
 So, after this long development, let me sum this up by saying that I
would be extremely glad to be offered a position at Google, if it was
in the executive committee, if I had direct control over a product that
I could actually make <em>good</em>, as in, …</p></article></div>

Air flow is also key. However Siegel warns all of those things are not enough on their own to protect your family from COVID-19. You still need masks, hand-washing and physical distancing to keep the virus at bay.</p>  <p>A HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter is a key part of the equation, too. Viruses such as the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 often attach themselves to dust or droplets, and a good air purifier with a HEPA filter can help capture them.</p>  <p>All <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-hepa-filter-1"><u>HEPA filters</u></a> are supposed to remove at least 99.97 per cent of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and airborne particles. All of the models we tested use pleated HEPA filters.</p>  <p><em>Marketplace</em> purchased 15 devices in total — three of the same models for each of the five brands used in our tests. Using incense smoke in 24.0 m³ chamber, Siegel and his team <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/how-clean-is-the-air-in-your-home-1.5900697">tested each device to see how much air-cleaning power it delivers</a> — what's known as the Clean Air Delivery Rate&nbsp;(CADR).</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | Marketplace test reveals the most effective air purifier:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Why more expensive air purifiers aren't always the best" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1854941251682-metadata-" title="Why more expensive air purifiers aren't always the best"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/562/851/WEB_CleanAir.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>An $800 Dyson air purifier we tested doesn’t clean your air as well as some less-expensive products.

The benchmark allows consumers to compare the effectiveness of portable air purifiers. You'll find the CADR listed in either cubic feet per minute (cfm), or, in Canada, in cubic metres per hour (m3/hour).&nbsp;</p>  <p>Siegel recommends looking for a CADR rating for smoke of about 200-300 m3/hour (118-176 cfm) for cleaning small to medium-sized rooms.

"Not everyone needs an enormous CADR, has huge rooms or incredibly dirty air."</p>  <p>Several experts told <em>Marketplace</em> the CADR is the most important metric and an internationally recognized benchmark.</p>  <p>"CADR is what you want to know, period," said Francis (Bud) Offermann, an indoor air quality researcher who has helped develop test methods for the performance of portable air cleaners with the American Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>"An air cleaner with a very high-efficient filter and very little air-flow rate will have a low CADR and little air-cleaning ability; same for an air cleaner with a very high air-flow rate and a very low filter efficiency."&nbsp;</p>  <p>In terms of price and performance, the Honeywell True HEPA Whole Room Air Purifier with Allergen Remover HPA160 performed in the middle range of our pack, averaging a CADR of about 180 m3/hr. <em>Marketplace</em> found this product retailing for around $200.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Honeywell <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/how-clean-is-the-air-in-your-home-1.5900697">said its air purifiers are AHAM certified</a> and compliant with AHAM standards, and are independently validated through repeatable, peer-reviewed tests.</p>  <h2>Expert says some UVC light claims are 'rubbish'</h2>  <p>One of the key promises from GermGuardian is that its AC5350B 28" Air Purifier with HEPA, UVC &amp; Digital purifier is equipped with a UV-C light that can "kill germs." <em>Marketplace</em> paid around $200 for this model.</p>  <p>While some professional-grade UV lights can do that, the experts Marketplace interviewed said the small dose of UV light GermGuardian's purifier delivers is not doing much of anything.</p>  <p>James Malley, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of New Hampshire and an expert on UV light, said that while UV-C light has been used for over 100 years to disinfect and kill viruses, the product must be properly designed and operated, and must use strong, directed UV-C light.</p>  <p><strong><em>WATCH | Cleaning your indoor air on a budget:</em></strong></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="How to clean the air in your home without spending hundreds of dollars" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1859106371942-metadata-" title="How to clean the air in your home without spending hundreds of dollars"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/438/1023/Air_quality_16x9_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>An indoor air scientist explains what you can do to keep your home’s air clean without buying a purifier.<!-- --> <!-- -->4:00</span></span></span></p>  <p>Although there are some good UV-C products, Malley warned there are some companies making "rubbish" claims about the efficacy of their UV-C lights.&nbsp;</p>  <p>After analyzing the UV dose and the UV-C power of the GermGuardian, Malley said he feels confident that the UV dose would not be enough to significantly reduce airborne pathogens.</p>  <p>GermGuardian did not give a clear response to our questions about its UV light, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/how-clean-is-the-air-in-your-home-1.5900697">but said its purifier</a> "eliminates over 99 per cent of airborne germs in a two-hour time frame," and all their purifiers are independently tested and AHAM verified for CADR.</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/how-clean-is-the-air-in-your-home-1.5900697">Read the full statements from each company featured in our story here</a></li>  </ul>  <p>If you happen to already have any of these devices, Siegel said you don't need to toss them out.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>We’re announcing <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear-base"><code>linear-base</code></a>,
a standard library for <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base#learning-about--xlineartypes">Linear Haskell</a> programs.
Our release accompanies the release of <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/status/ghc-9.0.1">GHC
9.0</a> which supports <code>-XLinearTypes</code>. Linear base has been
written by Bhavik Mehta, a former Tweag intern, Arnaud Spiwack, and ourselves.</p>
<p>In the spirit of a standard library, <code>linear-base</code> is not a strict replica of
<code>base</code> with linearly-typed variants of all the facilities in <code>base</code>. Instead,
<code>linear-base</code> focuses on the abstractions one naturally <em>needs</em> and <em>desires</em>
when programming with linear types.</p>
<p>It does include some linear variants from <code>base</code>, but the library
ranges from mutable data structures with a pure API to a resource-safe I/O
monad, to linear-streams. It’s a “base” library, a helpful
prelude to programming using <code>-XLinearTypes</code>.</p>
<p>Of course this raises the question, what does a linear Haskell program look like?
And, how does <code>linear-base</code> provide what we <em>need</em> and what we <em>want</em> to write one?</p>
<h2>Envisioning Linear Haskell Programs</h2>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with <code>-XLinearTypes</code>, you can learn more by
browsing our
<a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/tree/master/examples">examples</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base#learning-about--xlineartypes">README</a>.
At a bare-bones level, linear types simply
provide some further properties that a function declared with a signature like <code>f :: A %1-&gt; B</code> must satisfy. Namely, to type-check the body of <code>f</code>,
the <code>A</code> must be consumed exactly once. We are then able to leverage this
type-checking power to write functions that would have been unsafe to write
before (e.g., a pure interface to mutable data structures) or provide
alternative APIs to existing ones that place an obligation on the programmer to
ensure they avoid certain errors (such as reading from a closed file handle).
For more information about how <code>-XLinearTypes</code> works see our <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/tags/linear-types/">earlier
posts</a>.</p>
<p>There are two main families of motivations for this additional type-checking discussed
in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09756">Linear Haskell paper</a>. First, we can write pure
APIs for mutable data structures such as arrays. As discussed in the paper,
this approach is sometimes more convenient to work with than using the
<code>ST</code> monad, and even makes <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/array-0.5.4.0/docs/Data-Array-Unsafe.html#v:unsafeFreeze"><code>unsafeFreeze</code></a> safe.</p>
<p>Second, <code>-XLinearTypes</code> enables us to type-check usage protocols.
An example discussed in the paper is the protocol of file handles, namely, that
file handles must be closed and then cannot be written to or read from<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Thus, a typical linear program would likely be one that</p>
<ul>
<li>is mostly pure, but has a piece of state to use throughout. Using
linear types avoids that an <code>ST</code> monad invades
the larger, pure, part of the program</li>
<li>is resource-heavy and requires a non-trivial amount of reasoning on the part
of the programmer to ensure resource protocols are upheld.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind, we can envision a standard library as one that has the
<strong>linear gadgets we <em>want</em></strong>, like pure-interfaced mutable data structures and
resource-safe APIs, and the <strong>utilities we <em>need</em></strong>, like a linear <code>($)</code>, to
write a typical linear program.</p>
<h2>What we want: linear abstractions or use-cases!</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>linear-base</code> comes equipped with a pure API for mutable <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Array/Mutable/Linear.hs">arrays</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Vector/Mutable/Linear.hs">vectors</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/HashMap/Linear.hs">hashmaps</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Set/Mutable/Linear.hs">sets</a>.
These enable us to write a mutable implementation of

<p>This code reads rather like an imperative
program, where <code>arr</code> is updated through <code>arr</code>, <code>arr1</code>, <code>arr2</code> and so on.
Compared to using the <code>ST</code> monad, we lose the ability to share the
effect of mutations, in exchange we gain a pure interface, which can
be less invasive.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>linear-base</code> has a resource-safe <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/System/IO/Resource.hs">File I/O API</a> that ensures that file
handles, for instance, are closed and then no longer used.</li>
<li><code>linear-base</code> includes a <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/tree/master/src/Streaming">linear variant</a> of the
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming">streaming</a> library, which is compatible with the
resource-safe I/O monad, to ensure that resources accessed in the
monadic layers of streams have their protocols obeyed and that the protocols
of streams themselves are enforced. If the effects in streams can be repeated
more than once, we could, say, repeat the effect of reading from a file handle
after that handle is closed. Hence, we use control monads inside linear streams
to ensure monadic effects are performed exactly once. This is based
on
<a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2018-06-21-linear-streams/">the work</a> of Edvard Hübinette, for the Haskell Summer
of Code of 2018.</li>
<li>In order to define such resource-safe protocols, <code>linear-base</code> provides
<a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Control/Monad/Linear.hs">control monads</a> and related monadic functions like <code>foldM</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What we need: linear utilities!</h2>
<p>Of course, <code>linear-base</code> includes various abstractions that many
linear programs will end up using, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Variants of <code>base</code> abstractions like a linear <code>Num</code>, linear <code>Functor</code>s (in <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-01-16-data-vs-control/">two
flavors</a>), a linear <code>Data.List</code> API, and linear versions of
standard <code>Prelude</code> functions like <code>($)</code>.</p>
<p>We need these because functions as simple as</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="hs"><pre><code>  <span>f</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
  <span>f</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>4</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>will only type-check if <code>(*)</code> and <code>(+)</code> have linear arrows. Similarly, using
standard abstractions from <code>base</code>, like functors, <code>($)</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>foldl</code>, will
not work inside many functions that have linear arguments.</p>
<p>As a special note, we use a linear <code>(&amp;)</code> for a workaround to the
current limitation that all case statements consume the scrutinee (the <code>x</code> in
<code>case x of</code>) unrestrictedly. See the <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.md">user guide</a> for more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mechanisms to interface linear and non-linear code: <code>linear-base</code> comes with
<code>Ur</code>, which stands for unrestricted and lets you manipulate a
non-linear value in a linear context.
Hence, a function <code>f :: Ur a %1-&gt; b</code> can use the <code>a</code>
unrestrictedly after pattern matching on <code>(Ur x)</code>. Alongside this,
<code>linear-base</code> comes with the <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Unrestricted/Linear.hs">classes</a> <code>Consumable</code>, <code>Dupable</code> and
<code>Movable</code> which allow non-linear use of linearly-bound values; one can
<code>consume</code>, duplicate (possibly with <code>dup2 :: a %1-&gt; (a,a)</code>) or, <code>move</code> a
linearly bound value.</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="hs"><pre><code>  <span>consume</span> <span>::</span> <span>Consumable</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>dup2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Dupable</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>
  <span>move</span> <span>::</span> <span>Movable</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>Ur</span> <span>a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These are used throughout <code>linear-base</code> itself and are likely to
show up in linearly types programs. For instance,
the linearly-typed streaming function <code>chain</code> has
the following type</p>
<div data-language="hs"><pre><code>  <span>chain</span> <span>::</span> <span>forall</span> <span>a</span> <span>m</span> <span>r</span> <span>y</span><span> . </span><span>(</span><span>Control.Monad</span> <span>m</span><span>,</span> <span>Consumable</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>m</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stream</span> <span>(</span><span>Of</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>m</span> <span>r</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stream</span> <span>(</span><span>Of</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>m</span> <span>r</span></code></pre></div>
<p>because the <code>y</code> must be discarded as the monadic effect is chained
after each <code>a</code> in the stream.</p>
<h2>Advanced abstractions &amp; sneak peeks</h2>
<p>Finally, <code>linear-base</code> has several features still in the works. Please note
that some of these features like non-GC memory allocation, destination arrays
and push-pull arrays are still very experimental and likely to change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Control/Optics/Linear/Internal.hs">optics</a> are optics re-designed to work in linear contexts.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Foreign/Marshal/Pure.hs">Non-GC memory allocation</a>. We can use linear types to enforce the protocols for
using memory outside of GHC’s garbage collector and on the system heap, i.e., that
we allocate before use, necessarily free and do not use after that. Hence, the GC has
less work to do and we as programmers have the control over some allocation which
could impact the performance of our program.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Array/Destination.hs">Destination arrays</a>. Destination arrays, provide a way to write code in
destination-passing-style. This lets us decide when we allocate space
for a write-only array that’s threaded throughout our program. If we instead
had just used a vector, we might not have had all the fusion we’d like and might
have had extra allocations which impact memory use and performance.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Array/Polarized.hs">Push-pull arrays</a>. We can use linear-types to represent
<a href="https://jyp.github.io/posts/controlled-fusion.html">polarized arrays</a>. This enables us to provide a <code>vector</code>-like
API but explicitly control when allocation occurs. With the existing
<code>vector</code> library, one is often relying on array fusion to avoid
unnecessary allocations, but it can be hard to predict when array
fusion occurs. Polarized arrays can be either
output-friendly (a push array) or input-friendly (a pull
array) and neither form allocates. Only when a regular array is needed does
one <em>explicitly</em> allocate. So, controlling allocation is done by
the programmer, not the compiler.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Community first</h2>
<p>Our goal with <code>linear-base</code> is to make it easy and fun for the community to
write Linear Haskell programs. The first release is available on
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear-base">Hackage</a> and comes with <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/tree/master/examples">examples</a> from
the repository, and, in addition to the haddock, a short <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.md">user
guide</a>. Please feel welcome to <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/issues">point out bugs or request
features</a>. To check out the latest update, see <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base">our GitHub

    <p>We are very pleased to announce the latest Peergos application: a private calendar. The calendar is fully end-to-end encrypted, and allows you to share individual events securely – both with friends on Peergos and externally via secret link. Events are standard iCal files, and can be imported or exported to other calendar apps. You can even share entire calendars! You can create multiple calendars, and events can be one-off or repeating. </p>
<p>Interestingly, as the calendar is written on top of Peergos, the app itself doesn't include any encryption or sharing code, because the underlying Peergos layer handles that.</p>

              <article><p>Welcome to the <a href="https://jmmv.dev/series.html#Rust%20review"><strong>Rust Review</strong></a>’s bonus post, which I had promised from <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2018/05/rust-review-introduction.html">the very beginning</a>. I’m here to cover the big elephant in the room: Rust vs. Go. Which one is better?</p>
<p>There is no good answer to this question because <em>this comparison is unfounded</em>. I think people tend to bundle the two languages together because they were released at about the same time and the release of Rust felt like a response to the release of Go. Moreover, both languages are supposed to focus on systems software. But they are vastly different, and even as they both target systems software, they target different kinds of such software.</p>
<p>Go can be thought of as “C done right” or “a replacement for Python”. Go excels at the development of network servers and automation tools. Rust focuses on correctness and safety and is somewhere between C++ and Haskell, and as I previously mentioned, can be thought of as “a pragmatic Haskell”. Despite Rust’s high-level abstractions, its promise of making them zero-cost also means that it should excel at writing any kind of systems project.</p>
<p>This personal review is based on my experience writing the exact same project, <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/sandboxfs/">sandboxfs</a>, in the two languages. The original implementation of this project was done in Go and I have an experimental rewrite (not yet checked in) in Rust. Both pass the same test suite. I did this rewrite to learn the language, but also because profiling the Go variant always identified the hotspots as living in the Go runtime. I wanted to see if a trivial rewrite in Rust would deliver better performance, and that seemed to be the case. Along the way, I’ve been surprised by how many potential concurrency bugs I encountered in the <em>original</em> Go code because Rust didn’t allow me to implement the same design in the rewrite.</p>
<p>Before we start, you may want to also read <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2016/03/golang-review.html">my review of Go from two years ago</a>. Done? Let’s go.</p>

<p>The first thing that stands out as different between Go and Rust is the way they manage memory.</p>
<p>Go transparently allocates objects on the stack or heap depending on their lifetime and uses garbage collection to manage the latter. Rust uses explicit stack and heap allocations and manages the latter via scopes (aka RAII in C++ parlance) and ownership/move semantics.</p>
<p>In this area, the typical trade-offs between garbage collection and explicit memory management apply. This means that Go suffers from garbage collection overhead while Rust doesn’t, but this is a non-issue for the vast majority of software. Think about the last time you had to write a performance-critical, latency-critical, CPU-bound application.</p>
<p>Effectively using Rust requires understanding how a computer’s memory works. Go is more forgiving in this area, but as I’ll cover in the next section, that’s not necessarily a good thing: knowing how memory works is something you really ought to master as a programmer.</p>
<p><strong>Winner:</strong> cannot call. Both Go and Rust provide mechanisms to make memory leaks unlikely and both have good ergonomics.</p>

<p>Go is a very simple language and in <em>that</em> lies its beauty. Go is extremely easy to pick up and to churn lots of code with after only a few hours of practice. But as we saw in the <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-learning-curve.html">learning curve post</a>, this is a fallacy: any code you write right after learning a language will be non-idiomatic. You need a lot more time to really write code worthy of the language’s best practices.</p>
<p>In the Rust case, there is no denying that it is a complex language. Maybe not as complex as C++, but it has a lot of things going on. Writing code in Rust, therefore, requires more effort. The payoff is that, once the code is written and compiles successfully, there are high chances that it will run just fine. The same cannot be said of Go, in which I’ve experienced plenty of runtime crashes.</p>
<p>You have to pick your battle: either you write Go code quickly and then spend extra time writing trivial tests and debugging runtime problems; or you spend that time writing robust Rust from the ground up and avoiding post-build problems.</p>
<p><strong>Winner:</strong> hard to call. It’s easy to say that Go wins, but I don’t want to say so because of what I mentioned. I personally prefer spending extra time crafting code that will stand the test of time instead of having to track down complex memory and threading issues down the road.</p>

<p>Go doesn’t support generic types. The Go authors are not inherently opposed to having them, but they claim that they cannot be cleanly implemented or supported—and that a perfect solution should be found before anything is implemented. As a result, people abuse <code>interface {}</code> to represent generic types and primitives like <code>append</code> are implemented using features that no other Go code can benefit from.</p>
<p>Rust just has generic types and they work as you expect. Generics work both for plain types as for traits, and in the case of traits, you get to control how the machine code Rust generates looks like via the <code>impl</code> and <code>dyn</code> duality (starting from Rust 2018).</p>
<p><strong>Winner:</strong> Rust. ‘nuff said.</p>

<p>The thing I dislike the most about Go is that, in its lack of features, it provides zero mechanisms to encode the characteristics of robust code in the code itself. Yes, automated code formatting and strong recommendations on how the code should be written are great, but these are insufficient to enforce logical properties of the code. I’ve found myself writing long comments explaining why some conditions are never possible, why a particular parameter works the way it does, or how variables and mutexes are related… and these are all symptoms of code that will break in the future: <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2013/06/readability-avoid-comments.html">comments cannot be sanity-checked by the compiler and I can guarantee you that they go stale</a>. Everything should be expressed in code if at all possible.</p>
<p>So what features do we find in Rust to make code more robust and future-proof that we don’t find in Go?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Assertions.</strong> These are invaluable in letting the programmer communicate their intent about state that may be not obvious. Rust has assertions. Go, on the other hand, doesn’t. Well… Go does have <code>panic</code> which can be used to simulate assertions, but this is strongly frowned upon so you should never do that.</p>
<p>Why does Go not have assertions? My blind guess: because programmers routinely misuse assertions to validate user input, which later causes runtime crashes on bad or malicious input. Therefore, in its pragmatism, Go requires reporting all problems as controlled errors to avoid this kind of mistake. (Hmm… this is something I’ve been meaning to cover as a separate post for a while…)</p>
<p>By the way, a note I’ve heard several times from others: you can judge the experience of a programmer by how many assertions their code has, where more means better. Do whatever you want with that thought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Annotations.</strong> Sometimes there are input parameters that go unused when they should be used, or return values that must be checked but aren’t. Other times, you know a particular function will never return and want to communicate this fact to the caller so that the compiler doesn’t complain about, for example, missing return statements. Go doesn’t have any of these, which makes it hard to express programmer intent. Rust does have such annotations.</p>
<p>What’s worse in the Go case is that some of these behaviors exist for specific internal functions such as <code>panic</code>, which the compiler understands cannot return, but it’s impossible to express this for any Go code you write. Quite unfair, considering that this same drawback applies to what I said about generics above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Docstrings.</strong> Yes, Go has docstrings, but they are incredibly rudimentary. They work just fine for the most part though, but having written a lot of Java, there is a ton of value in having docstrings with a predefined structure. This allows tools to verify the sanity of the documentation. For example, IntelliJ is able to validate that parameter names match the actual function parameters and that cross-references to other classes are valid.</p>
<p>Rust’s docstrings are better than Go’s in the sense that they support Markdown, but they are still a underspecified: there doesn’t seem to be a standard way of structuring them, and they don’t support documenting individual items. The tooling cannot cross-check that those docstrings are valid according to the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Error checking.</strong> I am one of the few (?) people that likes Go’s explicit error propagation. Yes, it’s annoying to write many error checks, but doing so forces you to think about errors in a way that many other languages do not.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the chosen idiom has a problem: a function always returns a value <em>and</em> an error, and it’s up to the caller to <em>first</em> check the error and <em>then</em> check the value. The language won’t enforce doing the right thing, and I’ve seen people make mistakes by unpacking the result of a function before checking for an error. Rust, on the other hand, comes with higher-level types to wrap values <em>or</em> errors. Combined with the lack of null, this means that the caller can never access a value when an error is present and viceversa. See the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/"><code>Result</code></a> type and what I wrote about <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-match-keyword.html">the <code>match</code> keyword</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To conclude this section, a positive note about both languages: <strong>none of them promote types automatically</strong>. For example, both Rust and Go force the programmer to cast integers across different sizes so that any possible overflows or underflows become apparent. Mind you: Go is a bit better than Rust in this area because Go’s type aliases are treated as semantically different by the compiler—requiring explicit casts between them—while Rust just treats them as syntactical aliases (like C’s <code>typedef</code>s).</p>
<p><strong>Winner:</strong> Rust hands down. You can claim that these are just complaints about Go’s lack of features and that I should just take Go the way it is… but no: these are complains about the inability to write future-proof, crystal-clear code in Go <em>because of</em> these missing features.</p>

<p>Go’s simplicity transpires everywhere, including the tooling required to improve a program once written. One specific aspect of this is …</p></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>If you’re a really great coder, do you need a resume at all? Relying on your reputation, your circle of friends, and your prodigious output seems like it’s enough. And at Leet Resumes, where we <a href="https://www.leetresumes.com/">write experienced engineers’ resumes for free</a>, it’s a frequently asked question.</p><p>In fact, the better you are, the more you want a great resume. There are five reasons why it makes sense. A well-written resume attracts better interest, increases your pay offers, plays well in our data-driven world, doesn’t leave hard-earned money on the table, and forces your current employer to pay you what you’re worth. Let’s walk through these reasons one by one.</p><p>The goal of a technical resume is to attract interview requests. And the goal of a great technical resume is to attract better interview requests from better companies that are more interesting to you. A great resume helps you attract better attention by making it more obvious what your contribution to your current and past teams has been. And it does this by detailing your key <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/how-to-write-bullet-points-for-a-technical-resume">accomplishments</a> and <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/how-do-i-find-numbers-to-put-on-my-technical-resume">numbers</a>.</p><p>A better resume helps to increase your pay offers. If you’ve ever sold a house or a car or a domain name, you know that the more buyers you have at an auction, the higher the final price of the item will be. Well, it’s the same idea when you’re selling the most valuable thing you own — your own time. Getting multiple companies interested in you at the same time creates a competitive bidding dynamic, so that when one hiring manager tells you she’ll pay you $x and a 34-inch monitor, the next hiring manager has to offer you $x + 10^4 dollars and a 49-inch curved monitor. Plus, it makes negotiating easier on you when all you’re doing is repeating what the other company said — it doesn’t take much skill or sales ability to get a better deal this way.</p><p>The world is getting much more data-driven. One of the better outcomes of the internet revolution has been the rise in importance of data, and the reduction of hand-wavey logic from the marketing department or upper management. With data so readily available, people won’t rely on someone’s title or past company name to decide if what they say is true — they want to see the data themselves. </p><p>But that same skepticism that applies to claims from others also applies to claims from you, including your resume. Simply copy-pasta-ing your job description isn’t good enough anymore. Hiring managers and companies want to <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume">know the details</a> of what you’ve done and why you think you’ve been successful. A great resume helps to tell your great story.</p><p>A great resume also helps to make sure you’re not leaving money on the table. Sure, it’s great when your friend from college asks you to join the startup he signed up for, or it’s flattering when an old boss slides into your DMs to recruit you for his new gig. But in a lot of these cases, your old boss or your old friend might want to pay you your old value — and not what you’re worth today. And that can mean missing out on cash, vacation time, and equity. Having a great resume means that you can make sure that old friends are paying the right money for your work at your new employer.</p><p>And finally, a great resume ensures that your current employer is paying you what you’re worth. One of the reasons we started Leet Resumes to write experienced engineers’ resumes for free, was this ridiculous practice of companies trying to short-change talented engineers on annual pay raises. It’s silly that companies such as <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/what-google-recruiters-look-for-in-a-technical-resume">Google</a> won’t increase pay, or offer higher equity packages, to loyal, dedicated employee engineers just for their excellent work. No, they’ll offer the minimum they can get away with. Unless you bring a job offer to them. Only then will they match it or beat it. So even for engineers who want to stay at their current job, having a great resume is important for getting paid what you’re worth.</p><p>At Leet Resumes, we’re resume experts who have seen the power of a great resume to help engineers tell their story and get better job offers and better pay as a result. We write <a href="https://www.leetresumes.com/">experienced engineers’ resumes for free</a>, (with additional paid services coming later this year.)

            <p>Learn how to get a self-hosted HTTPS tunnel secure with Let’s Encrypt in 5-10 minutes for development, testing or self-hosting.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In this tutorial I want to show you how quick and easy it can be to get a secure HTTPS tunnel up and running.</p>

<p><img src="https://letsencrypt.org/images/le-logo-wide.svg" alt="Let's Encrypt logo"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let’s Encrypt offers free TLS certificates for a duration of 90 days, which can be renewed when they expire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tunnels are traditionally used to give you incoming network access to a service running on a private network. For application developers, many platforms require you to accept inbound webhooks, and there are very few solutions to fix this that can be used on a corporate VPN. The SaaS-based tunnels are often blocked, and have very restrictive rate limits, so get in the way of you doing your job.</p>

<p>When using a self-hosted tunnel, things just tend to work, and you won’t be rate-limited on the number of connections you can establish, or what DNS provider you can use.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll show you how to use the new Let’s Encrypt integration which ships with inlets PRO 0.8.0.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You’ll create a small VM on public cloud with a public IP address</li>
  <li>You’ll run the inlets server on the VM and get a free TLS certificate from Let’s Encrypt</li>
  <li>Then you’ll run a HTTP server on your local network, and if you don’t have anything to hand, we provide a practical example</li>
  <li>You’ll then connect the client to the server and access your private service from a custom domain</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/71af284e891c19085a6fae4933b859c7f52d18d00f4a940d2802062c2028de8a/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f457469366a5a47584941416e6b77463f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6c61726765" alt="Conceptual architecture"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conceptual architecture: public users will be able to access a HTTP server on our local and private network over an encrypted websocket.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="start-with-the-exit-server">Start with the exit-server</h3>

<p>Since we are not relying on a third-party to host a container or VM for us with a public IP, we will create our own. It needn’t be expensive, you can generally pick the lowest price available, and sometimes even use the free-tier of your cloud provider.</p>

<p>Provision a virtual machine and enable SSH access.</p>

<p>You will need the following ports open if you’re using security groups:</p>
<ul>
  <li>8123 - for the websocket that runs the inlets control-plane</li>
  <li>80 - to serve Let’s Encrypt HTTP01 challenges</li>
  <li>443 - to serve your website or local application to users</li>
</ul>

<p>Note down the IP address of your exit-server and create a DNS A record in your DNS management tool</p>

<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2021-letsencrypt/adns.png" alt="DNS record"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Above: Creating the alexellis.inlets.dev subdomain in <a href="https://domains.google.com/">Google Domains</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now download inlets 0.8.0 onto the server using <code>wget</code> or <code>curl</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/releases">releases page</a>.</p>

<p>Your command will be slightly different to mine, but here’s an example you can adapt:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Get an auth token for the inlets tunnel</span>
<span>export </span><span>TOKEN</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>head</span> <span>-c</span> 16 /dev/urandom | shasum | <span>cut</span> <span>-d</span><span>" "</span> <span>-f1</span><span>)</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>$TOKEN</span> <span>&gt;</span> token.txt

<span># Populate from previous step</span>
<span>export </span><span>SERVER_IP</span><span>=</span><span>""</span>
<span>export </span><span>DOMAIN</span><span>=</span><span>"alexellis.inlets.dev"</span>

inlets-pro http server <span>\</span>
  <span>--letsencrypt-domain</span> <span>$DOMAIN</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--letsencrypt-email</span> webmaster@<span>$DOMAIN</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--letsencrypt-issuer</span> prod <span>\</span>
  <span>--token</span> <span>$TOKEN</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--auto-tls</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--auto-tls-san</span> <span>$SERVER_IP</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what each flag does:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>--letsencrypt-domain</code> - gets a TLS cert for each domain given, you can provide this flag multiple times</li>
  <li><code>--letsencrypt-email</code> - required for renewal notifications and for accepting the Let’s Encrypt Terms of Service</li>
  <li><code>--letsencrypt-issuer</code> - use the value <code>prod</code> or <code>staging</code> to switch between the two options</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>--token</code> is used by the inlets client to authenticate to the server.</p>

<p>Then the <code>--auto-tls</code> flags enable TLS for the control-plane of inlets running on port <code>8123</code>. This ensures that the tunnel will be able to connect, even if there is an issue with Let’s Encrypt such as rate-limiting.</p>

<p>You can keep the inlets server process running by generating a systemd unit file. Just run the same command as before, but add <code>--generate=systemd</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>inlets-pro http server <span>\</span>
  <span>--generate</span><span>=</span>systemd <span>\</span>
  <span>--letsencrypt-domain</span> <span>$DOMAIN</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--letsencrypt-email</span> webmaster@<span>$DOMAIN</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--letsencrypt-issuer</span> prod <span>\</span>
  <span>--token</span> <span>$TOKEN</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--auto-tls</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--auto-tls-san</span> <span>$SERVER_IP</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>&gt;</span> inlets-pro.service
<span>sudo cp </span>inlets-pro.service /etc/systemd/system

<span>sudo </span>systemctl <span>enable </span>inlets-pro
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then check it started as expected with <code>sudo journalctl -u inlets-pro</code> or <code>sudo systemctl status inlets-pro</code>. The process will now restart upon reboot, or if for some reason the process crashes.</p>

<h3 id="run-a-local-http-server">Run a local HTTP server</h3>

<p>I’m going to run a HTTP server using Node.js on port 8080. I want to share it with my friends, but I also want to get some webhooks from a third-party like GitHub and this tunnel will help me with building the functionality and testing it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/alexellis/expressjs-k8s
<span>cd </span>expressjs-k8s
npm <span>install

</span>npm start

Express.js listening on port: 8080
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you don’t want to install Node.js on your computer, you can also use <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/expressjs-k8s">the README</a> to run the process using Docker.</p>

<p>If you don’t know what to expose, try inlets’ own HTTP fileserver extension, set it up: <a href="https://inlets.dev/blog/2021/02/09/simple-filesharing.html">here</a></p>

<p>This local HTTP server will be called the “upstream”, it’s where the inlets-client will direct traffic. It doesn’t have to be on the same computer as the client, it could be running on your Raspberry Pi, or your NAS for instance.</p>

<p>If running on your own computer, the upstream may be: <code>http://127.0.0.1:8080</code>, and when running on a NAS, the upstream may be: <code>http://192.168.0.101:8080</code> for instance.</p>

<h3 id="start-the-client">Start the client</h3>

<p>For Linux:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-SLsf</span> https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/releases/download/0.8.1/inlets-pro <span>&gt;</span> inlets-pro
<span>chmod</span> +x ./inlets-pro
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For Raspberry Pi, add the suffix <code>-armhf</code> to the download URL.</p>

<p>For MacOS:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-SLsf</span> https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/releases/download/0.8.1/inlets-pro-darwin <span>&gt;</span> inlets-pro
<span>chmod</span> +x ./inlets-pro
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For Windows, see the <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/releases">Releases page</a>.</p>

<p>Now connect your inlets client to the inlets server:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Populate from server</span>
<span>export </span><span>SERVER_IP</span><span>=</span><span>""</span>
<span>export </span><span>TOKEN</span><span>=</span><span>""</span>

<span># Populate from previous step</span>
<span>export </span><span>UPSTREAM</span><span>=</span><span>"http://127.0.0.1:8080"</span>

<span># Save your inlets-pro license to ~/LICENSE.txt </span>

inlets-pro http client <span>\</span>
  <span>--url</span> wss://<span>$SERVER_IP</span>:8123 <span>\</span>
  <span>--token</span> <span>$TOKEN</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--license-file</span> <span>$HOME</span>/LICENSE.txt  <span>\</span>
  <span>--upstream</span> <span>$UPSTREAM</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The four things you need to do are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set the <code>SERVER_IP</code></li>
  <li>Set the <code>TOKEN</code></li>
  <li>Set the <code>UPSTREAM</code> i.e.”http://127.0.0.1:8080”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="test-out-your-tunnel">Test out your tunnel</h3>

<p>Within a few moments you’ll have a tunnel established, and the inlets server will provision a certificate for your domain using Let’s Encrypt.</p>

<p>Visit your domain such as https://alexellis.inlets.dev/</p>

<p><img src="https://docs.inlets.dev/images/operator-pro-webpage.png" alt="Working tunnel"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here an Express.js tunnel that I set up a few weeks prior to this tutorial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was <a href="https://twitter.com/alexellisuk/status/1358367796455948288?s=20">a small challenge I ran on Twitter</a>, where eight different community users set up their own HTTPS tunnels using these instructions.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/techknowlogick/status/1358482311369666561/">Matti Ranta</a> from the Gitea project prepares for his live stream on OpenFaaS, by getting webhooks from Gitea to his functions</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/slavadotcom/status/1358493286185529350?s=20">slava exposed Minio</a>, so that he could get secure access to self-hosted S3</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtpWcWfWgAEA13o?format=png&amp;name=large" alt="minio"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://min.io/">minio - self-hosted S3</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS on Kubernetes for self-hosted functions</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-next">What next?</h3>

<p>Now that you have a tunnel server, you can keep it running at a very minimal cost and reconnect to it whenever you need.</p>

<p>You can connect several inlets clients to your exit-server, either for redundancy (connections will be load-balanced), or for separate sites.</p>

<p>If you’re an OpenFaaS user, then you may setup two separate subdomains for Grafana and the OpenFaaS UI.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>grafana.example.com</code> - upstream <code>http://127.0.0.1:3000</code></li>
  <li><code>faas.example.com</code> - upstream <code>http://127.0.0.1:8080</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Then it’s up to you whether you want to connect one client or two.</p>

<p>inlets also supports tunnelling TCP traffic and can be used with Kubernetes as a LoadBalancer through the <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/#/tools/inlets-operator?id=inlets-operator-reference-documentation">inlets-operator project</a>.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>We’ve now set up a self-hosted tunnel server and can use it whenever we like. inlets also supports TCP tunnels for services like RDP, VNC, SSH and databases. I’ve included a few more blog posts to help you understand use-cases.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What did you expose? Tweet to <a href="https://twitter.com/inletsdev">@inletsdev</a> and we’ll give the first 5 people 10% off a personal license.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you know that the personal license can now be used at work? inlets PRO has two options for licensing - either a personal license or a commercial license. You can learn more or take out a free trial on <a href="https://inlets.dev/">the homepage</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-w-id="a81ba003-9805-a73c-c604-68b50f014274"><h2>Background</h2><div><p>Ever since our <a href="https://twitter.com/aaroisosaari/status/1314160985679319040" target="_blank">first launch</a> in October, we've collected email signups on our landing page from people excited about our product. A potential user would join our waitlist by submitting their email address and we would follow-up with a confirmation.</p><p>Throughout the fall, we iterated our confirmation email numerous times, trying to encourage the recipients to share about us on social media. We tested different wordings and provided share links for social media, which got us a decent amount of <a href="https://www.flowrite.com/love" target="_blank">word-of-mouth</a>. In the end, what was missing was a real incentive to spread the word.</p><p>In January, we started looking into off-the-shelf referral marketing solutions like <a href="https://viral-loops.com/" target="_blank">Viral Loops</a>, <a href="https://kickofflabs.com/" target="_blank">KickoffLabs</a>, and <a href="https://www.prefinery.com/" target="_blank">Prefinery</a>, but none of them really gave us the flexibility that we were looking for. We wanted to own the entire process – signup, onboarding, referrals, emails, and rewards.</p><p><strong>So, we started building our own referral system using no-code tools.</strong> Just days later, we launched a new version of the signup process consisting of a beautifully integrated onboarding survey and a referral program – giving people the possibility to earn rewards by inviting their friends to join the waitlist.</p><p>The new system caused an immense spike in our signups – over 8x increase on W4/2021 compared to the average of the preceding 6 weeks.<strong>‍</strong></p></div><p>‍</p><blockquote><strong>This is a practical step-by-step instruction on how to implement the same referral program in your business 🎯</strong></blockquote><p>‍</p><h3>What does Flowrite's referral program include?</h3><ul role="list"><li>Email signup on <a href="http://flowrite.com/" target="_blank">flowrite.com</a></li><li>Unique referral link assigned to every user</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/flowritecom/status/1356546139768705024" target="_blank">Rewards</a> for # of people referred</li><li>Integrated Typeform survey to collect further information about each user</li><li>Possibility for the user to refer a friend during the survey</li><li>Internal spreadsheet to track signups and referrals</li><li>Public <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RPpQzwwsoAOET4MV3sy46CKw-93OPbZ6k4dtvnTrDAc/" target="_blank">leaderboard</a> for users to track how many referrals they have<br>‍</li></ul><h3>What's required to build a similar program?</h3><ul role="list"><li>Website that you can customize with your own HTML &amp; JavaScript (i.e. a Webflow site or just a pure HTML website)</li><li>Typeform survey (optional)</li><li>Google Sheets or Airtable</li><li>Gmail or something else that sends emails</li><li>Automation platform (e.g. Zapier or Integromat) to glue things together</li></ul><p>Also, having some level of understanding of JavaScript may become handy but is not essential 🙌<br>‍</p><blockquote>Before getting into it, I'd recommend going through our signup process yourself to understand how the entire thing works from a user perspective. Just hit the button in the navbar, enter your email, go through our Typeform survey and check your email for a confirmation.</blockquote><p>‍</p><h2>1. Creating a referral code</h2><div><p>Each person that signs up to our waitlist is assigned a random 6-character code consisting of numbers and letters. At the end of the signup process, we use this code to create referral links that a user can share on social media.</p><p>To create a referral code, insert the snippet below at the end of your &lt;body&gt; tag (or before &lt;/body&gt; tag) on each page where a user can sign up. If you're using Webflow, you can also insert it globally to every page from your site settings.</p></div><p><code>
const referralCode = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 8)
</code></p><p><br>Secondly, create another variable called referralUrl – composed of the URL of your homepage and the code we just generated. Insert it below the referralCode variable.</p><p><code>
const referralUrl = 'https://www.flowrite.com/?ref=' + referralCode
</code></p><p>‍</p><h2>2. Storing the user's URL</h2><p>You also want to store the user's current URL in a variable. It's essential to know from which URL every signup is coming in order to count the # of referrals by each user.</p><p><code>const siteUrl = window.location.href</code></p><p>‍</p><p>Your code should now look like this:</p><p>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/aaroi/10cc7ce4d328455cb489ecc05b55dd79.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><h2>3. The signup form</h2><h4><br>Creating hidden input fields</h4><p>In addition to an email input field, your signup form should also contain two hidden inputs to which we'll soon assign the referralUrl and siteUrl values from the previous steps.</p><p>To add the input fields, insert the following code inside your form element – right next to the email field.</p><p>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/aaroi/ec2198220ac33ad3d49f452b85c18a63.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/6024e0e6f804dc56ad43db9a_Frame%20444%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>If you're using Webflow, you can do this with a hidden HTML Embed element.</em></figcaption></figure><h4><br><strong>Populating the input fields</strong></h4><p>The inputs are still empty, though. You need to assign the variables from steps 1 and 2 into your inputs so that they get included in the submission. <br></p><p>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/aaroi/fa2813935c7e24996c5cb3b02c03bd6f.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><blockquote>If you're using e.g. Webflow's symbols and have multiple instances of the same signup form on a single page of your website, you need to make sure that variables get assigned to the correct inputs. Check our <a href="https://www.notion.so/flowrite/Flowrite-s-referral-program-Multiple-instances-of-the-same-signup-form-2a766628526145bcbbcc627d48934ea3" target="_blank">Notion memo</a> for instructions on this.</blockquote><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60244bc59fcacdc13e6fe788_Screenshot%202021-02-05%20at%2017.00.21.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h4><strong>Testing it out</strong>‍</h4><p>Now, when a user signs up on the website, both the referral URL and the site's URL should be hiddenly included in the submission. If you're using Webflow, you can verify this from the confirmation email.<br>‍</p><h2>4. Customizing your Typeform survey</h2><div><p>As part of the signup &amp; referral system, we are using Typeform to learn more about each user. Completing the Typeform survey is not required to join the waitlist because we collect the email addresses already during the initial signup. The percentage of users who proceed to complete the survey is currently roughly 75%.</p><p>In practice, we want to deliver the referralCode (step 1) and the user's email into Typeform and "carry" them throughout the submission. We do this in order to:</p></div><ol role="list"><li>Use the referralCode in share links on your confirmation page (step 7)</li><li>Match the initial waitlist signups with the corresponding Typeform answers. By bringing the email from the signup form to Typeform, we don't need to ask the user to submit it twice.<br>‍</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/602488dea0b3569783c128d5_Screenshot%202021-02-05%20at%2018.44.21.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h4>Hidden fields</h4><p>To make this happen, you need to use Typeform's <a href="https://help.typeform.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052676612-How-to-use-Hidden-Fields" target="_blank">Hidden Fields</a> feature. You can find the settings under Logic → Advanced.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/602489dacabb602c169b737e_Screenshot%202021-02-05%20at%2018.44.52.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>You need to set two Hidden Fields: @email and @code. Once that's done, you are able to insert those values at the end of your Typeform link and have them submitted along with the other answers of your Typeform:</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/602481634e7e9eecea2478dc_Screenshot%202021-02-11%20at%202.57.32.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h2>5. Integrating the Typeform to your site</h2><p>Typeform gives you several alternatives on how to embed a survey on your page. If you don't want to use an embed, you can just redirect your users to the Typeform.com link.</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60244c54f12cba5034627101_Screenshot%202021-02-05%20at%2019.19.32.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>We use the "Popup" alternative with Popup size set as "Large"</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/602486ba156aa267ba51f36d_Screenshot%202021-02-08%20at%2011.38.40%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you choose to go with any of the embeds, you need to grab Typeform's embed code and place it in your page's HTML.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60244c83342317cd8c00a453_Screenshot%202021-02-09%20at%2010.47.43.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>With a popup, it doesn't really matter where you place the Typeform code. We have ours on top of the page hierarchy.</p><p><br>The popup also includes an &lt;a&gt; element, which is essentially a "Launch me" button. Its function is to open the survey popup when clicked. However, since you want the popup to automatically open when a user submits the signup form, you need a piece of code that does that for you.</p><p>You also want that code to take the email that was submitted (from an input element with id set to "email"), assign it to a variable, and insert it at the end of your Typeform link together with the referralCode. These will be the Hidden Fields we set up earlier 😉</p><p>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/aaroi/b7cad587e42ada765e36a497f16b022a.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60244d2760e83d025adfcade_Screenshot%202021-02-09%20at%2010.47.09.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Lastly, set the visibility of the &lt;a&gt; element to "none" in order to hide the "Launch me" button. </p><p>If you're using Webflow, you can just hide the entire HTML Embed.<br>‍<br>‍</p><h2>6. Typeform redirect</h2><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60248571e3eb83af74193693_Screenshot%202021-02-09%20at%2010.51.47.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Typeform allows you to redirect users to custom URLs after completing the survey. The URLs can be customized with both the survey data as well as Hidden Fields.</p><div><p>Our redirect links contain both the referral code (a Hidden Field) and the user's first name from the survey.</p><p>For example, if the "code" was set to <strong>123456</strong> and the first name of the user was <strong>Aaro</strong>, the redirect URL would be:</p></div><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/6024811b2c9ab334616d67b3_Screenshot%202021-02-11%20at%202.57.13.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h2>7. Confirmation page</h2><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60244e1197258f49e8082af6_Screenshot%202021-02-10%20at%2014.26.40.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>On our <a href="https://www.flowrite.com/thanks#code=123456&amp;firstname=Aaro">confirmation page</a>, we wanted to give users simple options to share their personal referral link and inform them about the rewards they can earn.<br></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h4>Incentivization</h4><p>Our way of incentivizing the users is to offer Flowrite-branded merch and free access to the product. With merch, we'd recommend choosing items that you can fit in a letter. We recently realized that shipping packages across the world can get a little expensive.. 🤭<br>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60244e5060e83d1384dfcf51_Frame%20401%20(2).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><blockquote>If you want to dig deeper on how to choose rewards and incentives for referral programs check out Referral Rock's <a href="https://referralrock.com/blog/referral-rewards-incentives/#getting-started" target="_blank">guide</a> on the topic.</blockquote><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Customizing the confirmation page</strong></h4><p>Having that custom redirect URL from Typeform allows you to customize your confirmation page for every user. For example, Flowrite's confirmation page uses the "firstname" value of the URL to make the page just slightly more personal:</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60244ed6d8d979c9f8b395ff_Screenshot%202021-02-09%20at%2011.11.02.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p><br>To do the same, start by wrapping the part of the paragraph you want to customize in a span. Then, set the id of the span to "firstname".</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60246b9483283e1b30c25233_Frame%20445%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p><br>Lastly, insert the following snippet at the end of the &lt;body&gt; tag of your confirmation page.</p><p>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/aaroi/887807c921e840cd5d013d8a31ac8781.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><p>In addition to the first name, you can also use the "code" value of the URL to customize share links for social media. To create a Twitter link, first set the id of your Twitter share button to "tweet".<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60246a3759ded60523e1414c_Frame%20446.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p><br>Then, insert the following code at the end of the &lt;body&gt; tag of your confirmation page.</p><p>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/aaroi/186a7848e4d2c8a9acc559d868078c65.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><blockquote>Use your creativity to customize the texts and links on your confirmation page any way you like. You can also benchmark <a href="https://www.flowrite.com/thanks#code=123456&amp;firstname=Aaro" target="_blank">ours</a>.</blockquote><p>‍</p><h2>8. Confirmation email</h2><p>After the initial signup on our website, we send a confirmation email to the email address that was submitted. Naturally, we want to use the referralUrl from step 3 in every sharing link of that email.</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60244f585af6a65df0af16e3_Screenshot%202021-02-09%20at%2011.49.19.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><div><p>Regardless of whether you're using Zapier or Integromat to automate the confirmation email, you want to use the signup form submission as a trigger and connect it to your email account to send the confirmation email based on the submitted data – email address and referralURL from step 3.</p><p>We decided to use Gmail since it allowed us to send emails that look and feel the most personal. However, Gmail's daily sending …</p></div></div></div>

          This tool aim to humbly participate in stopping the race for ever more
          quality and bandwidth (8K resolution, 5G network, etc.) by offering a
          simple way to radically reduce the size of a video.
        </p>
        <p>
          The digital world’s contribution to the footprint of humanity is
          currently around 4% (see
          <a href="https://www.greenit.fr/environmental-footprint-of-the-digital-world/" target="_blank">this report from GreenIT.fr</a>
          and
          <a href="https://theshiftproject.org/en/article/lean-ict-our-new-report/" target="_blank">this another report from The Shift Project</a>). This is more than
          <a href="https://theshiftproject.org/en/article/lean-ict-our-new-report/" target="_blank">the aviation</a>, and it is predicted to grow in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Online video does <b>NOT</b> represent the main impact of the digital
          world, <b>manufacturing is a much bigger deal</b>. But reducing the
          size of a video can help <b>keeping our old devices</b> that have
          limited bandwidth and limited computing power, instead of buying new
          ones.

          <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        </header>
        <h3>
          Apply settings from The Shift Project (720p, CRF 28, 160 kbits/s)
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Shift Project has published a guide for reducing the size of a
          video while maintaining a good quality
        </p>
        <p>
          You can download it
          <a href="https://theshiftproject.org/en/guide-reduce-weight-video-5-minutes/" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, it reduces the video resolution to 720p and the audio
          bitrate to 160 kbits/s. The Constant Rate Factor (CRF) is set to 22.
        </p>
        <h3>Lower video resolution (480p)</h3>
        <p>
          It reduces the video resolution to 480p. Don't watch it on your 4K TV,
          otherwise it is OK.
        </p>
        <h3>Lower video quality (CRF 28)</h3>
        <p>
          It reduces the Constant Rate Factor (CRF) to 28. You won't see tiny
          details but the essential is there.
        </p>
        <h3>Lower audio bitrate (56 kbits/s)</h3>
        <p>
          It reduces the audio bitrate to 160 kbits/s. If the audio is mainly
          speeches, it should remain audible.
        </p>
        <h3>One image every 5 seconds (!)</h3>
        <p>
          For some videos, like conferences, there is not much action and you
          can easily understand what happens even with one image every 5 seconds
        </p>
        <h3>Black and white</h3>

          <h2>How it works?</h2>
          <p>Let's get into the technical details</p>
        </header>
        <p>
          This tool uses
          <a href="https://ffmpegwasm.github.io/" target="_blank">FFMPEG.WASM</a>
          to edit the video directly in the browser!
        </p>
        <p>
          You can dowload
          <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank">FFMPEG</a>
          to try these settings directly on your computer
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Apply settings from The Shift Project (720p, CRF 28, 160
            kbits/s)</b>
        </p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -s hd720 -c:v libx264 -crf 22 -vf "scale=iw*sar:ih,setsar=1" -c:a aac -b:a 160k output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p><b>Lower video resolution (480p)</b></p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -s hd480 -c:v libx264 -crf 22 -vf "scale=iw*sar:ih,setsar=1" output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p><b>Lower video quality (CRF 28)</b></p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 28 -vf "scale=iw*sar:ih,setsar=1" output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p><b>Lower audio bitrate (56 kbits/s)</b></p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:a aac -b:a 56k output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p><b>One image every 5 seconds</b></p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "fps=fps=1/5" output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p><b>Black and white</b></p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "hue=s=0" output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p>
          This whole approach is inspired by image dithering (see
          <a href="https://ditherit.com/" target="_blank">here</a> for an
          example), which removes a lot of data in the image while preserving
          its essential meaning

February 11, 2021 | https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2021/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2021/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As you may have heard, JCenter is shutting down in May 2021.</p><blockquote><p>Into the Sunset on May 1st: Bintray, JCenter, GoCenter, and ChartCenter<br><a href="https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/">https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/</a></p></blockquote><p>So, if you are using JCenter as the repository for your libraries (as me), it’s time to migrate.</p><p>In this article, I will not go through the publishing process of a library to MavenCentral, because there are already plenty of resources available. For example, I followed the one written by Márton Braun.</p><blockquote><p>Publishing Android libraries to MavenCentral in 2021
<a href="https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/">https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/</a></p></blockquote><p>Instead, the topic of this article is to show how to manually migrate the old artifacts of a library without recompiling them.</p><p>It’s important to migrate also the old artifacts because not all the users of your library are using the latest version. But if the library is old, it’s difficult to recompile it from scratch. For example, I’ve tried to manually rebuild the first version of <a href="https://github.com/prof18/YoutubeParser">YoutubeParser</a>, but I quickly failed because it was using a version of the Android Gradle Plugin of 5 years ago that is now incompatible with Android Studio 4.</p><h2>Download old artifacts from Bintray</h2><p>The first thing to do is downloading the old library’s artifacts from Bintray. It is possible to download them, directly from the Bintray directory page:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://bintray.com/package/files/%7Byour-bintray-username%7D/maven/%7Byour-library-name%7D">https://bintray.com/package/files/{your-bintray-username}/maven/{your-library-name}</a></p></blockquote><p>For example, this is the URL for my other library, <a href="https://github.com/prof18/RSS-Parser">RSS-Parser</a>: <a href="https://bintray.com/package/files/prof18/maven/RSS-Parser">https://bintray.com/package/files/prof18/maven/RSS-Parser</a></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/bintray-dir.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/bintray-dir.png"></a></figure><p>Here, it is possible to download the artifacts by simply clicking on them.</p><h2>Sign artifacts</h2><p>The next step is signing the artifacts, with a GPG key (to generate one, you can follow the instruction on <a href="https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/">Márton‘s article</a>). The command to perform the signing is the following:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="bash"> gpg -ab rssparser-1.0.pom
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/sign-terminal.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/sign-terminal.png"></a></figure><p>Remember that all the files uploaded to MavenCentral must be signed. In my case, I have to sign the <em>.aar</em> file, the <em>.pom</em> and the <em>jar</em> that contains the sources and the <em>JavaDoc</em> of the library.</p><p>The signing command produces a <em>.asc</em> file, that must be uploaded as well on MavenCentral.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/signed-files.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/signed-files.png"></a></figure><h2>Manual upload artifacts</h2><p>Now, it’s time to upload the artifacts. Login on <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/">Sonatype</a> and from the menu on the left, select <em>Staging Upload</em></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/manual-upload.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/manual-upload.png"></a></figure><p>First of all, in the <em>Staging Upload</em> section, it is necessary to upload the <em>pom</em> file.</p><p>Switch the upload mode to <em>Artifact(s) with a pom</em> in the dropdown window and then select to <em>pom</em> to upload.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-pom.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-pom.png"></a></figure><p>Then, in the section below, it is possible to upload the other artifacts. To do that, it is necessary to select them from the file system with the <em>Select Artifact(s) to Upload…</em> button and then add them to the list with the <em>Add Artifact</em> button.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/artifacts-to-upload.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/artifacts-to-upload.png"></a></figure><p>Don’t forget to upload also the signatures (the <em>.asc</em> files)!</p><p>After adding all the artifacts, upload them with the <em>Upload Artifact(s)</em> button. It is also necessary to provide a brief description, for example <code>1.1 manual upload</code></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-artifacts.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-artifacts.png"></a></figure><p>It could happen the the upload is stuck and the progress bar never goes away. If it happens, reload the page and redo the process (I’ve noticed that it can happen when the browser tab is open for a while).</p><p>After the upload is successful, select <em>Staging Repositories</em> from the left menu.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/staging-repo.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/staging-repo.png"></a></figure><p>Now, the process is the same as when the artifacts are upload from Android Studio (or from the CI). The only exception is that the close task is started automatically (if it not starts, you can start it manually from the top bar).</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/wait-close.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/wait-close.png"></a></figure><p>The close task takes a few moments to perform, and after that, it’s time to release the library with the button in the toolbar.</p><p>And that’s it! After the processing time (usually between 10 to 15 minutes) your library will be available to <a href="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/">MavenCentral</a>.</p><p>If you have any suggestion or any kind of doubt, feel free to reach me out on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoGomier">@marcoGomier</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>I promised I’ll post stuff about low level hardware issues, and here is my second post on the subject, the first part in a series about the Intel graphics stack.</p>

<p>This post series will be a summary of about a decade of unpublished research I am trying to organize and share.
Not all of it is current, as newer hardware is harder to inspect and reverse, but I think much of the research is relevant.</p>

<p>The first post below is a quick introduction to the different components on the hardware and software side we’ll need to dive into security issues in the next post.</p>


<ul>
  <li>Processor graphics - The graphics unit that is part of the processor itself. Has had many codenames over the years, HD Graphics, UHD Graphics, Iris, Gen9, Gen11, Intel Xe and so on. Even the ‘Gen’ name has double meaning - both generation and ‘Graphics ENgine’. In UEFI code it is sometimes referet to at the IGD - Integrated Graphics Device.</li>
  <li>
    <p>The GuC - an embedded i486 core that supports graphics sechduling, power managment and firmware attestation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>UEFI and OS Drivers</li>
</ul>


<p>As discussed in the introduction to the SecureBoot post, the Intel CPU has four major component groups - the CPU cores, the L3 (or LLC) cache slices, the ‘Uncore’ or ‘System Agent’ parts, all connected through a ring bus inside the die.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gen9.png" alt="Gen9 Architecture"></p>

<p>The graphics process is made up from several <em>slices</em> and an <em>unslice</em> (like <em>uncore</em>) area that includes common components.
Each slice is divided into subblices and a slice common area. The subslices are made up of several Execution Units (EUs), and Texture unit and a L1 Cache/Memory. The common area includes the L3 cache and the dataport.
The limit to the number of slices is the interconnect between them and the unslice. 
There is always only a single <em>unslice</em>. In the unslice we can find the connection to the ring bus, aptly named the GT interface (GTI), the <em>Command Streamer</em> is reads commands from the system memory and into the graphics processor, the <em>fixed function pipline</em> (FF pipeline), and the thread dispatcher \&amp; spawner that lunch shader programs and GPGPU (General Purpose Comuting) programs onto the EUs. The FF pipeline deals with fixed functions such as vertice operations (called the Geometry Pipe), and other dedicated hardware such as video transcoding.</p>

<p>Different SKUs have different combinations of these. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Skylake GT2: 1 slice of 3 subslices of 8 EUs (1x3x8)</li>
  <li>Skylake GT3: 2x3x8</li>
  <li>Skylake GT4: 3x3x8</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gen9slice.png" alt="Gen9 Architecture"></p>

<p>The graphics engine is also connect streight to the the IOSF (Intel On Chip Fabric internal bus, see the <a href="https://igor-blue.github.io/2021/02/04/secure-boot.html">secureboot post</a> bus, through a controller called Gunit.  Gunit is connect to both the primary and secondary IOSF and exports functions for communicating with the graphics engine and implementing IOMMU support for graphics memory and unified memory.</p>

<p>All of this is connected to the the display IO interconnect and output to DisplayPort and HDMI outputs.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gunit.png" alt="Gen9 Architecture"></p>

<h2 id="2d-graphics-pipeline">2D Graphics Pipeline</h2>
<p>The 2D graphics gengine is a standonle IP block in the <em>unslice</em> area, and has its own command streamer, registers and cache. It has 256 different operation codes, for example:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/2dops.png" alt="2D BitBlt Operations"></p>

<h2 id="3d-graphics-pipeline">3D Graphics Pipeline</h2>
<p>The fixed function pipeline in the <em>unslice</em> implements the DirectX 11 redndering pipeline stages: 
Vertex Fetch -&gt; Vertex Shader -&gt; Hull Shader -&gt; Tessellator -&gt; Domain Shader -&gt; Geometry Shader -&gt; Clipper -&gt; Windower -&gt; Z Ordering, -&gt; Pixel Shader - &gt;Pixel Output. Some of these functions are self contained, but many are implemented using by running shader programs on the EUs in the slices. EUs can send certain operations back into dedicated hardware units.</p>

<h2 id="the-execution-units-eus">The Execution Units (EUs)</h2>
<p>The EUs are in-order mulithreaded SIMD processing core. Each execution thread is dispatched has its own 128 register space and executed programs called “kernels”. All instructions are 8 channels wide, e.g. operate on 8 registers at a time (or 16 half registers). Its supports arithmetic, logical and control flow instructions on floats and ints. Registers are addressed by address.
The EU thread dispatcher implements priorities based on age, i.e. oldest is hight priority, and whether the trhead is blocked waiting on instruction fetches, register dependencies etc’. C</p>


<p>The GuC is a small embedded core that supports graphics sechduling, power managment and firmware attestation.
It is implemented in an i486DX4 CPU (also called P24C and Minute IA), altough it seems that since broadwell it has been extended to the Pentium (i586) ISA. It runs a small microkernel call μOS. 
The GuC μOS runs only kernel level tasks (even though μOS supports μApps). The firmware is written in C with not stdlib.
In the GuC we can find supporting blocks: ROM memory, 8KB L1 on core cache, 64KB/128KB/256KB (Broadwell/Skylake/CannonLake) of SRAM  memory which is used for code+data+cache and a 8KB stack. It also has power managment, DMA engine, etc’. 
Communication to the GuC is done through memory-mapped IO and bidirectional interrupts.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/guc.png" alt="GuC architecture"></p>

<p>The GuC offers a light-weight mechanism for dispatch work the host submits to the GPU. This means the GPU driver does not need to handle dispatch and job queuing, making it much faster. The <em>user mode driver (UMD)</em> can communicate with the GuC directly when required and bypass the need to context switch the main CPU into kernel mode. The <em>kernel mode driver (KMD)</em> uses the GuC as a gateway for job submission as well. This simplifies the Kernel and provides a single point where all jobs are submitted.
Communication between the UMD and the GuC is done through shared memory queues.</p>

<p><em>Why is the GuC interesting? Because I think it can communicate with the CSME, CPU and GPU and everything over the IOSF, and if it has bugs it can be used to gain very privileged access to the system and memory</em>.</p>

<h2 id="boot-rom-and-guc-firmware">Boot ROM and GuC firmware</h2>
<p>At system startup GuC is held at reset state until the UEFI firmware initializes the shared memory regtion for the GPU. Inside the shared region a special subregion call WOPCM is set aside fur GuC (and HuC) firmware. It then releases the GuC from reset and it in turn starts executing a small non-modifiable Boot ROM (16/32KB in size) that initializes the basic GuC hardware, and waits for an interupt signalling the firmware has been copied to the WOPCM region.
The GuC firmware is an opaque blob supplied by Intel as part of the GPU KMD, which copies it to the shared memory region (GGTT) and signals the Boot ROM with an interrupt. The bootrom verifies the firmware with a digital signature using a SHA256 hash + PKCSv2.1 RSA signature, and if the test passes copies it to SRAM and starts executing.</p>

<p>The GUC firmware can be extracted from the graphics driver and reversed. Screenshot of IDA open on the kabylake GuC:
<img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gucfirmware.png" alt="GUC firmware"></p>

<p>The GuC also attest the firmware for the video decoder unit, called <em>HuC</em>. The HuC is an HEVC/H.265 decoded implement in hardware.</p>

<h2 id="the-μos-kernel">The μOS kernel</h2>
<p>The μOS kernel runs in 32-bit protected mode, with no paging and old-style segments model (CS, DS, etc’). All code run in ring0. The OS handles HW/SW exceptions and crashes, and supplies debugging and logging services.</p>

<p>Interrupts are handled through the local APIC - I found interrupts coming from the IOMMU, power managment, display interfaces, the GPU and the CPU.</p>

<p>It runs a single process - which initializes the system and then waits for interrupts/events in a loop.</p>

<h2 id="communication-with-the-os">Communication with the OS</h2>
<p>Commands are dispatched through a ring buffer work queue. Each work item has a header followed by a command. Once a command is posted the CPU notifies the GuC using a “doorbell” interrupt.</p>

<p>The Windows kernel mode driver supports GuC debugging by setting a registry key:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>\\REGISTRY\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Intel\KMD\GuC\\
	GuCEnableUkLogging=1
    
\\REGISTRY\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Intel\KMD\GuC\\
    GuCLoggingVerbositySelect=0/1/2/3 (low, medium, high, max)
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>So far we only discussed hardware. The software part of the graphics stack is divided into three levels: UEFI DXE, kernel mode and user mode.</p>

<h2 id="uefi">UEFI</h2>
<p>Traditionally VGA support was implemented with a legacy Video VBIOS as an PCI option ROM. In UEFI VBIOS was modified into a DXE driver call the <em>Graphics Output Protocol</em> (<em>GOP</em>), which support basic display for the UEFI setup menu and for the OS bootloader. The GOP is supplied by Intel to the UEFI vendor. 
The GOP supplies two basic functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changing the graphics mode - resultion, pixel depth, etc’</li>
  <li>Getting the physical address of the framebuffer</li>
</ul>

<p>The Windows boot-loader uses the GOP to setup a memory mapped video framebuffer before entering VBS, and after the hypervisor and SK are loaded the access by winload is only through the framebuffer without invoking the GOP. Windows also uses the GOP for disablig blue screens.</p>

<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>

<p>On Windows, Intel supplies a fairly large graphics driver that implements both the user mode driver (UMD) and kernel mode driver (UMD). Applications using Direct3D communicate through the D3D runtime to the DXGI abstraction interface (in dxgkrnl.sys), which in turn communicated with the KMD. The KMD treats 2D Blt and 3D operations through different pipelines and dispatches the operations to the GPU.</p>

<p>The GPU driver is riddled with telemetry, but I haven’t figured out yet how much of it is sent automatically to Intel, altough crashes are sent through OCA - Online Crash Analysis.</p>

<h2 id="basic-memory-managment">Basic Memory Managment</h2>
<p>A very important job of the graphics drivers (both KMD and UMD) is memory managment (GMM). The Graphics Memory space is the virtual memory allocated to the GPU, and is translated using the system pages tables to the physical RAM. The memory contains stuff lime geometry data, textures, etc’. The GPU hardware used Graphics Page Tables (GTTs) to decode virtual addresses supplied by the software graphics memory space into …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I write a lot of bash scripts for both my day job and my personal projects, and while they are functional, bash scripts always seem to lack that structure that I want, especially when compared to writing something in Go or C#. The main problem I have with bash scripts is that when I use functions, I lose the ability to log things.</p>

<p>For example the <code>get_config_path</code> function will print the path to the configuration file, which will get consumed by the <code>do_work</code> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>get_config_path<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"Finding Machine Configurtaion"</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>-n</span> <span>"</span><span>$CONFIG_PATH</span><span>"</span> <span>]</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>[</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"</span><span>$CONFIG_PATH</span><span>"</span> <span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span># echo "Using Configuration from environment"</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"</span><span>$CONFIG_PATH</span><span>"</span>
    <span>return
  fi

  if</span> <span>[</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"~/.config/demo/config.toml"</span> <span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span># echo "Using Configuration directory file"</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"~/.config/demo/config.toml"</span>
    <span>return
  fi</span>

  <span># echo "Unable to find configuration"</span>
  <span>exit </span>1
<span>}</span>

do_work<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>config</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>get_config_path<span>)</span>

  <span># actual work...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem is, if I include the <code>echo</code> statements which are log lines, the <code>config</code> variable in the <code>do_work</code> function will contain them too.</p>

<p>In the past, this has caused me to use functions in bash very sparingly; usually with things that are short that I don’t need to add much logging to.  However, I was recently building some AMIs, and happened to be browsing the <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-consul">Consul</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault">Vault</a> terraform module source, which uses several bash scripts which are written in a different style, which makes them vastly more maintainable.</p>

<p>So let’s have a look at the new structure I use, which is heavily based off these scripts.</p>

<h2 id="better-bash-scripts">Better Bash Scripts</h2>

<p>Before we get to the implementation, make sure you are using <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/">ShellCheck</a> it provides static analysis of your scripts, pointing out many things like missing quotes, or incorrectly handling arrays.  It has plugins for all your favourite editors too.</p>

<h3 id="0-general-styles-and-constructs">0. General Styles and Constructs</h3>

<p>All variables should be declared <code>readonly</code>, and <code>local</code> if possible, to help prevent surprise values from being present if other functions forget to do the same.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#top level</span>
<span>readonly </span><span>SCRIPT_NAME</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>basename</span> <span>"</span><span>$0</span><span>"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span>

some_method<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span># within a method</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>config_path</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Functions should assign their passed arguments to named variables as the first thing they do, preferably matching the variable name they are passed, which helps later when you are searching through a script for usages of “config_file” and not having to find other names/aliases for the same value.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>read_config<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>config_file</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>skip_validation</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$2</span><span>"</span>

  <span># ...</span>
<span>}</span>

invoke<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span># ...</span>

  read_config <span>"</span><span>$config_file</span><span>"</span> <span>"</span><span>$skip_validation</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="1-error-handling">1. Error Handling</h3>

<p>It should go without saying, but you really need to start your scripts with the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are <a href="https://vaneyckt.io/posts/safer_bash_scripts_with_set_euxo_pipefail/">many better articles</a> on what these specifically do, but suffice to say:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>e</code> causes the script to stop on errors</li>
  <li><code>u</code> causes it to error on undefined variables being used</li>
  <li><code>o pipefail</code> causes a non-zero exit code from any command in a pipeline to fail the script too (rather than just the last command.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-logging">2. Logging</h3>

<p>The real advantage of this structure is we get to have log statements! This is achieved by doing all logging to <code>stderr</code> instead of <code>stdout</code>.  We use a standardised <code>log</code> function across all the scripts, which also includes the script’s name so when calling other scripts you can see which one wrote the log line:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>readonly </span><span>SCRIPT_NAME</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>basename</span> <span>"</span><span>$0</span><span>"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span>

log<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>level</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>message</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$2</span><span>"</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>timestamp</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>date</span> +<span>"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>&gt;</span>&amp;2 <span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>timestamp</span><span>}</span><span> [</span><span>${</span><span>level</span><span>}</span><span>] [</span><span>$SCRIPT_NAME</span><span>] </span><span>${</span><span>message</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Invoking the function is <code>log "INFO" "Some status"</code> or <code>log "WARN" "Something concerning"</code> etc.</p>

<h3 id="3-error-checking">3. Error Checking</h3>

<p>We have some standard assertion functions which are used by the script when starting up to validate arguments:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>assert_not_empty<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>arg_name</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>arg_value</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$2</span><span>"</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>-z</span> <span>"</span><span>$arg_value</span><span>"</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
    </span>log <span>"ERROR"</span> <span>"The value for '</span><span>$arg_name</span><span>' cannot be empty"</span>
    <span>exit </span>1
  <span>fi</span>
<span>}</span>

assert_is_installed<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>!</span> <span>$(</span><span>command</span> <span>-v</span> <span>"</span><span>$name</span><span>"</span><span>)</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
    </span>log <span>"ERROR"</span> <span>"The binary '</span><span>$name</span><span>' is required by this script but is not installed or in the system's PATH."</span>
    <span>exit </span>1
  <span>fi</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="4-argument-parsing">4. Argument parsing</h3>

<p>When scripts need to take parameters in, I prefer to use long-flag style, as they are little more readable for people checking invocations again in the future.  This function is usually always called <code>run</code>, and is the last function defined, and is invoked immediately after definition, passing in all script arguments (<code>run "<a href="https://andydote.co.uk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="391d79">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>run<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>local </span><span>namespace</span><span>=</span><span>""</span>
  <span>local </span><span>suffix</span><span>=</span><span>""</span>
  <span>local </span><span>dry_run</span><span>=</span><span>"false"</span>

  <span>while</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$# </span><span>-gt</span> 0 <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>do
    </span><span>local </span><span>key</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>

    <span>case</span> <span>"</span><span>$key</span><span>"</span> <span>in</span>

<p>The validation uses the <code>assert_not_empty</code> function defined above, which is used in two ways: after the <code>while</code> loop to check mandatory values have been filled in, and within the <code>case</code> statement for optional flags values.</p>

<p>We also use <code>assert_is_installed</code> to validate that utilities we need are installed, such as <code>vault</code>, <code>openssl</code> and <code>jq</code></p>

<p>The <code>print_usage</code> function is just a set of <code>echo</code> statements giving all the flags, and an example of invokation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>print_usage<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>echo
  echo</span> <span>"Usage: </span><span>$SCRIPT_NAME</span><span> [OPTIONS]"</span>
  <span>echo
  echo</span> <span>"This script creates a new certiticate, and it installs it into the right namespace"</span>
  <span>echo

  <span>echo
  echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"  --namespace</span><span>\t</span><span>The namespace to install the certificate in"</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"  --suffix</span><span>\t</span><span>An optional suffix for the hostname"</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"  --dry-run</span><span>\t</span><span>Don't install the certificate"</span>
  <span>echo

  <span>echo
  echo</span> <span>"  </span><span>$SCRIPT_NAME</span><span> --namespace test --dry-run"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>I keep a single template file which has all of this written into it, and new scripts start off with a copy-paste of the template.  Could it be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>er? Sure, but then I have to deal with dependency management, and it’s just not worth the hassle and overhead.</p>

        <p>Continuing from <a href="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/blog/2021/01/25/images-functor">image editing with Functors</a>, we will now understand Applicative by editing images with it.</p>

<h3 id="applicative">Applicative</h3>
<p>An applicative is composed of 2 things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A function which can wrap any value <code>A</code> with the context <code>F</code>. <code>pure(a: A): F[A]</code>. So it must be that <code>pure</code> knows what the <code>F</code> context means.</li>
  <li>One of the two functions which are equivalent to each other (can rewrite one in terms of the other + <code>pure</code>):
    <ul>
      <li><code>map2(a: F[A], b: F[B], f: (A, B) =&gt; C): F[C]</code></li>
      <li><code>app(f: F[A =&gt; B], a: F[A]): F[B]</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Below <code>app</code> is used with the enhanced syntax:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>fab</span><span>.</span><span>app</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>])</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>]</span>
<span>//where fab is of type F[A =&gt; B]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This structure must obey the laws:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identity</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>((</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fa</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>fa</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Homomorphism</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>==</span> <span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Interchange</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>ff</span><span>.</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>==</span> <span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>((</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>ff</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Composition</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>val</span> <span>compose</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>B</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>C</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>C</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>_</span><span>.</span><span>compose</span>
<span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>compose</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fbc</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fab</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fa</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>fbc</span><span>.</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fab</span><span>.</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fa</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>These laws are a bit complicated, so again like Functors we will check them with Cats laws. The tests are more fine 
grained than only these 4 laws so if some fail we will get a better idea what and where to fix.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>checkAll</span><span>(</span><span>"Applicative laws"</span><span>,</span> <span>ApplicativeTests</span><span>(</span><span>Image</span><span>.</span><span>imApplicative</span><span>).</span><span>applicative</span><span>[</span><span>Int</span>, <span>Int</span>, <span>String</span><span>])</span></code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="map2">Map2</h4>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>map2</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>],</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>],</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>C</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>C</span><span>]`</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This says it can merge two contexts. The <code>f</code> function knows how to merge A and B into a new value C,
but <code>map2</code> knows (just like <code>pure</code>) about what the <code>F</code> context means, so it actually knows to merge both contexts together.
We can replace the word “context” with “effect”:  map2 knows how to merge two effects.</p>

<h4 id="apply">Apply</h4>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>app</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>],</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>])</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is more tricky to understand intuitively but given a function/program wrapped in the context/effect <code>F</code>,
we can run the program with the value in <code>a: F[A]</code>.
Not to be confused with the functor’s <code>map(a: F[A], f: A =&gt; B): F[B]</code> - there is an extra <code>F</code> over <code>f</code> in apply.</p>

<p>Because <code>apply</code> also gets as input two <code>F</code>s and returns only one it means that it also knows how to merge these <code>F</code>s (just like <code>map2</code>)</p>

<h4 id="map2-vs-apply">Map2 vs Apply</h4>
<p>So what is the difference? Formally none because we can write one in terms of the other + pure</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>def</span> <span>map2</span><span>[</span><span>F</span><span>[</span><span>_</span><span>]</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>B</span>, <span>C</span><span>](</span><span>fa</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>],</span> <span>fb</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>],</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>C</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>C</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>val</span> <span>one</span> <span>=</span> <span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>curried</span><span>))(</span><span>fa</span><span>)</span>
  <span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>one</span><span>)(</span><span>fb</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>def</span> <span>apply</span><span>[</span><span>A</span>, <span>B</span><span>](</span><span>ff</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>])(</span><span>fa</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>])</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>map2</span><span>(</span><span>ff</span><span>,</span> <span>fa</span><span>)((</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So it’s clear that both <code>map2</code> and <code>apply</code> know how to merge F contexts/effects, but what about the difference in signatures?</p>

<p><code>ff: F[A =&gt; B]</code> from <code>apply</code> is the partial application of <code>f: (A, B) =&gt; C</code> from <code>map2</code> with <code>a: F[A]</code>.
It kinda holds a <code>F[A]</code> inside. More precisely it’s a program which ran with input A will produce a F[B].
We’ll see this below on images.</p>

<h4 id="applicative-is-also-a-functor">Applicative is also a Functor</h4>
<p>The complete name is: <a href="http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.pdf">applicative functor</a>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>def</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>A</span>, <span>B</span><span>](</span><span>fa</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>])(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>))(</span><span>fa</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But functor is not an applicative, functor does not have <code>pure</code> so it does not know as much about what <code>F</code> means.</p>

      <span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Given F is an Image it means we can combine any 2 images, pixel by pixel. Of course, if we can combine 2 images we can also combine any N images.</p>

<p><img src="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/assets/posts/applicative-image/colorifyBird3.png" alt="checkers-bird"></p>

<p>Now let’s create the same result with map2.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>map2</span><span>(</span><span>bird</span><span>,</span> <span>checkerPattern</span><span>)((</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>b</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/assets/posts/applicative-image/colorifyBirdPlusNoBird3.png" alt="checkers-bird"></p>

<p>I’m going to repeat myself because this is awesome:<br>
<code>ff: F[A =&gt; B]</code> from <code>apply</code> is the partial application of <code>f: (A, B) =&gt; C</code> from <code>map2</code> with <code>a: F[A]</code>,
<strong>it kinda holds a <code>F[A]</code> inside</strong>. We can even extract this core image from our checkerPattern program in order to see it by giving it the transparent color:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>checkerPattern</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>c</span><span>(</span><span>Color</span><span>.</span><span>Clear</span><span>))</span>
<span>//OR</span>
<span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>checkerPattern</span><span>)(</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>Color</span><span>.</span><span>Clear</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/assets/posts/applicative-image/checker.png" alt="checkers"></p>

<p>And one more fun example, combined with the bird image:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala">    <span>def</span> <span>psychedelics</span><span>:</span> <span>Image</span><span>[</span><span>Color</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Color</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>psychedelics</span><span>)(</span><span>bird</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/assets/posts/applicative-image/psychedelicsBird.png" alt="checkers"></p>

<p>And the core image embedded in the <code>F[A =&gt; B]</code></p>

<p><img src="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/assets/posts/applicative-image/psychedelics.png" alt="checkers"></p>

<p>In the next post of this series we will see new effects done with the help of other structures from category theory, maybe monad or contravariant functor.</p>

February 10, 2021 | https://www.emilykager.com/writing/2021/02/10/mozilla.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.emilykager.com/writing/2021/02/10/mozilla.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>I don’t think any little girl grows up with the goal of “I want to be an OSS Android browser developer” and to be totally honest, even as an adult I just kind of fell into it. I first joined Mozilla as an intern during my change-career journey mainly because I had taken one Android class, knew some Java, and applied on a whim at the right time to hit the recruiter’s inbox. Despite not actively seeking Mozilla or Android out, I immediately fell in love with the project and team and knew I had stumbled into a very special place. The problems were interesting, I had opportunities for leadership and growth from the start, and the people were kind, smart, and supportive.</p>

<p>At Mozilla you’ll meet the smartest and most passionate people who could be tech leaders at any other major company (and almost certainly make more money) but are choosing to work specifically on Firefox because they believe in the product and the mission. It’s definitely intimidating to come in as an intern to one of the original “software companies” but everyone I’ve met is truly wonderful and welcoming. It was (mostly) fun to be the underdog and celebrate our wins, large and small alike. I felt connected to the mission and the products we were creating. I felt like I had a large impact in my team after only a short amount of time (most teams are quite small and tight-knit). The fans and the community were passionate and many times I had the cool experience of wearing a Firefox t-shirt in public and people thanking me for my work (now that I’m writing this, it feels a bit odd. I guess you had to be there).</p>

<p>So if it’s so great then why am I leaving? I know it’s not a satisfying answer, verging on cliche, but I’m just looking to do something new. That and.. I am also extremely burnt out. The very small mobile team has been through a gauntlet in order to ship a full rewrite of the flagship Firefox for Android browser (partly during the pandemic no less). Working too much during the week for the last 2 years was normal for me and while never asked for from my team, I cared deeply about the product and the success and it would have been impossible to hit our deadlines and ship something I was proud of without it. And when we finally did ship, I WAS proud of our team and what we had accomplished, but the release just felt like a blip in our planned schedule before jumping into more sprints and fires and thinking about the next iteration.</p>

<p>I did take one week of PTO right after our release! … which just so happened to be the week that the large layoffs happened. I was safe from layoffs, but morale plummeted, and I was definitely not refreshed. The cherry on top was being specifically targeted for harassment that same week after the release by unhappy users of Firefox looking for someone to direct their frustrations at<sup><a href="#myfootnote1">1</a></sup>. There’s nothing that Mozilla really could have done in this scenario, but it left a terrible taste in my mouth after all of the blood, sweat, and tears I had put into this project. For someone who thought of themselves as an empathetic dev overworking myself FOR the end users and product, this hurt and I’m not sure I ever really recovered. While the pace is slowing down now and there’s a promise of no more deadline crunches, I just feel that I haven’t been able to catch my breath no matter how much time I take off. Whether that’s the project, pandemic fatigue, or all of the above, I’m very ready for a break, a fresh start, and a change of pace.</p>

<p>Working in open source full-time has been an incredible experience that has had its extreme ups and downs. On the positive side, I’ve loved mentoring new contributors to get their first open source PR merged. I’ve enjoyed all the positive interactions with the lovely community volunteers who care as much about making the product better as I do. On the negative side, it has become increasingly hard for me to separate work from not work. I found myself “contributing” (read - working) at all hours of the day. Replying to issues, emails, and public chats when I was in bed at midnight, when I just woke up at 7am, in the car on the way to go hiking on the weekend, and then while ON the hike. This might be a me problem, but boundary setting when there’s a public repo always getting new issues, comments, emails, and chatroom messages was difficult for me. And of course not all of those messages are nice; the constant stream of negative comments from unhappy and rude users during the work week and outside of it was extremely draining. Besides politicians, this might be one of the only jobs where you can wake up to an inbox full of emails and messages about how much everyone thinks you suck at your job. You definitely grow a thick skin quickly, but it’s still exhausting.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people tend to forget that Mozilla was also my very first job in tech. I learned so much there and there’s always more I could learn, but it’s good to try new experiences and face new problems, especially early in my career. I will be forever grateful for the experiences I’ve had at Mozilla and the people I’ve met. It was my “big break” into tech and I will never forget that! I will keep using and supporting Firefox and take a lot of the Mozilla ideals with me wherever I go. My experience was super formative for how I view ethics, privacy, and other important issues inside the tech space.</p>

<p>I am excited about my break and my next adventure but I’m definitely very sad to be leaving Mozilla and the wonderful people. The (good) problem with working with people who are true friends is it’s painful when people leave, including yourself. I will miss everyone dearly, especially all of my mobile team peers. I hope you all stay in touch and our paths cross again once conferences are a thing again (or maybe I’ll just crash the next All Hands, I’m not above it). If you’re at Mozilla and want to say goodbye, please ping me in the next 2 weeks! I’ve also heard I’m quite easy to find online! 😉</p>

<p>Love you all ❤️ XOXO</p>

<p><a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: EDIT: Saw this made it onto Hacker News and people in the comments were doubting this harassment happened. Classic. I documented it well on my Twitter at the time, but I’m happy to give more context. I tweeted around the time of release that I was proud of the team for all our hard work and I’m not “worrying about the haters” with a photo of me drinking a beer and flipping off the camera. I never referenced users. “Haters” is just a saying that the youngins say that isn’t specific but according to the internet, <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hater-4589594">“a hater is a slang term used in everyday language and especially online to describe an individual who talks and behaves negatively in response to other people’s success and goal achievement.”</a> It was a light-hearted joke for my Twitter friends after a year of hard work and constant negativity. In response this tweet was posted all over Reddit and 4chan and then there were coordinated doxxing attacks, multiple 4chan threads full of violent sexual and death threats, troll PRs opened in our repo, all of my photos pulled off of my Instagram and posted into these threads with disgusting commentary, and actual calls to my work from fake “journalists” to try to get me fired. I’m not going to post the comments here because they make me sick but feel free to search the archives to see for yourself. If you think this is ever an appropriate response to a dev on the team telling a joke online, I can’t help you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What’s the most successful rebranding of the past 10 years? Airbnb? Google? Burger King? Nope. The award goes to….🥁🥁🥁….skipping breakfast! What was once best known as an excuse for lazy teenagers who didn’t feel like making a bowl of cereal is now being shouted from the rooftops from health enthusiasts and experts. Its new name: intermittent fasting.</p><p>For those that aren’t aware, there is an unwritten rule of intermittent fasting: you must unabashedly tell all your friends and family about how amazing it is. After a couple months of trying it out, it’s time for me to follow orders.</p><h2 id="fasting-101">Fasting 101</h2><p>When we think of nutrition, we often focus on how much we eat (calories) and what we eat (fats carbs, proteins, etc.) However, there is an important and often underemphasized third dimension: when we eat. As described on a popular fasting app’s <a href="https://www.zerofasting.com/why-fasting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">website</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Three meals a day is a modern accident. Our metabolisms are programmed for periods of feast and famine. Unlike constantly-grazing cows with four stomachs, we aren’t built to maintain a constant drip of food.</p></blockquote><p>The gist of intermittent fasting is to reduce your eating window. There are a variety of styles. The 13:11 Circadian Rhythm style consists of a 13 hour fast followed by an 11 hour eating window. It tries to replicate the body’s natural clock by fasting roughly after sunset until morning. The 16:8 is the most popular. To reach the 16 hour fasting goal, it’s common to fast from dinner to lunch the next day. Aka skipping breakfast.</p><h2 id="the-benefits-of-fasting">The Benefits of Fasting</h2><p>People are excited about intermittent fasting for good reason. Numerous studies show promising physical and mental benefits. For example, it can help you:</p><ul><li>⚡️ Boost energy</li><li>💪 Lose weight</li><li>✨ Reduce inflammation</li><li>🩸 Reduce insulin resistance (driver of Type 2 diabetes)</li><li>🧠 Increase mental clarity</li></ul><p>You can read about these benefits and others in more detail <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/intermittent-fasting-guide#benefits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-health-benefits-of-intermittent-fasting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2><p>Today is my 65th day in a row fasting and I plan to stick with it for the foreseeable future. I’m impressed with its ease and effectiveness.</p><p>I started with a 13:11 style and quickly moved to a 16:8 structure. I skip breakfast and have my first meal around 12-2pm. During the first week I was a little hungry and tired in the morning, but now I feel great right up until my first meal of the day. In fact, I now frequently extend the fast to 16-20 hours.</p><p>I’ve noticed a number of physical and mental benefits. And unlike other dietary changes I actually enjoy it. I can harness my inner teenager and be lazy about breakfast. If I feel like ice cream I can have some damn ice cream and not feel guilty about it. In return, I have more energy and mental clarity. I’m also at my lowest weight level and % body fat since the prime of my collegiate soccer days. Below is how its impacted my weight so far:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>As I learned in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24945404-the-obesity-code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Obesity Code</a>, we have a natural weight set point. Kinda like a body weight thermostat. While traditional diets that focus on calorie reduction can help you lost weight in the short term, they rarely work long term because we naturally gravitate back to our set point. In contrast, fasting can actually change your set point, enabling long term weight change. While it’s still early, my initial results are promising.</p><p>While my experience has been positive, it’s important to mention that <strong>fasting is NOT for everyone</strong>. Everybody’s body responds differently. Accordingly, it’s important to consult a doctor before trying it. This is especially true if you have diabetes, have problems with blood sugar regulation, take medications, are underweight, have a history of eating disorders, or are pregnant.</p><h2 id="fasting-tips">Fasting Tips</h2><p>The Obesity Code contains a bunch of great intermittent fasting tips. I wouldn’t have been able to beat the initial hunger and fatigue without them. Straight from the book:</p><ul><li>💧 <strong>Drink water</strong>: Start each morning with a full eight-ounce glass of water.</li><li>🤹‍♂️ <strong>Stay busy</strong>: It’ll keep your mind off food.</li><li>☕️ <strong>Drink coffee</strong>: Coffee is a mild appetite suppressant. Green tea, black tea and bone broth may also help.</li><li>🏄‍♂️ <strong>Ride the waves</strong>: Hunger comes in waves; it is not continuous. When it hits, slowly drink a glass of water or a hot cup of coffee. Often by the time you’ve finished, your hunger will have passed.</li><li>🤫 <strong>Don’t tell everybody you are fasting</strong>: Most people will try to discourage you, as they do not understand the benefits. A close-knit support group is beneficial, but telling everybody you know is not a good idea.</li><li>📅 <strong>Give yourself one month</strong>: It takes time for your body to get used to fasting. The first few times you fast may be difficult, so be prepared. Don’t be discouraged. It will get easier.</li><li>🥑 <strong>Follow a nutritious diet on non-fast days</strong>: Intermittent fasting is not an excuse to eat whatever you like. During non-fasting days, stick to a nutritious diet low in sugars and refined carbohydrates.</li><li>🍽 <strong>Don’t binge</strong>: After fasting, pretend it never happened. Eat normally, as if you had never fasted</li></ul><p>Interested in learning more?

<p>Sennett Devermont is a police accountability activist whose streams police encounters to his Instagram followers. When he visited the Beverly Hills Police Department last Fri to obtain a form, BHPD Sergeant Billy Fair recognized him and began blasting music from of his phone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLCpHBQjX8r/">https://www.instagram.com/p/CLCpHBQjX8r/</a></p>
<p>Fair was following the example of other BHPD officers who have made a habit of playing copyrighted music during encounters with the public, apparently to trigger automated copyright takedowns on the major social media platforms.</p>

<p>As Dexter Thomas writes for Vice, this form of copyfraud has a failsafe: if the filter doesn't block the livestream, the archived footage might be easily removed through copyright complaints.</p>
<p>Instagram's copyright policy suggests that videos with incidental music are permitted, but the company's filters are incapable of distinguishing "incidental" and "non-incidental" use, while its appeals process is a long-running production of Kafka's Trial.</p>

<p>Moreover, the platforms use a "copystrike" system, which means that cops who successfully deploy this tactic can chip away at activists' presence on the system – three strikes and their accounts are permanently removed.</p>
<p>Thomas: "…[P]laying copyrighted music as a deterrent to the First Amendment-guaranteed right to openly film police is, if not BHPD official protocol, at least a technique that has been deployed by more than one officer."</p>
<p>Back in 2019, anti-racist activists experimented with playing copyrighted music at Nazi rallies to make them unpostable on social media. At the time, I warned that this would end badly.</p>

<p>Exactly a year later, BLM protest videos started disappearing from the internet thanks to copyfraud and overactive copyright filters.</p>

<p>Copyright filters are a terrible idea, not just because they have all but eliminated the ability of musicians to perform classical music online:</p>

<p>Nor merely because they allow giant companies to steal from independent video creators:</p>

<p>They're a bad idea because they create a backdoor system for censorship of any and all material – because they fray the fabric of our online speech forums, and give bullies a devastating weapon to use against those who document their crimes.</p>

<p>Two of the most astute IP scholars I know also happen to be two of the best legal writers I know, and also happen to work at one of the worst IP abusers in the country: Jennifer Jenkins and James Boyle, of Duke University, the nation's leading academic trademark abuser.</p>
<p>Duke has a universal reputation for being a serious trademark abuser, but Jenkins and Boyle wanted to empirically investigate that reputation. The result is "Mark of the Devil: The University as Brand Bully," forthcoming in Fordham IPLJ.</p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3780381">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3780381</a></p>
<p>To do empirical work, you have to find stuff to count. The problem is that questions like "who is the biggest bully?" are stubbornly qualitative, and quantizing Duke's conduct risks incinerating the most important elements in the quest for some kind of quantitative residue.</p>
<p>But the authors hit on a very good quantitative/qualitative methodology: they would count trademark oppositions, which are legal filings sent after a trademark has received preliminary approval. That way, they'd be counting oppositions to trademarks that had some merit.</p>
<p>Even better: trademark oppositions have to be accompanied by legal arguments explaining why the university thinks the trademark should be blocked, and that produces a qualitative account of how Duke thinks about its trademark.</p>
<p>Then Jenkins and Boyle used their considerable legal knowledge to characterize each opposition's argument on the basis of how plausible or stupid it was, quantizing the qualitative question of whether Duke's lawyers were fucking around.</p>
<p>Some background: universities have reinvented themselves as brand-factories and oriented their activities around slapping their logos on random shit and selling it. That's why Ohio State applied for a trademark on, I shit you not, the word "the."</p>
<p>Boise State asked for a trademark on all non-green football fields. U Texas wants the trademark over making devil horns with your fingers ("I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of metalheads suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced").</p>
<p>The trademark and licensing business is a squalid affair. The (grossly overstated, rarely realized) risk of a mark lapsing into the public domain ("genericide") justifies endless bullying of people who say and do normal things that glance off your trademarks.</p>
<p>Trademark was established to protect buyers, by allowing the makers of well-known goods to punish rivals who sought to deceive their customers. Over the years, trademark has been distorted into just another grift, a way to make the rich, richer.</p>
<p>As the authors point out, citing Mark Lemley et al, there's no good trademark justification for allowing a university to snuff out "counterfeit" tees  – the buyers of these items haven't been tricked into getting a bargain on a way to advertise their team allegiance.</p>
<p>But the expansion of trademark into an economic right for mark-makers (and away from a way of protecting the public from deceptive sellers), combined with the bogeyman of genericide add up to a perfect business for the greedy and unscrupulous. For bullies.</p>
<p>So, is Duke a bully?</p>
<p>Oh shit yes.</p>
<p>Let's look at some graphs. Here's how Duke stacks up against comparable US institutions in terms of how often it challenges a trademark.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukecancels.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukecancels.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>They slice this data many ways but it always looks like this: Duke is a huge outlier.</p>
<p>But wait! Maybe those trademark cancellations are good, actually. So let's go to the quantized, hand-coded qualitative assessments of Duke's arguments.</p>
<p>They're garbage.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukemerit.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukemerit.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>"85% of Duke’s oppositions were coded either clearly erroneous or far-fetched"</p>
<p>But wait! Maybe the authors are being mean to Duke. What's "erroneous or far-fetched?" Well, it seems that Duke challenges any trademark application containing "Duke," the letter "D," a devil, the world blue, or any word that sounds like "duke."</p>
<p>All of this is laid out with beautiful clarity in the paper, and the back third of the paper moves on to ask What It All Means – why is Duke such a godawful bully. The authors entertain several possibilities, like perverse incentives in trademark, etc.</p>
<p>But they don't draw conclusions. I have one, and it may be uncomfortable for my honorable and good lawyer friends, which is that law has a bullying problem. There are many fields where esoteric knowledge gives you the power to coerce others, but the law is especially bad.</p>
<p>Luckily, most of my experience of lawyers has been with people who fight for the underdog, but honestly, I think they're the exception. I had a very eye-opening experience about 15 years ago, when a friend asked me to come speak to some co-workers.</p>
<p>My friend worked at a giant company in a creative unit, and he asked me if I'd come speak to his group. It was close by home and I told him of course I'd do it. A day before I was meant to come by, he emailed apologetically to say that legal had sent him a contract for me.</p>
<p>Now, I wasn't charging this massive, profitable company a dime. It was a favor for a pal. But I looked at the contract and it was bonkers – like, I promised I'd never mention the name of the company in print, ever, without written permission.</p>
<p>I told my friend I couldn't sign that clause and he told me he understood, but the legal department wouldn't let me in the building unless I signed it. I canceled the talk. A couple months later, I met a lawyer from the company at a signing and I told him this story.</p>
<p>He grimaced and said he knew whose doing that was, another lawyer in the department who counted their successes by how badly they could humiliate the people who contracted with the company. He listed several of these, each more outrageous than the last.</p>
<p>This wasn't just a power-trip, it was sadism. And it's not limited to that lawyer or that company. I sent back two minor, small-dollar publishing contracts today that had abominable language in them – blanket indemnities, binding arbitration, huge rights grabs.</p>
<p>These aren't (or weren't) standard. There's no business reason for them. I mean, I <em>can't</em> indemnify a multinational corporation against all claims for the simple reason that I couldn't afford to hire lawyers to argue their case. I'd just go bust.</p>
<p>There is a toxic strain of competitive sadism in the law, an ethic of victory through someone else's humiliating defeat. If I had to guess why Duke smashes all those trademark applicants' dreams, I'd say that sadism is playing a major role.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

  
<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 09 February 2021</em></p><p>INTERNET – Stack Overflow users today rejoiced at the prospect of Python’s
upcoming 3.10 release including the controversial new pattern matching feature
described in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/">PEP 634</a>.</p>

<p>“Python 3 has been out for a while, and the goldmine of Python 2 to 3 migration
questions has started to run dry since January 2020,” said one user, referring
to the end of life for the Python 2.x release series. “We were starting to
worry that we would run out of major language changes to confuse new developers.
But thanks to pattern matching, we should be set for another 5-7 years!”</p>

<p>The question answerers on the popular site, <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, were commenting
on the upcoming Python 3.10 language feature of pattern matching, which allows
syntax such as the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>404</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Some other shit, sorry!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Stack Overflow users gushed over its similarity to C’s <code>switch</code> statement. “New
users will see the <code>case</code> keyword and instantly feel comfortable based on their
knowledge of C,” one SO answerer remarked. “But that’s when we get them! <code>match</code>
is about subverting expectations, by assigning to variables when the programmer
expects a comparison. We’re going to earn so many Stack Overflow reputation
points this way.”</p>

<p>This user’s comments referred to the unexpected behavior of the match statement
when used with identifiers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>NOT_FOUND</span> <span>=</span> <span>404</span>
<span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>NOT_FOUND</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, rather than matching <code>status_code</code> against the value of
<code>NOT_FOUND</code> (404), Python’s new <del>SO reputation machine</del> match syntax would
assign the value of <code>status_code</code> to the variable <code>NOT_FOUND</code>. Another Stack
Overflow user explained:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the core developers finally looked at the numbers, and saw how few
questions Python 3.x was getting on Stack Overflow. Here’s a language that has
finally matured, and it really strikes a balance between usability and
predictability. When we reached out to the core development team about the
dire situation, the developers knew they had to step in and add an
unpredictable feature to rectify things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last time the Python language conspired so strongly to confuse new users was
the controversial “mutable default argument” feature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>def</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[]):</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"myfunc({})"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>l</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>" l={}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, some Stack Overflow users were not so rosy about the future of Python 3
questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sure, Python 3.10 is going to trigger a massive influx of questions. But that
doesn’t mean we’ll get more reputation points! Most mods are just going to
mark all the questions as duplicates, even if they don’t have good answers
yet. Pattern matching may be a beautifully booby-trapped new feature, but it’s
not going to save us from bad moderation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the Perl community rallied in support of the latest developments in
the Python language. Said one Perl developer: “Honestly, I’m just glad Python
has finally given in to gratuitous new features, and Perl 7 is now the language
of reason and moderation. I can’t wait until they realize how many operators
they can overload.  Maybe Python 2.7 can make a comeback after all?”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			<p>If I’m repeatedly drawn to a thought, feeling, or belief, I write it out. I believe writing is the most practical tool we possess to think <em>far</em> more effectively.</p>
<p>For those of us with woefully average gray matter, our minds have a limited reach. Like an erratic compass needle, our minds cling to the most provocative fragments of ideas without helping us map the territory. <strong>Writing forces us to articulate things with a level of context and coherence we can’t achieve in the mind alone.</strong> Writing lets us expand our working memory. It also exposes the gaps — blind spots, falsity, bias, prejudice, ambiguity — in what we write.</p>
<p>At its best, writing (and reading) can help us confront the ugly and uncomfortable aspects of our nature. It can uproot ideas burrowed so deeply that they’ve imperceptibly shaped our feelings and beliefs. Sometimes this uprooting will reveal that the lustrous potential of a new idea was a mirage, or that your understanding about someone’s motives were incomplete, maybe even projected. <strong>Writing can be therapeutic.</strong>&nbsp;Sculpting the clay of your thoughts can bring clarity, spark ideas, and tidy mental clutter.</p>
<p>I also believe that <strong><a href="https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making writing a habit can encourage us to be more playful and attentive</a> as we walk this earth.</strong> Writing is a perfect excuse to do something off-kilter, to experience and document something new.</p>
<p>But writing is daunting. Chaotic and awkward. It’s so off-putting that I rarely encounter people in everyday life who enjoy, or at least don’t loathe, writing.</p>
<p>Our words expose us. Maybe the process of writing even shapes us over time. Even when we’re not writing something personal, our style pervades in the way we choose and arrange words. And this style certainly evolves.</p>
<p>This makes writing difficult, especially in the beginning. It forces us to fall short of our own expectations. <strong>Like the amateur chef trying again and again to emulate a great meal, we can recognize and appreciate good writing while not being able to create it.</strong> That’s frustrating. But that’s how skill development works. To improve, our taste for things must outstrip our ability to create them.</p>
<p>This imbalance between taste and ability also means you’ll encounter people who are eager to find flaws in your writing. Don’t receive negative feedback as an attack. A reader may be able to sense that something could be better, but they may not have the ability to explain it. Embrace scrutiny. Learn to convert critical feedback — and even cynical feedback — into better writing.</p>
<p>I don’t think writing is an isolated skill. Rather, I see it as a non-linear and gangly process of gathering, curating, organizing, creating, and refining ideas and information. It’s easy to overestimate (and romanticize) the role of creativity in the writing process. Creativity is often a byproduct of the other steps listed above. Reading is often the cleanest-burning fuel for this process.</p>
<h2>Writing at Work</h2>
<p>My career path compelled me to become a better writer, and I’m grateful for it. <strong>Writing well is a skill that complements nearly every professional role.</strong></p>
<p>When I cross paths with a skilled writer, I’m delighted, particularly when they can write or edit in ways I cannot. Their ability is easy to recognize. An email, or even a short conversation with no writing involved, can give them away. <strong>Good writers strive for relevance, brevity, and style, in that order.</strong></p>
<p>Writing well is not essential to becoming a leader or high earner. But if you have a white collar job, writing can almost certainly be a force multiplier. And it can be an asset as part of a company’s culture. By knowing how to parse and convey the right information, the good writer can relieve a myriad of headaches. Good writing can connect disjointed perspectives, give direction to a project, sell a service, solidify a shared purpose, document a process, and foster an evergreen knowledge-base.</p>
<p>In my unqualified opinion, good writer are also more likely to be effective generalists. Many of the best writers I’ve worked with were not writers. Several were designers, two were lawyers, one was a pharmacist, and one was a salesperson. These people often worked beyond their job titles and were called in to help untangle sensitive projects.</p>
<p><strong>You should write because it’s a way to help yourself and others.</strong></p>

<p>Assembly code can appear mysterious to the uninitiated. Aspects of the physical machine abstracted away in higher-level languages are referred to directly in its terse commands.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1502958082" target="">This chapbook</a> of minimal assembly code poems (its author refers to them as "snippets") offers no solutions, context, or explanations to ease this gap, leaving the work of deciphering to the reader. For xorpd, its pseudonymous author, this is exactly the point: to immerse the reader in the machine level of code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When working inside a computer, everything is eventually made of assembly, so this is where you go if you really want to understand how things work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no extraneous word of text in the book to break that context. The title, <code>xchg rax, rax</code>, is a NOP instruction (pronounced no-op, for no operation): xchg exchanges the data of two operands, in this case of rax with itself. The author's name, xorpd, is a bitwise logical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XOR (exclusive or)</a> of packed double-precision floating-point values. <span><br></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The xor logical operation is one of my favorites. It is the foundation for most of our modern cryptography.</p>
<p>The "xorpd" instruction allows xoring 128 bits at a time. It is really the kind of instruction you want to be when you grow up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.xorpd.net/pages/xchg_rax/snip_00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full book can be found here</a> but is also available as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1502958082" target="">lovely printed book</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Initially I wanted to publish the book through a publisher, but no publisher wanted to go with the "minimalistic" design. One publisher said he could publish the book if I added explanations for every code snippet, but I wasn't willing to do so.</p>
<p>Another friend recommended adding QR codes to the pages, linking to explanations, but I wasn't willing to do this either. I remember trying to decipher each of those code snippets myself, and I felt that I could not let my readers down by handing them an easy solution.</p>

<p>That lack of explanation, along with the monospaced font, gives the book the feel of conceptual poetry, perhaps an early Vito Acconci piece.</p>

<p>My father opened one of the books and looked at it in amazement. He said something like "There is nothing inside the book, it's all strange short English words, who would want to buy something like this?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, much of the joy of the book comes from discovering the nuances of these tiny programs; many rely on assembly-specific tricks that do not really translate "up" into the virtual machines defined by higher-level programming languages.</p>
<p>Those who have trouble deciphering can view xorpd's video series <a href="https://www.xorpd.net/pages/x86_adventures.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assembly Language Adventures</a>, which teaches assembly programming beginning with the very basics, reaching a level of expertise through 29 hours of instruction. Xorpd created the book as a companion piece while working on the video, pulling his favorite assembly snippets together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my favorites is:</p>

<div>
<pre>cmp &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;al,0x0a
sbb &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;al,0x69
das</pre>
<p>This snippet converts a nibble (4 bits) into a hex digit with only three instructions. It always takes me a few mintues to understand how it works. From what I know the <code>das</code>​ instruction doesn't work anymore on the x86_64 architecture, but it is a nice reminder of what life used to be.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>How is this accomplished in three assembly instructions? Where is the conversion happening, and how is the 0x0a value used? The author has provided a complete explanation of the code below. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The code converts a hex number (0x0 ... 0xf) into a hex character<br>('0','1','2',...'9','a',...'f').</p>
<p>How it works<br>============</p>
<p>introduction:</p>
<p>This is the relevant part of the ASCII table:</p>
<pre>0x30 0
0x31 1
0x32 2
0x33 3
0x34 4
0x35 5
0x36 6
0x37 7
0x38 8
0x39 9
0x3a :
0x3b ;
0x3c &lt;
0x3d =
0x3e &gt;
0x3f ?
0x40 @
0x41 A
0x42 B
0x43 C
0x44 D ...</pre>
<p>There is an unfortunate gap between the numeric digits and the caps English<br>letters. The code above is meant to overcome that gap.</p>
<p>We want to map a number x to its relevant ASCII number, in the following<br>fashion: If 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 9, then map x to x + 0x30 If 0xa &lt;= x &lt;= 0xf, then map<br>x to x + 0x37</p>
<p>Note that the difference is 0x7. The idea for the code comes from the fact<br>that 7 = (16 - 10) + 1 We get the (16 - 10) difference from the DAS<br>instruction, and the 1 difference from the SBB and CMP instructions.</p>
<p>Intro to binary coded arithmetic<br>-------------------------------------</p>
<p>Most of the magic of this snippet comes from the `das` instruction, so we<br>better start by exploring what it does.</p>
<p>`das` means decimal adjust (al) after subtraction. Together with the rest of<br>the binary coded decimals instructions family, it allows us to perform binary<br>coded decimals arithemtic.</p>
<p>Binary coded decimals are decimal numbers represented in base 16. For<br>example, 0x16 would mean the decimal number 16.</p>
<p>Internally, the `das` instruction observes the flag register, and alters `al`<br>to represent the correct binary coded decimal.</p>
<p>Subtraction example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x31
sub al, 0x08
das</pre>
<p>Will result in al = 0x23. Interpreted in the world of decimals, 31 - 8 = 23.<br>Overflow will also happen in the world of decimals (Modulo 100).</p>
<p>Overflow example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x15
sub al, 0x16
das</pre>
<p>Will result in al = 0x99, because 15 - 16 = -1, which equals to 99 modulo<br>100.</p>
<p>And finally, an example equivalent to the first subtraction example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x31
add al, 0x92
daa</pre>
<p>Which will also result in al = 0x23. This time we add instead of subtract.<br>and we use the instruction `daa`, decimal adjust after addition, instead of<br>`das`.</p>
<p>There is one more delicate point about `das` and `daa` that we will need for<br>our solution. Take a look at this example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x31
add al, 0x0a
daa</pre>
<p>The result is al = 0x41. This means that from the point of view of `daa`,<br>0x0a and 0x10 are the same. It also means that 0x0f behaves just like 0x15.</p>
<p>Converting to hex<br>------------------------</p>
<p>We want to use the 16 - 10 difference to our advantage, somehow bridging the <br>gap between the '9' and 'A' characters.</p>
<p>Here is a first attempt that is close to what we want to achieve:</p>
<pre>add al, 0x30
daa</pre>
<p>For every digit between '0' and '9', we will get the correct result.<br>As an example, assigning al = 0x5 will give us the result of al = 0x35, which<br>is the digit '5'. Assigning al = 0x9 will give us the result of al = 0x39.</p>
<p>What about hex digits? When we try to assign al = 0xa, we will get al = 0x40,<br>which means that we missed our target by 1. The character 'A' has the ASCII<br>code 0x41. But we did achieve something interesting here. We managed to take<br>a jump from 0x9 -&gt; 0x39 to 0xa -&gt; 0x40. Our input increased by 1, but our<br>output increased by 7!</p>
<p>We need to somehow add 1 in the case hex digits 'a' - 'f', but not in the<br>case of '0' - '9'. A classic way to achieve this is using the carry flag.<br>Here is a fixed solution:</p>
<pre>cmp al, 0xa ; Check if al is an 'a' - 'f' digit
cmc ; Complement the carry
adc al, 0x30
daa</pre>
<p>So, if we have a numeric digit ('0' - '9') in al, the first two <br>instructions will have no effect. But if our digit is in the 'a' - 'f' range,<br>we will get a carry flag equals 1, and so `adc al, 0x30` is equivalent to<br>`add al, 0x31`. Hence for example, an input of al = 0xa will give an al =<br>0x41 output, as we wanted.</p>
<p>But we could make our code shorter if we could somehow avoid using `cmc`.<br>In order to do this, we could turn to the dual side, knowing that given<br>wraparound, subtraction is equivalent to addition. In other words, <br>`add al, 0x30 // daa` is equivalent to `sub al, 0x70 // das`.</p>
<p>Combining this with the carry flag trick, we finally get:</p>
<pre>cmp al, 0xa
sbb al, 0x69
das</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives an idea of how much is packed into these short programs, but don't count on explanations for the other pieces. While the code may have seemed daunting early on, it has been intriguing enough for the book to build an audience slowly over the years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When "xchg rax, rax" was released in 2014, there was no real interest in the book. I hate marketing work, so I never really did anything to attempt to market the book. It is only recently, 6 years later, that people started paying attention.</p>
