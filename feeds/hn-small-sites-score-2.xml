<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kubernetes is an open-source project that “containerizes” workloads and services and manages deployment and configurations. Released by Google in 2015, Kubernetes is now maintained by the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>. Since its release, it has become a worldwide phenomenon. The majority of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/kubernetes-jumps-in-popularity/">cloud native companies use</a> it, SaaS vendors offer commercial prebuilt versions, and there’s even an annual <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/">convention</a>!<br></p><p>What has made Kubernetes become such a fundamental service? A major factor is its automation capabilities. Kubernetes can automatically make changes to the configuration of deployed containers or even deploy new containers based on metrics it tracks or requests made by engineers. Having Kubernetes handle these processes saves time, eliminates toil, and increases consistency.<br></p><p>If these benefits sound familiar, it might be because they overlap with the philosophies of SRE. But how do you incorporate the automation of Kubernetes into your SRE practices? In this blog post, we’ll explain the Kubernetes Operator—the Kubernetes function at the heart of customized automation—and discuss how it can evolve your SRE solution.</p><h3>What the Kubernetes Operator can do</h3><p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kubernetes-Operators-Automating-Container-Orchestration/dp/1492048046"><em>Kubernetes Operators: Automating the Container Orchestration Platform</em></a>, authors Jason Dobies and Joshua Wood describe an Operator as “an automated Site Reliability Engineer for its application.” Given an SRE’s multifaceted experience and diverse workload, this is a bold statement. So what exactly can the Operator do?</p><h4>Kubernetes Operators complete sophisticated tasks</h4><p>The Operator can complete complex tasks in order to achieve the desired changes in the application’s output. It can automatically handle such tasks as:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Deploying applications</li><li>Updating applications to new versions</li><li>Reconfiguring application settings</li><li>Scaling applications up and down depending on usage</li><li>Failure handling</li><li>Setting up monitoring infrastructure<br></li></ul><p>Without Kubernetes Operators, engineers would need to complete these tasks. Automating them saves time and toil, and makes the procedures and results consistent.<br></p><h4>Kubernetes Operators control custom resources and applications</h4><p>Kubernetes allows you to create and define custom resources based on specific applications. The custom resource is a data object generated by your application containing metrics on the application's state. Imagine you have an application that produces new server instances based on usage. You could define your custom resource to check RAM and disk space for each new instance. You can also define a custom resource as a target that the application is trying to match. The Kubernetes Operator can then control the application to achieve the target custom resource; if the application is spinning up servers that have insufficient RAM or disk space, the Operator can reconfigure the settings to match the desired amount.<br></p><h4>Kubernetes Operators make stateful decisions</h4><p>The Kubernetes Operator is able to modify the configuration and usage of an application based on the application’s output. This is determined by the custom resources defined for that application. Custom resources showing the desired state and custom resources showing the current state form a loop. The Operator observes the current state and then takes actions that will make the application produce the desired state. After the actions are executed, the current state is reevaluated and the loop begins again.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For example, a custom resource could define the desirable state of a new server instance as some amount of load capability based on its physical resources.The Operator would then adjust the configuration until new instances reached these standards.</p><h3>Kubernetes Operators and SRE</h3><p>If you’re using Kubernetes, you’ll find that building and implementing Operators aligns with your SRE goals.</p><h4>Operator monitoring, SLIs, and SLOs</h4><p>When developing the custom resource for your application, you need to choose which signals from the application’s output will be monitored by the resource and which targets the Operator will steer the application toward. This is similar to creating <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/slis-understand-users-needs">SLIs</a> and <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/service-level-objectives-slos-lessons-learned">SLOs</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The process of determining metrics with greatest impact is similar for Operators and SLIs. In the <em>Kubernetes Operators</em> textbook, Dobies and Wood suggest looking first at the “four golden signals” (<a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/">a concept from Google’s SRE book</a>) to determine what the Operator should monitor. These are:</p><ul role="list"><li>Latency</li><li>Traffic</li><li>Errors</li><li>Saturation<br></li></ul><p>Creating Operators for your applications will help you understand what SLIs and SLOs should be set for them. Likewise, setting SLIs and SLOs can help you understand what your Operators should monitor.<br></p><p>You might notice that when servers are overloaded, your customers are unhappy with the application’s availability.<br></p><p>You can set a custom resource to monitor the disk space available. At 5% remaining capacity, your custom resource will spin up new server instances, giving your customers better service. Your SLI will be based on availability and will monitor disk space. Your SLO might dictate that you need to achieve 99.9% availability to keep your customers happy, informing the Operator’s intervention points.</p><h4>Automating SRE application deployment</h4><p>Your SRE practice will involve applications being deployed on a regular basis for each new instance of a service. For example, you may want to deploy a monitoring application every time you implement a new area of system architecture. Kubernetes Operators can expedite and automate this process. For monitoring, the <a href="https://coreos.com/blog/the-prometheus-operator.html">Prometheus Operator</a> is one of the first Operators developed by Kubernetes. It automatically deploys and controls a new instance of the open-source monitoring software <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> onto any targeted clusters.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/choosing-sre-tools">SRE tools</a> represent an investment in reliability. The time spent implementing them is paid for by the time they save. Creating Operators is a similar investment. By creating Operators, you save time on each deployment. Furthermore, deployments are consistent and reliable. Your SRE practices have less overhead and can scale with your organization.</p><h4>Operators and incident management</h4><p>Operators can be set up to make adjustments to handle failure. If the application’s custom resource varies from the desired result, the Operator will make changes to compensate until the desired state is achieved. The cause of the variation is irrelevant to the Operator. It only operates based on the current and desired states. You will still need to work through an incident retrospective to bubble up contributing factors.<br></p><p>When developing your incident response plan, the behavior of your Operators can be a valuable resource. If you know that the Operator will automatically try to correct the behavior, you can incorporate that into your expectations and procedures. For example, if you have an incident response plan for oversaturated servers, your Operator could spin up new server instances or reconfigure load balancing. Your response plan would take this into account, saving you some troubleshooting steps and allowing you to focus on the originating issue. By combining Operators and <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/runbook-automation-best-practices">automated runbooks</a>, you can minimize the amount of manual escalation and resolve many incidents without human intervention. As automation is another core goal of SRE, this is another way that Kubernetes Operators fit into your reliability strategy.<br></p><p>As you shift your services to a container-based model and Kubernetes becomes more fundamental to your DevOps practices, it’s important to incorporate Operators into your reliability strategy. Operators allow you to extend Kubernetes with custom resources and responses, allowing for more automation and less toil.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you enjoyed this post, check out these resources:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/resources/webinar-modern-metrics">Webinar: Modern Metrics to Understand Operational Health</a></li><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/how-to-choose-monitoring-tools">How to Choose Monitoring Tools for DevOps and SRE</a></li><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/incident-classification">How to Classify Incidents</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="course-content">Course content</h2>
<p>The course is two-fold.</p>
<p>On the one hand it introduces functional programming: Immutable data, algebraic datatypes, pattern matching, recursion, functions as first-class values, proper tail calls, type-directed programming and functional programming patterns.</p>
<p>On the other hand it introduces 'Property-based testing' (QuickCheck) (next generation automated testing) expressed within the functional programming context: Generators, properties, shrinking, statistics of generators, type-directed testing, testing of imperative code while touching upon a number of more general testing concepts as debugging, unit-testing, corner cases, blackbox and whitebox testing and fuzzing.</p>
<p>Finally the course covers a number of real-world case studies of property-based testing, e.g., an automated test of the AUTOSAR specification for Volvo.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in creating something similar, feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/YaleDHLab/pix-plot">full code</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-with-threejs">Getting Started with Three.js</h2>

<p>Three.js is a JavaScript library that generates lower-level code for WebGL, the standard API for 3D rendering in a web browser. Using Three.js, one can build complex 3D environments that would take much more code to build in raw WebGL. For a quick sample of the projects others have built with the library, check out the <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js homepage</a>.</p>

<p>To get started with Three.js, one needs to provide a bit of boilerplate code with the three essential elements of a Three.js page:</p>

<p><strong>scene</strong>: The scene contains all objects to be rendered:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create the scene and a camera to view it</span>
<span>var</span> <span>scene</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Scene</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>camera</strong>: The camera determines the position from which viewers see the scene:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Specify the portion of the scene visiable at any time (in degrees)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>fieldOfView</span> <span>=</span> <span>75</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Specify the camera's aspect ratio</span>
<span>var</span> <span>aspectRatio</span> <span>=</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerWidth</span> <span>/</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerHeight</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Specify the near and far clipping planes. Only objects</span>
<span>// between those planes will be rendered in the scene</span>
<span>// (these values help control the number of items rendered</span>
<span>// at any given time)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>nearPlane</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.1</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>farPlane</span> <span>=</span> <span>1000</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Use the values specified above to create a camera</span>
<span>var</span> <span>camera</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>PerspectiveCamera</span><span>(</span>
  <span>fieldOfView</span><span>,</span> <span>aspectRatio</span><span>,</span> <span>nearPlane</span><span>,</span> <span>farPlane</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>// Finally, set the camera's position in the z-dimension</span>
<span>camera</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>renderer</strong>: The renderer renders the scene to a canvas element on an HTML page:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create the canvas with a renderer and tell the</span>
<span>// renderer to clean up jagged aliased lines</span>
<span>var</span> <span>renderer</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>WebGLRenderer</span><span>({</span><span>antialias</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>});</span>

<span>// Specify the size of the canvas</span>
<span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>setSize</span><span>(</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerWidth</span><span>,</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerHeight</span> <span>);</span>

<span>// Add the canvas to the DOM</span>
<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span> <span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>domElement</span> <span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The code above creates the scene, adds a camera, and renders the canvas to the DOM. Now all we need to do is add some objects to the scene.</p>

<p>Each item rendered in a Three.js scene has a <strong>geometry</strong> and a <strong>material</strong>. Geometries use vertices (points) and faces (polygons described by vertices) to define the shape of an object, and materials use textures and colors to define the appearance of that shape. A geometry and a material can be combined into a <strong>mesh</strong>, which is a fully composed object ready to be added to a scene.</p>

<p>The example below uses the high-level <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/geometries/BoxGeometry">BoxGeometry</a>, which comes with pre-built vertices and faces:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create a cube with width, height, and depth set to 1</span>
<span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>BoxGeometry</span><span>(</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>);</span>

<span>// Use a simple material with a specified hex color</span>
<span>var</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>MeshBasicMaterial</span><span>({</span> <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>0xffff00</span> <span>});</span>

<span>// Combine the geometry and material into a mesh</span>
<span>var</span> <span>cube</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Mesh</span><span>(</span> <span>geometry</span><span>,</span> <span>material</span> <span>);</span>

<span>// Add the mesh to the scene</span>
<span>scene</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span> <span>cube</span> <span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, to render the scene on the page, one must call the <code>render()</code> method, passing in the scene and the camera as arguments:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span> <span>scene</span><span>,</span> <span>camera</span> <span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Combining the snippets above gives the following result:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="WXdYpx" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="The Simplest Three.js Scene">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/WXdYpx/">The Simplest Three.js Scene</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>This is great, but the scene is static. To add some <strong>animation</strong> to the scene, one can periodically update the cube’s rotation property, then rerender the scene. To do so, one can replace the <code>renderer.render()</code> line above with a render loop that calls itself recursively. Here is a standard render loop in Three.js:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>animate</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span> <span>animate</span> <span>);</span>
  <span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span> <span>scene</span><span>,</span> <span>camera</span> <span>);</span>

  <span>// Rotate the object a bit each animation frame</span>
  <span>cube</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
  <span>cube</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>animate</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Adding this block at the bottom of the script makes the cube slowly rotate:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="vWpvNL" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Animating the Cube">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/vWpvNL/">Animating the Cube</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>Adding <strong>lights</strong> to the scene can make it easier to differentiate the faces of the cube. To add lights to the scene above, we’ll first want to change the cube’s material, because as the documentation says the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/materials/MeshBasicMaterial">MeshBasicMaterial</a> is not affected by lights. Let’s replace the material defined above with a <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/materials/MeshPhongMaterial">MeshPhongMaterial</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>MeshPhongMaterial</span><span>({</span><span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>0xffff00</span><span>})</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next let’s point a light at the cube so that different faces of the cube catch different amounts of light:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Add a point light with #fff color, .7 intensity, and 0 distance</span>
<span>var</span> <span>light</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>PointLight</span><span>(</span><span>0xffffff</span><span>,</span> <span>.</span><span>7</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Specify the light's position in the x, y, and z dimensions</span>
<span>light</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Add the light to the scene</span>
<span>scene</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>light</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Voila!</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="mqparr" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Lighting the Cube">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/mqparr/">Lighting the Cube</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<h2 id="adding-images-to-a-scene">Adding Images to a Scene</h2>

<p>The snippets above give a quick overview of the core elements of a Three.js scene. The following section will build upon those ideas to create a TSNE map of images.</p>

<p>To build an image viewer, we’ll need to load some image files into some Three.js materials. We can do so by using the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/loaders/TextureLoader">TextureLoader</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create a texture loader so we can load the image file</span>
<span>var</span> <span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>TextureLoader</span><span>();</span>

<span>// Specify the path to an image</span>
<span>var</span> <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>'https://s3.amazonaws.com/duhaime/blog/tsne-webgl/assets/cat.jpg'</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Load an image file into a MeshLambert material</span>
<span>var</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>MeshLambertMaterial</span><span>({</span>
  <span>map</span><span>:</span> <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>
<span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that the material is ready, the remaining steps are to generate a geometry from the image, combine the material and geoemtry into a mesh, and add the mesh to the scene, just like the cube example above. Because images are two-dimensional planes, we can use a simple <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/geometries/PlaneGeometry">PlaneGeometry</a> for this object’s geometry:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// create a plane geometry for the image with a width of 10</span>
<span>// and a height that preserves the image's aspect ratio</span>
<span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>PlaneGeometry</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>*</span><span>.</span><span>75</span><span>);</span>

<span>// combine the image geometry and material into a mesh</span>
<span>var</span> <span>mesh</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Mesh</span><span>(</span><span>geometry</span><span>,</span> <span>material</span><span>);</span>

<span>// set the position of the image mesh in the x,y,z dimensions</span>
<span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>

<span>// add the image to the scene</span>
<span>scene</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mesh</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The image will now appear in the scene:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="jaYdLg" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Adding an Image to a Three.js Scene">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/jaYdLg/">Adding an Image to a Three.js Scene</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that one can swap out the PlanarGeometry for other geometries and Three.js will automatically wrap the material over the new geometry. The example below, for instance, swaps the PlanarGeometry for a more interesting Icosahedron geometry, and rotates the icosahedron inside the render loop:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// use an icosahedron geometry instead of the planar geometry</span>
<span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>IcosahedronGeometry</span><span>();</span>

<span>// spin the icosahedron each animation frame</span>
<span>function</span> <span>animate</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span> <span>animate</span> <span>);</span>
  <span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span> <span>scene</span><span>,</span> <span>camera</span> <span>);</span>
  <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
  <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
  <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>animate</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This produces a strange looking cat indeed:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="NwXeoB" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Icosahedron Cat">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/NwXeoB/">Icosahedron Cat</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<h2 id="building-custom-geometries">Building Custom Geometries</h2>

<p>The examples above use a few different geometries built into Three.js. Those geometries are based on the fundamental <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/core/Geometry">THREE.Geometry</a> class, which is a primitive geometry one can use to create custom geometries. THREE.Geometry is lower-level than the prebuilt geometries used above, but it gives performance gains that make it worth the effort.</p>

<p>Let’s create a custom geometry by calling the THREE.Geometry constructor, which takes no arguments:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Geometry</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This geometry object doesn’t do much yet, because it doesn’t have any vertices with which to ariculate a shape. Let’s add four vertices to the geometry, one for each corner of the image. Each vertex takes three arguments, which define the vertex’s x, y, and z positions respectively:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// identify the image width and height</span>
<span>var</span> <span>imageSize</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>7.5</span><span>};</span>

<span>// identify the x, y, z coords where the image should be placed</span>
<span>// inside the scene</span>
<span>var</span> <span>coords</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>3.75</span><span>,</span> <span>z</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>};</span>

<span>// add one vertex for each image corner in this order:</span>
<span>// lower left, lower right, upper right, upper left</span>
<span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span>
  <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Vector3</span><span>(</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>,</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>z</span>
  <span>),</span>
  <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Vector3</span><span>(</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>imageSize</span><span>.</span><span>width</span><span>,</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>,</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>z</span>
  <span>),</span>
  <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Vector3</span><span>(</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>imageSize</span><span>.</span><span>width</span><span>,</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>+</span><span>imageSize</span><span>.</span><span>height</span><span>,</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>z</span>
  <span>),</span>
  <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Vector3</span><span>(</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>+</span><span>imageSize</span><span>.</span><span>height</span><span>,</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>z</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that the vertices are in place, we need to add some faces to the geometry. The code below will model an image as two triangle faces, as triangles are performant primitives in the WebGL world. The first triangle will combine the lower-left, lower-right, and upper-right vertices of the image, and the second will triangulate the lower-left, upper-right, and upper-left vertices of the image:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// add the first face (the lower-right triangle)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>faceOne</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Face3</span><span>(</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>4</span><span>,</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>3</span><span>,</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>2</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>// add the second face (the upper-left triangle)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>faceTwo</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Face3</span><span>(</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>4</span><span>,</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>2</span><span>,</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>1</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>// add those faces to the geometry</span>
<span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>faces</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>faceOne</span><span>,</span> <span>faceTwo</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Awesome, we now have a geometry with four vertices that describe the corners of the image, and two faces that describe the lower-right and upper-left-hand triangles of the image. The next step is to describe which portions of the cat image should appear in each of the faces of the geometry. To do so, one …</p></div></div>

            <p>As I have mentioned in other posts on this blog (and surely many would agree here), I strongly believe that a great start for designing a program is figuring out good representations for the real world problem one tries to solve, <em>i.e.</em> defining appropriate types.
One helpful technique for that is what one could call <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Julia/comments/ijln21/blog_sum_types_in_julia_and_rust/g3f1gtn/"><em>optionality</em></a> .<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Interestingly, it is expressed completely differently in different programming languages which I would like to briefly demonstrate in this article using Rust and Julia as examples.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong>
Julia and Rust are my favourite programming languages and they are particularly suited to demonstrate my point.
That should not stop you from reading if you use neither of these languages, though!
First, both have a rather intuitive syntax and the code shown here is really basic, so you should be able to follow along.
Second, you can probably substitute your inheritance-using language for Julia (<em>e.g.</em> Java) or your tagged-union-using language for Rust (<em>e.g.</em> Haskell).
Even if not, you might learn something anyway!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p>Suppose, you are creating an intergalactic game where players can inhabit three different star systems: Our sun (the <em>solarians</em>), the polar star (the <em>polarians</em>) and Alpha Centauri (the <em>centaurians</em>).
An obvious first step would be to define types for each of these three classes:</p>
<p>In Julia:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>struct</span> Solarian <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Polarian <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Centaurian <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>and in Rust (I will stick to this order if not stated otherwise):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Solarian</span>;
<span>struct</span> <span>Polarian</span>;
<span>struct</span> <span>Centaurian</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>(You would add some fields to those structs, of course, but that’s not the point here.)</p>
<p>Now, let’s say you need to store the player value in another object like a game state:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>struct</span> GameState
    daytime<span>::</span><span>UInt</span>
    player<span>::???</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>???</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>What type would you use for <code>player</code> in each case?
And what about</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>function</span> homestar(player<span>::???</span>)<span>::</span>String
    <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(player: <span>???</span>) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
    ...
}
</code></pre></div><p>These are the questions we’re here for.</p>
<h2 id="strategy-1-inheritance--subtyping">Strategy 1: Inheritance / subtyping</h2>
<h3 id="julia">Julia</h3>
<p>This is very straightforward in Julia.
Define</p>
<p>and make the structs from above subtypes of that:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>struct</span> Solarian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Polarian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Centaurian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Dynamic dispatch then allows you to write:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">homestar(player<span>::</span>Solarian) <span>=</span> <span>"sun"</span>
homestar(player<span>::</span>Polarian) <span>=</span> <span>"polar star"</span>
homestar(player<span>::</span>Centaurian) <span>=</span> <span>"Alpha Centauri"</span>
homestar(player<span>::</span>Player) <span>=</span> <span>"unknown"</span> <span># or `error("Unknown player class")`</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="rust">Rust</h3>
<p>Rust does not have subtyping but you can define relations between types via <em>traits</em> (similar to interfaces in other languages).
So, we can try</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> Player {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>and then</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl</span> Player <span>for</span> Solarian {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
        <span>String</span>::from(<span>"sun"</span>)
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>But what about the <code>GameState</code> struct?
We can make use of <em>trait objects</em>, about which we only know that they implement a certain trait.
We especially don’t know the object’s size so we need to reference to it.
If you’re familiar with Rust, you know that this either means using a “normal” reference (<code>&amp;</code> or <code>&amp;mut</code>) and dealing with life time annotations (not my favourite, to be honest) or using a <code>Box</code>ed value.
If you’re not familiar with that, it doesn’t really matter here anyway.
<code>GameState</code> could look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span>dyn Player<span>&gt;</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>This works, but does restrict us in what we can do with the <code>Player</code> trait, as it needs to be <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety"><em>object safe</em></a>.
For example, greeting another player of an arbitrary class</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> Player {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span>;
    <span>fn</span> <span>greet</span><span>&lt;</span>T: <span>Player</span><span>&gt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self, other: <span>&amp;</span><span>T</span>);
}
</code></pre></div><p>would not work anymore.</p>
<p>This would be easy in Julia, though:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">greet(self<span>::</span>Polarian, other<span>::</span>Player) <span>=</span> println(<span>"Hi!"</span>)
greet(self<span>::</span>Polarian, other<span>::</span>Solarian) <span>=</span> println(<span>"Your star doesn't even consist of three separate stars? Pathetic!"</span>)
</code></pre></div><h2 id="strategy-1b-constrained-generics">Strategy 1b: Constrained generics</h2>
<p>Both Julia and Rust offer defining generic types with type parameters.
Additionally, one can put constraints on those parameters.
This allows us to do a smiliar thing as in strategy 1 but without hiding the concrete player type in the <code>GameState</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>abstract type</span> Player <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Solarian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>

<span>struct</span> GameState{P <span>&lt;:</span> Player}
    daytime<span>::</span><span>UInt</span>
    player<span>::</span>P
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>or</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> Player { ... }
<span>struct</span> <span>Solarian</span>;
<span>impl</span> Player <span>for</span> Solarian { ... }

<span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span><span>&lt;</span>P: <span>Player</span><span>&gt;</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>P</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>This approach can be considered more performant in general, as the compiler can emit code for concrete types (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-01-syntax.html#performance-of-code-using-generics"><em>monomorphisation</em></a>) instead of carrying around a clumsy super type that keeps track of subtypes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table">virtual method tables</a>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>However, there is a major concern with this approach: <strong>abstraction leaking</strong>.
Users of the <code>GameState</code> struct now have to decide what concrete type to choose for the parameter <code>P</code>, very strictly so in Rust, not so much in Julia.
This can be okay, but often enough <code>GameState</code> is the right place to deal with that question and really should hide that detail.</p>
<p>So as a rule of thumb: Consider generics for this problem “deep down” in your code but don’t miss the abstraction level where it needs to be kept inside.</p>
<h2 id="strategy-2-enumerations">Strategy 2: Enumerations</h2>
<p>So far, the approaches were not really satisfying for Rust.
But enumerations come to the rescue!
Enumerations (or enums) are types that consist of a concrete and explicit list of possible values (so called <em>variants</em>).</p>
<h3 id="rust-1">Rust</h3>
<p>In Rust, those values can even have their own data which is perfect for our situation:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum</span> <span>PlayerClass</span> {
    Sol(Solarian),
    Pol(Polarian),
    Cent(Centaurian)
}

<span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>PlayerClass</span>
}

<span>impl</span> PlayerClass {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
        <span>use</span> PlayerClass::<span>*</span>;
        <span>match</span> self {
            Sol(_) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>String</span>::from(<span>"sun"</span>),
            ...
        }
    }

    <span>fn</span> <span>greet</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self, other: <span>&amp;</span><span>PlayerClass</span>) {
        <span>use</span> PlayerClass::<span>*</span>;
        <span>match</span> (self, other) {
            (Cent(_), Pol(_)) <span>=&gt;</span> println<span>!</span>(<span>"Hello, fellow three-star-systemer!"</span>),
            ...
        };
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>This indeed solves all our previous problems and is hence the go-to pattern for this situation.</p>
<h3 id="julia-1">Julia</h3>
<p>Julia does technically have enums, but not really.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">@enum PlayerClass Sol Pol Cent
</code></pre></div><p>exists and it will give you a type <code>PlayerClass</code> with exactly these three possible values but enums are not a first class citizen.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
But that’s not even relevant for us, more importantly, enum variants in Julia are <em>not</em> able to carry additional data with them!
So all the information in the fields of the <code>Solarian</code>, <code>Polarian</code>, and <code>Centaurian</code> struct can not be build into the <code>PlayerClass</code> enum.
There is no way to sensibly implement</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>function</span> takedamage!(player<span>::</span>PlayerClass)
    <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>whereas it is trivial in Rust:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl</span> PlayerClass {
    <span>fn</span> <span>takedamage</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> self) {
        <span>match</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> self {
            PlayerClass::Sol(solarian) <span>=&gt;</span> solarian.health <span>-=</span> <span>42</span>,
            ...
        };
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>assuming the struct <code>Solarian</code> has a field <code>health: u64</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You might have guessed it by now, but the general advice is:
<strong>Use subtyping in Julia and enums in Rust.</strong>
One caveat though: Enums can not be extended from the “outside”.
If you plan to let users of your library add new type variants, you will have to use some kind of trait approach.</p>
<p>If you are somewhat familiar with Rust or Julia then a large part of this article is probably very obvious to you.
“Of course I use subtyping, that’s what everybody <em>loves</em> Julia for!” or “Of course I use enums, they’re one of <em>the</em> key features of Rust!” you might say.</p>
<p>However, I find it quite surprising that these two – seemingly rather different – patterns can be used in the same situation.
If you are (without loss of generality) a Julia developer, being aware of the corresponding pattern in Rust might help you design appropriate types faster, should you ever get into that situation; and vice versa.</p>

        <article>
          
<p>30 Aug 2020</p>

<p>The decentralized nature of the Internet and the ability to self-host content has always been appealing to me.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m really interested in taking problems and re-working them so that they can be solved without an obvious single point of failure instead of requiring a single central coordinating actor. This can be accomplished using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> networking â€” instead of connecting to a single server, one would connect with multiple other peers on their network. Coincidentally, I also enjoy collecting data. Thus, the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent protocol</a></strong> is particularly interesting to me. For this post, I thought I would walk through a conceptual example to help de-mystify how the protocol works.</p>

<p>Upfront warning: there will be a decent amount of hand-waving around the actual networking component of the protocol, since I believe it would just bog down this post (and, realistically, Iâ€™d make a fool of myself).</p>

<h3 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the Scene</h3>

<p>We just finished running an event. Awesome. Maybe it was a conference, an unconference, or somewhere in the middle. It went well and weâ€™re feeling real proud of ourselves. This was also the first year we had talk transcripts as well as a professional photographer. We want to share this content with our organizers! Thereâ€™s one issue thoughâ€¦ the organizers are located all over the world!</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s plenty of options here â€” you could share a SomeCorpCloudServiceâ„¢ Folderâ€¦ maybe run an FTP serverâ€¦ what about physically mailing USB sticks to everyone? All very plausible options. But youâ€™re hesitating. That sounds like a lot of work for you, whether it be paying money for the storage, making sure a device stays plugged in 24/7, or licking tons of envelopes.</p>

<p>What if there was a way your organizers could help forward along the content to other organizers? Maybe some kind of organizer-to-organizer protocolâ€¦ ðŸ¤”</p>

<h3 id="a-first-attempt">A First Attempt</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s think of what we have here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A pre-defined list of files we want to share.</li>
  <li>A list of clients (ie. organizers, IP addressesâ€¦ basically the same thing) we want to share these files with. This is called a <strong>swarm</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So we develop a simple application. The application will keep track of which files youâ€™ve already downloaded and which ones youâ€™re missing. Itâ€™ll connect you to the swarm and open up individual connections to each person. This might be the entire swarm, or it could be just a few people.</p>

<p>These connections then support the following operations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We can announce to the entire swarm which files we have already downloaded. We would do this when we first connect to the swarm, when others connect to the swarm, or when our set of downloaded files changes.</li>
  <li>We can connect to a specific client to send or receive a file.</li>
</ol>

<p>The process of sharing works by having a client <em>A</em> check which files it is missing, waiting for another client (<em>B</em>) to announce it has the file, and then communicating with client <em>B</em> to receive the file. Then client <em>A</em> would announce that it now has this file for anyone else who might need it. This lets content propagate through our swarm without always needing to get the files from the same person! That way we are not stuck content-less just because client <em>B</em> decided to go to bed early.</p>

<p>But there seems to be a problem here. Someone needs to provide the content initially, otherwise everyone will just be constantly announcing that they have no files. This is called the <strong>initial seed</strong>.</p>

<p>How would this work in practice? Suppose we have four clients involved and we need to share <code>IMG_3051.jpg</code>. Initially thereâ€™s only three clients in the swarm and none of them have the image. But in the shadows there lurks a mythical fourth client who has yet to connect and who has the image.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene1.svg" alt="Image showing a swarm of three clients missing the file, with a disconnected fourth client possessing the file" width="300px"></p>

<p>When the client connects, it tells everyone which files it has.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene2.svg" alt="The fourth client joins the swarm announcing it has the image file." width="300px"></p>

<p>And now things start moving! One of our clients has a fast internet connection, hears this message, realizes â€œhey I need that!â€� and asks for the file. The send completes!</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene3.svg" alt="A send occurs for the file and now a second client has the file." width="300px"></p>

<p>Now that it has the file, this client decides to re-announce what it has.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene4.svg" alt="Two clients are now announcing they have the file." width="300px"></p>

<p>Time continues flowing. Our remaining clients have now heard both announcements and can receive the file from either client. The <strong>initial seed</strong> could now leave without leaving clients to dry.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene5.svg" alt="Everyone now has the files, with sends being issued from each client." width="300px"></p>

<p>With this application, we can now share our content peer-to-peer without needing to remain connected the entire time! Others can take up part of the sharing work.</p>

<h3 id="big-files-slow-connections">Big Files, Slow Connections</h3>

<p>The application is working well! Our organizers are slowly getting all of the generated media. Key word being <em>slowly</em>. Youâ€™ve gotten a few reports now that users will occasionally get stuck waiting ages for some of the larger files (RAW images are quite large after all). Not everyone in our swarm has fast internet connections, so the experience can be sub-optimal if you end up requesting a small file from a fast client and a large file from a slow client.</p>

<p>Your first guess here might be to always prioritize selecting the fastest client in the swarm. That sounds reasonableâ€¦ until they get bombarded with requests. Their home connection slows to a crawl. Eventually, they figure out that Netflix is streaming at awful quality due to the application and decide to close it â€” right as someone had downloaded exactly 99% of the image, leaving them unhappy.</p>

<p>A light bulb goes off in your head: <strong>why not split up our files into smaller pieces</strong>? This kills two birds with one stone! It minimizes the impact of slow connectionsâ€¦ downloading 100Kb from a slow connection is less painful than trying to download 100Mb. It also helps avoid re-downloading! If you are on a slow internet connection and already have 99% of a file downloaded and the connection drops all you need to do is download the missing piece instead of re-downloading the entire file.</p>

<p>So itâ€™s time to tweak our application â€” version 2.0.</p>

<p>Your application now conceptually splits up each file into <strong>pieces</strong>. Each piece has the same size. The protocol now uses the following operations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We can tell the entire swarm which <strong>pieces</strong> we have already downloaded.</li>
  <li>We can send/receive a <strong>piece</strong> for a given connection.</li>
</ol>

<p>Picking the piece size actually has an important trade off. As piece size decreases, there are more announces and more file send/receive connections. If your piece size is too low (or too high!), the protocol loses efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="growing-the-swarm">Growing the Swarm</h3>

<p>Initially, we embedded a list of possible clients in our application. This isnâ€™t the most practical: IP addresses change, organizing teams grow, people want to download the file from multiple devices, etc.</p>

<p>We could develop a centralized <strong>tracker</strong> of peers. This service is responsible for tracking the IP addresses of swarm members, and for providing that list to clients. Our application would register with the tracker on startup and query for available peers. The tracker could periodically send out updates as the swarm changes to keep clients up to date.</p>

<p>This seems less than ideal given our initial goal of offloading as much work as possible and not needing to host anything. Feeling inspired from the peer-to-peer nature of the protocol up to this point, you might get curious and wonder if thereâ€™s a way to exchange swarm information peer-to-peer as well. In the real world, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">distributed hash tables</a> are generally used to accomplish this (eg. the BitTorrent protocol uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia</a> system). These approaches all generally require some clients which are always online to bootstrap the search for swarm members, but it provides a way to de-centralize and distribute this work.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-trust-me">Do You Trust Me?</h3>

<p>Up till this point, weâ€™ve trusted all the members of our swarm to send the same files as the <strong>initial seed</strong>. But what if a malicious organizer decides to modify one of the images to make a meme and spreads it masquerading as the original? Alternatively, what if someoneâ€™s connection is flaky and weâ€™re not quite sure we got the right bytes for the image?</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve discussed a similar problem in the past when <a href="https://dominic.cr/2020/05/26/merkle_trees/">Verifying Data with Merkle Trees</a>. The core of solving that problem involved using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum function</a> on our data and sharing the checksum so that others could verify they had the data we intended.</p>

<p>So we decide to try <strong>embedding a checksum with each file piece</strong> in our application alongside our file piece information. Our application can then verify that any piece received from another client matches the checksum! We can now add untrusted members to the swarm without worrying that they might tamper our file data!</p>

<h3 id="what-about-next-year">What About Next Year?</h3>

<p>Weâ€™ve now established a good conceptual protocol for sharing this type of content. But one part of it is still impractical: so much information is baked directly into the application! Organizers really like the application and would like to use it for other events.</p>

<p>The information we needed to coordinate this dance of file-sharing includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The list of file pieces and their checksums.</li>
  <li>Any information we need to find other swarm members. As an example, this could be the URL for our tracker!</li>
</ul>

<p>If we were to put this information in a file and modify our application to accept these files, we could now re-use the protocol arbitrarily! This means our application could download and share multiple sources at once.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is exactly what a <code>.torrent</code> file contains (along with other data). These files are encoded using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode">Bencode</a> format in order to allow flexibility and offer some size reduction. Everything youâ€™ve read in this post is actually used in the BitTorrent protocol: the process itself, file pieces, checksumming, and trackers (or trackerless via distributed hash tables). Our application is the equivalent to a BitTorrent client!</p>

<p><strong>Well done - we over-engineered a simple file-sharing problem and built BitTorrent from scratch.</strong> ðŸŽ‰</p>

<h3 id="aside-encouraging-good-behavior">Aside: Encouraging Good Behavior</h3>

<p>We didnâ€™t really cover a) how to select which clients we interact with and b) how to select which file pieces to get first, but these are both …</p></article></div></div>

August 30, 2020 | https://restofworld.org/2020/ycombinator-zoom-foreign-startups/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://restofworld.org/2020/ycombinator-zoom-foreign-startups/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Minutes before Nitthin Chandran was set to present his startup to a powerful group of foreign investors, the power went out in his apartment in Bangalore. The timing couldn’t have been worse: power outages are par for the course in the city, where Chandran was presenting remotely via Zoom, but there was life-changing money on the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chandran, the founder of <a href="https://www.medpiper.com/">MedPiper Technologies</a>, was pitching his Indian hospital-staffing startup for this year’s Demo Day. The two-day event is the culmination of Silicon Valley’s most well-known startup accelerator program, Y Combinator; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/these-are-the-top-y-combinator-companies-of-all-time-based-on-valuation/">notable program graduates</a> include Airbnb, Stripe, and DoorDash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stakes were high, so Chandran came prepared: his Y Combinator–appointed mentor had advised him to upgrade his internet speed and<strong> </strong>make ready multiple backup options for situations just like this one. Saved by a spare dongle he’d bought on sale at his local market, Chandran delivered his one-minute pitch to an unseen audience of high-powered investors and thousands of viewers, all from his apartment in Bangalore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In spite of the blackout, Chandran kept his cool: “We practiced maybe 100 times before Demo Day.”</p>



<p>For the first time in its 15-year history, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/">Y Combinator went fully remote</a> with its famed startup accelerator program. With the coronavirus pandemic making travel and in-person meetings nearly impossible, everything from workshops to the all-important Demo Day went online. The remote experience may have flattened the in-person interactions that drive some of the tech industry’s biggest deals. But founders from non-Western markets say that attending Y Combinator remotely didn’t hinder their success — in fact, it helped. Internet connectivity issues aside, foreign founders say the first fully remote Y Combinator has put these companies on a more equal footing with their American counterparts.</p>

<p>In pre-pandemic times, founders accepted to Y Combinator were flown to San Francisco, where they spent three months developing their startups <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/02/12/y-combinator-demo-days-2019-san-francisco.html">before presenting to funders at Demo Day</a>. For non-American founders with operations outside the United States, this often meant spending a full financial quarter away from their teams and home markets to attend workshops and networking events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You talk to other international founders, and they’re like, Oh yeah, I spent most of YC on a plane,” said Iain Usiri, a Tanzanian founder whose startup <a href="https://www.ramani.io/">Ramani</a> presented at last week’s Demo Day. By going remote, “The biggest logistical problem is solved,” he said. “You’re on par with a U.S. founder who is in his home market.”</p>



<p>Under normal circumstances, Usiri might’ve fretted over his outfit choice or physical gestures on Demo Day. “Personally, I do well on a stage,” he said. But this time, he and other founders in his class invested in backup internet, high-quality microphones, and new lighting, to ensure their Zoom presentations go as smoothly as possible. A remote presentation has its own anxieties: Usiri said he was so paranoid about power outages in his home in Tanzania, he had nightmares about it leading up to Demo Day. Nicolás López, co-founder of Justo, <a href="https://www.getjusto.com/">a Chilean food-delivery startup</a>, said he worried about competing with social media notifications and emails that might be popping up on investors’ screens during their demo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But logging onto Y Combinator from the comfort of their home markets meant founders could maintain their startups while benefiting from Y Combinator’s coveted mentorships. “Between when we applied for Y Combinator in March and today, we grew our team from 10 to 95,” said López. “I don’t think we would have been able to do that if we had been in Palo Alto for the past three months.”</p>



<p>In Bangalore, MedPiper’s Chandran, who is building a database of verified doctors and nurses in India, was able to take in-person meetings during the period. He said he signed up to 40,000 medical professionals during his time with Y Combinator. “We don’t think we would have done even 60 to 70% of the sales which we were able to close [had we been away],” Chandran told <em>Rest of World.</em> “All these sales were done in person, walking into hospitals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paradoxically, the remote nature of this year’s Y Combinator meant more face time between founders and partners. “I was asking for office hours all the time, sometimes three meetings a week with partners,” Arthur Alvarenga, founder of Brazilian startup <a href="https://chatpay.com.br/">ChatPay</a> said. “Everyone was very available, and with Zoom, things moved faster. You could get on a call faster than going to campus to meet with them if we were in person.”</p>

<p>Crucially, the pandemic has forced investors to consider any and all investments remotely; it’s leveled the playing field. Alvarenga, based in Brazil, might’ve missed out on chances for in-person meetings. But on Zoom, he’s just as remote as a founder in Boston. Both current and former non-Western Y Combinator participants said that funders are now more willing to take meetings and close deals over Zoom, where they once might have required an in-person meeting. Foreign founders in this batch of Demo Day presenters said they walked away from the event with more than 100 interested investors — far more than they could muster in their local markets.</p>



<p>Thomas Hellman, professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at Oxford’s Saïd Business School, said that the remote nature of today’s business environment has changed investor behavior, perhaps to the benefit of non-American founders.<strong> </strong>“Investors who said they would never invest unless they met a person have now written checks to entrepreneurs without meeting them,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a willingness to close deals over Zoom hasn’t changed some of the inherent challenges in raising money as a foreign startup. U.S.-based companies still constitute the majority of the Y Combinator batch: 39 of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/">197 startups participated</a> from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Hellman said that, in lieu of organic meetings and face-to-face interactions, venture capital firms are likely to rely on their own referral networks, which he said are essentially frozen during the pandemic. “The biggest thing to look out for is how networks are going to retrench,” he said. “That could lead to more privileged entrepreneurs having access to capital.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a more remote-friendly environment, Hellmann said foreign startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/22/foreign-startup-founders-face-unique-struggles-to-break-funding-barrier/">still face higher barriers to raising funds</a>. Local companies may still have an advantage, even if it’s a smaller one. “Just because Zoom is making this more democratized, it doesn’t change the fact that some investors are just not going to understand your market or want to invest outside the United States,” said Alvarenga. “And that’s a root problem.”</p>



<p>But for the half a dozen founders from this summer’s batch of presenters who spoke with <em>Rest of World, </em>internet outages and Zoom presentations were minor inconveniences compared to their otherwise positive Y Combinator experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The real value of YC is the network,” said Alvarenga. “The more quality people you put in, the better the network becomes.”</p>

			<p>The original Roman mile was 1000 paces (<em>milia passuum</em>), or 5000 feet. The modern mile was defined as 5280 feet under Queen Elizabeth at the end of the 16th century in order to reconcile multiple discordant measurement systems already in wide use. In particular, it was convenient to make it an even multiple of the sides of an acre, which since early medieval times was a rectangle 660 feet long and 66 feet wide. 660 divides neatly into 5280, eight ways, allowing a square mile (640 acres or a “section”) to be conveniently quartered three times over: into quarter sections (160 acres), sixteenth sections (40 acres), and finally the 10 acre squares (660 by 660 feet) that remain at the base of all US land surveys to this day.</p>

<p><em>Background: Many years ago, I became curious as to why, exactly, there are 5280 feet in a mile. The explanations I found online at the time weren’t very convincing. At the time I tried to make some fixes to parts of the puzzle in Wikipedia, but they frequently rejected as OR (original research). Eventually I wrote this article, since revised and updated several times. Since then, my “version” of things will occasionally drift to the #1 spot on Google or Bing, or both, when answering the specific question “why are there 5280 feet in a mile”. More often some SEO-optimized version will slip ahead, though it seems this article is holding steady in the top 3 or 4 at least. So hopefully pretty much everybody who cares about the details will find this. If you have any comments or questions (or corrections), please add to the comment section, I do (eventually) read all comments.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>I have yet to find an answer to the question that’s as thorough and complete as this one is. But I must caution that this article isn’t really up to academic standards and contains a non-trivial amount of speculation. Caveat Emptor, what follows is my theory of how the mile ended up with 5280 feet.</em></p>
<p>The conventional wisdom on this topic goes something like this: the mile was originally 5000 feet. It was changed to 5280 feet in Elizabethan times around the year 1600 (some point to 1592 and some to 1593) to accommodate the furlong, which was 660 feet. It was easier to fix the mile rather than the furlong for various reasons, hence, eight furlongs and 5280 feet in a mile.</p>
<p>That’s the standard story. It’ll be fleshed out with bells and whistles, including odd theories about horses etc, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>The problem with these versions is that they don’t explain why this collision between furlong and mile occurred around 1600, and not centuries before. It implies, therefore, that people suddenly woke up and realized, hey, wait a second, if there’s 660 feet in a furlong … and eight furlongs in a mile … but 5000 feet in a mile …. wait a second !?!</p>
<p>It somewhat implies that four-digit multiplication was invented ca 1600. Like a lot of rear-view-mirror takes on history, the “explanation” boils down to: “before time X people were stupid about topic Y, and at time Z they wizened up.”</p>
<p>Failing to find a good write-up of the origins, I’ve pieced together my own theory over the years. And it’s a fun one because the answer (or rather, hypothesis) is simply this: the number 5280 arises out of a collision between organized religion, the military, and taxation. Three powerful historical forces, to be sure, so the fourth pillar to modern society (rationality) obviously has to be the one to compromise!</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more: naked Greeks are involved, and Jesus, and Vikings. In that order.</p>
<p>Our story starts with the “original” mile, the Roman one (though there is indication the measurement is older still). The Romans were both practical and militant. Their mile was 1000 paces – a pace being a double step (left foot, right foot) by a soldier in full battle gear. That was a “<em>passus</em>“, and a mile was a “<em>milia passuum</em>“, hence the word “mile” (for “thousand”, as in the word <em>millennium)</em>.</p>
<p>If you are a runner or a hiker, you’ll know that we still remember this information in our convention of relating pedometers to miles: about 2000 steps to a mile. But we have forgotten that it’s not a “trick”, it’s the whole point. Language use changes back and forth over time, and today we’re more likely to use the word “step” rather than “pace”, hence, we can think of a mile as being defined as 2000 steps.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Romans had another convention, that you’ve probably heard of, which was to place stones next to their roads to mark the distance from Rome. Called “<em>milliarium</em>“, these stone obelisks were first erected along the Via Appia, where milestones dating as far back as the second century BC still survive. Naturally, quite a large number of these stones survived along roads throughout Europe, providing a natural reference point, explaining why their particular measure of a “foot” survives with high accuracy. The central stone in Rome, from which the phrase “all roads lead to Rome” derives, wasn’t erected until some two centuries later in 20 BC, but is since lost.</p>
<p>It’s worth injecting that the popular notion that Roman roads all had measures of the distance from Rome is a myth: only central Italy and a few exceptions were marked from central Rome, all other roads were measured from the nearest local significant center. The US’ attempt to replicate this myth with the Zero Mile marker in Washington, DC, in 1792 would have a similar destiny, influencing only measurements nearby. Instead a similar variation (measuring from something local and significant) lives on in the mile markers of the interstate highway system, where the numbering typically starts at either the southern or the western state line and increasing as you drive in the other direction.</p>
<p>Curiously, we know very little of the details of how the Roman army used the mile as a practical tool – not a single significant military treatise has survived from Roman times. The that has, the <em>Epitoma rei militaris,</em> is unfortunately not considered authoritative. Thus its claims cannot be checked against any other contemporary sources, which is particularly irksome since some of them appear highly dubious – such as stating that the army marched 20 miles in 5 summer hours at regular pace and 24 miles at double pace.</p>
<p>You can experiment yourself to realize that the miles per hour measure is practical for a human: casual walking is 2 mph, an easy walk is 3, swift walking is 4. The available number of hours in a day is similarly small, thus making the mental arithmetic simple.</p>
<p>Hence, 5000 feet to the mile, a general measure that survived throughout Europe as roadside reminders of the might of Rome.</p>
<p>Now, switching tracks, about the furlong. It means “a furrow long” (long as a furrow) and is a practical measure in an agrarian society: it is (approximately) the distance an oxen can plow without resting. That distance was standardized to be 40 “rods”, where a rod (or “pole”) is today defined as 5.5 yards (16.5 feet), though it was probably originally 20 feet (we’ll get back to all this).</p>
<p>An “acre” (which means “field”) was 40 rods long and 4 rods wide (4 rods was also called a “chain”, more on that below). An acre was thus the surface area that one man and a team of oxen could till in one day. It was long and narrow because of the development of the heavy plough around the end of the 10th century, which turned the soil over, revolutionizing agriculture in northern Europe where the clay-heavy soil (vs sandier south European soil) went from being a handicap to an asset, in fact contributing significantly to the eventual inversion of economic power in Europe from the south to the north.</p>
<p>At this point, if you’re paying close attention, you’ll see that not only do we have the decimal (base 10) concept in the “mile” (one thousand paces), but also in the acre: the proportions of the sides are exactly 10:1. That’s because “acre” dates back to “10 square chains”, or an area that’s one “chain” wide and ten long. A “chain” in turn is four rods. The word “chain” comes from how this convenient measurement tool was constructed. Organic materials (wood, rope) have obvious problems in retaining precise dimensions, despite efforts to wax or otherwise treat them. A marked improvement therefore came from carrying a set of thin metal rods, that eventually would be “chained” together. Most surveying in the United States was done in the 1700s and 1800s using a standardized 100-link chain of 66 feet in total length.</p>
<p>But this was a more modern innovation. Going much further back in history it seems likely the basic approach was instead to carry a long, thin, metal “rod” that was 16 feet long, seems likely to me that they were in parts. This is still today a common surveying tool – search Amazon for “surveyor rod” and you’ll find the modern version, now made of telescoping aluminum and generally 16 feet long. We’ll get back to why it was 16 feet (and not 10 or 20), and how it later on became 16.5.</p>
<p>This tradition of the furlong (ten chains) took root in England between the fall of Rome and the Norman conquest of 1066, along the aforementioned adoption of heavy ploughs. With the Normans came the re-introduction of the Roman definition of the foot as 12 inches. A reference foot was thusly carved into one of the pier bases of the new nave in St Paul’s cathedral in London in 1104 (by the son of a banker, interestingly enough).</p>
<p>The Saxon tradition of measuring land had been established in terms of rods, and as we alluded above, probably based on 20 “natural” feet – i.e. not Roman standard feet but “real” 9.8-inch feet. The number 20, of course, was the common “decimal” system prior to the invention of shoes (at which point you can’t see your toes). Also, the technique of counting to 20 with one hand may have been prevalent. Vestiges of base-20 remain, notably for our story, in Danish and French. For example, in French you say “soixante-dix” for 70 and in Danish you say …</p></div></div>

A lot has changed since I last published my post on handling long-running async tasks in Python using celery. Last time we used it to run a few async tasks to fetch data from some service which took around 1-5 minutes. You can read more about it in the post below.</p>

Although I will still use celery for these types of long-running tasks, there is a subset of tasks that are better handled inside the execution thread itself. Today we will discuss a way of handling such operations.</p>

<p>
To the people who know me, I switched to a new role which allowed me to write Node.js over a year ago and I have been working on it since then. During my time working and building APIs using it, I have started falling for the way in which Node handles Async behavior and long-running tasks.</p>
<p>
The idea is simple, if the task is waiting for some IO, we can run some other task in the mean-time. Only the part that needs it, will wait for it.</p><p>
I wanted to use the same concept in Python. Fortunately, in Python version <code>3.4</code>, they have introduced <code>asyncio</code> for the same purpose. In this post, we are going to talk a little about it and try to understand its importance.</p><p>
By the end of the post, you will be able to understand the importance of async functions and will be able to start using them into your codebase.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h2><p>
I am using <code>Python 3.8</code> for this tutorial and you might want to use the same to run and try out the examples. You can try them <a href="https://www.python.org/shell/">online as well</a>.</p>
<h2 id="basic-async-function-in-python">Basic async function in Python</h2><p>
This is how we write a basic async function in Python.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>func1</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 1: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>

<span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>func1</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>Response</strong></p>
<p>
You have to start by importing the <code>asyncio</code> module.</p><p>
Async functions are defined just like a normal function, you just have to add the keyword, <code>async</code>. If you want to wait for the execution of some <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#coroutines">coroutine</a>, you have to use the keyword, <code>await</code>.</p><p>
Finally, you can run the function using <code>asyncio.run</code> method.</p>
<blockquote>
Anytime you use the await keyword inside the async function, the thread will not move forward until we get a response from the called function.
</blockquote><p>
This simple implementation will not help you understand the advantage of using async functions. In the next section, we will talk about the time taken for the execution and there you will really start to see the difference.</p>
<h2 id="time-taken-for-the-full-execution">Time taken for the full execution</h2><p>
To understand the benefits of using <code>async</code> functions, we will compare the time taken to run the same code in <code>async</code> and <code>sync</code> behavior.</p><p>
Letâ€™s first write the async code.</p>

I have defined 4 different functions doing almost the same thing. Letâ€™s assume there is a long-running function called <code>async_sleep</code> which is doing some IO operation. For example: Fetching data from the database.</p>
<blockquote>
<code>asyncio.gather()</code> is used to run the tasks passed to it concurrently.
</blockquote><p>
The response after running this code is as follows.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>4</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span>
<span>Completed</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span> <span>1.1852593421936035</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The function completes the execution somewhere between 1-2 seconds for every execution. (Ran it 5 times to check).</p><p>
Now letâ€™s try to run the <code>sync</code> version of the same code.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>time</span>
<span>start</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span>


<span>def</span> <span>sync_sleep</span><span>():</span>

    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 1: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
    <span>sync_sleep</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>


<span>def</span> <span>func2</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 2: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>))</span>
    <span>sync_sleep</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span>


<span>def</span> <span>func3</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 3: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>3</span><span>))</span>
    <span>sync_sleep</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>3</span>


<span>def</span> <span>func4</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 4: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span><span>))</span>
    <span>sync_sleep</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span>


<span>def</span> <span>main</span><span>():</span>
    <span>func1</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>func2</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>func3</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>func4</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Completed after: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>start</span><span>))</span>

<span>main</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The response that we got after executing this was:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>4</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span>
<span>Completed</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span> <span>4.168870687484741</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
This saved us <code>~3</code> seconds for executing 4 functions. Now if we wanted to run 10000 such functions, we would save ourselves <code>~2000</code> seconds/ i.e. <code>35-40</code> minutes.</p><p>
Thatâ€™s awesome, right.</p><p>
Even if we are just running 2-3 such functions in each iteration these small savings can be very important to provide better user experience to your customers.</p><p>
Now that we have understood the advantage of using <code>async</code> functions, we must know a few more things about it.</p>
<h2 id="order-of-execution-for-async-functions">Order of execution for async functions</h2><p>
We should understand that while running the functions in async mode, we donâ€™t really know about the order in which functions are executed. Letâ€™s understand the concept with an example.</p><p>
The functions will return as soon as the execution is completed.</p><p>
We can mock the different execution time by sleeping for a random time between 0 and 1 using, <code>random.randint(0, 10) * 0.1</code>.</p><p>
Here is the full code.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>

<span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>main</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The response to the following code is,</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>completed</span> <span>func</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span>
<span>completed</span> <span>func</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span>

<h2 id="practical-usage">Practical Usage</h2><p>
After the release of Python 3.8, which moved the <code>asyncio.run()</code> method to stable API, you can start using it without any problem.</p><p>
The only issue with moving from a <code>synchronous</code> approach to an async one, is to change the way of thinking about the problems. You have to change the way you think about every little detail. Once you reach that point of thinking in terms of async functions, believe me, you will love it.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work-under-the-hood">How does it work under the hood?</h2><p>
Letâ€™s check the type of the async function.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span><span>(</span><span>main</span><span>())</span>

<span># &lt;class 'coroutine'&gt;
</span></code></pre></div></div><p>
So, the async function is of type <code>coroutine</code>.</p><p>
This <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/coroutine-in-python/">GeeksForGeeks article</a> does a very good job of explaining coroutines.</p><p>
To sum up what they wrote in the post, <strong>subroutines</strong> are the set of instructions that have one entry point and are executed serially.</p><p>
On the other hand, <strong>Coroutines</strong> can suspend or give away the control to other Coroutines, allowing multiple tasks to run at the same time.</p><p>
Python uses this concept to allow async behavior.</p>
<h2 id="handling-timeout-in-async-functions">Handling timeout in async functions</h2><p>
It is necessary to have a timeout for waiting for the task to get completed. We are not supposed to wait forever for it to complete. <code>asyncio</code> also provided the ability to add a timeout to the async function so that you can skip the execution before its completion.</p><p>
A practical application of this can be a case when you are calling a third party API in your application and the third party itself is down. In that case, you donâ€™t want to wait for a long time.</p><p>
You can use the <code>timeout</code> method to solve your problem. See the code for example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>async_sleep</span><span>():</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'Execution completed'</span><span>)</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>main</span><span>():</span>
    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>wait_for</span><span>(</span><span>async_sleep</span><span>(),</span> <span>timeout</span><span>=</span><span>1.0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>except</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>TimeoutError</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'Timeout error'</span><span>)</span>

<span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>main</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The async function will raise <code>TimeoutError</code> if the coroutine doesnâ€™t return before the given <code>timeout</code> is passed.</p><p>
Response after executing the above code is</p>
<p>
There are other awesome methods in the <code>asyncio</code> module.</p><p>
You can check them at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html">pythonâ€™s official website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>
If you want to provide a better and faster experience to your users, you can start using the <code>asyncio</code> module in your application. This will definitely help you find cases in which you can reduce the execution time of your API or whatever else that you are doing.</p><p>
Just forcing yourself to write in this way for a few months can yield big returns in the future.</p>

<p>Most people are familiar with central banks’ ability to create money out of thin air. A central bank has access to physical printing presses which can produce physical banknotes, and it has the corresponding ability to create electronic money. However, central banks are not the only entities which create money. Money is also created by regular banks, such as retail banks and commercial banks, in the process of making loans.</p>
<p>Many people believe that regular banks’ ability to create money is similar to central banks’ ability to create money. It is not. This misconception has been perpetuated by a powerful cast of characters which includes <a href="https://www.hs.fi/tiede/art-2000002869261.html" target="_blank">mainstream news outlets</a> and even <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070" target="_blank">some economists</a>.</p>
<p>This article will demystify money creation by illustrating the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bank deposit is merely an IOU.</li>
<li>A bank loan is merely an exchange of 2 IOUs.</li>
<li>Anyone can create IOUs out of thin air.</li>
<li>When a customer redeems an IOU at a bank, the bank typically needs to hand over another form of money — the kind that it cannot create out of thin air.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bank deposits are merely IOUs</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have $100 in cash. You decide to deposit it at your local bank. Now you no longer have $100 in cash. Instead, you have a <em>promise</em> from the bank that you can withdraw $100 in cash at any time. The bank has $100 in cash and you have a promise. Let’s imagine this promise as a physical document acknowledging debt, an IOU (”I owe you”). The bank owes you $100 and promises that you can exchange this IOU to $100 cash at any time.</p>

<p>Is this IOU ”money”? We’ll get to that later, but the short answer is yes, that IOU is money. There are different types of money, and checking account deposits are usually considered to be a type of money.</p>
<p>Let’s illustrate this bank deposit as an exchange:</p>

<p>Assets are things the bank <em>owns</em>, liabilities are things the bank <em>owes</em>. In this simplified example, the only asset that the bank has is the $100 in cash that you deposited — now considered to be the <em>bank’s</em> asset — and the only liability is the $100 debt that the bank owes to you. These accounting entries were created at the same time: when the bank incremented your checking account by $100 (the deposit liability in bank’s accounting), there was a corresponding $100 cash deposit (the cash asset in bank’s accounting).</p>
<p><strong>A bank loan is merely an exchange of 2 IOUs</strong></p>
<p>Let’s continue with the example where you deposited $100 to a bank. Suppose I will go into that bank and ask for a $10 loan. Now that the bank owns $100, it can easily afford to loan me $10. I promise to pay back $11 at a later point in time, so the bank is eager to offer me a loan and make that dollar.</p>
<p>The bank deposits this $10 loan to my checking account. Remember, checking account deposits are IOUs, so the bank just gave me a $10 IOU. I promised to pay back $11, so I also created an IOU. In other words, this loan is an exchange of 2 IOUs: the bank promises to give me $10 in cash whenever I want, and I promise to give the bank $11 at a later point in time. Let’s imagine these IOUs as physical documents:</p>

<p>The bank still has that $100 cash in assets, and it still has that $100 liability to John. But now the bank also has a $10 liability to me: I could withdraw my $10 from the bank in cash at any time. Corresponding to this liability, the bank has recorded a new asset: my promise to pay back $11 later.</p>
<p>Notice how the bank now has $110 of deposits, but only $100 of cash in the vault. Welcome to fractional reserve banking! If I decided to withdraw my $10 from the bank today, and you decided to withdraw your $100 from the bank tomorrow, the bank would say ”oops, we no longer have your money”. In practice this rarely happens due to a myriad of reasons (banks can trade assets between each other when they have too little/too much cash, banks have internal risk controls which limit lending and other risky endeavours, lawmakers impose restrictions which are monitored by regulators, the existence of deposit insurance reduces likelihood of bank runs, etc.).</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s get to the interesting bit. Before taking out the loan there was $100 on checking account balances and afterwards there was $110 on checking account balances. Clearly, money was created in the process of taking out the loan. Where did this money come from? Was it created out of thin air? The short answer is yes, kind of, but let’s step back a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>What is money, anyway?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s go back to the cash deposit example. You deposit $100 into a bank and the bank records it as an asset. The bank records a corresponding liability: a $100 deposit to your checking account. Did the bank create money in this scenario?</p>
<p>Before the deposit there was $100 of cash money, but after the deposit there was $100 of cash money + $100 of electronic money = $200 worth of money in total. But of course we don’t want to ”double count” your money just because you deposited it in a bank, right? That’s why economists developed this convention that cash money in a bank’s vault is considered to be ”out of circulation”, and thus, is not typically counted when we count how much money exists.</p>

<p>The Eurozone M1 definition for money is <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money_credit_banking/monetary_aggregates/html/hist_content.en.html" target="_blank">basically</a> equal to this notion of ”currency in circulation”. The concept of money is ambiguous, so there are many different definitions, varying by both economic area and by use case. Nevertheless, checking account balances are included in most commonly used definitions (though not in all, for instance the UK M0 definition for money <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/details/further-details-about-m0-data" target="_blank">does not</a> include checking account balances).</p>
<p>In abstract terms we might think that the $100 cash you deposited into a bank was transformed into a $100 checking account balance. Except it wasn’t. That $100 of cash money still exists. It was not transformed into anything. The bank took $100 of cash and put it in a vault. Then the bank created an IOU out of thin air and gave it to you. (We can say that the IOU was created out of thin air, because the corresponding $100 cash in the vault is not earmarked to this IOU — the bank may run out of cash before you try to redeem that IOU.) Then economists decided that the IOU counts as money, and the cash in the vault does not count as money. Thus, the act of depositing cash in a bank does not result in (net) creation of money. $100 of electronic money is added to circulation while $100 of cash money is removed from circulation, for a net difference of $0.</p>
<p>When you deposit cash in a bank, the bank creates an IOU out of thin air. Similarly, when you take a loan out of a bank, the bank creates an IOU out of thin air. However, due to accounting conventions, the latter action results in net money creation, while the former action does not. (Although these conventions are weird, they make sense: currency in circulation is a good measure with real implications for economic activity, and currency in circulation is genuinely increased when banks loan money.)</p>
<p><strong>Anyone can create IOUs out of thin air</strong></p>
<p>If there’s only one thing you take away from this article, let it be this. IOUs are promises. Anyone can make promises out of thin air. For example, I could be handing out IOUs like this, furbished with my signature for authenticity:</p>

<p>You might think these would be worthless, but that’s not exactly the case. People who know me would think ”Atte is good for $10”. These would not be worth exactly $10, because you would still rather take $10 in cash than a coupon that’s exchangeable for $10 in cash. And it’s unlikely that these IOUs would be used to facilitate real economic activity, so these IOUs should not be considered ”money”. Although there are clear differences in how these IOUs <em>would be used</em>, compared to the IOUs created by banks, is there any <em>fundamental</em> difference between the IOUs themselves?</p>
<p>Let’s take another example and get one step closer to creating money. This one is real, not hypothetical, example of IOUs created by a non-bank corporation.</p>
<p>We have to go all the way back to 2011. Poker is booming and Full Tilt Poker is one of 2 giants dominating the scene (the other being PokerStars). The way that poker sites work is you deposit money (like you would in a bank) and then as you play poker and you win and lose money from other players, the poker site keeps track of how much money everyone has (like a bank would keep track of transfers between customers of the same bank).</p>
<p>In other words, a poker site issues IOUs to players. These IOUs are supposedly redeemable at any time (like the IOUs created by a bank). The IOUs created by Full Tilt Poker were largely treated as money by players of the site, to the point where they were used to facilitate real economic activity. For example, it was typical for players to settle small debts (like $10 for a movie ticket) by sending a player-to-player transfer on Full Tilt Poker instead of sending a bank transfer (because transfers on poker sites were typically faster and easier to make than bank transfers).</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, the IOUs created by Full Tilt Poker were money. They simply were not counted as money due to accounting conventions. Now, some of you might be thinking <em>”Wait a minute… Doesn’t the poker site have all player funds in the bank? If all player funds have corresponding bank deposits, then those bank deposits would already be counted as money, and we wouldn’t want to double count that money.”</em> Yeah, I also thought that Full Tilt Poker had player funds in the bank (can you guess where this is going?).</p>
<p>On April 15, 2011, known in the poker world as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Scheinberg" target="_blank">Black Friday</a>, the FBI raided offices of Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars as part of a larger crackdown on online gambling. This law enforcement action triggered an instant bank run by players: everyone …</p></div></div></div>

<p>With the increased amount of time I’ve spent in my apartment over the last few months and my new found electronics hobby, I thought it’d be fun to try and automate my studio apartment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a picture of the apartment (above) in all of it’s 450 square foot glory. </p>



<p>I spend most of my time in the area with my desk, bed, sofa, and television. So, it made sense to focus on making this area as comfortable and usable as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take note of the robotic vacuum cleaner, the standing fan, and the television. I use these devices daily, but more importantly, they all respond to IR signals.</p>



<p>Consequently, I knew if I could decode the signal their IR remotes were sending, I’d be able to create a circuit that could broadcast an identical signal thereby controlling the device. Additionally, with an Amazon Alexa integration, I’d conceivably be able to make all of these devices voice-controlled.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Demo</h2>



<p>Here’s a brief demo of the finished project. If you’re interested in seeing the circuit, code, and other implementation details, read on! Not only can I control my TV through Alexa, but also my standing fan and my robot vacuum cleaner. </p>



<figure><p>

<p>Here’s a demo of the fan. Triggering the sleep timer command cycles through the different delay options until the 1, 2, and 4 hour options are all enabled. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Finally, here’s a demo of the robot cleaner returning to the home station when the “dock” command is triggered. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h2>Implementation</h2>



<p>The first step was identifying the correct IR codes to send which was by far the most involved part of this project. I had seen some other examples online of people trying to reverse engineer the IR codes their remote controls were sending and they were getting back a single clear value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t so lucky. Any remote control key I pressed would give me a slew of possible signal codes – not just one discrete value. </p>



<p>So, in order to find the correct one, I’d press the button I was trying to decode a few times to build up a potential list of valid IR signals. Then, I’d programmatically loop through them slowly to try and identify which IR signal was actually triggering the device. </p>



<blockquote><p>Figuring out what IR encoding the signals were using was another time and research-intensive task.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Here’s the schematic for the IR receiver:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9aIHnUoDInPSudNujmBCmDYByZtYpPrH8BlIoplioo65dvTrtOjfLCUuR3TtyPTuCDumUsERv2tS1FzRuXFZjUmZgkSg8sF2G2Sp0Mh9wuFjmTXxU3RdjseWvq0N9dgRimRriktr" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>The final circuit is rather simple – an ESP8266 (for WiFi capabilities), a PN2222 transistor, and two IR LEDs. You certainly don’t need 2 IR LEDs, but I wanted greater coverage in the apartment and I had some parts to spare. </p>



<p>You can easily find the parts on Amazon and they’re all just soldered to a spare piece of perfboard.</p>



<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JyV0pAaK6x43Sfc4dHxRnqnMbKefIvrq3aYbgWemNlb22-Bc6VTeGZM-2RPrdC5DaH6xXPZEan9rVfp-V07plvFNwAiNoBELJK1SzJ2k0T7rxlg5dHMmCPN7r3NQhxNmpvs9HeLA" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>



<p>Though it’s hard to tell in the photo, the two IR LEDs are angled slightly away from one another to increase coverage of the apartment. </p>

<blockquote><p>A few tips if you’re trying to replicate this yourself. </p><p>For a while, I was getting a lot of noise or absolutely no IR values back at all from the IR receiver. I realized that the ambient light was interfering with the IR receiver. So, the simplest solution was just to hide the circuit and the remote control under a blanket while trying to record IR signals to eliminate any noise from ambient light.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Make sure to replace the placeholders in the following code. This code is meant for an ESP8266, but should also be compatible with an ESP32. &nbsp;There’s certainly cleaner ways of writing this code, but my focus was on creating a proof of concept. </p>







<blockquote><p>For the “clean up” and “dock” commands, I repeat the signal at regular intervals in the hopes that the robot vacuum cleaner is in the line of sight of the circuit at one of those time intervals. Unlike all of the other devices, the location of the robot isn’t static.</p></blockquote>



<p>Now, I had a circuit that was capable of controlling the main devices in my apartment. The next step was the Alexa integration. </p>



<h2>Alexa Integration</h2>



<p>The first issue I ran into was how to establish a connection between the Alexa and the ESP8266. Both were on the same local network, but I couldn’t find a way of setting up Alexa to make a local web request. Initially, it seemed like configuring port forwarding on my router was the only option and I wasn’t too keen on doing that. </p>



<p>Eventually, after a bit more research, I realized that Alexa could talk to <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IFTTT</a> and that IFTTT had an <a href="http://adafruit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adafruit</a> integration. This meant I could use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MQTT</a> protocol to pass commands from Alexa to my circuit through Adafruit.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The MQTT protocol, in essence, is a publisher/subscriber model often used by IoT devices. In this use case, Alexa would publish different messages (turn on tv, turn on fan, clean up) and the circuit would subscribe to Alexa’s broadcast and trigger the correct IR signal.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Tutorial</h2>



<p>If you’re interested in replicating this same flow, start off by <a href="http://io.adafruit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">creating a free Adafruit account.</a></p>



<p>Once you’re logged in, go to Feeds and create a new Feed. In my case, I titled it <code>smartStudio</code>.  This Feed will be a running list of all messages sent to this topic over the MQTT protocol. As you can see, a log of all the voice commands I’ve used in the last month appear in this Feed.</p>

<p>Click on <code>This</code> and select Amazon Alexa. Then, select the Alexa “say a specific phrase” integration.</p>



<blockquote><p>You’ll be asked to complete a small authorization flow if this is the first time you’re integrating these services.</p></blockquote>



<p>Now, whenever we say the phrase we define here, Alexa will trigger the “that” portion of your IFTTT integration.</p>

<p>Now, we can send a message to our Adafruit Feed with a custom payload, in this case <code>hbo</code>. All that’s remaining is to handle this case in the code and fire off the right IR signal.</p>



<p>Once you’ve created a few more triggers, your IFTTT dashboard should look something like this: </p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>



<p>Because the MQTT framework doesn’t guarantee delivery of a message, sometimes I would give Alexa a command, but the ESP8266 chip would never receive it. </p>



<p>It’s a fairly rare occurrence and since Adafruit doesn’t allow me to customize the quality of service settings for the MQTT implementation, there’s no immediate solution to this problem.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>Some finishing touches</h2>



<p>Now, we’re on the home stretch. We’re able to issue a command to Alexa, which gets forwarded to IFTTT, then to Adafruit, and finally to my circuit which sends out the correct IR signal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The final issue, however, was that even though saying “Alexa, trigger clean up” and having my robot vacuum cleaner spin up was pretty cool, I really disliked the sound of the robot bumping into everything as it cleaned. The noise is very noticeable in such a small apartment. </p>



<p>Eventually, I stumbled upon the “Routines” feature in the Amazon Alexa iOS app which allowed me to set up a few location-based triggers. </p>



<p>So, whenever I left my apartment, Alexa would trigger the “clean up” command. The robot would start up, and then 15 minutes later, Alexa would trigger the “dock” routine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, my apartment would consistently stay clean and I wouldn’t have to hear the robot bumping around everywhere. Additionally,&nbsp; I added another routine that monitored my location to detect when I was heading back to my apartment and would preempt the cleaning with a “dock” command.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Solving first world problems, I know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a more useable experience, I’d also recommend enabling “follow up” mode (allows you to issue multiple commands at once) and “brief responses” on Alexa.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve had this installed for a couple months, I wanted to see how often I actually used it. After pulling the logs from Adafruit, I’ve used this over 800 times in this month alone [August 2020], an average of almost 30 times a day.</p>

    <h2>Good Software Engineers Are Rare</h2>
<p>Good software engineers are rare. There are many reasons as to why. The most obvious reason is that to become a good software developer one has to master many skills (language proficiency, documentation literacy, debugging, text editing, architecture, and design, etc, etc). Because these are the obvious barriers to becoming good, there is an abundance of advice out there for young engineers on how to hone their skills. Most of this advice is either uninteresting, inefficient, or both. Why? Because the process of mastering a skill is typically independent of the skill being mastered. The process is almost always as simple as: learn (read technical material), practice (daily), have patience.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, mastering the skills is not enough to become a good engineer. If it were, the good software engineer would be no rarer than the hardworking, motivated engineer. Having the essential hard/technical skills mastered is only the start. To become great, the software engineer must adopt a mindset that often operates in opposition to the philosophical structure of the western world.</p>
<h2>Software Products Are Unique</h2>
<p>My development as an engineer began outside of the software world. I studied electrical engineering where I spent countless hours of my life in the lab: designing circuits, prototyping on breadboards, acid bathing PCBs. All of these efforts led to a finished, permanent product. Whether it be a power supply I could plug my computer into, a multimeter, an antenna, or some mostly useless gadget, I always had something I could hold in my hands that gave me a sense of pride and satisfaction. Productive societal activity tends to operate similarly. There is the expectation of tangible end results, and the success of an activity or task is contingent on the end result. For example, there are few companies or teams that do not set KRs (key results) each quarter, half, year. Developing software products, peskily enough, is decidedly unlike this. A software product is ephemeral. It can't be held or touched. There is no definitive "end result" or "finished product". What's more, the work done is impermanent. These traits aren't just unique, they clash with many fundamental expectations about the way we believe work/productive activity should behave. Whether consciously or subconsciously all good software engineers have had to internalize some sort of framework to allow themselves to reckon with this cognitive dissonance.</p>
<h2>Look To The East</h2>
<p>So what must a software engineer do if they can't rely on societal norms of the west to help them build the skills, temperance, and mindset to become competent, productive, and successful? They must <a href="https://www.theculturium.com/hermann-hesse-the-journey-to-the-east/">look to the east</a>. The western concepts that the software engineer must cast aside are:</p>
<pre><code> attachment
 permanence
 duality
 reason
</code></pre>

<p>The philosophy of Zen Buddhism rejects these cornerstones of western life. So it is in the delightful riddles/stories that the Zen Buddhists call <a href="http://www.ashidakim.com/zenkoans/zenindex.html">Koans</a> that we might look for answers. The following are three of my favourite Koans that have been helpful on my path to becoming that rare and golden, madly productive, madly exact engineer.</p>
<h2>Non-Attachment</h2>
<pre><code>"Kitano Gempo, Abbot of Eihei temple, was ninety-two years old when he passed away in the year 1933. He endeavored his whole life not to be attached to anything. As a wandering mendicant when he was twenty he happened to meet a traveler who smoked tobacco. As they walked together down a mountain road, they stopped under a tree to rest. The traveler offered Kitano a smoke, which he accepted, as he was very hungry at the time.

"How pleasant this smoking is," he commented. The other gave him an extra pipe and tobacco and they parted.

Kitano felt: "Such pleasant things may disturb meditation. Before this goes too far, I will stop now." So he threw the smoking outfit away.

When he was twenty-three years old he studied I-King, the most profound doctrine of the universe. It was winter at the time and he needed some heavy clothes. He wrote his teacher, who lived a hundred miles away, telling him of his need, and gave the letter to a traveler to deliver. Almost the whole winter passed and neither answer nor clothes arrived. So Kitano resorted to the prescience of I-King, which also teaches the art of divination, to determine whether or not his letter had miscarried. He found that this had been the case. A letter afterward from his teacher made no mention of clothes.

"If I perform such accurate determinative work with I-King, I may neglect my meditation," felt Kitano. So he gave up this marvelous teaching and never resorted to its powers again.

When he was twenty-eight he studied Chinese calligraphy and poetry. He grew so skillful in these arts that his teacher praised him. Kitano mused: "If I don't stop now, I'll be a poet, not a Zen teacher." So he never wrote another poem. "
</code></pre>

<p>In this koan, Kitano displays an ability that every software engineer should find enviable: a relentless non-attachment to all things outside of the pursuit of Zen. A software project is in constant flux. So is the state of tools, technology, and frameworks in the field. There is a serious lack of permanence in software development, and the best way to cope with that impermanence is to become a solid practitioner of non-attachment.</p>
<p>The inability for ICs to remain unattached to particular pieces of work completed, or particular technologies is probably one of the most common and detrimental problems software development teams encounter. Features that have had blood, sweat, and tears poured into them but do not serve a purpose fail to get removed, technologies invested in that end up being duds do not get replaced. All of this results in projects and companies suffering major setbacks. Ben Horowitz frames the problem well in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18176747-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things">The Hard Things about Hard Things</a>: "Early in my career as an engineer, I'd learned that all decisions were objective until the first line of code is written. After that, all decisions were emotional." The less attached a team of engineers is to their own work, the less emotional the decisions about a project will be. Good engineers are happy to delete their own code. A leaner code base is an easier codebase to work in. Good engineers are excited when a teammate finds a more robust, easier-to-work-with solution to the problem they have been working on. They don't create inertia and waste time by resisting switching to that solution, no matter how much work they have sunk into their own implementation. Good engineers are like Kitano.</p>
<h2>It Will Pass</h2>
<pre><code>A student went to his meditation teacher and said, "My meditation is horrible! I feel so distracted, or my legs ache, or I'm constantly falling asleep. It's just horrible!"

"It will pass," the teacher said matter-of-factly.

A week later, the student came back to his teacher. "My meditation is wonderful! I feel so aware, so peaceful, so alive! It's just wonderful!'

"It will pass," the teacher replied matter-of-factly.
</code></pre>

<p>Mmm, such a beautiful dialogue. Reading it quells the destructive flames of pride and ego that flare-up in my stomach whenever I am on a productive kick. Many engineers thrive off of the energy of this fire, but it can be dangerous if untempered. Engineers, it has been said, are natural optimists. Engineers are also, I will posit, naturally prideful. When they are assigned a project or ticket and are asked to estimate how long it will take, they almost certainly will imagine themselves at their most productive when making the estimate. This results in the unenlightened engineer wreaking no small havoc on the logistics of managing a project. No engineer is at their most productive at all times; the productive fervor of a great session is fickle. The engineers who assess their own skills and compare themselves to their colleagues as if they are, hurt themselves and their team. They stunt their growth (by believing they are already outperforming all their colleagues), are hard to manage, and are hard to work with.</p>
<p>Recently, while working on extending our application's backend to be accessible via a GraphQL API, I came across a few blogposts by an engineer named Marc-Andre Giroux. Clearly, a quite talented engineer, I noticed a neat little feature on his <a href="http://mgiroux.me/">site's homepage</a>. As a play on the 10x engineer motif, he describes himself as an "Nx platform interface engineer", the N flitting randomly between decimal numbers from 0 to 10. Marc-Andre is clearly a talented engineer, yet is zen enough to appreciate that he is not always in the state of ultra-productive. Admittedly, sometimes he is even less than 1x engineer. He understands "It will pass" and is most likely a factor in his success.</p>
<p>Avoiding overestimation of yourself is not the only lesson to be learned. This koan helps me to avoid taking productive times for granted. Understanding that quieter seas and lulls in productivity and focus may be just around the corner is good motivation to keep pushing for more while you are in the zone. Zen has taught me to never let a good session go to waste.</p>
<p>Finally, this koan helps me during the unproductive and unfocused times as well. I often experience a quite intense physical aching and pain during those hours where I can't seem to get any code written, or worse when I can only seem to produce poor, convoluted, messy solutions. Knowing that such a state is somewhat inevitable and that It Will Pass, is a medicative and constructive mindset to have.</p>
<h2>First There is a Mountain</h2>
<pre><code>At the first level on the path, he saw mountains as mountains and rivers as rivers.

On the second level of the path, he saw that mountains are not mountains and rivers are not rivers.

And at a third level, he saw once again mountains were mountains and rivers were rivers.

<p>This koan is a description of the Zen student <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-zen/#OveDua">overcoming dualism</a>. In Zen, the idea is called "Not Two". The student first sees the river as discrete from the mountains. The student then sees that …</p></div></div>

	<p>During my years as a software engineer, I got exposed to more and more
data-based projects where data engineering and model research were
major aspects of the system.</p>

<p>Over time, one main pattern became apparent: the functional programming
paradigm helps a lot when working with data-oriented systems.</p>

<p>For a regular data scientist or a data engineer, they will be quite familiar
with ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines. However, not all data scientists
and data engineers are familiar with functional programming and its
benefits.</p>



<p>I’ll remind again, that according to Uncle Bob, 
the essence of functional programming is that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Variables in functional languages do not vary</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Functional programming is disciple imposed upon variable assignment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that each return a value, rather than a sequence of imperative statements that change the state of the program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, you can assign variables a new value, but existing values cannot change.</p>

<p>A few examples:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># BAD
</span><span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'c'</span><span>:</span> <span>'value'</span><span>}</span>
<span>my_var</span><span>[</span><span>'b'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'new_value'</span>
<span># or 
</span><span>my_var</span><span>[</span><span>'c'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'new_value'</span>

<span># GOOD
</span>
<span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'c'</span><span>:</span> <span>'value'</span><span>}</span>
<span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>my_var</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>=</span><span>'new_value'</span><span>)</span>

<span># or
</span><span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'c'</span><span>:</span> <span>'new_value'</span><span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>using functions</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># BAD
</span><span>def</span> <span>my_function</span><span>(</span><span>input_dict</span><span>):</span>
    <span>input_dict</span><span>[</span><span>'new_value'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'var'</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>True</span>

<span># GOOD
</span><span>def</span> <span>my_function</span><span>(</span><span>input_dict</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>input_dict</span><span>,</span> <span>new_value</span><span>=</span><span>'var'</span><span>)</span>    

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This has a few important implications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>if you receive value, you can be sure that it won’t change mid-processing because it was modified
 in another thread</li>
  <li>as a function caller, you can be sure that after calling the function passed in arguments
 haven’t changed and you can use them the same way before calling the function</li>
  <li>as a function writer, you can do whatever you want with the data, as long as you do not change
 the original value and return results in the new one</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, it reduces surprises and eases the cognitional context load of the programmer as
we do not  need to worry about the state of the entire program but just the 
local state (input)
of the function.</p>

<p>There is a common expectation that if you call the function with the same arguments, it will
return the same results. However, that is not always the case:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reading the same file, with the same filename, might produce a different result if the file was updated</li>
  <li>calling function that returns current time should return different time during each call</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>These edge cases usually creep in from the environment (boundaries with the environment) and a keen
functional practitioner could work around these by introducing Environment or Context
states but for practical purposes it is more work than it is worth.</p>

<p>The implications above often lead to code structure that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>x1</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span>
<span>x2</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>x1</span><span>)</span>
<span>b3</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>x1</span><span>,</span> <span>x2</span><span>)</span>
<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>b3</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s easier to reason about the calls step-by-step as the context of each function call is
always limited.</p>

<p>As it usually happens, in data engineering data processing flows are often quite simple, and
the pipeline above looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="coupling">Coupling</h2>
<p>One missing, but quite important, piece of this puzzle is that the functions should be cohesive (
one responsibility) and loosely coupled. What does it mean to be loosely coupled?</p>

<p>Let’s compare these two examples:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What will happen, if <em>we</em> do not need to call <code>another_call</code>? In the first case, we could remove it
from the <code>third_call</code> function, but that would break functionality for all the other
users of <code>third_call</code> function.</p>

<p>Clearly, the latter case is more loosely coupled, because we can just drop the <code>x = another_call(x)</code>
line, we will achieve our goals, and the code won’t be broken for the other users.</p>

<p>The other nice thing is that nested function calls build this mental complexity hierarchy that
becomes harder to follow with each function. You can’t really understand what each function does
without traversing the hierarchy up and investigating all the other calls.</p>



<p>Now, we now know how to write nice “functional” functions. What can we do with that?</p>

<p>In the examples above we had a pipeline that processed just a single value. In most of the cases,
we operate on the lists. Those lists can be anything:</p>
<ul>
  <li>lists of lists</li>
  <li>lists of byte arrays</li>
  <li>lists of tuples that are made of other objects and other lists</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>but we usually get some kind of list first. In Python, it means a specific type of array-like collection
but in reality, we just need some kind of Iterable.</p>

<h2 id="enter-the-map">Enter the map</h2>

<p>When we are processing a list of items, it is extremely easy to use the functions that we’ve defined
above to process the list using a <code>map</code>.</p>

<p>On Python, the call would look something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>items</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>my_function_one</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>another_call</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>third_call</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="reduce-it">Reduce it</h2>

<p>What if we want to get a single value as a result? Functional programming toolset has 
this function called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce">reduce</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>functools</span> <span>import</span> <span>reduce</span>

<span>#...
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>reduce</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>c</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>:</span> <span>c</span> <span>+</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Actually, <code>reduce(lambda c, i: c + i, x)</code> is the same as
<code>reduce(operators.add, x)</code>. It is also equivalent to <code>sum(x)</code> on Python,
so the same above could be expressed as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#...
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is important to note here, that <code>lambda c, i: c + i</code> is a function
and could be replaced with anything. For example, calculating is not
that difficult either (but there are better ways):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>accumulate</span><span>(</span><span>cumulative</span><span>,</span> <span>current_item</span><span>):</span>
    <span>count</span><span>,</span> <span>sum</span> <span>=</span> <span>cumulative</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>count</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>sum</span> <span>+</span> <span>current_item</span>

<span>#...
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>reduce</span><span>(</span><span>accumulate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>initial</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>
<span>average</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>/</span> <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="composing-functions">Composing functions</h2>
<p>I’ve just used (introduced?) an extremely important concept in FP -  function composition. It deserves
a special mention.</p>

<p>In the part <code>reduce(accumulate, ...)</code> you can see that we are calling a function, that takes another
function as the argument. To be used inside <code>reduce</code> the <code>accumulate</code> function has to satisfy 
the same signature requirements (if such a thing exists in Python at all…) - it takes two arguments
and returns a single value. The first argument and the return value should be (preferably) of the same 
type.</p>

<p>Then, when the time comes, <code>reduce</code> will call our supplied function to accumulate the stream of values
into a single value (it will get <em>reduced</em>). 
For developers who know their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a>, 
it is the same as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">Strategy pattern</a>.</p>

<p>We can use the same idea in our functions as well. For example, let’s say we are writing a 
function to normalize some input data, but we want to let our users choose if the text
should be processed uppercased or lowercased. We could implement that like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>noop</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span> <span># default function that does nothing
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>text_processor</span><span>=</span><span>noop</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text_processor</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>first_use</span> <span>=</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>"aaAA"</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>upper</span><span>)</span>
<span>second_use</span> <span>=</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>"aaAA"</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>)</span>
<span>third_use</span> <span>=</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>"aaAA"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="factory-functions">Factory functions</h3>

<p>The version of the <code>clean_text</code> above can be unwieldy to use with <code>map</code> so it is often beneficial
to create a factory function, that creates the version of <code>clean_text</code> that has only a single
argument but you still get to choose which text processing function to use:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text_processor</span><span>=</span><span>noop</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>step</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text_processor</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>text</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>step</span>

<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>),</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is also a perfect way to create configurable functions.</p>

<h3 id="better-composition-examples">Better composition examples</h3>
<p>In the example above, we could move the text_processor to the pipeline itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>clean_text</span><span>,</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>,</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>so a better example would be a randomizing post-processing function, to augment 
text examples for your neural network. We will make this augment function configurable,
so the users of the function can choose the possible augmentations:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>random</span>

<span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>def</span> <span>augment</span><span>(</span><span>augmentations</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>step</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
        <span>augmentation</span> <span>=</span> <span>random</span><span>.</span><span>choice</span><span>(</span><span>augmentations</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>augmentation</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>step</span>

<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>clean_text</span><span>,</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>augment</span><span>([</span><span>noop</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>upper</span><span>]),</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Often, I get to see functions that look something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>some_big_function</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>z</span><span>):</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>x</span> <span>is</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>None</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>x</span> <span>==</span> <span>"a"</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>z</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
        <span>counter</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>y</span> <span>in</span> <span>z</span><span>:</span>
            <span>i</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>
            <span>counter</span> <span>+=</span> <span>y</span> <span>/</span> <span>i</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>counter</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>while the specific example above is not that bad because it is rather clear 
what’s happening just because it is ~10 lines long, I am not happy when I find

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasonmcintosh_facebooks-kenosha-guard-militia-event-was-activity-6705852062460084224-G5e9">posted the following note to my LinkedIn page</a> earlier today, where I also <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/29/facebook-kenosha-guard-455-times">linked to this Daring Fireball article</a>.</em></p>

<p>A note to my friends who still work at Facebook:</p>

<p>You are at the top of your career. The very fact of your job at Facebook demonstrates a level of technical acumen that would allow you to work anywhere you wish within the technology sector.</p>

<p>The time has come for you to take advantage of this. Your employer has become unworthy of your talent. Please quit. Work for a company doing literally anything else.</p>

<p>From promoting hateful conspiracy theories to favoring Trump’s re-election, <a href="https://fogknife.com/2019-05-23-i-read-ruined-by-design.html">Facebook’s drive for emotionally fueled “engagement” over all else</a> steals the light from our shared human future in order to enrich a handful of people.</p>

<p>I know that you do not identify as a white supremacist. Facebook, however, funnels most of your talent directly into growing and empowering white supremacy’s most significant technological ally in spreading hate.</p>

<p>I urge you to think of your own career prospects, as well. The peak of Facebook’s positive reputation already lay in the past. After this year, employers will justifiably assume that hiring someone from Facebook would risk bringing in a culture of division, deception, and algorithmically optimized racism.</p>

<p>Please, for your own sake, if not for the sake of the future: leave Facebook. Do it today, before it ruins you.</p>

        <p><span>How We Do It?</span>
        </p>

        <!-- step 1  -->
        <div>
          <p><span>Step 1</span>
          </p>
          <div>
            <p><span>Automated Product Research</span></p><p>AMZ Snagger was birthed from the perspective of an amazon dropshipper. After months of grinding it out, putting in 100hr weeks looking for winning products and being able to scale into a 6 figure store. We knew that product research was an issue and it needed to be simplified.</p>
            <p>No one believed it could be done but we always did. So we got to work and designed YOU a bot from the mind of an amazon dropshipper.</p>
            <p>We designed a proprietary algorithm that mines, scrapes, sorts and filters winning products for you on autopilot. So that you can focus on the other important aspects of your business.</p>
            <p>Now we want you to experience what we experienced: The redemption of our time!</p>
          </div>
          
        </div>
        <!-- step 2 -->
        <div>
          
          <div>
            <p><span>Sort Through Qualified Products</span></p><p>We designed the app to filter and weed out the diamonds in the rough. This has virtually never been done before, since we ourselves our dropshippers we knew exactly What the amazon dropshipping community wanted to experience.</p>
            <p> Sorting Options like: price, category, sellers on listings, buyBox Eligibility and the potential for profit</p>
            <p>The most exciting part of this all, is that you are able to download all of the Winning products that are profitable and export them as a CSV.</p>

August 30, 2020 | https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p><em>This is part 1 of a series by the data visualization tool <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Datawrapper</a> that explains log scales. Visit <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale2/">part 2</a> or <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale3/">part 3</a>.</em></p>
<p>As promised <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-scatterplotlinechart">last week</a>, we have a closer look at the logarithmic scale this week. I won’t get into mathematical details to explain what a logarithm is – I won’t even explain when we should use log scales instead of linear scales. This and next week, I’ll explain what log scales can tell us.</p>
<p>We start slowly. Here’s a chart that’s not on a log scale –&nbsp;not yet:</p>
<hr>

<p>We will transform it to a chart with a log scale in a minute (in <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Datawrapper</a>, it’s as easy as clicking on a checkbox). First, let’s learn some basics about log scales, to understand what they tell us:</p>
<h3 id="Log-scales-show-relative-values">Log scales show relative values</h3>
<p><strong>Log scales show relative values instead of absolute ones.</strong> Log scales don’t care that 101 minus 100 equals the same as 2 minus 1. Instead, they are concerned with percentages: the difference between 100 and 101 is a 1% increase, while the difference between 1 and 2 is a 100% increase. So on a log scale, the distance between 100 and 101 is roughly 1% of the distance between 1 and 2:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-180531_log6.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-180531_log6.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-180531_log6.png"></p>
<h3 id="The-same-distance-on-a-log-scale-shows-the-same-rate">The same distance on a log scale shows the same rate</h3>
<p>So what do same distances on a log scale show? They show the same percentage growth or decline. Imagine you eat candy for money and your business grows yearly by 100%. That means every year you eat twice as many candies than you ate the previous year.</p>
<p>In year zero, you start by eating <strong>1</strong> candy.</p>
<p>In the 1st year, you eat <strong>2</strong> candies. The year after that, you eat <strong>4</strong> candies. In the 3rd year, you eat <strong>8</strong> candies. By year 5, you eat <strong>32</strong> candies, and on your 25th anniversary, you would be eating <strong>33.5 million</strong> candies.</p>
<p>On a linear scale, a line chart plotting these numbers would go insanely high very quickly. On a log scale, each of these amounts takes up the same space, because, in each year, the number of candies <strong>grows at a fixed rate (100%)</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-180531_log1.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-180531_log1.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-180531_log1.png"></p>
<h3 id="How-to-read-a-log-scaled-chart">How to read a log scaled chart</h3>
<p>Let’s see what that means for our chart. Here, the log scale can show us two things that the linear scale can’t show us: First, the <strong>drop of short-term arrivals in the Second World War</strong>. There wasn’t a stark drop in <em>absolute</em> numbers (that’s why we can’t see it in the chart up there), but it was a stark drop in <em>relative</em> numbers:</p>

<p><strong>How stark?</strong> Well, we know by now that the same unit on a log scale represents the same growth rate. Looking closer, we see that the drop during the Second World War is almost as “deep” as the growth afterward is “high”. In April 1942, only 40 people visited New Zealand. Three years earlier, there were 33 times as many tourists: 1,310 in total. It took ten years to get back to that number of 1,300 tourists (for April) – that’s the brown range in our chart. But the growth didn’t stop there. Within 32 years, the number of tourists in New Zealand grew again by 33 times and reached 45,700 tourists in 1984 – that’s the blue range.</p>
<p>The <strong>blue range has the same height as the brown range because both ranges represent a 33-fold increase</strong>; no matter their absolute values. So during the Second World War, the arrivals in New Zealand dropped almost by the same rate between 1939 and 1942 as they increased between 1952 and 1984. That’s something the log scale can tell us and the linear scale can’t.</p>
<p>The log scale also shows us something about the arrivals each season. We can see that the ups and downs get smaller over time. So we can conclude that <strong>seasonal increase and decrease of arrivals each year happened at a higher rate</strong> before the Second World War than after the Second World War, and at an even lower rate since approximately 1985.</p>

<p><em>Next week, we’ll explore magnitudes, and how log scales are ideal to show exponential growth. <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale2/">Visit the article here.</a></em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This is the most comprehensive guide to Captive Portal on the planet.</p><p>I’m going to show you how you can build your own Captive Portal Software for Hacking, Business Security, and Growth.</p><p>In short: if you want to leverage WiFi Captive Portals for improving your Business, you’ll love this guide.</p><p>Let’s get started.</p><p><note>Sharpen your Network Security skills with <b>rootsh3ll Labs</b>, right from your browser. Click to <a href="https://labs.rootsh3ll.com/?ref=" captive-portal-guide"="">start you first lab</a></note></p><p>Operating in an Enterprise, studying in a college or sitting in Starbucks, you must have encountered a login screen like this once.</p><p>You connect to the WiFi network and it greets with you a similar login screen. That page is called a captive portal.</p><p>But, what is a captive portal exactly, How does it work and how the system knows where the captive portal is?</p><p>These are all the questions you are going to uncover from this guide and take-away the knowledge to build your own captive portal for your company, institute etc and use it for fun and profit.</p><p>Technically speaking, an authentication screen is displayed when a wireless user is not authorized to access the network resources. The authentication page is called a captive portal login.</p><p>1. DNS Redirection<br>
2. Splash page</p><p>DNS redirection works as the simple DNS hijacking where all the user DNS requests are hijacked and resolved to the captive portal login page. But, after widespread use of HSTS header implementation, DNS redirection hits a low success ratio providing no better service to the users.</p><p>Whereas, a Splash Page works in a little different fashion. It also uses DNS redirections but, it responds to the requests acc. to the operating systems which trick the O.S in believing there is a captive portal login in place and forcing the O.S to automatically trigger the login page to the user.</p><p>When a client device is connected to the WiFi, If unauthorized to access the Internet, A screen automatically pops up to display the captive portal.</p><p>A Splash page not only bypasses HSTS implementations on most websites but also gives you the flexibility of showing O.S specific login pages.</p><div>

<p>The only difference in regular captive portal and splash page is that splash page pulls up the captive portal login page automatically. Whereas, the DNS redirection based method requires a user to manually open up a website.</p>
<p>Imagine if a user is using a mobile app only, how would a user know he needs to log in? If you are a hacker you will lose your victim because the device will automatically disconnect upon no Internet access. So, this leads us to the much better and flexible option for triggering captive portal login page, the Splash Screen.</p>
<p>As a business operator, you can show a different kind of services to different client devices, whereas as an attacker you can identify victim machine automatically and serve the payload accordingly. I’ll showcase its crux, and leave implementation upon your creativity and requirement.</p>

<h2>Different Client Behaviours</h2>
<p>Now comes the technical theory part of this guide. It is important for you to understand the theory behind a captive portal before diving into the practical aspect of it.<br>
<a href="#start-ap">Click here</a> to skip the theory and jump into action</p>
<h3>Basic Strategy behind portal detection</h3>
<p>Every operating system has its own different way of detecting Internet access.</p>
<p>The mechanism is this basically:</p>
<pre>GET/POST http://foo.com/bar.html
If bar.html == [expected content] &gt; Open Internet
If bar.html != [expected content] &gt; Captive Portal
If bar.html[status] != SUCCESS &gt; No Network
</pre>

<p>If a Captive Portal is not in place, the result will match the expected one and the OS will know that there is full access to the Internet.</p>
<p>If the URL returns a result other than the expected one, then the OS will detect that there is a Captive Portal in place and that it’s needed to proceed with authentication in order to get full access to the Internet: In this case, the OS will open the Splash Page automatically.</p>
<p>All client devices use the above-described strategy to find out if they are behind a captive portal, but the URL might vary depending on the specific model of smartphone, tablet, laptop and depending on the specific OS version. In the following, you can find the list of domains that are contacted by each model in order to detect the captive portal.</p>
<h3>Captive Portal Detection method by various Operating Systems</h3>
<h4>Android 4 – 9</h4>
<p>Android devices look for an HTTP 204 response for a file named generate_204 from the following domain.</p>
<pre><code>clients3.google.com
connectivitycheck.android.com
connectivitycheck.gstatic.com</code></pre>
<p>HTTP Status 204 means the file exists but, is empty. This lets Android know that the Internet is accessible. If the request receives HTTP Status 302 (temporary redirect) instead of HTTP 204, Android will follow the redirection URL to display the Captive Portal to the user.</p>
<p>In its nature, all the domains serve on HTTP and not HTTPS which makes the captive portal mechanism possible. Also, it allows an attacker to use the redirection to bypass security.</p>
<p>Unlike Apple Devices, Android is very fragmented acc. to the install base. Which leaves us with a wide variety of attack surface as an attacker. Have a look at the current install base of Android devices acc. to Google.</p>

<h2>Apple’s secret “WISPr” request</h2>
<p>WISPr (pronounced “whisper”) or Wireless Internet Service Provider roaming used by every Apple device for captive portal detection. This technology allows users to roam between wireless internet service providers in a fashion similar to that which allows cell phone users to roam between carriers.</p>
<p>Another question is whether this is an attack vector. The answer is “probably yes”. There is more to the functionality than a simple HTTP request. If you look up the keyword “wispr” from the User-Agent string in apache logs, you’ll find out why.</p>
<p>The idea is that smart Wi-Fi portals will detect that this is a WISPr-supporting device, and send back a WISPr message in XML. This allows the iDevice(s) to then log in with cached credentials via another XML message. This means, for example, you might be able to grab somebody’s credentials with a properly configured Wi-Fi access-point.</p>
<p>When an iDevice connects to a Wi-Fi network, the first thing it does is make a request to the URL captive.apple.com or apple.com/test/success.html.</p>
<p>With iOS 7 onwards, Apple began to use the User Agent “<strong>CaptiveNetworkSupport</strong>“, though it’s not as common as the URL method that Android and Windows uses.</p>
<p>The reason Apple does this is that you may be using an app other than the web browser. For example, the only thing you might be doing is syncing your e-mail. In such situations, no auto-redirection would work as no browser is in use and you would never see the portal page, and your app will mysteriously fail to connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>Therefore, before your app has a chance to access the network, Apple does this for you. It sends out a request to the above URL. If the request gets redirected, then Apple knows there is a portal. It then launches a dialog box, containing Safari, to give you a chance to log in.</p>
<p>When reading apache logs (<b>/var/logs/apache2/access.log</b>) for apple devices, you’ll see something like this:</p>
<pre>10.0.0.194 - - [03/March/2019:14:14:22 +0530] "GET /hotspot-detect.html HTTP/1.0" 302 487 "-" "<strong>CaptiveNetworkSupport-346.50.1 wispr</strong>"
10.0.0.194 - - [03/March/2019:14:14:22 +0530] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 2004 "-" "<strong>CaptiveNetworkSupport-346.50.1 wispr</strong>"</pre>
</div>
<h2 id="start-ap">Access Point Configuration</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<pre><code>







<ul>








 	<li pf="$">sudo apt update</li>
















 	<li pf="$">sudo apt install hostapd dnsmasq apache2 -y</li>








</ul>







</code></pre>
<h4>Configure hostapd</h4>
<p>Create a directory for saved configuration files. Open Terminal and create a hostapd config file.</p>
<pre><code>







<ul>







 	<li pf="$">vi hostapd.conf</li>







</ul>







</code></pre>
<p><file>hostapd.conf</file></p>
<pre>interface=<span>wlan0</span>       # Desired Interface name
driver=nl80211
ssid=<span>Captive Portal</span>   # Desired AP name
hw_mode=g
channel=<span>6</span>
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
</pre>
<p>Make sure you edit the changes accordingly every time you perform an attack.</p>
<p>Operating Channel number can cause issues if not chosen properly.</p>
<h4>Configure dnsmasq</h4>
<pre><code>







<ul>







 	<li pf="$">vi dnsmasq.conf</li>







</ul>







</code></pre>
<p><file>dnsmasq.conf</file></p>
<pre>interface=<span>wlan0</span>   # Desired Interface name
dhcp-range=10.0.0.10,10.0.0.250,255.255.255.0,12h
dhcp-option=3,10.0.0.1
dhcp-option=6,10.0.0.1
server=8.8.8.8
log-queries
listen-address=127.0.0.1</pre>
<p>Make sure to define proper interface in dnsmasq.conf file.</p>
<h4>Parameter Breakdown:</h4>
<pre><strong>dhcp-range=10.0.0.10,10.0.0.250,12h</strong>:  Client IP address will range from 10.0.0.10 to 10.0.0.250 and default lease time is 12 hours.
<strong>dhcp-option=3,10.0.0.1</strong>:  3 is code for Default Gateway followed by IP of D.G i.e. 10.0.0.1
<strong>dhcp-option=6,10.0.0.1</strong>:  6 for DNS Server followed by IP address</pre>
<p>Kill network-manager utility before running hostapd. Because when you start hostapd, network-manager tries to take control of the wireless device and put it into managed mode. whereas hostapd needs the card to be set to Master mode (Access Point mode). So, kill network-manager and other interfering processes before you begin</p>
<pre><code>







<ul>








 	<li pf="$">sudo killall network-manager wpa_supplicant dnsmasq</li>
















 	<li pf="$">sudo hostapd hostapd.conf</li>








</ul>







</code></pre>
<p>To allocate IP addresses to victims, run dnsmasq.<br>
Before that, set IP address for wlan0 interface to enable IP networking, so that dnsmasq can process the incoming requests and direct the traffic accordingly.</p>
<p>Open a new Terminal for dnsmasq:</p>
<pre>ifconfig wlan0 10.0.0.1       # Set class-A IP address to wlan0
dnsmasq -C dnsmasq.conf -d    # -C: configuration file. -d: daemon (as a process) mode
</pre>
<p>as soon as victim connects you should see similar output for hostapd and dnsmasq Terminal windows:</p>
<p><file>[ <strong>hostapd</strong> ]</file></p>
<pre>Using interface wlan0 with hwaddr 00:c0:ca:5a:34:b7 and ssid "rootsh3ll"
wlan0: interface state …</pre></div></div>

    <mytitle>Parsing: a timeline</mytitle>
    <version>Version 3.1</version>
    <datestamp>Revision 2, 23 October 2019</datestamp>
    <author>Jeffrey Kegler</author>
    
    <p>In India, Pannini creates an exact and complete description of
      the Sanskrit language, including pronunciation. Sanskrit could be
      recreated using nothing but Pannini's grammar.
      Pannini's grammar is
      probably the first formal system of any kind, predating Euclid.
      In the future, nothing like it will exist for any other natural language of
      significant size or corpus.
      By 2018,
      Pannini will be the object of serious study.
      But in the 1940's and 1950's Pannini will be almost unknown in
      the West.
      This means that Pannini will have no direct effect
      on the other events in this timeline.
    </p>
    
    <p>In her translator's note on an article on Babbage's
    computer, Ada Lovelace becomes the first person to
    clearly distinguish programming a computer (software)
    as a separate field from
    building the computer itself (hardware).<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>
    Ada is also the first to
    think of software in linguistic terms --
    she originates the idea that,
    in writing software,
    we communicate with the computer,
    and that the means that we use to do that is a "language".<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     A new, a vast, and a powerful language is developed for the future
     use of analysis, in which to wield its truths so that these may
     become of more speedy and accurate practical application for the
     purposes of mankind than the means hitherto in our possession have
     rendered possible. Thus not only the mental and the material, but
     the theoretical and the practical in the mathematical world, are
     brought into more intimate and effective connexion with each other.<a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here "analysis" means the branch of mathematics that studies limits
    and continuous functions, and which includes calculus.
    </p>
    
    <p>Andrey Markov introduces his
      <term>chains</term>
      -- a set of
      states with transitions between them.<a id="footnote-4-ref" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>
      One offshoot of Markov's work will be what will
      come to be known as regular expressions.
      Markov uses his chains,
      not for parsing,
      but to deal with a problem in probability --
      does the law of large numbers require that events be
      independent?
      Indirectly, Markov is addressing the question 
      of the existence of free will.<a id="footnote-5-ref" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>In 1913, Markov revisits his chains,
      applying them to the sequence of vowels and consonants
      in Pushkin's
      <cite>Eugene Onegin</cite><a id="footnote-6-ref" href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>.
      Again, Markov's interest is not in parsing.
      Nonetheless,
      this is an application to language
      of what later will be regarded
      as a parsing technique,
      and apparently for the first time in the West.
    </p>
    
    <p>Leonard Bloomfield,
      as part of his effort to create a linguistics that
      would be taken seriously as a science,
      publishes his "Postulates".<a id="footnote-7-ref" href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>
      Known as structural linguistics,
      Bloomfield's approach will
      dominate American lingustics for
      over two decades.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Bloomfield's "Postulates" defines a "language" as
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      [t]he totality of utterances that can be made in a speech
      community<a id="footnote-8-ref" href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Note that there is no reference in this definition to the usual view --
      that the utterances of a language "mean" something.
    </p>
    <p>
      This omission is not accidental.<a id="footnote-9-ref" href="#footnote-9">[9]</a>
      Bloomfield excludes meaning from his definition of language
      because he wants linguistics to be taken
      seriously as science.
      Behaviorist thought is very influential at this
      time and behavorists believe that,
      while human behaviors can be observed and verified
      and therefore made the subject of science,
      mental states cannot be verified.
      Claiming to know what someone means
      by a word
      is claiming to read his mind.
      And "mind-reading" is not science.
    </p>
    
    <p>Emil Post defines and studies a formal rewriting system<a id="footnote-10-ref" href="#footnote-10">[10]</a>
      using productions.
      With this, the process of rediscovering Pannini in the
      West begins.</p>
    
    <p>Alan Turing discovers the stack as part of his design of the
      ACE machine. This will be important in parsing because recursive parsing
      requires stacks. The importance of Turing's discovery is not noticed
      in 1945 and stacks will be rediscovered many times over the
      next two decades<a id="footnote-11-ref" href="#footnote-11">[11]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Claude Shannon publishes the foundation paper of information theory<a id="footnote-12-ref" href="#footnote-12">[12]</a>.
      In this
      paper, Shannon models English using Andrey Markov's
      chains<a id="footnote-13-ref" href="#footnote-13">[13]</a>.
      The approach is similar to Markov's but the intent
      is different --
      Shannon's is a serious attempt at a contribution
      to parsing human languages.
    </p>
    
    <p>From 1949 to 1951 at the ETH Zurich, Heinz Rutishauser works on
      the design of what we will come to call a compiler<a id="footnote-14-ref" href="#footnote-14">[14]</a>.
      Rutishauser's arithmetic expression parser
      does not honor precedence but it does allow nested parentheses.
      It is perhaps the first algorithm which can really be considered a
      parsing method.
      Rutishauser's compiler is never implemented.</p>
    
    <p>
      In the form of arithmetic expressions, operator expressions
      are the target of the first efforts at automatic parsing.
      We will not see this issue go away.
      Very informally<a id="footnote-15-ref" href="#footnote-15">[15]</a>,
      we can say that
      an operator expression is an expression
      built up from operands
      and operators.
      It is expected that the operand might be another operator expression,
      so operator expressions raise the issue of recursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The archetypal examples of operator expressions are arithmetic expressions:
    </p><pre><tt>
         2+(3*4)
         13^2^-5*9/11
         1729-42*8675309
      </tt></pre>
    <p>
      In Western mathematics arithmetic expressions have been read
      according to traditional
      ideas of
      associativity and precedence:
    </p><ul>
      <li><tt>^</tt>
        is exponentiation.
        It right associates and has tightest<a id="footnote-16-ref" href="#footnote-16">[16]</a>
        precedence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiplication (<tt>*</tt>) and division (<tt>/</tt>) left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than that of exponentiation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Addition ('+') and subtraction ('-') left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than that of multiplication and division.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parentheses, when present, override the traditional
        associativity and precedence.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Rutishauser's language
      is structured line-by-line,
      as will be all languages until LISP.
      No language until ALGOL will be truly block-structured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line-by-line languages
      are parsed using string manipulations.
      A parsing theory is not helpful for describing these
      ad hoc string manipulations,
      so they don't give rise to one.
      The only logic in these early compilers that really deserves to be called
      a parsing method
      is that which tackles arithmetic expressions.
    </p>
    
    <p>During 1950, Corrado Boehm, also at the ETH Zurich,
      develops his own compiler.
      Rutishauser and Boehm are working at the same institution at the same
      time, but Boehm is unaware of Rutishauser's work until his own is
      complete.
      Boehm's is also the first self-compiling compiler -- it is written
      in its own language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Rutishauser, Boehm's language is line-by-line and
      parsed ad hoc, except for expressions. Boehm's expression parser
      <em>does</em>
      honor precedence, making it perhaps the first operator precedence
      parser<a id="footnote-17-ref" href="#footnote-17">[17]</a>.
      In Norvell's taxonomy<a id="footnote-18-ref" href="#footnote-18">[18]</a>,
      Boehm's algorithm inaugurates
      the
      <q>classic approach</q>
      to operator parsing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boehm's compiler also allows parentheses, but the two cannot
      be mixed -- an expression can either be parsed using precedence
      or have parentheses, but not both.
      Also like Rutishauser's, Boehm's compiler is never
      implemented<a id="footnote-19-ref" href="#footnote-19">[19]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Grace Hopper writes a linker-loader,
      and calls it a
      <term>compiler</term><a id="footnote-20-ref" href="#footnote-20">[20]</a>. Hopper seems to be the first
      person to use this term for a computer program.</p>
    
    <p>Hopper uses the term
      <term>compiler</term>
      in a meaning very close to one of its traditional senses:
      <q>to compose out of materials from other
        documents</q><a id="footnote-21-ref" href="#footnote-21">[21]</a>.
      Specifically, in 1952,
      subroutines were new,
      and automated programming
      (what we will come to call
      <q>compiling</q>)
      often is viewed as providing a interface
      for calling a collection of
      carefully chosen assembler subroutines<a id="footnote-22-ref" href="#footnote-22">[22]</a>.
      Hopper's new
      program takes this subroutine calling
      one step further -- instead of calling the subroutines
      it expands them (or in Hopper's terms
      <q>compiles</q>
      them) into
      a single program.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Hopper the term
      <term>compiler</term>
      will acquire a different meaning,
      one specific to the computer field.
      By 1956, programs like Hoppers will
      no longer be called
      <term>compilers</term><a id="footnote-23-ref" href="#footnote-23">[23]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Kleene discovers regular languages<a id="footnote-24-ref" href="#footnote-24">[24]</a>.
      Kleene does not use regular expression notation,
      but his regular languages are the idea behind
      it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Glennie discovers what Knuth will later
      call the first
      <q>real</q><a id="footnote-25-ref" href="#footnote-25">[25]</a>
      compiler.
      (By this Knuth will mean that
      AUTOCODE was actually implemented and used by someone to translate
      algebraic statements into machine language.)
      Glennie's AUTOCODE
      is very close to the machine -- just above machine language.
      It does not allow operator expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      AUTOCODE is hard-to-use,
      and apparently sees little use by anybody but
      Glennie himself.
      Because
      Glennie works for the British atomic weapons projects his papers
      are routinely classified,</p></div>

As a result, it is equipped with a system of specialized <strong><a aria-label="symbols (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symbols</a></strong> and <strong>vocabularies</strong> — each with its own level of generality and formality.</p><p>Among these, there’s a particular subset of terms that is uniquely foundational and appropriate to our pursuit: the <strong>higher mathematical jargon</strong>. Loosely speaking, these are a set of specialized terms that fall into most — if not all — of the following categories:</p><ul><li>Specific to <strong>higher mathematics</strong></li><li><strong>English-looking</strong> (with a near-technical meaning)</li><li><strong>Frequently-occurring</strong></li><li><strong>Cross-disciplinary</strong> (i.e., not field-specific)</li></ul><p>In brief, these are terms that are generally accessible to most, yet still provide us with a glimpse of the world of non-miniaturized mathematics — and the way their practitioners act and think. In fact, in what follows, we’ve compiled a list of 106 such terms — along with some in-depth exploration of their <strong>definitions</strong>, <strong>examples</strong>, <strong>relevance</strong> and <strong>implications</strong>.</p><p>So if you’re ready to dive into this fascinating world that is known as mathematics, then let’s get started!</p><p>(and if you’re looking for a concise rendition of all the 106 terms featured in this glossary, then you might find the following <strong>higher math jargon mindmap</strong> both interesting and useful.)</p><span></span><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image.png" alt="The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargons" width="1366" height="702" title="Math Glossary Header Image"></figure><h2 id="toc">Higher Mathematical Jargon — The Definitive List (106 Terms)</h2><p><span> The definitive glossary of higher mathematical jargon — from abstract nonsense, elementary proof to singularity and 101+ more. </span> <span><span>Click to Tweet</span><i></i></span></p><h2 id="abstraction"><a href="#toc">Abstraction</a></h2><p>The process of extracting the underlying <strong>structures</strong>, <strong>patterns</strong>, or <strong>properties</strong> of some mathematical objects, with the intention of generalizing these findings to a broader class of objects. These include, for example:</p><ul><li>Finding the <strong>shared properties</strong> of similar polynomials</li><li>Formalizing the <strong>general pattern</strong> of a sequence</li><li>Establishing a <a href="#otoc"><strong>one-to-one correspondence</strong></a> between two sets</li><li>Constructing an alternate <a href="#axiom"><strong>axiomatic system</strong></a> for Euclidean geometry</li></ul><p>At first, abstraction can seem a bit unappealing due to its higher cognitive demand and lack of connection to real-world phenomena. However, it can often turn out to be an integral force in bringing about a <strong>broaden applicability</strong> to a field — along with some <strong>unification</strong> in between the fields.</p><div><p>Did You Know?</p><p>While abstraction is involved in pretty much all subfields of mathematics, it is particularly well-represented in fields such as <strong>abstract algebra</strong>, <strong>model theory</strong>, <strong>axiomatic set theory</strong> and <a href="#nonsense"><strong>category theory</strong></a>.</p></div><h2 id="nonsense"><a href="#toc">Abstract Nonsense</a></h2><figure id="attachment_18333" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18333"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Category-Theory-Diagram.png" alt="Category Theory: A Category with Objects and Morphisms" width="325" height="325" title="Category Theory Diagram"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18333">A category with objects $A$, $B$, $C$ and a series of morphisms.</figcaption></figure><p>A colloquial term for <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">category theory</a></strong> (a mathematical subject dedicated to the notion of category and the formalization of <a href="#structure">mathematical structures</a>), or the methods and arguments that are related to it.</p><p><span>Since different branches of mathematics deal with different mathematical structures satisfying the definition of a category, category theory can be regarded as a <strong>unifying theory</strong> of mathematics — whose results are applicable to a wide range of disciplines.</span></p><p>In particular, if a proposition follows from abstract nonsense, then it means that its argument has more to do with the underlying categorical structure of its objects — rather than the field where it’s found. And since such arguments are often highly abstract and long-winded by nature, they are also alternatively referred to as “<strong>general abstract nonsense</strong>” or “<strong>generalized abstract nonsense</strong>“.</p><h2 id="aon"><a href="#toc">Abuse of notation</a></h2><p>The act of inadvertently or deliberately using notations in a way that’s not entirely<strong> syntactically correct</strong> — but which simplifies the exposition and makes the passage easier to understand. For example, one might say that:</p><ul><li>“$\mathbb{R}$ is distributive” — rather than “$(\mathbb{R}, +, \times)$ is distributive.”</li><li>“$3$ is differentiable” — rather than “the function defined by the rule $x \mapsto 3$ for all real $x$, is differentiable.”</li><li>“$a+b+c = c+b+a$” — rather than “$(a+b) + c = (c+b) + a$”.</li></ul><p>In the cases where the context and the assumptions are made clear and well understood, abuses of notation are usually harmless (if not actually desirable). In other cases, however, the same might not be true, and can amount to a <strong>misuse of notation</strong> — which is a faux-pas in mathematics (such as the case of $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=\frac{y}{x}$).</p><h2 id="algo"><a href="#toc">Algorithm</a></h2><p>A finite series of <a href="#welldefined">well-defined</a>, <strong>computer-implementable instructions</strong> to solve a specific set of computable problems. It takes a finite amount of initial input(s), processes them unambiguously at each operation, before returning its outputs within a finite amount of time. Some examples of algorithm in mathematics include:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Euclidean algorithm</strong> (for finding the greatest common factor of two natural numbers)</li><li><a href="https://mathvault.ca/long-division">The <strong>long division algorithm</strong> (and its variants)</a></li><li>The <strong>simplex algorithm</strong> (for finding the optimal solution under a set of linear constraints)</li></ul><p>In essence, algorithms are created to streamline the solution-finding process for a specific set of problems, though it can also remove the necessity of thinking and understanding in the process. For a a series of instructions that are quasi-algorithmic and broader in nature, the term “<strong>general procedure</strong>” is sometimes used (which, like an algorithm, could also involve some element of <a href="#heuristics">heuristics</a> or <a href="#recursion">recursion</a>).</p><h2 id="almost"><a href="#toc">Almost</a></h2><figure id="attachment_18414" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18414"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board.png" alt="Dart and Board" width="225" height="225" title="Dart and Board"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18414">Since the actual circumference of the board has area 0, the probability of hitting it is also 0 as well (i.e., almost never).</figcaption></figure><p>A handy adverb similar to its usage in English, but can take on specific meanings depending on the context. For example:</p><ul><li>“<strong>Almost all</strong> elements in a set” usually means “all but a finite/countable amount of negligible elements in the set.”</li><li>“<strong>Almost no</strong> integer” usually means “only a finite subset of integers.”</li><li>“A property holds <strong>almost everywhere</strong> (in a measure space)” usually means “everywhere in a set except a subset of<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MeasureZero.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> measure zero</a>.”</li><li>“An event occurs <strong>almost surely</strong>” usually means that “the event has a probability of 1, even though it does not include all of the possible outcomes.”</li><li>“An event occurs <strong>almost never</strong>” usually means that “the event has a probability of 0, even though it does contain some of the possible outcomes.”</li></ul><p>Here, notice that “almost” doesn’t necessarily mean that the <strong>exceptional cases</strong> are “small”, and hence one is perfectly well-justified in making claims such as “almost all real numbers are transcendental” — or that “the dart almost never lands on the circumference of the board.”</p><h2 id="ansatz"><a href="#toc">Ansatz</a></h2><p>A term of German origin meaning “initial placement of a tool at a work piece” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansatz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>), and is used in mathematics to refer to the initial, additional <strong>mathematical assumptions</strong> made to kick start the problem solving process — but which are later confirmed to be parts of the actual solution as well. Some examples of ansatz in mathematics include:</p><ul><li>The adoption of linear regression model to fit the data points (i.e., <strong>linear ansatz</strong>)</li><li>The assumption that the solutions to a differential/recurrent equation take an exponential form (<strong>exponential ansatz</strong>)</li><li>The assumption that the solution to a system of linear equations is expressible in terms of a particular vector (<strong>ansatz of particular solution</strong>).</li></ul><p>Metaphorically speaking, the use of ansatz can be liken to drawing a picture by first establishing a <strong>framework</strong>, in that if it succeeds, then the framework can be reused as an ansatz later on, but if it doesn’t, then it’s usually discarded and marked as an instance of failure.</p><h2 id="arbitrarily"><a href="#toc">Arbitrarily</a></h2><p>An adverb attached to a mathematical adjective X to make clear that something is “<strong>X with little limitation or restraint</strong>.” For example:</p><ul><li>An <strong>arbitrarily large</strong> function is a function capable of assuming values larger than any fixed choice of real number — regardless of the size of the latter.</li><li>An <strong>arbitrarily small</strong> positive sequence is a sequence capable of assuming values smaller than any fixed choice of positive real number — regardless of the “tininess” of the latter.</li><li>An <strong>arbitrarily long</strong> progression is a progression whose number of members can be made to exceed than any choice of natural number — regardless the size of the latter.</li></ul><p>In general, “arbitrarily” is a foundational term in number theory and mathematical analysis, and can also occur in other topics where some form of <strong>degree</strong> and <strong>ordering</strong> are involved (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">polynomial ring</a>).</p><div><p>Caution</p><p>Don’t make the mistake in assuming that “arbitrarily” means “infinitely”! If anything, “arbitrarily” usually carries a sense of being “without bound within the finite realm.”</p></div><h2 id="arbitrary"><a href="#toc">Arbitrary</a></h2><p>An adjective used to refer to a choice made without any specific criterion or restraint (e.g., arbitrary integer, arbitrary division of a set, arbitrary permutation of a sequence). It corresponds to the term “<strong>any</strong>” and the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/logic-symbols/#Quantifiers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">logical quantifier</a> $\forall$, and hints at an element of generality in the phrase where it’s found (e.g., statement $P$ holds for an arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$).&nbsp;</p><div><p>Arbitrary vs. Random</p><p>While “random” and “arbitrary” are often used interchangeably in informal discourses, in mathematics, “random” — unlike “arbitrary” — usually presupposes that the outcomes follow a <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/probability-statistics-symbols/#Discrete_Probability_Distributions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>probability distribution</strong></a>, and as such might have predictable probabilities even if the outcomes are subject to chance and unpredictability.</p></div><h2 id="axiom"><a href="#toc">Axiom</a></h2><figure id="attachment_18546" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18546"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Parallel-Postulate.png" alt="Illustration of Parallel Postulate" width="320" height="240" title="Parallel Postulate"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18546">Pictorial representation of the parallel postulate</figcaption></figure><p>Axioms, also known as postulates, are mathematical premises which are assumed to be<strong>&nbsp;true</strong> and along with <a href="#def">definitions</a>, form the foundation of a <a href="#theory">mathematical <span>theory</span></a>.</p><p>In general, axioms can be divided into two types: <strong>logica</strong>l and <strong>non-logical</strong>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-141518467573597169" itemprop="articleBody">

<p><img data-original-height="392" data-original-width="1176" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c8iAON90hE8/X0u6DaURFlI/AAAAAAAAEzI/dENaZvr7StEWfYHQXURz4wBd_D_XA73bACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/multitenancy.png" width="640"></p>


<p>Multi-tenancy Application Deployment Architecture could be modeled in 4 broad ways:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Separate Apps &amp; Separate Databases</li>
	<li>Shared Apps &amp; Shared Databases</li>
	<li>Separate Apps &amp; Shared Databases</li>
	<li>Shared Apps &amp; Separate Databases</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no right or wrong here. It's about choice and consequence that you should consider taking into your business context and constraints. In this post I intend to jot down a some key points to keep in mind for each of these multi-tenant architecture.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Separate Apps &amp; Separate Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>Easiest to implement from development and deployment stand-point.</li>
		<li>Just automate the deployment infrastructure for every tenant for quick set-up.</li>
		<li>Most expensive of all the models from infrastructure cost stand-point.</li><li>Relatively longer deployment time for newer application versions, at scale.&nbsp;</li><li>More wastage from infrastructure resource utilization point of view.</li>
		<li>The application's statelessness criteria for scalability would mean:
			<ul><li>not holding user-request data</li></ul>
		</li>
		<li>Suitability:
		<ul>
			<li>This is the best way to begin your SAAS platform, for product-market fitment until stability and growth.</li>
			<li>When you provide SAAS as white-labelled product.</li>
			<li>When you deploy your SAAS product at client infrastructure, maybe for compliance reasons.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Challenges:
		<ul>
			<li>How do you optimize resources for cost?</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h4>Shared Apps &amp; Shared Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>The most complex beast of all the multi-tenancy architectures.</li>
		<li>Maximizing infra utilization every bit for maximum profitability.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Challenges:&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
		<ul>
			<li>How do you manage as volume of transactions&nbsp; and data increases? The relational database by its virtue is vertically scalable and not horizontally scalable. Now this means it could become a bottleneck sooner than you think as you onboard more and more tenants, depending on the volume of transactions and data.</li>
			<li>In case of SaaS apps that provides lot of customizations on the UI, how do you get this tenant specific configuration optimally for latency? <a href="https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/website" target="_blank">Wix eCommerce</a>, <a href="https://www.shopify.in/tour/ecommerce-website" target="_blank">Shopify</a>, etc.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</div>

<h4>Separate Apps &amp; Shared Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>A model where tenant specific configuration are tied to deployed instances, but all share a common database. The data isolation per client is achieved by prefixing database schema with tenant info.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>You got many web-frameworks and web-plugins supporting this model of prefixing-queries with tenant specific data, to hit the right datasource. For example, <a href="https://github.com/influitive/apartment" target="_blank">apartment</a> (rails/ruby), <a href="https://github.com/tenancy/multi-tenant" target="_blank">multi-tenant</a> (laravel/php), springboot (java), etc.</li>
		<li>Relational database instances are expensive. It way pricier than your application instances and is not as disposable as your compute instances can are. You got to do a bit of forward looking into future for its capacity planning.</li>
		<li>When you are managing your database instance as a SaaS provider and want to optimize on the overall cost, often the easiest thing to do is use shared database.</li>
		<li>The application's statelessness criteria for scalability would mean:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>not holding user-request data</li>
			<li>not holding database-responses</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Challenges:&nbsp;</li>
		<ul>
			<li>How do you manage as volume of transactions&nbsp; and data increases? The relational database by its virtue is vertically scalable and not horizontally scalable. Now this means it could become a bottleneck sooner than you think as you onboard more and more tenants, depending on the volume of transactions and data.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<br>
</div>
<h4>Shared Apps &amp; Separate Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>A request can hit any of the available application instance.</li>
		<li>Tenant specific configuration is got dynamically with every request.</li>
		<li>The application's statelessness criteria for scalability would mean:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>not holding user-request data</li>
			<li>not holding tenant's configuration</li>
			<li>not holding database-responses</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Challenges:&nbsp;</li>
		<ul>
			<li>How do you hit the right database dynamically on a per request basis? How do you do it optimally for latency? Think&nbsp; of Atlassian suite of products like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence" target="_blank">Confluence</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/agile" target="_blank">Jira</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket" target="_blank">Bitbucket </a>etc.</li>
			<li>In case of SaaS apps that provides lot of customization on the UI, how do you get this tenant specific configuration optimally for latency? <a href="https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/website" target="_blank">Wix eCommerce</a>, <a href="https://www.shopify.in/tour/ecommerce-website" target="_blank">Shopify</a>, etc.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul><p>Hope that helps you in your design choice for your SAAS architecture...</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>At the moment Kubernetes is one of the most exciting technologies in the world of DevOps. Recently a lot of hype has formed around it for one simple reason, and this reason is the mighty containers.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-101-2.JPG" alt="Infrastructure"></p>
<p>Once upon a time, and it wasn't so long ago, we still ran applications on server hardware. We had a website that spins on a hardware server and a database that stores the website's state. Users visit the site, everything was cool, everything worked.</p>
<p>The website become successful and our company grows. Then the website becomes more and more complex and evolves into a platform with a <a href="https://luminousmen.com/post/thoughts-on-microservices">bunch of services</a>.</p>
<p>Then along came virtual machines (VMs), and we could run multiple operating systems and applications on a single machine. This empowered company to run ten times or more server instances on a single server. But what if we could run even more server programs on a single server if we left behind the bulk of the VM's operating system? That would give us, even bigger cost savings and flexibility. And the containers came along.</p>
<h2>Docker</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DbqFymX.png" alt="How Docker was born"></p><p>Docker containers have been the de facto development standard for quite some time now, but interestingly enough, Docker is not a pioneer in the container world.</p>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-101-3.JPG" alt="History"></p>
<p>Docker is based on namespaces and cgroups technologies (the first one provides isolation, the second one provides process grouping and resource limitation), so in terms of virtualization, it's not much different from LXC/OpenVZ which historically came first. Same native speed, same isolation methods based on Linux kernel machinery. However, at a higher level, it's a very different story. The highlight of Docker is that it allows you to deploy a fully virtual environment, run an application on it, and easily manage it.</p>
<p>Like a virtual machine, the Docker runs its processes in its own pre-configured operating system. However, all the docker processes run on a physical host server sharing the processors and available memory with all the other processes running in the host system. The approach used by the Docker is in the middle between running everything on the physical server and full virtualization offered by virtual machines. This approach is called <em>containerization</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-101-4.JPG" alt="Docker internals"></p>
<p>Starting with Linux containers, the excitement moved to Docker containers, while increasing the need for <em>container orchestration</em>.</p>
<p>Back to our story. At some point, the company has realized that the current server is not sufficient, no matter how big it is (vertical scaling). The history moves to the next phase — the company buys more servers and divides the load between them (horizontal scaling).</p>
<p>The IT team tasks are getting harder and harder. They need to bother harder with problems like updates, patches, monitoring, security, backups, durability, reliability, resiliency... which means pagerduty at 6 am on Sunday...</p>
<p>Cloud!</p>
<p>Cool, now all we have to worry about is application logic. But the complexity of the highly available distributed system didn't go anywhere — it's just moved to the complexity of orchestrating and connecting the infrastructure components. Deployments, service discovery, gateway configurations, monitoring, replication, consistency...</p>
<p>It was a short story as we have come to this day. Now we have a distributed system with a bunch of services inside a bunch of containers in the cloud.</p>
<h2>Kubernetes</h2>
<p><em>Don't flatter yourself, even though I've been working with Kubernetes I only know the tip of the iceberg. So here will be not a deep dive, but rather a smooth flight over existing subsystems and concepts.</em></p>
<p>Kubernetes is a sophisticated mechanism designed to make systems scalable, resilient, and easy to deploy. It allows us to automate container orchestration — starting, scaling, managing containerized applications including cluster management, scheduling, service discovery, monitoring, secrets management, and more.</p>
<p>Kubernetes allows to automate the start and rollback of deployments, Kubernetes manages the resources and can scale the required resources for the applications depending on how much they need in order to avoid waste of resources. So k8s essentially is <strong>process automation</strong>. Applications in k8s are rolled out and tested without administrators. The developer writes a script and then the cloud magic happens. So, in the ideal world of Kubernetes, all operational support of the software lies on the shoulders of programmers, and administrators make sure that the layer of cloud infrastructure — that is, Kubernetes itself - works steadily. That's why companies go to the clouds to completely remove the routine of their administration and do only development.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one of the coolest features of Kubernetes is that it helps <strong>standardize the work with Cloud Service Provider</strong>. No matter which CSP we are talking about, working with Kubernetes always looks the same. The developer, in a <strong>declarative manner</strong>, tells the Kubernetes what he needs, and Kubernetes works with system resources, helping the developer to abstract from the implementation details of the platform.</p>
<p>Originally, Kubernetes was a Google project that took into account the shortcomings of <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/">Borg</a>, the ancestor of Kubernetes. Google uses Kubernetes to manage its gigantic infrastructure of millions of containers. At some point, Google gave the Kubernetes to the world, namely the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>. So far, Docker has added the Kubernetes as one of the orchestrators — Kubernetes is now part of the Docker Community and Docker Enterprise Edition.</p>
<p>Kubernetes has many names among which are <em>kube</em> or <em>k8s</em> (I like cool acronyms with numbers and will use it further).</p>
<p>The Kubernetes itself is one huge piece of abstraction. These abstractions are mapped to virtual or physical infrastructure. To understand how it works, we must first understand its basic components.</p>
<h3>Pod</h3>
<p>The pod is the smallest unit that can be launched on a cluster node. It is a group of containers that should work together for some reason. The containers in the pod share port numbers, Linux kernel namespaces, and network stack settings. So when you scale your application within k8s, you should increase the number of pods rather than the number of containers in one particular pod. By <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy">default</a> containers inside pods are restarted automatically fixing intermittent problems for you. So even on these basic level k8s keeps your containers running and with a little additional effort, you can tune it to get even more reliability.</p>
<p>Quite often (but not always) there is only one container underneath the pod. But pod abstraction provides additional flexibility when, for example, two containers need to share the same data warehouse, or if there is a connection between them using interprocess communication, or if they are closely connected for some other reason, all this can be implemented by running them in the same pod.</p>
<p>Thus, you can easily draw parallels with existing code primitives and distributed primitives in k8s. Class is a container image, an object is a container instance, a pod is a deployment unit, the composition can be achieved via sidecar pattern, etc.</p>
<p>Another flexibility of pods is that they do not require the use of Docker containers. If necessary, you can also use other application containerization technologies, such as <a href="https://coreos.com/rkt/">rkt</a>.</p>
<h3>Desired state</h3>
<p>The desired state is one of the basic concepts of k8s. You can specify the required state of running pods instead of writing how to achieve that state. For example, if a pod stops working for some reason, k8s will recreate the pod based on the specified desired state.</p>
<p>K8s always checks the state of the containers in the cluster, and this is done by the control loops on the so-called Kubernetes Master, which is part of the control plane. We'll talk about it a bit later.</p>
<h3>Objects in Kubernetes</h3>
<p>An object in k8s is a record of intent — the desired cluster state. And after the object is created, the k8s will constantly check for this object state. In addition, the objects also serve as an additional abstraction layer above the container interface. You can interact with the objects' entities instead of interacting directly with containers.</p>
<p>Almost every k8s object includes two nested object fields that govern the object's configuration: the object spec and the object status.</p>
<p><strong>Pod</strong> that we talked about earlier is just one of the k8s objects.</p>
<p>Pods are mortal — they are born and die but in order to be able to communicate with pods and for them to be able to communicate with each other abstraction of the <strong>Service</strong> has been introduced. Service plays the role of an access point to sets of pods that provide the same functionality as the underlying pods. There are different types of services, ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName. By default k8s use ClusterIP — it exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP, so you can only access it using the Kubernetes proxy.</p>
<p>Also for exposing services you can use <strong>Ingress</strong> object. Ingress is not a Service type, but it acts as an entry point for your cluster. Ingress is a description of how traffic should flow from outside the cluster to your services, it acts as a "smart router" or ALB. It allows you to consolidate routing rules into a single resource, as it can aggregate multiple services under a single IP address.</p>
<p>For example, the web application can have a home page at <a href="https://example.com/">https://example.com</a> and a shopping cart at <a href="https://example.com/cart">https://example.com/cart</a> and an API at <a href="https://example.com/api">https://example.com/api</a>. We could implement all of them in one pod, but in order for all of them to scale independently, we could decouple them into different pods and connect to Ingress.</p>
<p>K8s also has a huge number of controllers, such as <strong>ReplicaSet</strong> — it checks that a certain number of copies of pods are running, <strong>StatefulSet</strong> is used with stateful applications and distributed systems, <strong>DemonSet</strong> is used to copy pods to all nodes in the cluster or only to specified nodes, etc. They all implement a control loop — a non-terminating loop that monitors the state of its subsystems, then makes or requests …</p></div></div>

        <h3>Contributing to the Laravel ecosystem</h3><p>This morning I discovered a useful <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Laravel package</a> for generating download links for files, that has some useful features, like expiry time, restricted IP addresses.</p><p>One thing was missing: assigning the DownloadLink for a specific user, so for example when somebody purchases a digital product we can generate a DownloadLink that will only allow him to download the file, and nobody else.</p><p>So I thought this is a good opportunity to contribute to the Laravel ecosystem 💡. I went ahead and <a href="https://github.com/Yiddishe-Kop/laravel-download-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forked the repo</a>, added the functionality to assign a DownloadLink to a user, &amp; submitted a <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link/pull/9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pull-request</a> (PR) to the owner of the repo, with a detailed explanation what I'm doing.</p><p>The owner of the repo was very fast, and within an hour already added some more features (assigning DownloadLinks to a list of users) and added tests. This is unlike some <a href="https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/141" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other PRs</a> I opened, that are currently waiting for months...</p><h3>Tehran, Iran</h3><p>Some time later I checked back on the PR, and I was surprised to see that it has been closed, and not merged 😕. I opened it up, and this is what greeted me:</p><blockquote>Hi, Thanks for your great idea. I'm SO SORRY to tell you that I cannot merge this PR. There is a law in my country that we MUST NOT have any relationship with people from Israel or the Israel government. I hope you understand this, and again thanks for your time.</blockquote><p>Turns out he's from Tehran, Iran; and he saw on my <a href="https://github.com/Yiddishe-Kop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a> that I'm from Jerusalem, Israel.</p><p>I was very surprised and also hurt. This is the first time I experienced the conflict between Israel &amp; Iran first hand. I also never thought that Iran would have has such laws.</p><p>But hey, maybe I'm a Palestinian living in Jerusalem? Or does Iranian law not differentiate?! 🙃 <em>[...aaahhh, my profile name is</em>  <strong>yiddishe-kop</strong> <em>😉]</em></p><p>I thought for a moment how to respond, and this is how I replied:</p><blockquote>That's very sad, @armancodes. I hope one day your country removes this restriction, just like my country has never put such restrictions. However I'm sure that your governments restrictions don't represent your views 🤷‍♂️ . Good luck anyway! 😃</blockquote><h3>What's with the code?</h3><p>I'll probably just have to continue working on my fork of the repo for my own needs, but without being able to collaborate together, it is a loss for the open source community.</p><p>Let's hope that the Iranian people will be freed from their ayatollahs, and be able to collaborate with whoever they want.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I do a fair amount of interviews, 60+ during the six months prior to COVID and during those I have noticed some common mistakes candidates make during the interview that are highly avoidable, so I thought I’d spend just a little bit of time writing those down and share them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="1---not-asking-clarification-questions">#1 - Not Asking Clarification Questions</h3>
<p>Normally all tech companies make candidates go through at least one round of technical interview, where a problem is presented and the candidate needs to address it and solve it. This interviews can vary in form, ie. coding challenges where the candidate needs to do hands-on coding, architectural interviews where the candidate would need to design some “bigger” system and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Regardless of what type of technical question you may be asked, it is very important to ask clarifying questions <strong>always</strong>. And I can’t stress enought the <strong>always</strong> here, even if you think the problem given is trivial, it is not, take a bit of time to think about it and questions will pop up in your mind. For instance, if I asked you during an coding interview:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<em>given a list of numbers, return two numbers such that one times the other results in 220</em>”</li>
</ul>
<p>You could think that this two-sentence problem is very clear. However questions that I would ask are “<em>is the list sorted</em>…<em>are the numbers unique</em>…<em>can I multiply a number to itself</em>…<em>what shall I return if there are multiple numbers meeting the criteria</em>”.</p>
<p>Asking clarifying questions is however not only important for you to provide the best solution possible. It is also important because it is what I would expect you to do in real life when coming in to my team and you’re given a problem to solve. I would expect you to ask questions to further scope the problem, discover corner cases, etc. and not just go back to your desk and start coding.</p>
<p>I normally tell candidates upfront “<em>feel free to ask any question that helps you clarify</em>”. If you are given that cue, it is because it is important for the process. Stop, think, and ask the questions that will surely pop up.</p>
<h3 id="2---not-keeping-your-interviewer-engaged">#2 - Not keeping your interviewer engaged</h3>
<p>There was a time where I found this sentence just be BS. I thought that the interview process was just about me solving or answering questions. I was dead wrong. Any good interview process is a two-way street, a process where the interviewer and the candidate <strong>collaborate</strong> during however long the interview is. And because they are collaborating, it is very important to keep the other party engaged.</p>
<p>“<em>How do I keep my interviewer engaged?</em>” you may ask. It is extremely simple, just <strong>think out loud</strong>, let the interviewer know how and where your thoughts are taking you. I know this can feel odd, or you may fear saying anything stupid, don’t. There is literally nothing you may say that would be interpreted as stupid.</p>
<p>Thinking out loud during an problem solving interview has several advantages in my opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li>the obvious, you keep your interviewer engaged. We are all humans and it is very easy for us to let our mind wander off for a moment if the candidate is just silent while e.g. coding for 30 minutes. And as unfair as it might sound, an interviewer not paying attention, does not play on your side</li>
<li>the less obvious, it gives you more time. There are numerous instances where candidates that I interviewed just go silent during their coding or their architectural challenge and after a few minutes they just come with the solution. At that point I have lots of questions about the trade-offs they made, why they made them etc. Many of those questions could have been avoided by just walking me through that thought process, and that saves time that might be especially important when the solution is not completely correct.</li>
<li>the none obvious at all. <strong>Good interviewers are there to help you</strong>. Believe me, all good interviewers I know <strong>want the candidate to pass the interview</strong> and will do whatever possible (and within their limits) to help you succeed. So giving them early feedback on why/what/how you’re doing what you’re doing let them help you as soon as possible. For example, if I see that they path you’re taking will get you to a very bad solution, I will try to  ask subtle questions to make you to re-think about your current proposal and other possible trade-offs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3---not-prepare-for-the-interview">#3 - Not prepare for the interview</h3>
<p>This mistake may seem very hard to make, right? Who comes to an interview for a tech company not having done tons of leetcode problems, studying algorithms and data structures to the limit?
Well, this is one side of the preparation, the other one however is not so obvious.</p>
<p>Most tech companies have rounds of behavioral interviews and although these may or may not involve certain technical (very high level) questions, you also need to prepare for these. These kinds of interviews are more like an open discussion where you will be asked things related to your previous projects, your background, certain situations you faced in the past and how you approached them, interactions with your team mates, how have you led projects (if applicable), etc. And for all these, it is better to come prepared.</p>
<p>When I say prepared, I don’t mean that you invent, or “fake” the answers to these types of questions, believe me when I tell you that it is relatively easy to know when any of that is true with just two-three follow up questions.
What I mean when I say prepare is that you should spend some time thinking about those kinds of past situations, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>that time you led that project that was slipping the deadline, how did you approach that? what did you do? what was the outcome? what did you learn?</li>
<li>that time you were given not so good feedback by some of your peers, think about what you learnt, how you felt, how you dealt with that and what changed moving forward</li>
<li>that time you had to give feedback to some of your peers that was hard for you to give, think about how you did it, would you do it in the same way today? how do you think it went now in retrospect?</li>
<li>that time you were given a problem that required more broader knowledge than what you had at that moment, what did you do? how did you deliver/ did you enjoy the challenge or was it stressful?</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>I see this preparation as going back to your past memories and reflect on them. This will help during the interview as your thoughts will be already in order and you will not have to pause for minutes to think about what to say, you will just know what past experience is most relevant for that moment, believe me.</p>
<p>It is also very important to remember, be <strong>completely honest</strong>. In these kinds of interviews there is no right or wrong answer, we are just trying to get to know you a bit better, your motives and motivations, where you excel and where there is still potential improvement, etc. All this helps you and the hiring manager have a good start on your first day at work.</p>

<![CDATA[An interesting mistake with Go's context package]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>An interesting mistake with Go's <code>context</code> package that I (sort of) made</h2>

	<p><small>August 29, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Today, <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/">Dave Cheney</a> did another Go pop quiz
<a href="https://twitter.com/davecheney/status/1299846267850223616">on Twitter</a>,
where he asked whether the following code printed -6, 0, '&lt;nil&gt;', or
paniced:</p>

<blockquote><pre>package main
</pre>

<pre>import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
)

func f(ctx context.Context) {
    context.WithValue(ctx, "foo", -6)
}

func main() {
    ctx := context.TODO()
    f(ctx)
    fmt.Println(ctx.Value("foo"))
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn't answer this correctly because I focused my attention on the
wrong thing.</p>

<p>What I focused on was the use of the <code>"foo"</code> string as the context
key, partly because of my experience with languages like Python.
To start with, the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/context/"><code>context</code></a>
package's documentation says:</p>

<blockquote><p>The provided key must be comparable and should not be of type string
or any other built-in type to avoid collisions between packages using
context. Users of WithValue should define their own types for keys.
[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A traditional problem in languages like Python is that two strings
may compare the same without actually being the same thing, and
some code really wants you to present it with the exact same thing.
However, the <code>context</code> package doesn't require that you present it
with the exact same key, just a key where the <em>interface value</em> of
the key will compare the same.</p>

<p>(Because <code>context</code> compares interface values, both the value and
the type must match; it's not enough for both values to have the
same underlying concrete type, say string, and to compare identical.
This is why defining your own string type is a reliable away around
collisions between packages.)</p>

<p>So after I worked through all of this, I confidently answered that
this code printed -6. The <code>"foo"</code> string that the value is set
with is not necessarily the same <code>"foo"</code> string that it's retrieved
with, but that doesn't matter. However, this is not the problem
with the code. The actual problem is that <strong>context.WithValue()
returns a new context with the value set, it doesn't change the
context it's called on</strong>. Dave Cheney's code is written as if
<code>.WithValue()</code> mutates the current context, as <code>f()</code> ignores that
new context that <code>.WithValue()</code> provides and returns nothing to
<code>main()</code>. Since the original <code>context</code> in <code>main()</code> is what <code>.Value()</code>
is called on, it has no <code>"foo"</code> key and the result is actually
'&lt;nil&gt;'.</p>

<p>This problem with the code is actually a quite interesting mistake,
because as far as I can tell right now none of the usual Go style
checkers detect it. This code passes '<code>go vet</code>', it produces no
complaints from <a href="https://github.com/kisielk/errcheck"><code>errcheck</code></a>
because we're not ignoring an error return value, and tools like
<a href="https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint">golangci-lint</a> only
complain about the use of the built-in type string as the key in
<code>.WithValue()</code>. Nothing seems to notice that we're ignoring the
critical return value from <code>.WithValue()</code>, which turns it into more
or less a no-op.</p>

<p>(Now that Dave Cheney has brought this to the surface, I suspect
that someone will contribute a check for it to <a href="https://staticcheck.io/">staticcheck</a>, which already detects the 'using a
built-in type as a key' issue.)</p>

Preface
</summary>

  <p>I wrote this article to introduce the Internet to a non-technical audience.
In order to get everyone on board,
I first explain basic concepts, such as
<a href="#communication-protocol">communication protocols</a>,
<a href="#network-topologies">network topologies</a>,
and <a href="#signal-routing">signal routing</a>.
The section about <a href="#internet-layers">Internet layers</a> becomes increasingly technical
and peaks with a deep dive into <a href="#domain-name-system-security-extensions"><abbr title="Domain Name System Security Extensions">DNSSEC</abbr></a>.
If the beginning is too elementary for you,
then just skip ahead to more interesting sections.</p>

  <p>Due to the nature of the topic,
this article contains a lot of acronyms.
Many of them are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym">three-letter acronyms (<abbr title="Three-Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr>)</a>,
but some are longer,
which makes them extended three-letter acronyms (<abbr title="Extended Three-Letter Acronym">ETLA</abbr>).
While I introduce most of the acronyms before using them,
you can simply hover over a <abbr title="Three-Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr> or an <abbr title="Extended Three-Letter Acronym">ETLA</abbr> with your mouse
if you forgot what they stand for.
If you are reading this on a touch device,
you have to touch the acronym instead.</p>

  <p>Let’s get right into it:
What is a protocol?</p>

</details>

<h2 id="communication-protocol">Communication protocol</h2>

<h3 id="communication-diagram">Communication diagram</h3>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol">communication protocol</a>
specifies how two parties can exchange information for a specific purpose.
In particular, it determines which messages are to be transmitted in what order.
If the two parties are computers,
a formal, well-defined protocol is easiest to implement.
In order to illustrate what is going on, however,
let’s first look at an informal protocol,
also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette">etiquette</a>,
which we’re all too familiar with:</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram">sequence diagram</a>
and it highlights the temporal dimension of a protocol
in which messages are exchanged sequentially.</p>

<h3 id="communication-parties">Communication parties</h3>

<p>It also illustrates that communication is commonly initiated by one party,
whereby the recipient responds to the requests of the initiator.
Please note that this is only the case for one-to-one protocols,
in which each message is intended for a single recipient.</p>

<details>
  <summary id="broadcasting-and-information-security">
Broadcasting and information security
</summary>

  <p>There are also one-to-many protocols for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting">broadcasting</a>.
These are typically one-way protocols,
in which the recipients do not acknowledge the receipt of the transferred data.
Examples for such protocols are analog radio
or churches ringing their bells to indicate the time of day.
Both in the case of a single recipient and in the case of a broad target audience,
anyone with access to the physical medium and the right sensors receives the signal.
The difference is simply that,
in the former case,
entities ignore the messages
which are not addressed to them.
If the messages are not encrypted,
others can still read them, though.
And if the messages are not authenticated,
a malicious party might be able to alter them in transit.
Even when messages are encrypted and authenticated,
their exchange can still be interrupted,
by not relaying some messages
or by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_jamming">jamming</a> the signal.
The properties Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
form the so-called <abbr title="Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability">CIA</abbr> triad of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security">information security</a>.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="communication-channel">Communication channel</h3>

<p>The above greeting protocol is used among humans
to establish a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_channel">communication channel</a> for a longer exchange.
In technical jargon,
such an exchange in preparation for the actual communication is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking">handshake</a>.
The greeting protocol checks the recipient’s availability and willingness to engage in a conversation.
When talking to someone you have never spoken before,
it also ensures that the recipient understands your language.
I’ve chosen these two examples for their figurative value.
Why we actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeting">greet</a> each other
is mainly for different reasons:
To show our good intentions by making our presence known to each other,
to signal sympathy and courtesy by asking the superficial question,
and to indicate our relative social status to each other and to bystanders.
Another benefit of asking such a question is that,
even though it’s very shallow,
it makes the responder more likely to do you a favor
due to the psychological effect of
<a href="https://www.influenceatwork.com/principles-of-persuasion/#consistency">commitment and consistency</a>.</p>

<h2 id="handling-of-anomalies">Handling of anomalies</h2>

<h3 id="protocol-deviation">Protocol deviation</h3>

<p>Since your communication partner can be erratic,
a protocol needs to be able to handle deviations:</p>

<p>In order to detect transmission errors,
computers typically append a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum</a> to each message,
which the recipient then verifies.
The need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retransmission_(data_networks)">retransmit</a> messages
can be reduced by adding redundancy to messages
so that the recipient can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction">detect and correct small errors</a> on their own.
A simple and very inefficient way of doing this is to repeat the content within each message several times.</p>

<h3 id="connection-loss">Connection loss</h3>

<p>It can also happen that a party loses their connection permanently,
for example by moving too far away for the signal to reach the recipient.
Since a conversation requires some attention from the communication partner,
abandoning a conversation unilaterally without notifying the other party
can be misused to block them from talking to someone else for some time.
In order to avoid binding resources for a prolonged period of time
and thereby potentially falling victim to a so-called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">denial-of-service attack</a>,
computers drop connections after a configurable duration of inactivity:</p>

they can arrive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_delivery">out of order</a>:</p>

  <figcaption>
Bob’s second message (in blue) arrives after his third message (in green).
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The solution for this is to enumerate all messages,
to reorder them on arrival,
and to ask the other party to retransmit any missing messages,
as we saw <a href="#data-corruption">above</a>.</p>

<h3 id="lack-of-interoperability">Lack of interoperability</h3>

<p>Besides defining the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax">syntax</a> (the format),
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">semantics</a> (the meaning),
and the order of the messages,
a protocol should also specify how to handle anomalies like the above.
Ambiguity in a standard
and willful deviation therefrom
result in incompatibilities between different implementations.
In combination with a lack of established standards in many areas,
which often leads to uncoordinated efforts by various parties,
incompatibilities are quite common in computer systems,
unfortunately.
This causes a lot of frustration for users and programmers,
who have to find workarounds for the encountered limitations,
but this cannot be avoided in a free market of ideas and products.</p>

<h2 id="network-topologies">Network topologies</h2>

<h3 id="communication-network">Communication network</h3>

<p>In practice, there are almost always more than two parties
who want to communicate with each other.
Together with the connections between them,
they form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network">communication network</a>.
For the scope of this article,
we’re only interested in symmetric networks,
where everyone who can receive can also send.
This is not the case for analog radio and television networks,
where signals are broadcasted unidirectionally from the sender to the receivers.
In the case of our symmetric networks,
two entities are part of the same network
if they can communicate with each other.
If they cannot reach each other,
they belong to separate networks.</p>

<h3 id="nodes-and-links">Nodes and links</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)">Nodes</a> are the entities
that communicate with each other over communication <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link">links</a>.
We can visualize this as follows:</p>

<p>The terminology is borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a>,
where nodes are also called vertices
and links are also called edges.
The technical term for the structure of a network is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology">topology</a>.
Different arrangements of nodes and links lead to different characteristics of the resulting network.</p>

A fully connected network with five nodes and ten links.

</figure>

<p>In graph theory, such a layout is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph">complete graph</a>.
Fully connected networks scale badly
as the number of links grows quadratically with the number of nodes.
You might have encountered the formula for the number of links before:
n × (n – 1) / 2, with n being the number of nodes in the network.
As a consequence, this topology is impractical for larger networks.</p>

<h3 id="star-network">Star network</h3>

<p>The number of links can be reduced considerably by introducing a central node,
which forwards the communication between the other nodes.
In such a star-shaped network,
the number of links scales linearly with the number of nodes.
In other words,
if you double the number of nodes,
you also double the number of links.
In a fully connected network, you would have quadrupled the number …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="sapper"> <div>  <main> <div>  <p>My entire worldview changed when I realized that <strong>luck can be created</strong>.</p> <p>More precisely, you can actively <strong>create optimal conditions for lucky things to happen to you</strong>. The more I looked into this, the more I realized that this is not only <em>not</em> a new insight, but successful people have studied this for <em>decades</em> and I am just late to the party.</p> <p>In this post we'll briefly review the "Literature of Luck", and then I'll end with some personal thoughts on how it could be extended.</p> <section> <h2 id="binary-luck">Binary Luck</h2> <p>Most people have a binary view of luck:</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/kgd335km9x3ujfmhxnz7.png"> </p> <p>This is true enough. Some people are born into privilege, some people just win some literal or figurative lottery or other.</p> <p>The closing question of every episode of Guy Raz's <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this">How I Built This</a> podcast asks successful people: <em>"How much of your success is due to skill, and how much is due to luck?"</em></p> <p>Those who believe in their own agency answer the former. Others - who've seen people smarter and harder working than them fail - answer the latter. Those who are politically correct cop-out with the half-and-half.</p> <p>It can be comforting to subscribe to the binary luck model. If you just got a bad roll of the dice, there's nothing you could do. Your lack of success is not your fault.</p> <p>But what if I told you <strong>there are people who have skill at creating luck</strong> for themselves?</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="luck-surface-area">Luck Surface Area</h2> <p>Jason Roberts coined the term "<a href="https://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area">Luck Surface Area</a>", and it was expanded by <a href="https://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2019/04/03/increase-your-luck-surface-area-to-get-more-customers/">Sean Murphy</a> and popularized by <a href="https://www.perell.com/podcast/patrick-mckenzie-internet-famous">Patrick McKenzie</a>.</p> <p>I liken this model of luckiness to a "catchment area" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchment_area">a term from urban and hydrological geography</a>). Luck is still randomly occurring, but you can position yourself in a way that captures more of it:</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ogbkk8weenqb9nltrl34.png"> </p> <p>Jason has a really simple model of how to grow your LSA - do more things, and tell more people about it. <strong>Doing and Telling</strong>. Already this embodies a more active attitude toward how you can orient your life for more positive random events. It's "<a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Fixed vs Growth mindset</a>" adapted for luck.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="four-kinds-of-luck">Four Kinds of Luck</h2> <p>A parallel, older school of thought dates back to James Austin in 1978 and was repopularized by <a href="https://pmarchive.com/luck_and_the_entrepreneur.html">Marc Andreesen</a> in 2007, then <a href="https://twitter.com/nivi/status/1094940675353784320?lang=en">Naval and Nivi</a> a decade later.</p> <p>Here, there are no helpful visuals. James Austin just gives a list of types, and Marc quotes verbatim. <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1093981014920052736">Naval summarizes</a> the 4 kinds of luck as such:</p> <blockquote> <ol> <li> <p>Hope luck finds you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hustle until you stumble into it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances others miss.</p> </li> <li> <p>Become the best at what you do. Refine what you do until this is true. Opportunity will seek you out. Luck becomes your destiny.</p> </li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>I've quoted this many times to friends and always had trouble remembering what the 4 types are. I gave it some thought and visualized/organized it as such:</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/5ycsicfgoxsvxoyys5ip.png"> </p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>🌱 Accidental Luck</strong>: You have the same luck as a plant. A plant does not move. Whether or not a plant does well pretty much just depends on where it's seed lands. It's not very interesting since by definition you can't do anything about it, but ofc privilege plays a huge part.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>🏃🏽‍♀️ Active Luck</strong>: The luck you get from constantly moving around. There's no particular direction in mind, but you're more likely to find something good if you move around and explore instead of stay put and hope. You're more likely to roll a 6 if you roll more dice.</p> <blockquote> <p>"I have never heard of anyone stumbling on something sitting down." - <a href="https://due.com/blog/keep-going-charles-f-kettering/">Charles Kettering</a></p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p><strong>💊 Prepared Luck</strong>: The luck you get from noticing that something lucky has happened, that most would miss. The canonical story on this is Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin, which was a huge medical breakthrough. The discovery was a total accident (some mold happened to fall in the right spot + Fleming happened to see it + he had a similar experience that was a nonevent 9 years ago), but Fleming was not only "uniquely equipped to observe it" by his background, he took action to confirm the observation.</p> <blockquote> <p>"Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity." - Seneca</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"Chance favors the prepared mind." - Louis Pasteur</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say: “How did he do it? He must be a genius!”" - <a href="http://themattheweffect.org/tag/richard-feynman/">Gian-Carlo Rota</a></p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p><strong>🧲 Magnetic Luck</strong>: <em>"Chance IV comes to you, unsought, because of who you are and how you behave."</em> All sources call it "individualized action" but I've renamed it "magnetic luck" to emphasize the end result rather than how you get there. I'm quite familiar with this as <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learning-gears/#miner">the "Miner" gear of my Learning Gears</a> terminology (since updated to 4 gears in <a href="https://learninpublic.org/">my book</a>). This was already a thing pre-Internet, but search and social media have given tremendous reach and influence to the oddballs and obsessives that become the spiritual leaders of every idea and purpose both big and niche.</p> </li> </ol> <p>I find the 4 of these hard to remember, so I've organized them along two axes - <strong>active vs passive</strong>, and <strong>general vs individual</strong>. The first axis is the same realization as "Luck Surface Area" - you actually have the power to do things to create more luck than you were given.</p> <p>The second axis is the insight - that there are forms of luck that apply to everyone, and there are forms of luck that are available only to someone in your unique position. There is a you-shaped hole in the universe and you can either passively occupy it or you can become a beacon for some idea or purpose.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="habits-and-strategy">Habits and Strategy</h2> <p>I of course find the Four Kinds of Luck very appealing, since I've quoted it so much to friends that I'm writing this post at all. But upon closer reading I think there's a <em>slightly</em> different direction that is unaddressed by the Four Kinds (I originally thought this was embedded in the Four Kinds, only to discover that it wasn't in the source material and I had completely read my own thinking into it).</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/poue5zg9homy1eo4ml05.png"> </p> <p>This model differs in two ways. It treats both axes as a spectrum rather than a 2x2. It also focuses more on <strong>actions</strong> (you can take) rather than <strong>classification</strong> (which are a little more abstract). I've also swapped out "Active vs Passive" for "Active Habits" and "Individual vs General" for "Good Strategy". So my version is more about HOW you get more lucky. It's not very actionable to be "more magnetic", but you can Claim a Domain or Hustle and have a good sense of what those things entail.</p> <p>I've written about a few of these ideas in prior posts so I won't elaborate:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/marketing-yourself/">Claiming a Domain, Personal Branding</a></li> <li>"Copywork" I wrote about in the "Clone Open Source Apps" chapter of the book</li> </ul> <p>I think <strong>Exploring</strong> and <strong>Prospecting</strong> are worth elaborating here.</p> <p><strong>Exploring</strong> (and to a lesser extent Grinding and Copywork) are <strong>Actively Habitual, non Strategic</strong> activities. But this doesn't mean it is bad. I think this is what you do when you take in general life and career advice and apply them to yourself. You know there are a list of <strong>Principles</strong> which are just generally good things to do in life, and trust that you will do well if you do those things (e.g. <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/">Learn in Public</a>). Keep doing the "right" things, and "trust the process".</p> <p><strong>Prospecting</strong> is a term I've <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospecting">borrowed from the oil exploration industry</a>. <strong>Prospecting is a highly Active habit, and highly Strategic.</strong> These days, when you look for oil, there is a whole science to handicapping whether or not a plot of land is likely to have oil. You don't know it for a fact, all you're doing is estimating probabilities. Not to get too tautological, but you will be luckier if you can consistently assess and move towards areas where you are more likely to be "lucky". It might look like luck to others, but the motion and intention you invested to get yourself in a position to be lucky was far from random. I've also written many times about how I think strategic <a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=swyx.io+%22megatrends%22&amp;oq=swyx.io+%22megatrends%22">manoeuvring for "Megatrends"</a> is a good idea.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/5075sq79y4pstxpp4pdk.png"> </p> <p>This is the state of my thinking on luck right now. That last bit you just read is pretty fresh, I might come back and change this in a couple years when I have refined my thoughts. I welcome any and all feedback.</p> <p>But overall, the message I really want to leave you with is this: <strong>you can create luck</strong>. That's it. I don't care how you do it, what mental model you use, who you quote. I just care <em>that</em> you do it. <strong>Go make yourself more lucky.</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>Ordinarily I'd wish you good luck, but now you have something better than a mere wish 😂</p> </blockquote> </section> <hr>  </div> </main>  </div></div></div>]]>

            </header>

            <p>There has been a lot of work going on in Core Customer over the last few months to migrate our OIDC/OAuth2 identity service from our tactical container platform to on-premises Kubernetes clusters. I’ve spoken about our homebrew container platform (Corbenetes) before, but here’s the essentials.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We built a container platform using Chef and Docker as a stepping stone to Kubernetes. It utilised our existing apps-on-virtual-machines deployment and operational patterns, and so this allowed Software Engineers to develop their applications in a cloud-native manner in a familiar way, and without needing to use the (at the time) brand new Kubernetes platform.</p>

  <p>Now we have a very high level of confidence in said new Kubernetes platform, we are migrating projects over and decommissioning our middle-ground solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The migration actually went a lot smoother than we anticipated, especially seeing as this is the first large-scale service we have built on Kubernetes. One thing we hadn’t initially accounted for was the different ways in which health checks would be used by the underlying platform to detect whether or not traffic should be sent to a specific container. For some context, our current Corbenetes architecture looks similar to the below with one traefik container and two app containers per host (alongside a number of supporting containers for logging and metrics that aren’t shown here).</p>

<p><img src="https://sbg.technology/images/zero-downtime-kubernetes/corbenetes_architecture.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Traefik acts as a proxy, handling both TLS-termination and sending requests to the two backends that are available on the host. The upstream load balancer examines the health endpoints of the applications (via traefik) as well as traefik’s own <code>/ping</code> endpoint. When we do a restart of the application as part of a release, we stop traefik, which allows existing connections to the application to clear down, and takes it out of service in the load balancer so no further requests are sent to this host. Once the applications have finished dealing with their requests, they too are closed down. Because of this, the shutdown of the application itself doesn’t need to be the cleanest, as by the time it receives the shutdown signal there are no requests being served by it.</p>

<p>The following image shows our current architecture now we’re on Kuberbetes, again very high level. We have traefik and app Pods, each exposed with a Service (essentially a cluster of Pods and a policy allowing access to them). The traefik Service is exposed outside the cluster to allow incoming connections from the load balancer, and we make use of the Ingress resource to direct traffic destined for specific URLs to the app backend Service.</p>

<p><img src="https://sbg.technology/images/zero-downtime-kubernetes/kubernetes_architecture.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="how-kubernetes-handles-health-checks">How Kubernetes handles health checks</h2>

<p>Our health checks are defined as part of our Deployment manifest, for both traefik and the application. Initially we used the same health check endpoints as we had been using previously. Our manifest looked a little like this.</p>

<h3 id="traefik">traefik</h3>

<div><div><pre><code>livenessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 80
    scheme: HTTP
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 80
    scheme: HTTP
  periodSeconds: 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="application">application</h3>

<div><div><pre><code>livenessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 8081
    scheme: HTTP
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 8081
    scheme: HTTP
  periodSeconds: 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This seemed to work out alright. Our Pods were up and running when we expected them to be, and when we force stopped the application, the health check went bad and the Pod was deleted. It was at this point we started doing extensive performance testing of the application on this new platform. We noticed an issue with cold starts. It appeared that the first time a non-health check request was made to each application Pod, the response time was around <strong>six seconds</strong>. The was obviously a suboptimal situation, and another reason why we do lots of performance testing using production-like load profiles.</p>

<p>After this first slow response, the application was absolutely fine. Turns out that the application doesn’t compile its JavaScript components until the first page load.</p>

<h2 id="its-alive-but-is-it-ready">It’s alive, but is it ready?</h2>

<p>It’s almost as though the team that built Kubernetes knew this would be a thing, as they specifically define both a <code>livenessProbe</code> and a <code>readinessProbe</code> that can be applied to the Pods. Their <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/">own documentation</a> explains the difference between the two:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>livenessProbe</strong> defines when to restart a container, e.g. the <code>/ping</code> endpoint returns a bad response</li>
  <li><strong>readinessProbe</strong> defines when a container is ready to start accepting traffic, e.g. a script has run to synchronise data in your stateful application</li>
</ul>

<p>In our case, we needed to change our <code>readinessProbe</code> to try and load the <code>/login</code> endpoint, and allow the application to be properly ready for accepting <strong>all</strong> traffic, not just health check traffic.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 5
  httpGet:
    path: /login?client_id=auth_provider
    port: 8081
  initialDelaySeconds: 25
  periodSeconds: 10
  timeoutSeconds: 1
  successThreshold: 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This was a great success. Each Pod took about 15 seconds longer to start, but that’s a small price to pay to be confident in the ability of the Pod to handle traffic straight away. We went back to our performance testing and low and behold… we still saw issues with dropped requests during an application release, or scale down of the Pods.</p>

<p>Something about how this application works did not appreciate the way in which Kubernetes was terminating it.</p>

<h2 id="let-me-down-gently">Let me down gently</h2>

<p>When Kubernetes decides that it needs to terminate a Pod (whether this be to evacuate a host, move things around for resource utilisation purposes, or just because there is change to the Deployment warranting the creation of new Pods) it sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> (graceful shutdown request) to PID 1 of the container and waits for up to thirty seconds. In our case, PID 1 was the <code>node</code> parent process.</p>

<p>Remember the way we used to stop the applications on Corbenetes? We’d cut them off from receiving new requests and then eventually stop the application itself. Because at a basic level there is no link in Kubernetes between the state of the application Pods, and the state of the traefik Pods, we can’t hide the application behind traefik any more.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we had a way around this. We could use the Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/">container hooks</a> to implement a PreStop hook to do something <em>before</em> Kubernetes attempts to stop the container. We knew that straight killing the <code>node</code> parent was bad, even if it was graceful, so we experimented with the best way to gracefully terminate the container.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>lifecycle:
  preStop:
    exec:
      command: [
        "sh", "-c", "sleep 2 &amp;&amp; kill -15 $(pidof node | awk '{print $1}') &amp;&amp; sleep 2"
      ]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We ended up with this PreStop hook, which waits a couple of seconds, then sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> to the <code>node</code> child process, before waiting for another couple of seconds.</p>

<p>We went back to our performance tests and it was smoother than the proverbial. No matter how aggressively we were terminating Pods and restarting Deployments (the quickest way to test a release without actually releasing), we saw absolutely no degradation in service whatsoever.</p>

<p>This was all fine and dandy, but it taught us an important lesson: even if you are moving from one container-based platform to another, there is no such thing as a lift-and-shift. Each of them have their own nuances that need to be addressed. Now we know that Kubernetes is our standard, and we know how to handle zero-downtime deployments for our applications, we can properly spec out work in future, and not spend days chasing our tail trying to work out why it doesn’t just work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Recently, I came across a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/i48b5q/for_those_that_work_for_a_team_that_has_both_data/" target="_blank">Reddit thread</a> on the different roles in data science and machine learning: data scientist, decision scientist, product data scientist, data engineer, machine learning engineer, machine learning tooling engineer, AI architect, etc.</p>

<p>I found this <em>worrying</em>. It’s difficult to be effective when the data science process (problem framing, data engineering, ML, deployment/maintenance) is split across different people. It leads to coordination overhead, diffusion of responsibility, and lack of a big picture view.</p>

<p>IMHO, <strong>I believe data scientists can be more effective by being end-to-end</strong>. Here, I’ll discuss the <a href="#from-start-identify-the-problem-to-finish-solve-it">benefits</a> and <a href="#but-we-need-specialist-experts-too">counter-arguments</a>, <a href="#the-best-way-to-pick-it-up-is-via-learning-by-doing">how to</a> become end-to-end, and the experiences of <a href="#end-to-end-in-stitch-fix-and-netflix">Stitch Fix and Netflix</a>.</p>

<h2 id="from-start-identify-the-problem-to-finish-solve-it">From start (identify the problem) to finish (solve it)</h2>

<p>You may have come across similar <em>labels</em> and definitions, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-shouldnt-be-a-data-science-generalist-f69ea37cdd2c" target="_blank">Generalist</a>: Focused on roles (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_manager" target="_blank">PM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analyst" target="_blank">BA</a>, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/content/data-engineering-a-quick-and-simple-definition/" target="_blank">DE</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Data_scientists" target="_blank">DS</a>, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-does-a-machine-learning-engineer-do" target="_blank">MLE</a>); some negative connotation</li>
  <li><a href="https://skillcrush.com/blog/front-end-back-end-full-stack/" target="_blank">Full-stack</a>: Focused on tech (Spark, Torch, Docker); popularized by full-stack devs</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3429185/stop-searching-for-that-data-science-unicorn.html" target="_blank">Unicorn</a>: Focused on mythology; believed not to exist</li>
</ul>

<p>I find these definitions to be more prescriptive than I prefer. Instead, I have a simple (and pragmatic) definition: An end-to-end data scientist can <strong>identify and solve problems with data, to deliver value</strong>. To achieve the goal, they’ll wear as many (or as little) hats as required. They’ll also learn and apply whatever tech, methodology, and process that works. Throughout the process, they ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the problem? Why is it important?</li>
  <li>Can we solve it? How should we solve it?</li>
  <li>What is the estimated value? What was the actual value?</li>
</ul>

<details><summary>Data Science Processes</summary>
<div>
<p>Another way of defining end-to-end data science is via processes. These processes are usually complex and I’ve left them out of the main discussion. Nonetheless, here are a few in case you’re curious:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining" target="_blank">CRISP-DM</a>: Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (1997).</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining#Process" target="_blank">KDD</a>: Knowledge Discovery in Databases.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview" target="_blank">TDSP</a>: Team Data Science Process, proposed by Microsoft in 2018.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dslp/dslp" target="_blank">DSLP</a>: Data Science Lifecycle Process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t worry if these processes seem heavy and overwhelming. You don’t have to adopt them wholesale—start bit by bit, keep what works and adapt the rest.</p>
</div>

</details>

<h2 id="more-context-faster-iteration-greater-satisfaction">More context, faster iteration, greater satisfaction</h2>

<p>For most data science roles, being more end-to-end improves your ability to make meaningful impact. (Nonetheless, there are <a href="https://nvidia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/NVIDIAExternalCareerSite/job/US-CA-Santa-Clara/Senior-Deep-Learning-Data-Scientist--RAPIDS---AI_JR1929838" target="_blank">roles</a> that focus on machine learning.)</p>

<p><strong>Working end-to-end provides increased context.</strong> While specialized roles can increase efficiency, it reduces context (for the data scientist) and leads to suboptimal solutions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The trick to forgetting the big picture is to look at everything close-up. – Chuck Palahniuk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s hard to design a holistic solution without full context of the upstream problem. Let’s say conversion has decreased and a PM raises a request to improve our search algorithm. However, what’s causing the decrease in the first place? There could be various causes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Product: Is fraudulent/poor quality product reducing customer trust?</li>
  <li>Data pipelines: Has data quality been compromised or are there delays/outages?</li>
  <li>Model refresh: Is the model not refreshing regularly/correctly?</li>
</ul>

<p>More often than not, the problem—and solution—lies <em>outside</em> of machine learning. A solution to <em>improve the algorithm</em> would miss the root cause.</p>

<p>Similarly, it’s risky to develop a solution without awareness of downstream engineering and product constraints. There’s no point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Building a near-real time recommender if infra and engineer cannot support it</li>
  <li>Building an infinite scroll recommender if it doesn’t fit in our product and app</li>
</ul>

<p>By working end-to-end, data scientists will have the full context to identify the right problems and develop usable solutions. It can also lead to innovative ideas that specialists, with their narrow context, might miss. Overall, it increases the ability to deliver value.</p>

<p><strong>Communication and coordination overhead is reduced.</strong> With multiple roles comes additional overhead. Let’s look at an example of a data engineer (DE) cleaning the data and creating features, a data scientist (DS) analysing the data and training the model, and a machine learning engineer (MLE) deploying and maintaining it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months. – Frederick P. Brooks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The DE and DS need to <em>communicate</em> on what data is (and is not) available, how it should be cleaned (e.g., outliers, normalisation), and which features should be created. Similarly, the DS and MLE have to discuss how to deploy, monitor, and maintain the model, as well as how often it should be refreshed. When issues occur, we’ll need three people in the room (likely with a PM) to triage the root cause and next steps to fix it.</p>

<p>It also leads to additional coordination, where schedules need to be aligned as work is executed and passed along in a sequential approach. If the DS wants to experiment with additional data and features, we’ll need to wait for the DE to ingest the data and create the features. If a new model is ready for A/B testing, we’ll need to wait for the MLE to (convert it to production code) and deploy it.</p>

<p>While the actual development work may take days, the communication back-and-forth and coordination can take weeks, if not longer. With end-to-end data scientists, we can minimize this overhead as well as prevent technical details from being lost in translation.</p>

<p>(But, can an end-to-end DS really do all that? I think so. While the DS might not be as proficient in some tasks as a DE or MLE, they will be able to perform most tasks effectively. If they need help with scaling or hardening, they can always get help from specialist DEs and MLEs.)</p>

<details><summary>The Cost of Communication and Coordination</summary>
<div>
<p>Richard Hackman, a Harvard psychologist, showed that the number of relationships in a team is <code><span>N</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>2</span></code>, where <code><span>N</span></code> is the number of people. This leads to exponential growth in links, where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A start-up team of 7 has 21 links to maintain</li>
  <li>A group of 21 (i.e., three start-up teams) has 210 links</li>
  <li>A group of 63 has almost 2,000 links.</li>
</ul>

<p>In our simple example, we only had three roles (i.e., six links). But as a PM, BA, and additional members are included, this leads to greater than linear growth in communication and coordination costs. Thus, while each additional member increases total team productivity, the increased overhead means productivity grows at a decreasing rate. (Amazon’s <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/small-teams-why-startups-often-win-against-google-and-facebook-the-science-behind-why-smaller-teams-get-more-done/" target="_blank">two-pizza teams</a> are a possible solution to this.)</p>
</div>
</details>

<p><strong>Iteration and learning rate is increased.</strong> With greater context and lesser overhead, we can now iterate, fail (read: learn), and deliver value faster.</p>

<p>This is especially important for developing data and algorithmic products. Unlike software engineering (a far more mature craft), we can’t do all the learning and design before we start building—our blueprints, architectures, and design patterns are not as developed. Thus, rapid iteration is essential for the design-build-learn cycle.</p>

<p><strong>There’s greater ownership and accountability.</strong> Having the data science process split across multiple people can lead to diffusion of responsibility, and worse, social loafing.</p>

<p>A common anti-pattern observed is “<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?ThrownOverTheWall" target="_blank">throw over the wall</a>”. For example, the DE creates features and throws a database table to the DS, the DS trains a model and throws <code>R</code> code over to the MLE, and the MLE translates it to <code>Java</code> to production.</p>

<p>If things get lost-in-translation or if results are unexpected, who is responsible? With a strong culture of ownership, everyone steps up to contribute in their respective roles. But without it, work can degenerate into ass-covering and finger-pointing while the issue persists and customers and the business suffers.</p>

<p>Having the end-to-end data scientist take ownership and responsibility for the entire process can mitigate this. They should be empowered to take action from start to finish, from the customer problem and input (i.e., raw data) to the output (i.e., deployed model) and measurable outcomes.</p>

<details><summary>Diffusion of Responsibilty &amp; Social Loafing</summary>
<div>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility" target="_blank">Diffusion of responsibility</a>: We are less likely to take responsibility and act when there are others present. Individuals feel less responsibility and urgency to help if we know that there are others also watching the situation. </p>

<p>One form of this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility#Bystander_effect" target="_blank">Bystander effect</a>, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese" target="_blank">Kitty Genovese</a> was stabbed outside the apartment building across the street from where she lived. While there were 38 witnesses who saw or heard the attack, none called the police or helped her.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_loafing" target="_blank">Social loafing</a>: We exert less effort when we work in a group vs. working alone. In the 1890s, Ringelmann made people pull on ropes both separately and in groups. He measured how hard they pulled and found that members of a group tended to exert less effort in pulling a rope than did individuals alone.</p>

</div>
</details>

<p><strong>For (some) data scientists, it can lead to increased motivation and job satisfaction</strong>, which is <a href="https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/how-employees-are-motivated-autonomy-mastery-purpose/" target="_blank">closely tied</a> to autonomy, mastery, and purpose.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> By being able to solve problems independently. Instead of waiting and depending on others, end-to-end data scientists are able to identify and define the problem, build their own data pipelines, and deploy and validate a solution.</li>
  <li><strong>Mastery:</strong> In the problem, solution, outcome from end-to-end. They can also pick up the domain and tech as required.</li>
  <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: By being deeply involved in the entire process, they have a more direct connection with the work and outcomes, leading to an increased sense of <em>purpose</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="but-we-need-specialist-experts-too">But, we need specialist experts too</h2>

<p>Being end-to-end is not for everyone (and every team) though, for reasons such as:</p>

<p><strong>Wanting to specialize</strong> in machine learning, or perhaps a specific niche in machine learning such as neural text generation (read: <a href="https://mc.ai/the-subtle-art-of-priming-gpt-3/" target="_blank">GPT-3 primer</a>). While being end-to-end is valuable, we also need such world-class experts in research and industry who push the envelope. Much of what we have in ML came from academia and pure research efforts.</p>

And why should we trust it?</p>  <p>As Leonard Cohen once sang, "I don't trust my inner feelings. Inner feelings come and go." The famed Montrealer was reiterating a point made by Socrates right at the beginnings of Western philosophy. The inner voice can mislead us.</p>  <p>For <a href="https://patriciachurchland.com/" target="_blank">Patricia Churchland</a>, professor emerita in philosophy at University of California San Diego, it's instructive to know more about the origins of our human consciences. She argues the starting point could be as early as the first warm-blooded animals more than 200 million years ago.&nbsp;</p>  <p>What began as an adaptation to foraging in cold or nighttime environments spurred further adaptations, such as a propensity to nurture, socialize, and learn from others.</p>  <p>Brain structures encouraging social behaviour took mammals right up to the doorstep of what we call morality in humans.</p>  <p>"I don't think that human behaviour is different in kind from the behaviour we see in chimpanzees, or baboons, or wolves," Churchland told <em>IDEAS</em> host Nahlah Ayed.</p>  <p>"I think it is more complicated because our ecology — especially now — is more complicated."</p>  <h2>Vole brain&nbsp;breakthrough</h2>  <p>Churchland wants the scientific research to inform what has long been a philosophical or religious conversation. Often, thinkers tried to answer questions such as "Why be good?" with appeals to reason or divine authority.</p>  <p>The biological story offers us a different answer: brain wiring.</p>  <p>"Why is [being social] so meaningful? Why do we care? We care because we're like that," said Churchland, author of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324000891" target="_blank">Conscience: The Origins of Moral Intuition</a>.</em></p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4144691.1582312588!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/prairie-voles.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4144691.1582312588!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/prairie-voles.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4144691.1582312588!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/prairie-voles.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4144691.1582312588!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/prairie-voles.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4144691.1582312588!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/prairie-voles.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4144691.1582312588!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/prairie-voles.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Prairie voles mate and bond for life, says Churchland. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Emory University)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The philosopher explains that a key discovery for her came from research into vole biology.</p>  <p>A difference in the number and location of oxytocin receptors in the brains to two vole species — one adapted to life in mountain ecosystems, and the other to life on the plains — appeared to regulate the voles' love lives.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The prairie voles, with more oxytocin receptors in certain areas, mated and stayed together to raise offspring.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>I create an educational product and students occasionally ask for discounts. So-called "educational" discounts are very popular, but I don't give them.</p> <p>To be honest, I don't like them at all, but there is some nuance.</p> <p>Not all educational discounts bother me—primarily it's the discounts limited to students at degree-granting institutions and especially those tied to having a .edu email address.</p> <h2 id="why-might-edu-discounts-be-good"><a href="#why-might-edu-discounts-be-good">#</a> Why might .edu discounts be good?</h2> <p>Many of the arguments for student discounts are similar to those for region-based discounts, which I am a fan of. So let's look at some reasons to give discounts in general.</p> <h3 id="need"><a href="#need">#</a> Need</h3> <p>The idea behind student discounts, at least as it was first explained to me, sounds great. Students are often broke so it's only fair to give them a price break!</p> <p>I totally get that. As a student myself, I worked as a waiter, a calculus tutor, a bar tender and even started a house painting franchise in order not to get buried in debt. I went to a cheap state school, back when it was only about 70% of what it costs now, and I was <em>still</em> broke.</p> <p>I have a great deal of sympathy for anyone trying to pay their way through school in the US now. I have even more sympathy for anyone taking out debts they likely won't repay for many, many years.</p> <h3 id="price-discrimination"><a href="#price-discrimination">#</a> Price discrimination</h3> <p>In economics, <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/microessays/pd/price-discrimination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">price discrimination</a> refers to the idea of charging some customers more than others in order to maximize revenue.</p> <p>In the extreme form, it would mean charging each customer the absolute maximum price they're willing to pay and completely eliminating <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/188/concepts/definition-of-consumer-surplus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consumer surplus</a>. This isn't practical or possible in most cases, but less extreme forms are very common.</p> <p>Sometimes customers are segmented by their actions, such as spending time clipping coupons or watching movies during typical work hours. Other times, customers are segmented simply by who they are. Senior discounts or higher prices for foreign tourists are both common examples.</p> <p>A less direct form of price discrimination is to create a slightly different product that would only appeal to customers with more money. In software, we see this often with features revolving around team management, accounting and compliance. This makes it possible to both sell to frugal hobbyist users and to charge large companies very high prices.</p> <h3 id="creating-habits"><a href="#creating-habits">#</a> Creating habits</h3> <p>For most, going to college is a time of major life transitions. Other than marriage, having children or serving in the military there are few times when people change as much.</p> <p>This is <strong>incredibly</strong> appealing to marketers.</p> <p>The opportunity to reach people when they're at a place where they're open to creating so many new habits that will stick with them for years or even decades is worth spending heavily on. One way to do it is through advertising. Another is by giving students a steep discount.</p> <h2 id="the-problem"><a href="#the-problem">#</a> The problem</h2> <p>In a number of ways that matter to me, educational discounts <em>as they are typically implemented</em> are radically different from region or need-based discounts.</p> <h3 id="who-has-a-edu-email-address"><a href="#who-has-a-edu-email-address">#</a> Who has a .edu email address?</h3> <p>Who has a .edu email address? Generally it's only students, faculty and alumni of accredited US colleges. This roughly translates to "many of the most priviledged people in the world".</p> <p>The vast majority of adults in the US <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=ACSST1Y2018.S1501&amp;g=0100000US&amp;tid=ACSST1Y2018.S1501&amp;hidePreview=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">do not have a 4-year degree</a>. There are probably a billion people in the world who would <em>love</em> to either enter a US college themselves or get their children into one.</p> <p>Competition for those slots is fierce. People spend small fortunes on English language education for a shot. I've seen it first-hand living in Asia for most my adult life.</p> <p>Obviously, not <em>everyone</em> with a .edu email address is or will be wealthy. However in aggregate, their parents are wealthier and they will be wealthier than any country in the world... by a large margin. At a minimum, getting a 4-year degree costs tens of thousands of dollars. Saving a few dollars a month on my <a href="https://alchemist.camp/episodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screencasts</a> is trivial in comparison.</p> <p>In contrast, the average person in Nigeria earns 2,000 USD/year. Even the average programmer isn't making much compared to their counterparts in other countries. Nigerians are also a double digit percentage of my audience! Indians are a large percentage as well.</p> <p>I have a <em>completely</em> different reaction when someone living in poor country asks for a discount than I do when someone spending more per year on tuition than I earned until my late 20s does.</p> <h3 id="who-is-a-student"><a href="#who-is-a-student">#</a> Who is a student?</h3> <p>An even more salient question is, who counts as a student. I've spent a great deal of time as a non-credentialed student at language schools, at a programming school and even completely on my own with a self-designed curriculum.</p> <p>During those times, I wasn't very successful in asking for educational discounts since nearly all are tied to credential-offering schools. I often thought about why and settled on two answers.</p> <ol><li>They probably worry about non-students claiming to be students to get the discount.</li> <li>Their educational discounts weren't really motivated by any sense of altruism or fairness to begin with.</li></ol> <h3 id="hypocrisy"><a href="#hypocrisy">#</a> Hypocrisy</h3> <p>Perhaps the thing that <em>most</em> bothers me about student discounts I see announced is the virtue signalling.</p> <p>If you're offering a discount to get your customers hooked early in their careers or to raise prices for business users, great. But you're not doing a noble thing if you're restricting a discount to people with .edu addresses.</p> <p>What that discount model actually does is exclude all of the students in poorer parts of the world as well as anyone who couldn't stomach going $100k in debt for a credential.</p> <h3 id="what-does-the-discount-subsidize"><a href="#what-does-the-discount-subsidize">#</a> What does the discount subsidize?</h3> <p>As economists love to point out, incentives matter. When you subsidize something, you get more of it. This isn't just true of governments, but it's also true of companies and other groups.</p> <p>That leads ato the question of what educational discounts subsidize. In effect, they subsidize going to very expensive universities. Is this something we want more of?</p> <p>In what's likely a minority opinion, I think too many people pursue formalized schooling for too long. Universities are necessary for some kinds of careers and for some kinds of research. Far more often, the price is just too high. The worst part of this cost isn't dollars either—it's four years of a person's life.</p> <p>Nearly anything universities teach can be learned outside of a university, and usually faster. I've experienced this first hand with mathematics, foreign languages and programming but it's certainly a wider phenomena.</p> <p>According to George Mason economist Bryan Caplan, <a href="https://amzn.to/2YLbmNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only about 10%-20% of the value in schooling is actually education</a>. The other 80%-90% is selection and signalling.</p> <h2 id="what-products-are-exceptions"><a href="#what-products-are-exceptions">#</a> What products are exceptions?</h2> <p>If I were selling very expensive tools for skilled professionals, like Adobe used to, then I'd offer student discounts. Even a person in relatively fortunate circumstances has fewer resources than a typical company.</p> <p>Dropping a few dollars a month doesn't move the needle compared to tuition, but spending thousands of dollars on a photo or video editor sure could.</p> <p>Another factor in Adobe's case was that by being <em>the</em> tool to use in the industry, students needed to learn it. Anyone trying to become a designer pretty much had to find a way, even if that meant "pirating" it. Giving students convenient affordable access to such a tool is also a great way to <em>become</em> a standard tool in the industry.</p> <p>Even Adobe didn't limit their discounts to US students, though. Doing so might have cost them billions.</p> <h2 id="the-bottom-line"><a href="#the-bottom-line">#</a> The bottom line</h2> <p>Having a .edu email address generally means being in the most expensive and desired university system in the world.</p> <br>  <br> <hr></div></div>]]>

						<p><span>Once, small firms centred on inventors were responsible for most of our innovation. Larger firms might buy or exploit these steps forwards, but they did not typically make them. And then for a brief period, this changed: many of the best new products, tools, and ideas came from research labs within large corporations. This brief period also happened to be the era when scientific, technological, and economic productivity sped forward at its fastest ever clip. Yet almost as soon as it arrived, the fruitful period was over and we returned to a situation where small companies and small-business-like teams at universities developed innovations outside of large companies and sold them in a market for ideas. Though we might enjoy the innovation created by small flexible firms, we should not dismiss the contributions made by large corporate labs. The corporate lab may be creeping back, but aggressively prosecuting antitrust against large firms growing organically through in-house research could easily snuff this spark out.</span></p>
<h3>The USA’s first system of innovation</h3>
<p><span>When the USA began to contribute to the progress of technology, in the early 19th century, it was largely practically-minded, not based on deep scientific understanding. Rather, it largely consisted of individual inventors commercialising their own inventions. Whereas nuclear power depended on decades or centuries of progress in physics, many late 19th century innovations were more like the cotton gin, which came together through practical-minded trial and error in the field. By the late 19th century, the system had morphed into one we would find strangely familiar today: inventors invented, venture capitalists invested, and companies commercialised. The system even had </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>patent lawyers</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/khan_ip2_working_paper.pdf"><span>non-practising entities</span></a>, <span>which own patents purely </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/Documents/BHR870102.pdf"><span>to litigate on their behalf</span></a><span>. There were still startups commercialising an idea and scaling it up themselves, but many inventors found that the division of labour enabled by the market ideas allowed them to </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>focus on what they did best</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Large firms were consumers of ideas created by inventors, and were sceptical of the value of doing in-house science. They believed it was easier to buy new science off the shelf. In 1885 T. D. Lockwood, head of American Bell Telephone Company’s patent department, said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“I am fully convinced that it has never, is not now, and never will pay commercially, to keep an establishment of professional inventors, or of men whose chief business it is to invent”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Of course, Bell Labs itself later grew to be one of the marquees of commercial labs—in the late 1960s it employed 15,000 people including 1,200 PhDs, who between them made too many important inventions to list, from the transistor and the photovoltaic cell to the first digitally scrambled voice audio (in 1943) and the first complex number calculator (in 1939). Fourteen of its staff went on to win Nobel Prizes and five to win </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award"><span>Turing Awards</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>The 1920s stock market boom was in large part driven by a huge rise in the value that investors </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.98.4.1370"><span>accorded to intangible capital</span></a><span> and ideas held within companies. A similar thing happened in the </span><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Capitalism-Without-Capital-Intangible-Economy/dp/0691175039"><span>1990s Dot-com Bubble</span></a><span>. Between 1921 and 1927 the number of scientists and engineers in industrial labs more than doubled. When the stock market crashed and the Great Depression hit it caused a </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d71a/90cfa2d0d0d72f13724d27dd326209431974.pdf"><span>massive and persistent decline</span></a><span> in independent inventing and the startup-like activity around it. But large labs continued to boom, increasing staffing and research spending throughout the lean 1930s, and earning more patents. By 1930, most patents were issued to large firms, rather than independent innovators, and this gap only widened into the 1950s. The industrial lab had become king.</span></p>
<h3>Why labs work well</h3>
<p><span>The question of why the industrial lab works is a microcosm of the question of why the firm works in general. Economist Ronald Coase, who won the Nobel Prize in 1991 (and who lived to be 102) bookended the most productive period of his career with two insights about transaction costs. The first, published in 1937 and entitled </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x"><span>“The Nature of the Firm”</span></a><span>, tells us why firms exist. In economics, situations are typically approached from the perspective of competitive behaviour in open markets. Most of the things we buy are from open, competitive markets like these. But when we sell our labour, we are usually bound to a single “buyer”—our employer—for an extended period of time for everything we have to offer. If market competition is so efficient, why do we not set up mini-firms for every instance of cooperative work and receive pay in line with our output? Why do we instead generally sell a promise to do whatever our boss says within limits for certain hours of the day for months or years in advance?</span></p>
<p><span>The other, </span><a href="https://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/coase-problem.pdf"><span>“The Problem of Social Cost”</span></a><span>, reads like a reflection of the first. Published in 1960, it spawned the so-called Coase Theorem, which holds that so long as transaction costs—the costs of interacting with other individuals or institutions, such as the costs of drawing up and enforcing a contract—are low, people will contract to deal with the problems emerging from positive and negative externalities, like the benefits of a new park to a neighbourhood or the costs of pollution. Where transaction costs are too high, institutions and policies are needed to deal with the externalities instead.</span></p>
<p><span>Coase answers the question of why businesses exist as he answers the question of why people simply don’t contract away all externalities: transaction costs. If there is a cost on both sides every time one person wants to pay another for a task, then some tasks will not be worth paying for, or worth doing at the going rate. Concretely: an employer who does not negotiate contracts for each and every individual work unit can afford to offer higher wages, and an employee who does not do so can afford to accept lower wages. Companies organized in this way thus outcompete pure market organization—in cases where transaction costs are large.</span></p>
<p><span>In many ways, this general story for why firms exist also explains why large firm R&amp;D labs were so successful. The transaction costs of collaboration are extremely large, and prevent all sorts of potentially-valuable crossovers: not just the financial costs of contracting with others, but the costs of finding people you work well with, of corresponding and collaborating with people far from you, and so on. University lecturers collaborate more with those in their department than in other departments, and more with those in their university or city than elsewhere, despite all the tools and technologies the internet has brought. Chance meetings are another driver of serendipitous discovery and unexpected but fruitful collaborations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s more, without great efforts in ‘translation’, many scientific ideas can be completely disconnected from practical applications. A research lab brings an array of scientific experts together from different disciplines, for collaboration and drawing on expertise at low cost. Fellow researchers bump into one another. And the firm context means the potential impact in terms of usable products is always taken into account.</span></p>
<h3>The DARPA Era</h3>
<p><span>The era of the R&amp;D lab has one particularly legendary story and paradigmatic example: PARC. Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Centre—the location in Palo Alto, now the home of companies like Tesla, Palantir, and Google, is no coincidence—developed many of the foundational building blocks of today’s technology and economy. In the 1970s, PARC researchers built the first computer with a graphical user interface, the first laser printer, the first Ethernet cable, and the first user-friendly word processor. Steve Jobs visited PARC in 1979, aged 24, and incorporated many of the ideas into Apple products. Charles Simonyi, a key developer at PARC, moved to Microsoft, where he developed the Office suite. But Xerox itself, which is still largely known for making photocopiers, did not capitalise on these inventions.</span></p>
<p><span>PARC, in turn, had hired many of its workers from Augmentation Research Centre, a publicly-funded project which pioneered the computer mouse, hyperlinks, the earliest predecessor to the internet, and many smaller innovations we take for granted in today’s computer ecosystem. ARC was funded by ARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, now DARPA. Though DARPA (then ARPA) is funded by the US Department of Defence, it shares many elements with golden era R&amp;D labs. They are organised around a mission and a goal—even the most basic research is done with an end in mind—but researchers are given a lot of freedom to make their own decisions.</span></p>
<h3>A return to the market for ideas</h3>
<p><span>The scale of the change since the 1970s is huge—big businesses have retreated from research. In the 1960s, DuPont, the chemicals giant, published more in the </span><i><span>Journals of the American Chemical Society</span></i><span> than both MIT and Caltech combined. R&amp;D magazine, which awards the R&amp;D 100 to the hundred innovations it judges most innovative in a given four year period, gave 41% of its awards to Fortune 500 companies in its 1971 iteration and 47% in 1975. By 2006, 6% of the awards were going to firms in the Fortune 500. The great majority of these awards are now being won by federal labs, university teams, and spin-offs from academia. The lone inventor is back.</span></p>
<p><span>This is reflected by declines in the shares of patents going to the biggest businesses, and in the shares of scientists working there. In 1971 just over seven per cent of scientists in industry tracked by the US National Science Foundation worked in firms with under 1,000 employees; by 2004 this was 32%. In 2003 around a quarter worked at firms with fewer than ten employees. Even pharmaceuticals, the one area where large internal research labs are still significant, has been affected—around half of the drugs approved so far in the 2010s were originally discovered by small biotech startups.</span></p>
<p><span>In general, participation by large American firms in …</span></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>In this article, we will see how to create a simple URL shortener. We will be using <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/">Netlify Redirects</a> and a package called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener">netlify-shortener</a>.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to create my own URL shortener and use it to shorten all my links. But I always felt like creating it would take a lot of effort, although I never actually gave much thought to it. </p>

<p>But I came across a tweet containing a link to the video which showed how to create a simple URL shortener. This blog post is my attempt to share that approach with you.</p>
<p>Before we see how to create your own URL shortener, let's see why having a URL shortener can be useful.</p>
<p>If you are already convinced that having your own URL shortener can be useful, you can skip this section and directly jump to <a href="#creating-your-own-url-shortener">Creating Your Own URL Shortener</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-shortening-your-urls">Benefits of Shortening Your URLs</h2>
<h3 id="it-masks-the-original-links">It masks the original links.</h3>
<p>Masking the URL has many advantages</p>
<p>For example, take this URL - <code>hashnode.com/series/how-i-made-a-markdown-editor-with-ability-to-embed-youtube-videos-codepens-etc-cke6g1y2x00afxms17vp30803</code></p>
<p>This URL is the link to the series that I am writing on <a href="https://hashnode.com/@hashnode">Hashnode</a> where I am developing a full-featured Markdown editor from scratch. But, the URL is so long and difficult to read and share on platforms like twitter. </p>
<p>Instead, wouldn't it be nice to have a simple short URL like <code>pbt.im/markdown-series</code> which redirects to the above URL. It's short, crisp, readable, and also equally conveys what one can expect in that link.</p>
<h3 id="sharing-affiliate-links">Sharing affiliate links.</h3>
<p>Other places where URL shortening can be useful is when you want to share or brand an ugly affiliate link, or when the domain of the link that you want to share is very long.</p>

<p>Take a look at some of the shortened links that I frequently use. </p>
<table>
<thead>

<p>Sharing the above links is so easy. You don't even have to copy them. You can just type them out yourself. They are short, consistent, readable and can easily be remembered.</p>
<h3 id="links-can-change">Links can change</h3>
<p>Another disadvantage of sharing normal links is that the links can potentially change in the future. </p>
<p>If they do change, you can't hunt down every post and every place where you posted or shared that link and then update it. And it might not always be feasible to redirect the old URL to a new URL. </p>
<p>Shortened links can come in very handy in this situation. The shortened link that you share need not change ever. Whereas the URL that the short link should redirect to can change as you wish.</p>
<h3 id="bookmarks">Bookmarks</h3>
<p>I even started using my URL shortener to create bookmarks. I added a short URL(<code>/bookmarks</code>) that redirects to a GitHub page which contains all my other short URLs. Then whenever I want to bookmark a very useful URL, instead of bookmarking it normally, I started shortening it, which will automatically add it to my list of short URLs (which means it will also be available at <code>/bookmarks</code>)</p>
<p>Now that we saw some of the reasons of how shortened URLs can help us, let's see how to create one yourself.</p>
<h2 id="creating-your-own-url-shortener">Creating Your Own URL Shortener</h2>

<p>This is the tweet that inspired me to explore and create a URL shortener for shortening my links. I finally ended up using the approach that Kent suggested. I will be explaining the same in this article.</p>
<h3 id="netlify-redirects">Netlify Redirects</h3>
<p>Before we jump into the actual content, let's see what Netlify redirects are. Netlify gives us an easy way to handle redirects for any site that is hosted on the platform. All you have to do is create a <code>_redirects</code> file and then add the redirect rules in that file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a <code>_redirects</code> file, each redirect rule must be listed on a separate line, with the original path followed by the new path or URL. Any line beginning with # will be ignored as a comment.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>/home              /</span>
/blog/my-post.php  /blog/my-post
/news              /blog
<span>/cuties            https:/</span>/www.petsofnetlify.com
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>This is the bare minimum that you need to create your own URL shortener. </p>
<ul>
<li>Create an empty project with a single file called <code>_redirects</code>.</li>
<li>Add your short and complete URLs there.</li>
<li>Deploy that project to Netlify. </li>
</ul>
<p>You now have your own simple URL shortener. </p>
<p>Every time you want to add a new URL, you can just add it in the <code>_redirects</code> file and then deploy it. If using this workflow is good enough for you, you can stop here and use it.</p>
<p>But Kent went a step further and created a package called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener">netlify-shortener</a> which simplifies the workflow of creating short URLs even further.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to start using <code>netlify-shortener</code> and set up your own URL shortener</p>
<h4 id="step-1-create-an-empty-project">Step 1: Create an empty project</h4>
<pre><code>mkdir url-shortener
<span>cd</span> url-shortener
</code></pre><h4 id="step-2-initialize-it-as-npm-project">Step 2: Initialize it as npm project</h4>
<pre><code>npm <span>init</span> -y
</code></pre><h4 id="step-3-create-a-redirects-file-and-add-the-following-content">Step 3: Create a <code>_redirects</code> file and add the following content.</h4>
<pre><code>
/*       https://your-website.com
</code></pre>
<p><code>your-website.com</code> will act as a fallback when the URL doesn't match any of the available short URLs. Replace it with whatever URL you want to have as a fallback.</p>
<h4 id="step-4-add-homepage-and-shorten-script-to-your-packagejson-add-your-own-short-domain-url-to-the-homepage">Step 4: Add homepage and shorten script to your package.json (Add your own short domain URL to the homepage)</h4>
<pre><code>{
  "<span>homepage</span>": <span>"https://pbt.im"</span>,
  "<span>scripts</span>": {
    "<span>shorten</span>": <span>"netlify-shortener"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you can run the following commands.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>npm</span> run shorten 


<span>npm</span> run shorten https:<span>//</span>yahoo.com


<span>npm</span> run shorten https:<span>//gi</span>thub.com gh
</code></pre><p>The <code>npm run shorten</code> command</p>
<ul>
<li>Generates a shortcode automatically if it is not provided.</li>
<li>Validates your URL.</li>
<li>Automatically check for URL collisions and throws an error if there is a collision.</li>
<li>Adds the URL to the top of the <code>_redirects</code> file and reformats the file properly.</li>
<li>Pulls the changes from remote, adds the new shortened URL, commits the code, and then pushes the commit to the remote again.</li>
<li>Automatically copies the short URL to your clipboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't even have to provide <code>https://</code>, by default it assumes that the original link is <code>https://</code></p>
<p>You can even add it as a global command in your shell using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener#shell-function">these instructions</a></p>
<h3 id="my-workflow-for-shortening-a-url">My workflow for shortening a URL</h3>
<p>Open the terminal and simply write <code>shorten original-URL short-slug</code>. </p>
<p>For example, to shorten the link to my Github profile, I will run the following command </p>
<pre><code><span>shorten</span> github.com/pbteja1998 gh
</code></pre><h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink1.jpg" alt="Neuralink Press Image">
<sub>Images courtesy of Neuralink.</sub></p><p>You probably heard about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/elon-musk-demonstrates-neuralinks-tech-live-using-pigs-with-surgically-implanted-brain-monitoring-devices/" target="_blank">the latest Neuralink demo</a>
by now. I’m referring to the one where Elon Musk showed pigs with brain implants walking around and making cute noises. But why should you care? Is this just another publicity stunt by a rich billionaire with eccentric pet projects, or does it actually matter?</p><iframe width="100%" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVvmgjBL74w?start=947" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><sub>Click above to see the part of the presentation where the pig sniffs around and sounds play whenever the neurons associated with his snout fire. Trust me, it’s adorable. From now on, this is the sound I’ll play in my mind whenever I see animals sniffing around.</sub></p><p>The Neuralink demo is a big deal for several reasons. Most importantly, it shows a fully-working brain-machine interface product in a living being. I cannot emphasize how incredible this is. Creating a brain implant is a hard task. Not only do you have to figure out how to stick something in a brain without hurting it, but keeping that thing in place, building the software to interpret the signals coming from it, and then removing it with minimal damage is an endeavor that presents serious challenges at every step of the way. Making all of the above into a <em>product</em>, not a week-long surgery research project, is a truly Promethean achievement.</p><p>The fact that Neuralink is closer to delivering a product and not just research matters a lot. We’ve heard about advances in brain-machine interface research for decades now, but all the results have been highly experimental. Building a product and not an experiment means that all those results, from restoring speech to restoring movement, are closer to being used by those who actually need them. Furthermore, reducing the barriers to obtaining neural data from humans creates an unprecedented opportunity to better understand our own minds, not to mention traditionally elusive topics like consciousness.</p><p>One of the first things that stood out to me in the demo was how Neuralink inserts the brain-machine interface device into the brain. Insertion is something Neuralink has brought up in past presentations, but this time they showed a particularly good video of how it works. In order to insert sensors in a brain without damaging it, the Neuralink team has built electrodes in the shape of small wires that are 1/4 of the diameter of human hair. These electrodes are then inserted through a skull opening using a high-precision robot that scans the brain area <em>during</em> surgery, which allows it to avoid any blood vessels, no matter how small. This procedure reduces tissue damage and increases the probability that the implant won’t be outright rejected by the brain. To see how cool this is, just watch the demo below:</p><video id="video" muted="" preload="auto" poster="https://j.gifs.com/p8ADyp.jpg" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline="">
<source src="https://j.gifs.com/p8ADyp.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>The robot misses the blood vessels every time! This takes place in an area where distances are measured in micrometers - 1/100000 of a meter. This procedure is not something that would work without major advances in robotics and computer vision. Having a human do it by hand is out of the question. I suggest you go back to the <a href="https://youtu.be/DVvmgjBL74w?t=646" target="_blank">original demo</a> and watch the high-definition video to see just how good the robot is at this job.</p><p>The fact that the robot can implant a <em>Link</em> (Neuralink’s name for the sensor) in under an hour is a great achievement too. Neuralink’s goal is to make getting a brain-machine interface as easy as getting Lasik eye surgery. This demo showed that they’re not joking about delivering on this promise.</p><p>Another thing that truly stood out to me is how secure and inconspicuous the <em>Link</em> interface looked on the pig’s head. I couldn’t even spot it! This is really important, since if you’re about to make something that living beings are supposed to wear every day, you might as well make sure it’s not awkward or annoying. Even better, the interface should feel like it’s part of your own body.</p><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink2.jpg" alt="Neuralink Press Image">
<sub>The new <em>Link</em> brain-machine interface.</sub></p><p>This is an area that did not receive a lot of attention before Neuralink. For example, when hospitals perform invasive brain-recordings using traditional methods like ECoG, wires come out of your head through skull openings. Since the brain is a squishy mass surrounded by liquid, keeping the liquid <em>in</em> and the area around the opening <em>clean</em> becomes an incredibly difficult task. Nurses have to hover around patients constantly to make sure that the wires are not coming loose and that the brain ooze is being cleaned so that no infections take place.</p><p>What makes the <em>Link</em> so revolutionary is that it’s a standalone device. By removing the need for charging or data transfer wires, this brain-machine interface is closer to an Apple Watch-level wearable than anything else that has been built so far. Seeing the charging puck (which seems to have copied the Apple Watch charging puck) offered perhaps the clearest glimpse of the future in the entire presentation (so did the 1-day battery life, which, while amazing for a device this size, will also lead to some really funny memes about how our brains will run out of battery and need to be charged).</p><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink3.jpg" alt="Neuralink Inductive Charging Mechanism">
<sub>Is this going to be worse than forgetting to charge your phone at night?.</sub></p><p>Having something that fits neatly in your skull and blocks liquid from coming out without the need for wires is a major achievement. I’m sure there is still a lot of work to be done, especially given Elon’s calls for help from sealing experts, but seeing something as good as what we’ve seen today shows a great degree of progress.</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you’ve solved hard problems with phones / wearables (sealing, signal processing, inductive charging, power mgmt, etc), please consider working at engineering@neuralink.com</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1284306733720940544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote><p>Another noteworthy aspect of the <em>Link</em> interface is the signal processing. In this regard, the pig-sniffing-with-sounds demo was ok, since it didn’t really use any fancy techniques. What really stood out was predicting and interpreting brain signals using the information from the <em>Link</em> sensors.</p><video id="video" muted="" preload="auto" poster="https://j.gifs.com/vl0MOm.jpg" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline="">
<source src="https://j.gifs.com/vl0MOm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>These demos can get a bit hand-wavey and Neuralink did not provide a lot of information about the techniques used to produce this particular example. However, given the fact that deep learning has been shown to be really good at brain signal decoding and prediction, I wouldn’t be suprised if Neuralink and OpenAI partenered on advancing signal processing using deep learning once the hardware is ready. Given Elon’s obsession with the singularity, I wouldn’t be surprised if this happened sooner.</p><p>Overall, I’m really excited about the future of invasive brain-machine interfaces after seeing this demo. While the jump from animals to humans is a big one and I’m sure Elon errs on being overly-optimistic when it comes to the timeline, this is a historical moment similar to launching the first dog into space. The fact that this is possible today opens an endless array of opportunities for the future of humanity.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>A few years ago I wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@LainIwakura/deobfuscating-obfuscated-code-for-fun-and-no-profit-36ec615c8f5d">two</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@LainIwakura/deobfuscating-code-for-fun-and-no-profit-round-2-60d78b67ebce">posts</a>
on medium.com explaining the workings of some obfuscated programs. After these posts other stuff took priority and I forgot about the world of obfuscation for a while. Now though, I find myself returning to it.
For reasons I’ll explain in a different post I find studying obfuscated code to be quite valuable. So, I thought to myself ‘Well, those last programs I examined were honestly pretty simple. What would it be like to research a truly obfuscated program?’</p>
<p>This post is the story of that journey. I will discuss the code, how I got such old and obscure code to run, as well as include snippets from my conversations with
one of the original authors (who was very helpful in figuring some of this out). If all that wasn’t enough I managed to obtain the original PDP and VAX source code, it will be hosted here with permission. I want to give a huge thank you to Sjoerd Mullender and Don Libes for their assistance and permission in reproducing some of this material.</p>

<p>Because older obfuscated programs tend to be easier to dissect I decided to stay in the early years of the IOCCC (International Obfuscated C Code Contest).
Among those early programs one sticks out as truly interesting - and that is the first IOCCC winner <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/1984/mullender/mullender.c">mullender.c</a>, which I’ve also replicated below because it’s quite short.

<p>Where do you start with a program like this? Well, the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/1984/mullender/hint.text">hint</a> provided by the IOCCC is always a good first step.
From this hint, we can learn a few things necessary to understanding how the program works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps most importantly, this program will only run on a PDP-11 or VAX-11.</li>
<li>The C startup routine - provided by crt0.o - transfers control to a location named ‘main’ - usually intended to be a function, but in this case it’s an array of shorts</li>
<li>These shorts (represented in different formats to enhance obfuscation) form a meaningful set of PDP-11 and VAX-11 instructions</li>
<li>The first instruction is a branch to the PDP code, and due to the way VAX calls the main ‘function’ it skips the first word of the program (I’ll discuss this more later).</li>
<li>The program prints a string</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, the program is a bunch of machine code instructions encoded in various formats. It runs because this code predates ANSI C by a half decade and old compilers seem to have had significantly less qualms about
‘main’ being a function or not (I tried to define ‘main’ as an array of shorts with a modern compiler and it did not like that one bit).</p>

<p>I admit it, the PDP-11 was before my time. I grew up in the Windows 95/98/2000 era, and until recently I didn’t even know what a PDP-11 was.
This ignorance left me kind of stuck, and a brief look on eBay confirmed that I was not going to get a working PDP-11 any time soon. Fortunately though,
an emulator exists. Enter <a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/">SimH</a>, it’s more of a suite of emulators for a wide range of historical computers - of which the
PDP-11 is one, and lucky for us the VAX-11 is another.</p>
<p>After a few false starts and misadventures with 2.11BSD, I realized I had no idea what I was doing so I decided I needed some help.
The two original authors of this program are Robbert van Renesse and Sjoerd Mullender, why not try to contact them? So I did.
Robbert didn’t answer my e-mail, but luckily Sjoerd got back to me and was happy to discuss the program. He told me that the
PDP-11 OS they used was Unix v7, so I proceeded on that route.</p>
<p>I managed to <a href="http://a.papnet.eu/UNIX/v7/Installation">find a guide</a> on installing Unix v7 onto this emulator that worked;
and now with my emulator running, and OS installed, I could slap it into a file, compile, and run the thing. Below is what I got.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="https://lainsystems.com/img/running_on_pdp11.gif">
	
		<figcaption>Running the program on the PDP-11 using Unix v7</figcaption>
	
</figure>


<p>The animation is a little choppy, but even still you can hopefully see that it is printing “:-)” across the screen until it is forced to exit (there is no clean way to stop it).</p>
<p>In my discussions with Sjoerd, it was revealed that the string it prints is not exactly “:-)” but instead "  :-)\b\b\b\b”
(NOTE: there should be 2 space characters at the start but my templating engine is removing one for some reason).
It is exactly 9 bytes long. The first 2 characters are whitespace, followed by the :-), finally followed by four ‘\b’
characters. The ‘\b’ characters indicate a backspace. What does the backspace accomplish? Well, if you count 4 characters back from when they begin you’ll see we’re left with a single space - it is at this point
that the program loops and prints the string again. This happens quickly enough that to our eyes it looks like the “:-)” is scrolling across the screen - a clever effect.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the C code is not very useful to examine directly. As it also turns out, the assembly isn’t much better. Below is a small sample of what the assembly looks like (from the PDP-11’s perspective):</p>
<pre><code>    .text
    .globl  _main
    .data
    .even
_main:
    .word   0425 
    .word   04735
    .word   -010041
    .word   031
    .word   0
    .word   0735
    .word   01773
    .word   05757
</code></pre><p>So, what to do? Well, you can actually set up a cross compiler for the PDP-11 and if you go through that effort you can use the objdump program targeted at PDP-11 binaries.</p>
<p>Below is the relevant portion of the objdump - the whole thing is <a href="https://lainsystems.com/mull_objdump.txt">here</a>, but not all of it is useful. Sjoerd confirmed that the PDP code is
from _main+0x2c to _main+0x4a (inclusive). Of course, the first word is also a PDP-11 instruction. Everything I’ve ommitted is related to the VAX portion of
the program which we will get back to. (It’s also not proper VAX code since the disassembler thinks everything is PDP-11).</p>
<pre><code>   0:   0115            br  0x2c
  2c:   11c4            mov pc, r4
  2e:   0be4            tst -(r4)
  30:   e5c4 0009       sub $11, r4
  34:   1137 0006       mov r4, $0x3e
  38:   15c0 0001       mov $1, r0
  3c:   8904            sys 4
  3e:   0000            halt
  40:   0009            .word   11
  42:   15c2 0200       mov $1000, r2
  46:   892d            sys 55
  48:   7e82            sob r2, 0x46
  4a:   01f0            br  0x2c
</code></pre><p>Before going further there are 2 important things to know about PDP-11 assembly code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PDP-11 works primarily with octal. All the addresses and instructions are encoded in octal.</li>
<li>In an instruction like <code>mov pc, r4</code>, you are moving pc INTO r4, not r4 into pc. Personally, I got used to this pretty quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first number in the original program is 277, put that into a hex converter and you’ll get 115 like we see in the objdump. More interesting though is what you get translating it into octal - 425.
How does 0425 get you br 0x2c though? Well for that you need to grab some <em>manuals</em>. I got my hands on a lot of old manuals for these computers but the most useful one was the PDP-11/45 Handbook from 1973.
It would helpfully describe the instruction format, and exactly what it did. Below is an example of the page for the unconditional branch instruction.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="https://lainsystems.com/img/pdp11-branch.png">
	
		<figcaption>PDP-11/45 Handbook Describing the Branch instruction</figcaption>
	
</figure>


<p>As you can see, it sets the program counter to pc + 2x the offset - which is 25 (octal) in our case. Since the program counter at the start of our program is 2 (because it points to the next word to execute),
we get 2 + (25 x 2), or 2 + 52 = 54, which translating back into hex gives us 2c. Cool!</p>

<p>Now that we know how the branch works we can examine the main stuff - I won’t go into huge depth with the manuals for each little instruction but doing so is fun if you’re bored and enjoy that sort of thing.</p>
<p>The next relevant portion of code is this:</p>
<pre><code>  mov pc, r4
  tst -(r4)
  sub $11, r4
  mov r4, $0x3e
  mov $1, r0
  sys 4
  halt
  .word   11
</code></pre><p>We move the program counter into the r4 register and then use the ‘test’ (tst) instruction. This has the effect of clearing the some flags in the PSW (processor status word), and because
the register is using ‘Autodecrement mode’ it will subtract 2 from the value stored at r4. When using autoincrement / decrement, it will go by 1 in byte instructions or 2 in word instructions.
After this we subtract 11 from r4, but 11 is actually 9 (used to octal yet?). Then we store r4 into…0x3e? Well, if you look back at the objdump you’ll see that 0x3e is ‘halt’ or 0000. This
mov instruction overwrites that value with the contents of r4. We move 1 into r0 (1 indicating STDOUT), and call ‘sys 4’. The next line will be the value of r4 as just mentioned, and <code>.word 11</code>
simply inserts octal 11 directly into that spot. If you’re wondering what exactly is in r4 and why we’re doing all this stuff, be patient - we’re getting there.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with system calls, you probably know what’s going on. If not, all of this is to setup the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_(system_call)">write</a> system call. I
actually made a <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/15590/trying-to-understand-some-assembly-syntax-in-the-unix-v7-write-system-call">post on the retro-computing stackexchange</a>
asking about the workings of this call internally - I recommend checking it out if you want further clarity on how this works.</p>
<p>After this we have the final 3 lines of PDP code which are:</p>
<pre><code>  mov $1000, r2
  sys 55
  sob r2, 0x46
</code></pre><p>We put 1000 into r2, and call system call 55. After this, we use the ‘sob’ instruction - which is ‘subtract one and branch’ and not an invitation to cry - to see if r2 is 0 yet. If it isn’t, we branch
to the previous line and call system call 55 again. loop until r2 is 0. Syscall 55 eh? Which …</p></div></div></div>

      <div class="page">
  
  <p>OpenMath is an emerging standard for representing mathematical objects with their semantics, allowing them to be exchanged between computer programs, stored in databases, or published on the worldwide web. While the original designers were mainly developers of computer algebra systems, it is now attracting interest from other areas of scientific computation and from many publishers of electronic documents with a significant mathematical content. There is a strong relationship to the MathML recommendation from the Worldwide Web Consortium, and a large overlap between the two developer communities. MathML deals principally with the presentation of mathematical objects, while OpenMath is solely concerned with their semantic meaning or content. While MathML does have some limited facilities for dealing with content, it also allows semantic information encoded in OpenMath to be embedded inside a MathML structure. Thus the two technologies may be seen as highly complementary.</p>

<p>Mathematical objects encoded in OpenMath can be</p>

<ul>
  <li>displayed in a browser</li>
  <li>exchanged between software systems</li>
  <li>cut and pasted for use in different contexts</li>
  <li>verified as being mathematically sound (or not!)</li>
  <li>used to make interactive documents really interactive.</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenMath is highly relevant for persons working with mathematics on computers, for those working with large documents (e.g. databases, manuals) containing mathematical expressions, and for technical and mathematical publishing.</p>

<p>The worldwide OpenMath activities are coordinated within the OpenMath Society, based in Helsinki, Finland. It is coordinated by an executive committee, elected by its members. It organizes regular workshops and hosts a number of electronic discussion lists. The Society brings together tool builders, software suppliers, publishers and authors.</p>

He was curious to know what I had done differently to arrive at a positive outcome.</p><p>My first reaction was to tell him that this is not my first attempt. </p><p>I've tried building a company twice before and failed miserably. I even tried building a breakfast delivery business in 2015 (I had no idea what I was doing back then) and I made ₹85,000 in revenue before I shut it down.</p><p>SuperLemon is actually my fourth attempt.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2> What is the yield curve?</h2><p>The Yield Curve shows current yield rates, for US Treasuries, at varying maturities. That was a lot of jargon, so let's break it down.</p><canvas></canvas><p>US Treasuries represent bonds issued by the US Government. Think of a bond as any loan - the issuer of a bond has to pay interest each month, and the amount borrowed at maturity. Maturity refers to the period after which the bond is to be paid back. The US Government issues bonds for varying maturity rates, from 30 days to 30 years. And finally, the yield rate represents the effective interest rate for a bond, based on its current price.</p><h2>Why does it matter?</h2><p>The yield curve sets the basic, or lowest possible, interest rates. Any changes in the yield curve have a ripple effect across the entire economy.</p><p>Effectively, the yield curve represents current interest rates for the US Government. The US Government is considered the safest borrower in the economy. So, it gets to borrow money at the lowest possible interest rates. Everyone else has to pay more interest, to compensate for the added risk. </p><p>Let's take a concrete example. On September 4, 2019, Apple issued bonds worth $7bn. These bonds had maturities ranging from 3 years, to 30 years. The yield rate on these bonds was higher than the US Government bond yields on the same day.</p><canvas></canvas><p>Similarly, if you want to take out a 30 year mortgage, your interest rate will be some number plus the interest rate of the 30 year treasury.</p><p>So when the yield curve rises, that means interest rates for everyone go up. It becomes more expensive for Apple to borrow money, or for you to get a mortage. If it's more expensive to borrow money, it's more expensive to spend money; and in this way, higher interest rates make economic growth harder.</p><p>The yield curve also matters because it's considered a predictor for future recessions.</p><h3>How is the yield curve a recession indicator?</h3><p>The shape of the yield curve offers some clues. In normal times, the yield curve slopes upwards. Remember, the higher risk the, the higher the interest rate. Shorter periods are safer - it's easier to predict what will happen in the next 30 days, than in the next 30 years.</p><p>When the yield curve is <em>inverted</em>, something is wrong. It means that rates for long term-periods are lower than interest rates for short-term periods. This is rare, and breaks the relationship we described above. It's so abnormal, that it is a reliable predictor of economic recessions.</p><p>The chart below is an example of an inverted yield curve; specifically, the yield curve for August 11, 2006. Yield curves were inverted for much of 2006 and 2007. It proved prophetic. In late 2007 we entered the deepest economic recession since the 1930s.</p><canvas></canvas><p>The graph below shows the <em>spread</em> between the 10 year treasury and the 3 month treasury. The spread is just the difference between two interest rates; so anytime the spread drops below 0, it means the yield curve was inverted on that day.</p><canvas></canvas><h3>How does this matter as a personal investor?</h3><p>One way to use the yield curve is to check whether it is inverted. If the yield curve is inverted, postpone taking any loans if you can. An inverted yield curve is a sign that the rates might be lower in the future, so you'd want to wait for that to happen. It's also a sign that there might be economic trouble ahead; so ensure your savings are truly safe.</p><p>The yield curve can help you identify opportunities to refinance old mortgages or loans. If interest rates have dropped since the day you took the loan, you might have an opportunity to refinance it at a lower interest rate.</p><p>The yield curve doesn't change frequently; check it once per quarter.</p><h2>How does it change?</h2><h3>The Federal Reserve manages parts of the yield curve.</h3><p>The Fed's job is to manage inflation and maintain economic growth. They use a variety of tools to do so. For the moment, don't worry about how the Fed does it - just know that the Fed has lots of control over short term rates, but only some control over long term rates.</p><p>During a recession the Fed's goal is to get the economy growing again. In order to do so, it will cut interest rates. As explained above, high interest rates reduce spending, while low interest rates stimulate spending. When spending is stimulated, the economy grows, and things eventually return back to normal.</p><p>The Fed is good at its job, and is reliable, so the relationship described above works well. So well, that investors know the Fed will do so when a recession hits. If investors think a recession is coming 2 years from now, they'll start betting that interest rates will drop. This in fact causes <strong>yield rates</strong> to fall, resulting in an inverted yield curve. </p><p>But there are limits to what the Fed can actually do.</p><h3>What's happening during COVID-19?</h3><p>The yield curve is considered extremely flat today. The chart below shows the spread between 30 day and 30 year bonds. The lower the spread, the flatter the yield curve.</p><p>The Fed has committed to keeping interest rates as as close to 0 as possible. COVID-19 has hit the economy hard; low interest rates are needed to stimulate the economy as much as possible, but the Fed might be hitting its limits.</p><h3>What could the future look like?</h3><p>There's a notion of the <em>Zero Lower Bound</em>. Theoretically, interest rates can't drop below 0%. Negative interest rates are weird - that implies being paid to take out a loan. For a long time, it was assumed that the bound was a hard one. Meaning that once the Fed has cut interest rates to 0%, it can't do anything more to stimulate the economy.</p><p>Firstly, we've discovered that 0% might not be the lower bound. European central banks, such as the Swiss central bank, have run interest rates lower than 0% for some time now.</p><p>Secondly, the Fed has discovered new tools to stimulate the economy. A notable example is Quantitative Easing, first used in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed has started to do it again; but this time around, the effects have been very different. To be explained in a future post!</p><h2>What else do I need to know?</h2><p>The Fed is one of many interacting agents in the world of interest rates; we haven't discussed inflation or gone into details about the role that investors play.</p></div></div></div>]]>

    <div>
      <article role="main">
        <p>This isn’t going to be a post about how adopting a several-thousand-year-old practice <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/healthy-living/mindfulness-sells-buddhist-meditation-teachings-neoliberalism-attention-economy-a8225676.html">can make you a better servant of capital</a>.
Instead, let’s talk about when I feel the lowest of the low.
It comes after spending any number of hours on my computer, maybe even a full day, endlessly circling around different websites in search of stimulation, the quick jolt that comes with learning an interesting fact or watching a funny short video or seeing someone get dunked on for having a bad political opinion.
I’ll eventually wake into a state that could be identified as conscious thought, look back on the many (genuinely exciting!) things I wanted to learn or do that day, and contrast it with what I actually did.
What did I actually do? I honestly don’t even know. I doubt I could list even three things I’d read or experienced the entire preceding eight hours.
At this moment I feel very bad. I know one of the ~30,000 days in my life is gone.
And I didn’t get anything out of it.
Actually, I’m worse off, because spending your time in this way just begets even more time spent in this way.</p>
<p>I don’t have any social media apps on my phone.
I deleted my twitter account.
I deleted my reddit account.
I don’t have an instagram account.
My facebook account exists only to be part of some groups.
I use LeechBlock.
I redirect websites to 0.0.0.0 in my hosts file.
Everyone I know does most of these things.
Everyone I know still has trouble spending their time how they actually want to spend it.
If I were to write down a list of the things I find most important in life, endlessly circling around a handful of websites would not even be in consideration.</p>
<p>If I get stuck in the loop for more than a week or so my brain starts to eat itself.
There’s a visceral knawing feeling.
My thoughts dwell on how to defeat this thing which is deleting hours from my life.</p>
<p>So far the only thing which has helped is mindfulness meditation.
After sitting for 10 or 20 minutes and focusing on my breath, my mind becomes quiet.
Traffic on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network">default mode network</a> dies down a little bit.
I’m no longer instantly pulled into the online vortex upon encountering the slightest speedbump in my work.
Instead my mind just… stays quiet, and I keep the problem in my head.
This doesn’t last forever.
I could probably meditate for 10 minutes out of every hour and still have spent more time on the things I actually wanted to spend time on, at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Deciding to meditate is hard.
The idea of spending ten minutes intentionally doing nothing runs against a lot of messaging I’ve internalized.
It’s also very difficult to keep my attention on my breath instead of running away to consider whatever figment wanders through my thoughts.
There’s an interesting metaphor I’ve heard.
Your mind is like a train station.
Thoughts think themselves - they are trains pulling into the station.
A train of thought will shortly pull out of the station, but you don’t have to be on it.
Or maybe you just boarded it without thinking, then don’t realize what you’ve done until you’re a mile down the track.
No worries; you can always return to the station.</p>
<p>I decided to try mindfulness meditation after listening to the audio version of Robert Wright’s book <a href="http://whybuddhismistrue.net/">Why Buddhism Is True</a> while on a cross-country drive.
It’s about how many beliefs in Buddhism - specifically Western Atheistic Buddhism - have support from modern psychology &amp; neuroscience.
I wasn’t motivated to start meditating by thinking it would help me in this struggle for my attention; the discovery was quite accidental.
I use the <a href="https://www.wakingup.com/">Waking Up</a> app.
Friends of mine also report good experiences with <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a>.</p>
<p>It’s troubling I have to go to such lengths to live my life the way I think I want to live it.
Maybe this struggle is uniquely modern, maybe it’s one for the ages.
I still have issues sometimes, especially before bed when my defenses are lower and I can get sucked into the loop instead of reading a good book or just going to sleep.
Still, for the first time in my life I’ve found an actually effective tool for resisting the attention economy.</p>

<p>I got this email from Linkedin this morning. It is telling me that they are going to change my location from “<strong>Auckland, New  Zealand</strong>” to “<strong>Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand</strong>“. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="496" height="512" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-33-26.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-33-26.png 496w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-33-26-291x300.png 291w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px"><figcaption>Email from Linkedin on 30 August 2020</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since “Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand” sounds stupid to New Zealanders (Auckland is pretty much a big city with a single job market and is not a state or similar) I clicked on the link and opened the application to stick with what I currently have</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="912" height="557" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46.png 912w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46-300x183.png 300w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46-768x469.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px"></figure>



<p>Except the problem is that the pulldown doesn’t offer many any other locations</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="546" height="316" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03.png 546w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03-300x174.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px"></figure>



<p>The only way to change the location is to click “use Current Location” and then allow Linkedin to access my device’s location.</p>



<div><p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/suggested/110568">the help page</a>:</p><p><em>By default, the location on your profile will be suggested based on the postal code you provided in the past, either when you set up your profile or last edited your location. However, you can manually update the location on your LinkedIn profile to display a different location.</em></p></div>



<p>but it appears the manual method is disabled. I am guessing they have a fixed list of locations in my postcode and this can’t be changed.</p>



<p>So it appears that my options are to accept Linkedin’s crappy name for my location (Other NZers have posted problems with their location naming) or to allow Linkedin to spy on my location and it’ll probably still assign the same dumb name.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="489" height="42" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43.png 489w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43-300x26.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px"></figure>



<p>The basically appears to be a way for Linkedin to push user to enable location tracking. While at the same time they get to force their own ideas on how New Zealand locations work on users.</p>
