                                <h2>Even if greenhouse-gas emissions stop now, global warming will continue for centuries, a study shows. The solution: removing carbon from the air.</h2>
                            </p><div>
                                <ul><li>Even if the world were to stop emitting greenhouse gases right now, the Earth would keep warming for centuries, a new study shows.</li>
<li>The researchers suggest <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/how-to-stop-gobal-warming-plan-carbon-capture-2018-10">sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere</a> and storing it underground — a solution known as carbon capture and storage.</li>
<li>That's considered a type of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/geoengineering-how-to-reverse-climate-change-2019-4">geoengineering</a>. Other <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/geoengineering-how-to-reverse-climate-change-2019-4">climate-hacking</a> proposals in the same category are far riskier.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li></ul><p>Even if we stopped emitting greenhouse gas today, the Earth would continue warming for centuries. Arctic ice and permafrost are already on an irreversible path of melting.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75481-z">That's the finding of new research</a> published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports. The model suggests that even if emissions were to drop to zero this year, global temperatures would ultimately rise to be 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit higher in 2500 than they were in 1850 (that's 3 degrees Celsius).</p><p>"The tundra will continue to melt over the next 500 years — irrespective of how quickly humanity cuts its greenhouse-gas emissions," Jørgen Randers, the lead author of the new study, told Business Insider.</p><p>That's because climate change is a vicious, self-sustaining cycle: As permafrost thaws, it releases more greenhouse gases, like methane and carbon dioxide, which sustains warming over time. To stop that cycle, Randers said, we'll need to suck carbon dioxide back out of the atmosphere.</p><h2>8 feet of sea-level rise</h2><p>Randers' study modeled the effect of various emissions-reductions scenarios on Earth's climate between 1850 and 2500.</p><p>The data showed that if emissions stopped for good in 2020, sea levels in 2500 would still be more than 8 feet (2.5 meters) higher than in 1850.</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5fac2eb9b09abb0018626059?format=jpeg" alt="FILE - In this Aug. 16, 2019, photo, large Icebergs float away as the sun rises near Kulusuk, Greenland. The Trump administration is poised to announce an expanded diplomatic presence in Greenland and a new assistance package for the vast island aimed at thwarting growing Chinese and Russian influence in the Arctic. The announcement, expected Thursday, April 23, 2020, will come less than a year after President Donald Trump drew derision for expressing an interest in buying Greenland.

</figcaption></figure><p>To prevent the projected 3-degree-Celsius temperature increase, greenhouse-gas emissions would need to have ceased entirely between 1960 and 1970, the model found. In that sense, Earth blew by a climactic point of no return 50 years ago — before much of the public understood the realities of climate change.</p><p>"Yes, that is an irony," Randers said. "But of course the scientific community knew about global warming already in the 1960s."</p><h2>We need to suck carbon out of the atmosphere</h2><p>The Paris climate agreement was created with the intention to cut greenhouse-gas emissions enough to keep the world's temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius by 2100. But even if all emissions stopped by 2100, according to Randers' model, sea levels in 2500 would be nearly 10 feet (3 meters) higher than they were in 1850.</p><p>Earth's temperatures are already on track to blow past the Paris agreement's goals. Last year was the <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/projected-ranks#:~:text=The%20warmest%20years%20globally%20have,Courtesy%20of%20NOAA%20NCEI.">second warmest on record</a> for surface temperatures and <a href="https://time.com/5765489/ocean-temperatures-warmest-ever/">the hottest ever for oceans</a>. Polar melting is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sea-level-rise-3-feet-in-80-years-un-report-2019-9" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40">on track to raise seas 3 feet by 2100</a> and threatens to displace hundreds of millions of people.</p><p>What's needed, Randers said, is for companies and governments to "start developing the technologies for large-scale removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere."</p><p>In technical terms, that strategy is known as carbon capture and storage (CCS). To prevent further warming after emissions have stopped, the new study found, at least 33 gigatonnes (36.5 billion tons) of carbon dioxide would need to be sucked out of the atmosphere each year. That's roughly the total amount of carbon dioxide the global fossil-fuel industry emitted in 2018 (<a href="https://www.wri.org/blog/2018/12/new-global-co2-emissions-numbers-are-they-re-not-good#:~:text=Record%20Carbon%20Dioxide%20Emissions%20in%202018&amp;text=This%20year's%20numbers%20confirm%20their,2017%20to%2036.2%20gigatonnes%20CO20CO2">36 gigatonnes</a>).</p><p>Power plants in the US, Canada, and Switzerland have already started utilizing CCS to lower their emissions. In 2014, the Boundary Dam Power Station in Saskatchewan became one of the first in the world to successfully use the technology.</p><p>In total, 21 commercial-scale carbon-capture projects are operating around the world, and 22 more are in development, <a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/carbon-capture/">according to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions</a>. These projects typically store carbon deep underground in depleted oil and gas fields or in bioreactor containers filled with algae that eats carbon dioxide.</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5fac4783b09abb001862611c?format=jpeg" alt="bioreactor" height="3744" width="4992" charset=""><figcaption>Bioreactors filled with green algae that eats carbon dioxide in Costa de la Luz, Spain.

</figcaption></figure><p>Two US carbon-capture completed in 2017 — <a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/carbon-capture/">one in Illinois, one in Texas</a> — can capture 1.1 million and 1.6 million tons of carbon dioxide, respectively, per year. But the amount of CO2 that needs to be removed from the atmosphere requires far more plants than any current plans call for.</p><p>"In other words, building 33,000 big CCS plants and keep them running for ever," the study authors wrote.</p><h2>The pros and cons of geoengineering</h2><p>Carbon capture is becoming widely accepted as a safe and potentially effective form of geoengineering. This and other climate interventions are increasingly being floated <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03036-4">by scientists</a> and politicians alike; Andrew Yang, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, suggested <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-yang-thinks-geoengineering-could-lead-to-war-2019-4">budgeting $800 million</a> for further geoengineering research in the US.</p><p>But most climate-hacking proposals would be far riskier than CCS. Take solar geoengineering, for example, which involves injecting aerosols into the sky to reflect sunlight back into space. Critics of this idea point out that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01606-0">most models predict</a> the effects of solar geoengineering wouldn't stay localized. If a country decided to independently deploy such measures, varying and unpredictable effects would likely be seen in other spots around the globe.</p><p>Aerosol injections deployed in the southern hemisphere, for instance, could impact ocean temperatures and wind speeds, leading to more hurricanes in the northern hemisphere.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5c76a74726289812e8235523?format=jpeg" alt="Clouds above earth" height="2848" width="3797" charset=""><figcaption>Subtropical stratocumulus clouds above Earth.

</figcaption></figure><p>"Solar geoengineering has geopolitical ramifications, unlike carbon capture," Juan Moreno-Cruz, an associate professor at the University of Waterloo who studies geoengineering, previously told Business Insider.</p><p>Randers said his study advocates just for carbon capture, not other more experimental forms of geoengineering.&nbsp;</p><p>"I am generally against geoengineering because of its unintended side effects. But if the world continues to delay meaningful and feasible action to phase out fossil fuels, we may have to resort to geoengineering," Randers said.&nbsp;</p><p>As an immediate priority, he added, countries should invest equally in efforts to cut emissions and build more CCS plants.</p><p>"This would be a wonderful task for a government-financed <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-green-new-deal-2019-1">Green New Deal</a>," he said.</p>

    <p>If you followed the recent Apple events, you probably saw a picture of the A14 and M1 dies… that got me thinking about what you would see if you could pass iOS under X-Rays…</p>
<p>In my previous article about the <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/">evolution of the programming languages from iPhone OS 1.0 to iOS 14</a>, I analyzed iOS based on the number of binaries and their programming languages. As I pointed out in this past post, the size of the binaries were not taken in account. In this new article, I look at iPhone OS 1.0 and iOS 14 from a size perspective using tree maps.</p>

<p>To produce the images in this article, I extracted the root filesystem (including the dyld shared cache) of each major iOS release:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<p>I then created a tree map. You might be familiar with tree maps as they are often used to visualize a file hierarchy to give you a graphical overview of the structure. One key characteristic is that each file is shown as a rectangle with an area proportional to the file's size. The tree maps displayed in this article have been created using the awesome <a href="http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/">GrandPerspective</a> and annotated with <a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/">Pixelmator</a>.</p>

<p>Let's look at what you would see if you could scan iPhone OS 1.0 using X-Rays:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The diagram below highlights some of the major functional blocks:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS1_structures.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can already notice that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The structure is quite simple and has similarities to macOS</li>
<li>Frameworks are taking more than a third of the size</li>
<li>Fonts are taking more than 25% of the whole operating system</li>
</ul>
<p>We can go one level deeper and identify all the components:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS1_details.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From the list of components, we can clearly determine all the main features of iPhone OS 1.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phone</li>
<li>SMS</li>
<li>Weather</li>
<li>Clock</li>
<li>Mail</li>
<li>Safari + Web</li>
<li>Calendar</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Wallpaper</li>
<li>Ringtones</li>
<li>Office support</li>
<li>Audio player</li>
<li>Video player</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of components worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>The UIKit framework is taking more than 13 % of the total size</li>
<li>The wallpapers and ringtones count for 6 %</li>
<li>ICU (International Components for Unicode) takes more than 5 %</li>
<li>SpringBoard is roughly 2 %</li>
</ul>

<p>On popular demand, I added this section to provide more info about the fonts.
The huge <code>Fonts</code> block is composed of 2 parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>the fonts representing 2/3 of the size</li>
<li>some caches (visible at the top of the area and representing a third of the size)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the font lovers, here is the complete list of fonts in iPhone OS 1.0:</p>
<pre><code>AmericanTypewriter.ttf
AmericanTypewriterBold.ttf
AmericanTypewriterCondensed.ttf
AmericanTypewriterCondensedBold.ttf
AmericanTypewriterCondensedLight.ttf

</code></pre>
<p>The cache contains info for all these fonts and includes the 2 extra files:</p>
<ul>
<li>HelveLTMM.ps</li>
<li>TimesLTMM.ps</li>
</ul>

<p>I won't give details about each iOS release but you can inspect the tree maps from iPhone OS 2.0 to iOS 13.1:</p>

<p>Note that the number of building blocks increased with each new iOS release and the components are becoming smaller.</p>

<p>We are now in 2020 and iOS 14 is available. Without a surprise, iOS 14 is way more complex than iPhone OS 1.0:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is the diagram highlighting the functional blocks in iOS 14:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS14_structures.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can note that the main structure is still fairly similar to the original iPhone OS 1.0 version: the fonts, frameworks, applications, library, /usr, … are still there.</p>
<p>There are however a couple of big differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 14 contains a lot of <code>Preinstalled Assets</code> and <code>Linguistic Data</code>. As far as I can tell, these components are used for on-device machine learning: language detector, voices, tokenizers, vocalizers, …</li>
<li>The dyld shared cache, a caching mechanism introduced in iPhone OS 3.1, causes the Frameworks and Private Frameworks to be split in several areas. The dyld shared cache has been marked with the red box in the diagram.</li>
<li>Health is clearly an important feature of iOS 14.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many components in iOS 14 that it is way more complex to identify all of them. I gave it a try nonetheless:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS14_details.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Although it is now difficult to list all the features, there are some clear trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 14 is packed with on-device machine learning technologies: Face Detection, Deep Convolutional Networks, Vision frameworks, Text Recognition, Neural Network, …</li>
<li>A lot of components are related to the camera and photos: Effects, Memories, video processing, photo library, …</li>
<li>Siri and voices are clearly visible.</li>
<li>As we already mentioned, Health is an important feature.</li>
<li>We can identify a couple of features added over the years: HomeKit, Watch, CarPlay, Spotlight, Emoji 🤟, News, iWork, Wallet, Shortcuts, ARKit, …</li>
</ul>
<p>More statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fonts are now counting for less than 6 % of the size</li>
<li>Linguistic Data represent almost 8 % of the size</li>
<li>Although the ICU size was multiplied by more than 3 since iPhone OS 1.0, it now represents approximatively 0.5% of the total</li>
</ul>

<p>For readability the previous tree maps in this article were all displayed using the same size. If we present iPhone OS 1.0 next to iOS 14 with a proportional area, you would see that the whole iPhone OS 1.0 is basically taking the size of the iOS 14 wallpapers:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/Compare-iOS1-iOS14.png" alt=""></p>

<p>When iPhone OS 1.0 was released in 2007, it redefined the smartphone with a limited set of core features. Nowadays iOS 14 contains an incredible amount of components. By looking at them based on their size, we can determine the most important features. We thus distinctly see Apple's AI push into on-device machine learning with technologies like object detection in images and video, language analysis, sound classification and text recognition.</p>

<p><strong>Update 24.11.2020:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added fonts in the iPhone OS 1.0 tree map</li>
<li>Added fonts in the iOS 14 tree map</li>
<li>Add section with fonts info for iPhone OS 1.0</li>
</ul>

To beat the crisis, the world can't simply rely on renewable energy, governments will need to include carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) into the mix if they want to <span>hit their climate targets.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-4uch7"><span>According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), CCUS could <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/transforming-industry-through-ccus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>reduce carbon emissions by almost a fifth</u></a>, but can this technology deliver on its promises or is it too good to be true?</span></p><h3 id="viewer-5vpth"><span>What is <!-- -->Carbon capture, usage and storage?</span></h3><p id="viewer-pi2c"><span>Carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) refers to <!-- -->a chain of different technologies aimed at capturing waste <!-- -->carbon dioxide<!-- --> (<!-- -->CO2<!-- -->), usually from large <!-- -->point sources of pollution like power plants, <!-- -->transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere. Some could be used to help grow greenhouse plants, make plastics, or even carbonate fizzy drinks. The first step is to fit factory chimneys with solvent filters, which trap carbon emissions before they escape, then the gas can be piped to locations to be used or stored. For the moment, t<span>here are about 30 CCUS projects operating around the world, which is nowhere near enough to clean up all of our emissions. </span></span></p><h3 id="viewer-fds85"><span><span>Why is CCUS needed?</span></span></h3><p id="viewer-7vj3h"><span><span>Nowadays, </span>Industrial production <span>accounts for one-quarter of CO</span>2﻿<span> emissions from energy and industrial processes.

<p><strong>Content warning</strong>: Description of a death, and photos of the cleaned site of death.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/23/death-of-sydney-uber-eats-rider-the-fourth-food-delivery-fatality-in-two-months">four cyclists were killed by car drivers in Sydney in the last 2 months</a>, a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-24/uber-eats-vows-to-improve-safety-cyclist-killed-in-inner-sydney/12913840">37-year-old man from Malaysia</a> was killed at ~6:40pm last night - on my street, 200 metres from my front door, at an intersection I cycle through 2-4 times a day. I would have gone through that intersection within 15 minutes of that time if I didn’t skip a class. If you know me, I’m usually quite outspoken about the dangers cyclists face, but this was absolutely brutal to hear.</p>
<p>They cleaned up the body, but didn’t completely clean up the UberEats meal the man was delivering. The man likely died while earning less than minimum wage - A survey conducted by the Transport Workers’ Union in September <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/23/death-of-sydney-uber-eats-rider-the-fourth-food-delivery-fatality-in-two-months">found</a> that food deliverers earned an average of just $10.42 an hour after costs. 73% said they were worried about being “seriously hurt or killed” at work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>…I was driving along Cleveland st, and only had a glimpse of what happened: for those of you arguing about PPE - I think there was a helmet - and a crushed head and body, and a twisted bicycle, and, yes, one of those grey food delivery bags all in the middle of Chalmers st. I am crying tonight, because that was someone’s child, friend … a person - who is no more… .</p>

</div><div>
<h2 id="contributing-causes">Contributing causes</h2>
<p>This is a tragedy in itself, but there are also a number of contributing causes at play here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In NSW, cycling on a footpath <a href="https://bicyclensw.org.au/who-can-ride-on-a-footpath-in-nsw/">is illegal and carries a fine of $114</a> for those above 15 years of age. Footpath cycling is <a href="https://www.bykbikes.com.au/blogs/bike-riding-tips/riding-bikes-on-the-footpath-the-laws-for-kids-and-adults-in-australia">legal in</a> Queensland, Tasmania, the ACT, the Northern Territory and South Australia.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the UK in 2017, there is a cyclist/pedestrian collision every <a href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/rise-pedestrians-hit-cyclists-not-cause-leap-conclusions-396047">~9.9 million kilometres walked by a pedestrian</a>, or 531 in total. Of these 531 collisions 3 people were killed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Gig economy workers have little training and often no insurance. California recently proposed a law to force Uber and other platforms to treat their workers like employees. It narrowly failed to pass after <a href="https://jakecoppinger.blog/articles/the-last-delivery-of-an-ubereats-cyclist-2020/Uber,%20Lyft,%20and%20DoorDash%20poured%20over%20$200%20million%20into">Uber, Lyft and Doordash spent &gt; US$200m</a> campaigning against the law.</p></li>
<li><p>Dedicated infrastructure for cyclists is rare in Sydney. Not only are separated bicycle lanes hard to come by, a state government <a href="https://concreteplayground.com/sydney/design-style/sustainability/state-goverment-moves-to-rip-up-college-street-cycleway">actively removed</a> a cycleway in 2015 (which <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/central-sydney/college-st-syclists-four-times-as-likely-to-be-involved-in-a-crash-since-cycleway-removed/news-story/98ebe30e5c649407e45fd1aa7f023049">increased accidents by 400%</a>) <a href="https://www.bicyclenetwork.com.au/newsroom/2019/03/12/planned-removal-of-alexandra-canal-cycleway/">and in 2019</a>. Walking and cycling infrastructure typically receives <a href="https://theconversation.com/cycling-and-walking-can-help-drive-australias-recovery-but-not-with-less-than-2-of-transport-budgets-142176">0.1-2% of transport budgets</a>. Clover Moore is pushing hard on adding new dedicated cycle infrastructure in the City of Sydney - <a href="https://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/building-new-infrastructure/creating-pop-up-cycleways-in-sydney">Six pop-up cycleways</a> have been added, which may remain if their is popular support.</p></li>
<li><p>Australian car drivers have a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/mythbusting-the-reasons-why-people-hate-cyclists/8689058">unique hatred of cyclists</a>. Cyclists <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/youre-a-cyclist-so-its-your-fault-20140205-321np.html">attract a level of vitriol</a>, if not outright malice, reserved for few subjects in the laid back Aussie’s mind. Even Tour de France winner Cadel Evans, a self described “car guy” who has a number of classic and sports cars, said <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/even-tour-de-france-winner-cadel-evans-finds-cycling-in-sydney-too-intimidating-20161118-gss316.html">he doesn’t cycle in Sydney</a> due to the culture. Cyclists want to be on the road even less than car drivers want them there, but as stated earlier it is illegal to cycle on the footpath.</p></li>

<h2 id="reasons-for-change">Reasons for change</h2>
<h3 id="public-safety">Public safety</h3>
<p>Car crashes are one of the <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/lifestyle/the-most-dangerous-activity-driving/">leading causes of death in western countries</a>, and air pollution due to cars killed <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/road-death-toll-should-include-victims-of-vehicle-emissions-report-20190628-p522a8.html">two times</a> as many people as <a href="https://roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au/statistics/index.html">crashes do</a> in NSW each year - and they didn’t even have a choice. <a href="http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC89231/jrc89231-online%20final%20version%202.pdf">Half of PM10 particle emissions come from tire wear, suspended road dust and brake wear</a>- electric cars (even with regen braking) won’t fix this. In the US, drivers of cars <a href="http://vpc.org/regulating-the-gun-industry/gun-deaths-compared-to-motor-vehicle-deaths/">kill more people</a> than guns each year.</p>
<p>NSW has a program called <a href="https://towardszero.nsw.gov.au/">Towards Zero</a>, with the aim of reducing road fatalities to zero. One of the few cities to achieve this goal is Oslo, which <a href="https://twitter.com/andershartmann/status/1212465415743512576">reduced pedestrian and cyclist deaths in 2019 to 0</a> by making the <em>city centre</em> <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90294948/what-happened-when-oslo-decided-to-make-its-downtown-basically-car-free">effectively car free</a>, replacing more than 700 parking spots with bike lanes, plants, parks and benches, increasing business.</p>

<h3 id="cars-are-heavily-subsidised-in-australia">Cars are heavily subsidised in Australia</h3>
<p>By the most generous measure, drivers only contribute <a href="https://www.ptua.org.au/myths/petroltax/">two-thirds of the cost of the road system</a> through rego and petrol taxes. The damage to a road is proportional to the <em>fourth power</em> of axle weight. Many cyclists also own a car and already pay rego. Contrary to popular belief, cyclists are likely subsidising car users.</p>
<h3 id="investing-in-cycle-infrastructurereducing-car-usage-makes-economic-sense">Investing in cycle infrastructure/reducing car usage makes economic sense</h3>
<p>In one study, for each dollar of investment in cycle focused infrastructure, the best practice policy returns 24 dollars in health, congestion, and air and noise pollution related benefits (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/378na1_en.pdf">Macmillan, A., Connor, J., Witten, K., et al.&nbsp;(2014). The Societal Costs and Benefits of Commuter Bicycling: Simulating the Effects of Specific Policies Using System Dynamics Modeling</a>)</p>
<p>A paper submitted to Infrastructure Australia estimated the value of commuter cycling in Australian capital cities as worth approximately <a href="https://www.infrastructureaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-06/Cycling_Infrastructure_Background_Paper_16Mar09_WEB.pdf">$0.76 per kilometre travelled</a>, equating to $2,667 for each regular commuter. Another paper <a href="https://www.infrastructureaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-06/Cycling_Infrastructure_Background_Paper_16Mar09_WEB.pdf">estimated</a> that converting drivers to cycling in Sydney &amp; Brisbane is worth $0.74 per kilometre, $1,920 per person annually in inner Sydney.</p>
<p>Banning cars on a street in Rome led to <a href="https://jakecoppinger.blog/articles/the-last-delivery-of-an-ubereats-cyclist-2020/www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/mar/13/pedestrianisation-rome-italy-car-parking-ban">30% increase</a> in retail spending in that street.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://cityobservatory.org/ten-things-more-inequitable-that-road-pricing/">a lot of things</a> in our current system more inequitable than road pricing in urban areas.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Up to now, I have used vi as an example for modal text editor, mostly because
I expect most programmers have at least heard of it. However, I don’t believe
vi and clones are the best modal text editor out there.</p>
<p>I have been working, for the last 5 years, on a new modal editor called
Kakoune. It first started as a reimplementation of Vim (the most popular vi
clone) whose source code is quite dated. But, I soon realized that we could
improve a lot on vi editing model.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_improving_on_the_editing_model">Improving on the editing model</h3>
<p>vi basic grammar is <strong>verb</strong> followed by <strong>object</strong>; it’s nice because it matches
well with the order we use in English, "delete word". On the other hand,
it does not match well with the nature of what we express: There is only
a handful of <strong>verbs</strong> in text editing (<strong>d</strong>elete, <strong>y</strong>ank, <strong>p</strong>aste,
<strong>i</strong>nsert…​), and they don’t compose, contrarily to <strong>objects</strong> which can be
arbitrarily complex, and difficult to express. That means that errors are
not handled well. If you express your object wrongly with a delete verb,
the wrong text will get deleted, you will need to undo, and try again.</p>
<p>Kakoune’s grammar is <strong>object</strong> followed by <strong>verb</strong>, combined with instantaneous
feedback, that means you always see the current object (In Kakoune we call
that the selection) before you apply your change, which allows you to correct
errors on the go.</p>
<p>Kakoune tries hard to fix one of the big problems with the vi model: its
lack of interactivity. Because of the <strong>verb</strong> followed by <strong>object</strong> grammar,
vi changes are made in the dark, we don’t see their effect until the whole
editing <strong>sentence</strong> is finished. <code>5dw</code> will delete to next five words, if
you then realize that was one word too many, you need to undo, go back to
your initial position, and try again with <code>4dw</code>. In Kakoune, you would do
<code>5W</code>, see immediately that one more word than expected was selected, type
<code>BH</code> to remove that word from the selection, then <code>d</code> to delete.  At each
step you get visual feedback, and have the opportunity to correct it.</p>
<p>At the lower level, the problem is that vi treats moving around and selecting
an object as two different things. Kakoune unifies that, moving <strong>is</strong> selecting.
<code>w</code> does not just go to the next word, it selects from current position to
the next word. By convention, capital commands tend to expand the selection,
so <code>W</code> would expand the current selection to the next word.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_multiple_selections">Multiple selections</h3>
<p>Another particular feature of Kakoune is its support for, and emphasis
towards the use of multiple selections. Multiple selections in Kakoune
are not just one additional feature, it is the central way of interacting
with your text. For example there is no such thing as a "global replace" in
Kakoune. What you would do is select the whole buffer with the <code>%</code> command,
then select all matches for a regex in the current selections (that is the
whole buffer here) with the <code>s</code> command, which prompts for a regex. You would
end up with one selection for each match of your regex and use the insert
mode to do your change. Globally replacing foo with bar would be done with
<code>%sfoo&lt;ret&gt;cbar&lt;esc&gt;</code> which is just the combination of basic building blocks.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Multiple selections provides us with a very powerful to express structural
selection: we can subselect matches inside the current selections, keep
selections containing/not containing a match, split selections on a regex,
swap selections contents…​</p>
<p>For example, convert from <code>snake_case_style</code> to <code>camelCaseStyle</code> can be done
by selecting the word (with <code>w</code> for example) then subselecting underscores
in the word with <code>s_&lt;ret&gt;</code>, deleting these with <code>d</code>, then upper casing the
selected characters with <code>~</code>. The inverse operation could be done by selecting
the word, then subselecting the upper case characters with <code>s[A-Z]&lt;ret&gt;</code>
lower casing them with ` and then inserting an underscore before them with
<code>i_&lt;esc&gt;</code> This operation could be put in a macro, and would be reusable
easily to convert any identifier.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Another example would be parameter swapping, if you had <code>func(arg2, arg1);</code>
you could select the contents of the parenthesis with <code>&lt;a-i&gt;(</code>, split the
selection on comma with <code>S, &lt;ret&gt;</code>, and swap selection contents with <code>&lt;a-)&gt;</code>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>It is as well easy to use multiple selections for alignment, as the <code>&amp;</code>
command will align all selection cursors by inserting blanks before
selection start</p>

<p>Or to use multiple selections as a way to gather some text from different
places and regroup it in another place, thanks to a special form of pasting

<div>
<h3 id="_interactive_predictable_and_fast">Interactive, predictable and fast</h3>
<p>A design goal of Kakoune is to beat vim at its own game, while providing a
cleaner editing model. The combination of multiple selections and cleaned up
grammar shows that it’s possible to have text edition that is interactive,
predictable, and fast at the same time.</p>
<p>Interactivity comes from providing feedback on every command, made possible by
the inverted <strong>object</strong> then <strong>verb</strong> grammar. Every selection modification
has direct visual feedback; regex-based selections incrementally show what
will get selected, including when the regular expression is invalid; and even
yanking some text displays a message notifying how many selections were yanked.</p>
<p>Predictability comes from the simple effect of most commands. Each command is
conceptually simple, doing one single thing. <code>d</code> deletes whatever is selected,
nothing more. <code>%</code> selects the whole buffer. <code>s</code> prompts for a regex and
selects matches in the previous selection. It is the combination of these
building blocks that allows for complex, but predictable, actions on the text.</p>
<p>Being fast, as in requiring fewer keystrokes, is provided by carefully designing
the set of editing commands so that they interact well together, and by sometimes
sacrificing beauty for useability. For example, <code>&lt;a-s&gt;</code> is equivalent to
<code>S^&lt;ret&gt;</code>: they both split on new lines, but this is such a common use case that
it deserves to have its own key shortcut. As shown in <a href="http://github.com/mawww/golf">http://github.com/mawww/golf</a>,
Kakoune manages to beat Vim at the keystroke count game in most cases,
using much more idiomatic commands.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_discoverability">Discoverability</h3>
<p>Keyboard oriented programs tend to be at a disadvantage compared to GUI
applications because they are less discoverable; there is no menu bar on
which to click to see the available options, no tooltip appearing when you
hover above a button explaining what it does.</p>
<p>Kakoune solves this problem through the use of two mechanisms: extensive
completion support, and auto-information display.</p>
<p>When a command is written in a prompt, Kakoune will automatically open a menu
providing you with the available completions for the current parameter. It
will know if the parameter is supposed to be a word against a fixed set
of word, the name of a buffer, a filename, etc…​ Actually, as soon as <code>:</code>
is typed, entering command prompt mode, the list of existing commands will
be displayed in the completion menu.</p>
<p>Additionally, Kakoune will display an information box, describing what the
command does, what optional switches it can take, what they do…​</p>
<div>
<p>Command discoverability</p>
<p>
<video src="https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/video/discoverability.webm" autoplay="" controls="" loop="">

</video>
</p>
</div>
<p>That information box gets displayed in other cases, for example if the <code>g</code>
key is hit, which then waits for another key (<code>g</code> is the <strong>goto</strong> commands
prefix), an information box will display all the recognized keys, informing
the user that Kakoune is waiting on a keystroke, and listing the available
options.</p>
<p>To go even further in discoverability, the auto information system can
be set to display an information box after each normal mode keystroke,
explaining what the key pressed just did.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_extensive_completion_support">Extensive completion support</h3>
<p>Keyboard oriented programs are much easier to work with when they provide
extensive completion support. For a long time, completion has been prefix
based, and that has been working very well.</p>
<p>More recently, we started to see more and more programs using the so called
fuzzy completion. Fuzzy completion tends to be subsequence based, instead
of prefix based, which means the typed query needs to be a subsequence of
a candidate to be considered matching, instead of a prefix. That will generate
more candidates (all prefix matches are also subsequence matches), so it
needs a good ranking algorithm to sort the matches and put the best ones first.</p>
<p>Kakoune embraces fuzzy matching for its completion support, which kicks in both
during insert mode, and prompt mode.</p>
<div>
<p>Word completion support</p>
<p>
<video src="https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/video/completion.webm" autoplay="" controls="" loop="">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
</p>
</div>
<p>Insert mode completion provides completion suggestions while inserting in the
buffer, it can complete words from the buffer, or from all buffers, lines,
filenames, or get completion candidates from an external source, making it
possible to implement intelligent code completion.</p>
<div>
<p>Language specific completion support</p>
<p>
<video src="https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/video/cpp-completion.webm" autoplay="" controls="" loop="">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
</p>
</div>
<p>Prompt completion is displayed whenever we enter command mode, and provides
completion candidates that are adapted to the command being entered, and to
the current argument being edited.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_a_better_unix_citizen">A better unix citizen</h3>
<p>Easily making programs cooperate with each others is one of the main strength
of the Unix environment. Kakoune is designed to integrate nicely with a POSIX
system: various text editing commands give direct access to the power of POSIX
tools, like <code>|</code>, which prompts for a shell command and pipe selections through
it, replacing their contents with the command output, or <code>$</code> that prompts for
a command, and keeps selections for which the command returned success.</p>
<div>
<p>Using external commands as filters</p>
<p>
<video src="https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/video/filters.webm" autoplay="" controls="" loop="">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>I love ED on CP/M.  It's often derided but I think it's just misunderstood and with a little practise its true value can shine through.  It's elegant, easy to learn and only has about 25 commands but these can be combined.  Once you get used to it most editing tasks are pretty quick.  If I'm editing text that is made up of separate lines, ideally not more than the width of the terminal, I find it excellent.  It does have a line limit of 128 characters so for continuous prose I will switch to something like Wordstar, but for editing source code and config files on CP/M, it's my first choice.</p>
<p>ED came as standard with CP/M and is only 7k for CP/M 2.2 and 10k for CP/M Plus.  One advantage of ED is that it will work both with teleprinters and video terminals without having to be configured for each device.  It is also good at manipulating large files even when the system is short of memory.</p>
<p><img src="https://techtinkering.com/img/articles/cpm_ed_copy_paste.png" title="Copying and Pasting with ED"></p><p>Like many early editors, ED is a modal editor which you start in command mode and while in this mode you can view existing text, move between lines and points in the line.  It allows you to do standard operations such as copy and paste, inserting text from other files, searching for and replacing text, etc.  When we want to enter input mode, we can use the 'I' command.  This is much like VI, except that you can only enter text in the non-command mode but not edit it.  To exit data input mode and return to command mode you use ^Z (CTRL-Z).  These commands can be combined together and one of the most powerful facilities that ED has is the 'M' Macro command to repeat sequences of commands.</p>
<p>Upon executing ED it creates a temporary output file and as you write out from ED it goes to this temporary file.  When editing a file we append text from it into the memory buffer and save to the temporary output file as we go or at the end.</p>
<p>ED keeps track of a number of values such as where it is in the source file,  the line number in the memory buffer and the character pointer (CP) on the line.  These are altered as you move around the file and memory buffer.</p>
<p>I'm not going to give a fuller explanation of how to use ED here because the CP/M 2.2 Operating Manual has a good section on the <a href="http://www.gaby.de/cpm/manuals/archive/cpm22htm/ch2.htm">CP/M Editor</a>.  I do, however, want to show it being used properly in the video below.  Further down in this article I have highlighted some useful command sequences.</p>
<h2>An Example Macro</h2>
<p>ED has a macro facility which allows you to repeat a sequence of commands as many times as you like.  This makes it a good example of the power of ED and the following is a typical macro which searches through the memory buffer and displays any occurrences of the text 'CPM', pauses in case you want to stop the macro and then replaces it with 'CP/M'.</p>
<pre><code>MFCPM^Z0TT6Z-3CSCPM^ZCP/M^Z
</code></pre>
<p>The 'M' command will run the sequences of commands that follows it until an error is raised, such as end of file.  If we wanted to we could prepend 'M' with a number to indicate the number of times we want it to run.  I'll break down each command in the sequence below:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><td><code>M</code></td><td>Run the following command sequence until an error</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>FCPM^Z</code></td><td>Find 'CPM' and leave Character Pointer (CP) after it</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>0T</code></td><td>Display the line up to CP</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>T</code></td><td>Display the rest of the line from CP to end </td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>6Z</code></td><td>Pause</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>-3C</code></td><td>Move CP back 3 characters</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>SCPM^ZCP/M^</code></td><td>Substitute 'CPM' for 'CP/M'</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>^Z</code> in the above is CTRL-Z and indicates the end of an argument for a command.</p>
<p>The above macro could also be written:</p>
<pre><code>MFCPM^Z0TT6Z-3DICP/M^Z
</code></pre>
<p>In which case:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><td><code>-3D</code></td><td>Delete the 3 previous characters</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>ICPM^Z</code></td><td>Insert the text 'CP/M'</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2>Video</h2>
<p>The video below shows ED being used properly and some of the things that make it great, including searching and replacing text, copying and pasting, macros and handling files bigger than the available memory.</p>
<p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7pqaj050X7g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<h2>Common Command Sequences</h2>
<p>Below are some useful command command sequences which may be overlooked when reading the manual for ED.</p>
<div><table>
  <tbody><tr><th>Sequence</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
  <tr><td>#A</td><td>Load whole file into buffer</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0A</td><td>Load enough of the file to fill half the buffer.  This is great for large files</td></tr>
  <tr><td>#W0A</td><td>Save entire buffer and load more of the source file, enough to fill half of the buffer.  Useful to move through large files.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0W</td><td>Write half of the buffer to the new file.  Useful to make room of the buffer is full.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>-B</td><td>Move to end of the last line in the buffer</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0L</td><td>Move CP to beginning of line</td></tr>
  <tr><td>L-2C</td><td>Move to end of line before the &lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt; sequence</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0P</td><td>Display page from CP without moving CP</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0LT</td><td>Move CP to beginning of line and display line (Should this be +/-n ??)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0T</td><td>Type line up to but not including CP</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0TT</td><td>Type whole line without moving CP</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0T&lt;cr&gt;T</td><td>Type whole line without moving CP.  Display up to CP on first list and from CP on next line.  This is useful to see where CP is on line.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>B#T</td><td>Display the whole buffer</td></tr>
  <tr><td>KI</td><td>Replace a line</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0K</td><td>Delete up to CP on current line</td></tr>
  <tr><td>S^L^Z</td><td>Join current line with next</td></tr>
  <tr><td>I^L^Z</td><td>To split a line at CP</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0V</td><td>Print free/total memory buffer stats</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0X</td><td>Empties the temporary default exchange file: X$$$$$$$.LIB, used by the <em>X</em> command</td></tr>
</tbody></table></div>
<p>In the table above the following holds true:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>#</dt><dd>Represents the highest value for n</dd>
  <dt>^L</dt><dd>CTRL-L - Stands for carriage return sequence &lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;</dd>
  <dt>^Z</dt><dd>CTRL-Z - Indicates the end of a command's argument</dd>
  <dt>&lt;cr&gt;</dt><dd>Carriage Return - Actually pressing the <em>Return</em> key</dd>
</dl>
<br>
<h2>Do You Like ED Too?</h2>
<p>I know that I'm in the minority, but I'm sure there must be other people who also like ED.  I'd love to hear if I'm not alone in this.  You can leave comments via the links below or via the YouTube video above.</p>

<p>The Intel NUC <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/76978/">D34010WYK</a> has a LAN port with two integrated LEDs. Both are permanently on when a connection is established, with one LED blinking on network activity. This can be rather distracting, particularly at night. So I went on to figure out how to disable the LEDs. It's a general solution that should work with every OS, every NUC, and every somewhat recent Intel NIC (Network Interface Card). Perhaps most devices with an Intel Ethernet controller.</p>
<p>The most obvious and low-tech solution is to tape the LEDs. I haven't tried as an observation led me on a different path. I noticed that a few seconds into booting Ubuntu, the LEDs are briefly switched off. I concluded this must be done through software somehow. This didn't turn out to be entirely correct or useful, as the driver (kernel module) merely resets the controller when it loads, but made me curious enough to proceed.</p>
<p>First, a step back to know the controller used in the NUC.</p>
<p>$ lspci | grep Ethernet
00:19.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation Ethernet Connection I218-V (rev 04)</p>
<p>Intel ARK has <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/71305/">more information</a>, including a very detailed 262-pages datasheet, which will prove essential.</p>
<h2>Kernel</h2>
<p>I wondered if the option to disable LEDs is perhaps provided through a kernel module parameter. I already knew the  module name for recent Intel Ethernet devices: <i>e1000e</i>. If I hadn't, <a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/search?keyword=I218">searching</a> the Intel Download Center for <i>I218</i> and filtering for <i>Linux</i> tells the same. And sure enough, the module is loaded.</p>
<p>$ lsmod | grep e1000e
e1000e                226396  0
ptp                    19395  1 e1000e</p>
<p>Many parameters, but none to change the behavior of LEDs. As confirmed by the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/e1000e.txt">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>$ modinfo -p e1000e
debug:Debug level (0=none,...,16=all) (int)
copybreak:Maximum size of packet that is copied to a new buffer on receive (uint)

WriteProtectNVM:Write-protect NVM [WARNING: disabling this can lead to corrupted NVM] (array of int)
CrcStripping:Enable CRC Stripping, disable if your BMC needs the CRC (array of int)</p>
<p>It turns out such a parameter was <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/e1000/feature-requests/2/">requested</a> years ago, but denied by Intel with the following explanation.</p>
<p><span></span><span>I'm sorry, but this feature request was evaluated and denied because the majority of our customers require the LEDs to function as-is, and module parameters of this type are unacceptable.</span><span></span></p>
<p>So I downloaded the kernel model <a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/15817">source</a>, hoping to modify it, and eventually noticed a promising function.</p>
<p>
static s32 e1000_led_off_pchlan(struct e1000_hw *hw)
{
    u16 data = (u16)hw-&gt;mac.ledctl_mode1;
    u32 i, led;

    
    if (!(er32(STATUS) &amp; E1000_STATUS_LU)) {
        for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
            led = (data &gt;&gt; (i * 5)) &amp; E1000_PHY_LED0_MASK; 
            if ((led &amp; E1000_PHY_LED0_MODE_MASK) !=
                E1000_LEDCTL_MODE_LINK_UP)
                continue;
            if (led &amp; E1000_PHY_LED0_IVRT)
                data &amp;= ~(E1000_PHY_LED0_IVRT &lt;&lt; (i * 5));
            else
                data |= (E1000_PHY_LED0_IVRT &lt;&lt; (i * 5));
        }
    }

    return e1e_wphy(hw, HV_LED_CONFIG, data);
}</p><p>Perhaps more complex than you'd expect such a simple task to be. Many constants and bit operations. Lots more in related functions. I figured this must be documented, presumably in the <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/i218-ethernet-connection-datasheet.pdf">datasheet</a>. Browsing it cut my plans to modify the kernel module short, as it spells out a better alternative: NVM (Non-Volatile Memory).</p>
<p><span></span><span>The PHY has three LED outputs that can be configured via the NVM. The default values for the PHY (based on the LED NVM word 0x18 of the LAN region) are listed in the table below.</span><span></span></p>

<p>If you're wondering why the table mentions 3 LEDs when the LAN port only has 2: the second LED is bi-colored and can switch state to either green (LED2) or amber (LED1).</p>
<p>As a closing note on the kernel module: the code does not do what it appears to. Its only purpose is to provide an interface for blinking a single LED on request, in order to identify a NIC or LAN port. It's unrelated to LEDs blinking on network activity or otherwise, which is done in hardware.</p>
<h2>NVM</h2>
<p>Writeable flash memory, which holds configuration, like the MAC address or power management settings, detailed in the table below. The LED configuration is stored in the previously mentioned word <span>0x18</span>.</p>

<p>A minor detour first to explain the term <i>word</i>. It refers to a 2-byte (16-bit) value in little-endian order, meaning in reverse byte order. So value <span>0x1c10</span> is written <span>0x101c</span> to NVM. Very simple to do manually, by just swapping bytes, but can be done programmatically too. (These will be useful later.)</p>
<p>
def swap(value):
    return hex(value &gt;&gt; 8 | (value &amp; 0xFF) &lt;&lt; 8)

&gt;&gt;&gt; swap(0x1c10)
'0x101c'</p>
<p>
function swap(value) {
    return '0x' + ((value &gt;&gt; 8 | (value &amp; 0xFF) &lt;&lt; 8)).toString(16);
};

&gt; swap(0x1c10)
"0x101c"</p>
<p>Word <span>0x18</span> is encoded as follows.</p>

<p>It's a bit sequence with 5 bits each per LED. The first 3 bits on each LED set the mode, detailed in the second table. The remaining 2 bits invert and blink the LED. Below is a visual explanation on how to read this, using the default values.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.pwmon.org/1900/f418.x1.png?201706071858" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.pwmon.org/1900/f418.x2.png?201706071858 2x"></p><p>Such a sequence can be used directly with the <span>swap</span> function defined earlier, with <span>0b</span> prefix to indicate bits.</p>
<p>&gt; swap(0b0001100011110100)
"0xf418"</p>
<p>Now to construct a bit sequence to turn LEDs off permanently. As you notice, there is no mode to just flat disable an LED. It's still possible to get effectively the same result. There are two solutions.</p>
<p><span>1</span><span>Set the mode of each LED to <span>010</span>, so LEDs are on on any connection, and set the invert bit on each LED. Ergo, LEDs are off on any connection. With a minor side effect: in case of no connection, LEDs are on. (When the network cable is pulled, or when the opposite side is off.)</span></p>

<p>&gt; swap(0b0010100101001010)
"0x4a29"</p>
<p><span>2</span><span>Set the mode of each LED to <span>101</span>, so LEDs are on <b>only</b> on a 10Mbps connection. Ergo, LEDs are off for either a 100Mbps or 1Gbps connection. Without side effect, as LEDs stay off in case of no connection.</span></p>

<p>&gt; swap(0b0001010010100101)
"0xa514"</p>
<p>There are two additional variants to the second solution, which exclude the other link speed combinations each. I'll leave constructing the bit sequence for both as an exercise to the reader. Of both solutions I prefer the second due to lack of side effect when a link speed can be excluded. Usually either 10Mbps or 1Gbps definitely can be. A way to get the negotiated link speed is to use <i>dmesg</i>.</p>
<p>$ dmesg -t | grep e1000e
...
e1000e: eth0 NIC Link is Up 100 Mbps Full Duplex, Flow Control: Rx/Tx</p>
<p>So <span>0xa514</span> it is. Ready to write to NVM. The datasheet tells how.</p>
<p><span></span><span>Intel has an MS-DOS* software utility called EEupdate that is used to program the SPI Flash images in development or production line environments. A copy of this program can be obtained through your Intel Field Service representative.</span><span></span></p>
<p>That's no good. <i>EEupdate</i> is not publicly available. A bit of research reveals another Intel tool named <i>LANConf</i>, available for DOS, Linux, and Windows, which can also write to NVM, but can only be obtained by applying for a <a href="https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/my-intel/design-center-privileged-access-required.html">privileged account</a> and signing a Non-Disclosure Agreement. Fortunately, <i><a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/network/ethtool/">ethtool</a></i> can handle NVM too.</p>
<p>To read from NVM, use as follows. (EEPROM and NVM are used interchangeably from here on.)</p>
<p>% ethtool -e|--eeprom-dump devname [raw on|off] [offset N] [length N]</p>
<p>As per the NVM Address Map, word <span>0x18</span> is at NVM byte offset <span>0x30</span>.</p>
<p>$ sudo ethtool -e eth0 offset 0x30 length 2
Offset      Values
------      ------
0x0030:     f4 18</p>
<p>It matches the default value constructed earlier. Now to the important part: writing to NVM.</p>
<p>% ethtool -E|--change-eeprom devname [magic N] [offset N] [length N] [value N]</p>
<p>So <i>offset</i>, <i>length</i>, and <i>value</i> are obvious, but what does <i>magic</i> refer to? The manual knows.</p>
<p><span></span><span>Because of the persistent nature of writing to the EEPROM, a device-specific magic key must be specified to prevent the accidental writing to the EEPROM.</span><span></span></p>
<p>Where the device-specific magic key can be obtained from isn't documented anywhere. It appears to be kept somewhat secret on purpose. Only the file <i>ethtool.c</i> in the kernel module source code explains it.</p>
<p>eeprom-&gt;magic = adapter-&gt;pdev-&gt;vendor | (adapter-&gt;pdev-&gt;device &lt;&lt; 16);</p>
<p>Here <i>vendor</i> and <i>device</i> refer to <a href="https://pcisig.com/membership">PCI IDs</a>. There are numerous ways to get them, with the easiest perhaps being <i>lspci</i>.</p>
<p>$ lspci -nnq | grep Ethernet
00:19.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Intel Corporation Ethernet Connection I218-V [<b>8086</b>:<b>1559</b>] (rev 04)</p>
<p>The bold numbers are the <i>vendor</i> and <i>device</i> ID respectively, in hex. So this should give the magic key.</p>
<p>
&gt; '0x' + (0x8086 | (0x1559 &lt;&lt; 16)).toString(16)
"0x15598086"</p>
<p>Very simple. Alright, commence writing.</p>
<p>$ sudo ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x15598086 offset 0x30 length 2 value 0xa514
ethtool: bad command line argument(s)</p>
<p>The value of <i>value</i> can only be a single byte. The <i>length</i> parameter repeats that byte. (This isn't documented.) Both bytes must hence be written separately. </p>
<p>$ sudo ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x15598086 offset 0x30 value 0xa5
Cannot set EEPROM data: Invalid argument</p>
<p>This rather non-descriptive error took me quite a while to figure out. The <i>e1000e</i> kernel module included with the default kernel of Ubuntu 14.04.2 does not support writing to NVM, in this case at least. Intel has <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/network-and-i-o/ethernet-products/000005480.html">instructions</a> for compiling and installing the latest kernel module from source. Now it should work.</p>
<p>$ sudo ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x15598086 offset 0x30 value 0xa5
$ sudo ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x15598086 offset 0x31 value 0x14</p>
<p>And it does. Note: the LEDs remain unchanged until either the NUC is reset or the kernel module is reloaded.</p>

<p>I have not verified, but modifying NVM should also work for other OSes, unless the …</p></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Quantization refers to techniques for performing computations and storing tensors at lower bitwidths than floating point precision. A quantized model executes some or all of the operations on tensors with integers rather than floating point values. This allows for a more compact model representation and the use of high performance vectorized operations on many hardware platforms. This technique is in particular useful at the inference time since it saves a lot of inference computation cost without sacrificing too much inference accuracies.</p>



<p>So far, major deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, have supported quantization natively. The users have been using the built-in quantization modules successfully without knowing how it works exactly. In this article, I would like to elucidate the mathematics of quantization for neural networks so that the developers would have some ideas about the quantization mechanisms.</p>

<h3 id="quantization">Quantization</h3>

<h4 id="quantization-mapping">Quantization Mapping</h4>

<p>Quantization maps a floating point value $x \in [\alpha, \beta]$ to a $b$-bit integer $x_q \in [\alpha_q, \beta_q]$.</p>



<p>Mathematically, the de-quantization process is defined as</p><p>

\[x = c (x_q + d)\]

</p><p>and the quantization process is defined as</p><p>

\[x_q = \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{c} x - d\big)\]

</p><p>where $c$ and $d$ are variables.</p>



<p>In order to derive $c$ and $d$, we have to make sure that $\alpha$ maps to $\alpha_q$ and $\beta$ maps to $\beta_q$. So we would just have to solve the linear system</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\beta &amp;= c (\beta_q + d) \\
\alpha &amp;= c (\alpha_q + d) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The solutions is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
c &amp;= \frac{\beta - \alpha}{\beta_q - \alpha_q} \\
d &amp;= \frac{\alpha \beta_q - \beta \alpha_q}{\beta - \alpha} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>In practice, we would have to ensure that $0$ in floating point is represented exactly with no error after quantization.</p>



<p>Mathematically, we need to ensure</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
x_q &amp;= \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{c} 0 - d\big) \\
&amp;= \text{round}(- d) \\
&amp;= - \text{round}(d) \\
&amp;= - d \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This means that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
d &amp;= \text{round}(d) \\
&amp;= \text{round}\big(\frac{\alpha \beta_q - \beta \alpha_q}{\beta - \alpha}\big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>By convention, we denote $c$ as the scale $s$ and $-d$ as the zero point $z$.</p>



<p>To summarize, the de-quantization process is defined as</p><p>

\[x = s (x_q - z)\]

</p><p>and the quantization process is defined as</p><p>

\[x_q = \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{s} x + z\big)\]

</p><p>The value of scale $s$ and zero point $z$ are</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
s &amp;= \frac{\beta - \alpha}{\beta_q - \alpha_q} \\
z &amp;= \text{round}\big(\frac{\beta \alpha_q - \alpha \beta_q}{\beta - \alpha}\big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that $z$ is an integer and $s$ is a <em>positive</em> floating point number.</p>

<h4 id="value-clipping">Value Clipping</h4>

<p>In practice, the quantization process will have chance to have $x$ that is outside the range of $[\alpha, \beta]$, thus the quantized value $x_q$ will also be outside the range of $[\alpha_q, \beta_q]$. If the integer type is signed <code>INTb</code> and $(\alpha_q, \beta_q) = (-2^{b-1}, 2^{b-1}-1)$, or unsigned <code>UINTb</code> and $(\alpha_q, \beta_q) = (0, 2^{b}-1)$, programming languages that have fixed type-precisions will clip the values that are outside the range.</p>



<p>More concretely, the quantization process will have an additional clip step.</p><p>

\[x_q = \text{clip}\Big( \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{s} x + z\big), \alpha_q, \beta_q \Big)\]

</p><p>where $\text{clip}(x, l, u)$ function is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\text{clip}(x, l, u) &amp;= 
    \begin{cases}
      l &amp; \text{if $x &lt; l$}\\
      x &amp; \text{if $l \leq x \leq u$}\\
      u &amp; \text{if $x &gt; u$}\\
    \end{cases} 
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="affine-quantization-mapping">Affine Quantization Mapping</h4>

<p>The quantization mapping we discussed above is also called affine quantization mapping.</p>

<h4 id="scale-quantization-mapping">Scale Quantization Mapping</h4>

<p>If the integer type is signed <code>INTb</code>, $(\alpha_q, \beta_q) = (-2^{b-1} + 1, 2^{b-1}-1)$ and we force $z = 0$.</p>



<p>Mathematically, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{gather}
\alpha_q = -\beta_q \\
\text{round}\big(\frac{\beta \alpha_q - \alpha \beta_q}{\beta - \alpha}\big) = 0 \\
\end{gather}\]

</p><p>This results in $\alpha = -\beta$. Therefore, we are mapping between the floating point range $[\alpha, -\alpha]$ and the integer range $[\alpha_q, -\alpha_q]$. Because it is exactly symmetric around $0$, we also call it symmetric quantization mapping.</p>



<p>Note that scale quantization mapping is just a special case of the affine quantization mapping, and we have an unused bit in the integer range.</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p>The quantization function is defined as</p><p>

\[f_q(x, s, z) = \text{clip}\Big( \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{s} x + z\big), \alpha_q, \beta_q \Big)\]

</p><p>and the de-quantization function is defined as</p><p>

\[f_d(x_q, s, z) = s (x_q - z)\]

</p><h3 id="quantized-matrix-multiplication">Quantized Matrix Multiplication</h3>

<h4 id="quantized-matrix-multiplication-mathematics">Quantized Matrix Multiplication Mathematics</h4>

<p>Suppose we have to perform the matrix multiplication $Y = XW + b$, where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times p}$, $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times n}$, and $b \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ resulting in $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
Y_{i, j} = b_j + \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{i,k} W_{k,j}
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We would need to do $p$ floating number multiplications and $p$ floating number additions to compute one single entry in $Y$. To complete the full matrix multiplication, given there are $mn$ entries in $Y$, we would need to do $mpn$ floating number multiplications and $mpn$ floating number additions.</p>



<p>Depending on the floating number precision, such the speed of such floating point matrix multiplication might not be favored. So the question becomes can we complete the same matrix multiplication using quantized values.</p>



<p>Here we apply the de-quantization equation.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
Y_{i, j} &amp;= b_j + \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{i,k} W_{k,j} \\
&amp;= s_b (b_{q, j} - z_b) + \sum_{k=1}^{p} s_X(X_{q,i,k} - z_X) s_W(W_{q, k,j} - z_W)\\
&amp;= s_b (b_{q, j} - z_b) + s_X s_W \sum_{k=1}^{p} (X_{q,i,k} - z_X) (W_{q, k,j} - z_W)\\
&amp;= s_b (b_{q, j} - z_b) + s_X s_W \Bigg[ \bigg( \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} W_{q, k,j} \bigg) - \bigg( z_W \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} \bigg) - \bigg( z_X \sum_{k=1}^{p} W_{q, k,j} \bigg) + p z_X z_W\Bigg]\\
&amp;= s_Y(Y_{q,i,j} - z_Y)\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $X_q$, $W_q$, $b_q$ and $Y_q$ are the quantized matrix for $X$, $W$, $b$ and $Y$, respectively, $s_X$, $s_W$, $s_b$, and $s_Y$ are the scales for $X$, $W$, $b$ and $Y$, respectively, and $z_X$, $z_W$, $z_b$ and $z_Y$ are the zero points for $X$, $W$, $b$ and $Y$, respectively.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[Y_{q,i,j} = z_Y + \frac{s_b}{s_Y} (b_{q, j} - z_b) + \frac{s_X s_W}{s_Y} \Bigg[ \bigg( \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} W_{q, k,j} \bigg) - \bigg( z_W \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} \bigg) - \bigg( z_X \sum_{k=1}^{p} W_{q, k,j} \bigg) + p z_X z_W\Bigg]\]

</p><p>Note that in the above equation the following terms are constants during inference and therefore could be computed offline before inference.</p>

<ul>
  <li>$z_Y$</li>
  <li>$\frac{s_b}{s_Y} (b_{q, j} - z_b)$</li>
  <li>$z_X \sum_{k=1}^{p} W_{q, k,j}$</li>
  <li>$p z_X z_W$</li>
</ul>

<p>Term $\sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} W_{q, k,j}$ suggests that we could just do the integer matrix multiplication for $X_q$ and $W_q$. Such integer matrix multiplication could employ special hardware and algorithms, such as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tensor-cores/">NVIDIA Tensor Core</a> and <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/ampere-tuning-guide/index.html#tensor-operations">Tensor Core IMMA operations</a>, and runs much faster than conventional integer matrix multiplication.</p>

    <figcaption>NVIDIA Tensor Core Operations</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>One additional thing to note is that $s_X$, $s_W$, $s_Y$, $z_X$, $z_W$, and $z_Y$ are floating point and integer constants, instead of variables. So there could be some special compile-time optimizations for those multiplications.</p>



<p>This could be retrieved from the resulting integer matrix from $X_q$ and $W_q$ multiplication, which is much faster than the floating number matrix multiplication for the same sizes.</p>



<p>The significance of such quantized matrix multiplication is that the product integer matrix could be converted back to floating point matrix using the scale and the zero point of the product integer matrix and it is almost numerically equivalent. If we have to do a sequence of matrix multiplications whose inputs and outputs are floating point numbers, for example</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
X_1 &amp;= X_0 W_0 + b_0\\
X_2 &amp;= X_1 W_1 + b_1\\
&amp;\vdots \\
X_n &amp;= X_n W_n + b_n\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We could convert the math to the followings using quantized matrices.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
X_{0, q} &amp;= f_q(X_0, s_{X_0}, z_{X_0})\\
X_{1, q} &amp;= f_m(X_{0, q}, W_{0, q}, b_{0, q}, s_{X_0}, z_{X_0}, s_{W_0}, z_{W_0}, s_{b_0}, z_{b_0}, s_{X_1}, z_{X_1}) \\
X_{2, q} &amp;= f_m(X_{1, q}, W_{1, q}, b_{1, q}, s_{X_1}, z_{X_1}, s_{W_1}, z_{W_1}, s_{b_1}, z_{b_1}, s_{X_2}, z_{X_2}) \\
&amp;\vdots \\
X_{n, q} &amp;= f_m(X_{n-1, q}, W_{n-1, q}, b_{n-1, q}, s_{X_{n-1}}, z_{X_{n-1}}, s_{W_{n-1}}, z_{W_{n-1}}, s_{b_{n-1}}, z_{b_{n-1}}, s_{X_n}, z_{X_n}) \\
X_n &amp;= f_d(X_{n, q}, s_{X_n}, z_{X_n})
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $f_q$ is the quantization function, $f_m$ is the quantized matrix multiplication function, and $f_d$ is the de-quantization function.</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<p>In the following example, we simulated the quantization matrix multiplication of $Y = XW + b$ using random matrix $X$, $W$ and $b$.</p>

      <li>needs only <b>200 KB</b>, <b>32 KB RAM</b>, <b>40 MHz CPU</b>!</li>
      <li><b>suckless</b>, pure C, <b>no dependencies</b>, no FPU, GPU or file I/O needed</li>

      <li>completely <b>gratis</b>, without ads, DRM or similar bullshit</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This isn't a 90s style retro shooter, this <b>is</b> a 90s shooter.
    </p>

    <p>
      This game runs everywhere and adheres to great <a href="https://suckless.org/">simplicity</a>.
      It is much more efficient and portable than Doom and has completely
      <b>no dependencies</b>. Not even floating point is used, in case your
      computer doesn't have the HW unit. The game can fit into <b>200 KB</b>
      (including assets!) and can run with just <b>32 KB RAM</b>. No build system,
      library, internet connection or package manager is inherently required for
      compilation as the whole game is written in pure C language.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is an experiment and art that categorically rejects capitalist
      technology.

    <span>MORE THAN A GAME</span>

    <p>
      This is not a mere entertainment or toy meant for killing time or pursuing
      low goals such as making profit or something to put on portfolio, this is
      much more. Anarch is completely <b>gratis and free as in freedom</b> and
      besides entertainment can also be used for education, research, hacking, media
      creation, as a benchmark, as a test, as an environment, as an engine, as
      a basis for something greater. You are not limited by anything, there are
      no conditions to agree to. Nothing is hidden, everything is allowed, no
      burdens are imposed. The best motivation for creating anything is only
      the <b>pure love of creation for its own sake</b>, unburdened by any other
      goal than creating something truly useful.

    <span>NO ONE OWNS THIS</span>

    <p>
      Not even I, the creator, own any part of this game.
      I&nbsp;have purposefully created everything myself from scratch,
      including the engine, graphics, sounds, music, even the font and palette,
      so that I could eventually give up all my rights and
      dedicate this game fully and <b>completely to the public domain</b>,
      to you, my dear fellow human being. No one should be allowed to own
      information and art.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've done my best to ensure this is 100% free as in freedom software and
      culture, well understandable and documented. This isn't made for any
      profit. This is made out of <b>love</b>, for you and for the greater good.

<p>I haven't written straight JavaScript in years. I use <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> for everything, including DOM manipulation, integrating with audio libraries and TensorFlow models, and using graphics libraries like <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>.

</p><p>This page explains how.

</p><h2>Pros and Cons of Go for web programming</h2>

<p>The good: Go is a great glue language, and most web programming is gluing things together. Even though Go doesn't have a complicated type system, most code I write works the first time. Go compiles to every architecture and platform that I've ever cared about, including web browsers, so I can usually reuse my packages regardless of where the code runs.

</p><p>On the other hand, the syscall/js syntax is annoyingly verbose, particularly when it comes to callbacks, and particularly when those callbacks are used with Promises. I mitigate these issues by isolating usage of syscall/js in shared packages, <a href="https://research.swtch.com/deps#abstract_the_dependency">as you might for any other dependency</a>.

</p><p>The <em>motivation</em> for me to write this article is that I feel very productive writing web sites with Go and I want to share that secret superpower with you. However, the <em>point</em> of writing this article is to make writing Go on the web easy by showing you the hard parts up front. Since I try to illustrate every roadblock with as little code as possible, it might look like Go web development is all roadblocks, but that's not true. Please don't be discouraged! It gets easier as your code base scales.

</p><h2>Scaffolding</h2>



<p>There's one entry point for the server, and one for the code that runs in the browser. It just takes these four files to get off the ground:

</p><ul>
<li>project/server/main.go
</li><li>project/server/public/index.html
</li><li>project/browser/main.go
</li><li>project/browser/generate.go (only needed for convenience)
</li></ul>

<p>Inititalize the project by running <tt>go mod init yourproject</tt> in the project/ directory. <a href="https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules">This is good Go hygeine these days</a>; it creates a file in your project directory that tracks version numbers and hashes of all your dependencies.

</p><hr>

<h3>project/server/main.go</h3>



<p>Until you add more server-side features, project/server/main.go just serves the static files in the public/ directory:

</p><pre><code>package main

import (
	"flag"
	"net/http"
)

var httpAddress = flag.String("http_address", "localhost:8080", "Address for serving HTTP")

func main() {
	http.Handle("/", http.FileServer(http.Dir("public")))
	http.ListenAndServe(*httpAddress, nil)
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3>project/server/public/index.html</h3>



<p>index.html just needs to invoke the compiled Go code:

</p><pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;yourproject&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;script src="wasm_exec.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
if (!WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming) {
	// Polyfill, required for Safari.
	WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming = async (resp, importObject) =&gt; {
		const source = await (await resp).arrayBuffer();
		return await WebAssembly.instantiate(source, importObject);
	};
}

const go = new Go();
WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("main.wasm"), go.importObject).then((result) =&gt; {
	go.run(result.instance);
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The section below about generate.go explains where wasm_exec.js and main.wasm come from.

</p><hr>

<h3>project/browser/main.go</h3>

<p>This is the entry-point for the Go code that runs in the browser, including some examples of how to access global JavaScript objects (which is the same for <tt>document.body</tt> and the rest of the DOM):

</p><pre><code>// +build js,wasm

package main

import (
	"syscall/js"
)

func main() {
	js.Global().Get("console").Call("log", "Hello, World!")

	var cb js.Func
	cb = js.FuncOf(func(this js.Value, args []js.Value) interface{} {
		js.Global().Call("alert", "Hello, World!")
		cb.Release()
		return nil
	})
	js.Global().Call("setTimeout", cb, 2000)

	&lt;-(make(chan bool))
}</code></pre>

<p>I told you the syscall/js syntax was awful.

</p><p>I end with <tt>&lt;-(make(chan bool))</tt> because otherwise, the Go program exits, and any DOM callbacks you've registered (click handlers, timers, etc) that call into Go code will fail.

</p><hr>

<h3>project/browser/generate.go</h3>

<p>index.html refers to two files that you don't write by hand: wasm_exec.js ships with Go, and main.wasm is compiled from project/browser/main.go.

</p>

<p>I put <a href="https://blog.golang.org/generate">go:generate</a> directives in generate.go, which allows you to run <tt>go generate</tt> to put both files into the public/ directory:

</p><pre><code>package main

//go:generate cp $GOROOT/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js ../server/public/
//go:generate env GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o ../server/public/main.wasm</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>Start the server in one terminal:

</p><pre><code>$ cd project/server/
$ go run main.go</code></pre>



<p>Re-compile the code that runs in the browser whenever you make a change:

</p><pre><code>$ cd project/browser/
$ go generate</code></pre>

<p>View your new, fancy web site by visiting <a href="http://localhost:8080/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/</a>

</p><h2>Miscellaneous notes</h2>

<h3><tt>foo == null</tt></h3>

<p>When I wrote JavaScript, I avoided having to care about the difference between JavaScript's <tt>null</tt> and <tt>undefined</tt> by always coercing them to the same value with <tt>==</tt>. For example, <tt>foo == null</tt> is true regardless of whether foo is <tt>null</tt> or <tt>undefined</tt>.

</p><p>That option isn't available with Go's <tt>js.Null()</tt> and <tt>js.Undefined()</tt>, so be prepared to care about the difference, or write a helper.

</p><h3>Promises and async functions</h3>

<p>As you saw above, Go functions that are used as JavaScript callbacks are not automatically garbage-collected and have elaborate syntax. That makes Promises and <tt>async</tt> functions hard to deal with.

</p>

<p>So I use this helper to convert Promises to idiomatic Go return values:

</p><pre><code>func UnwrapPromise(promise js.Value) (js.Value, error) {
	retc := make(chan js.Value)
	errc := make(chan error)

	var release func()
	success := js.FuncOf(func(this js.Value, args []js.Value) interface{} {
		retc &lt;- args[0]
		release()
		return nil
	})
	failure := js.FuncOf(func(this js.Value, args []js.Value) interface{} {
		errc &lt;- fmt.Errorf("%v", args[0])
		release()
		return nil
	})
	release = func() {
		success.Release()
		failure.Release()
	}

	promise.Call("then", success).Call("catch", failure)
	select {
	case ret := &lt;-retc:
		return ret, nil
	case err := &lt;-errc:
		return js.Undefined(), err
	}
}</code></pre>

									<p><span>Founders and co-founders alike are the foundation of any startup.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“You can always change the idea you are working on, but it’s much harder to get rid of a cofounder. So you want to choose cofounders very carefully.” — Jessica Livingston</span></p>
<p><span>This person should be someone you know. You’ve already worked with this person. You know they are effective, reliable, and share similar ambitions/moral outlooks as you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Jessica suggests that these 3 qualities should make up the founding team as a whole:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b><i>Determination</i></b><span>: “Startups are really hard and take a really long time. There has to be at least one founder who’s just a tower of strength. Part of being determined is being able to withstand rejection. People will think your idea is lame, customers won’t be interested, investors will say no, reporters won’t care. And they might not be polite about it either. But you can’t let rejection discourage you.” — Jessica Livingston</span></li>
<li><b><i>Domain expertise</i></b><span>: “At least one of the founders should be an expert in what you’re working on” — Jessica Livingston</span></li>
<li><b><i>Ability/willingness to sell</i></b><span>: “Someone has to be the face of the company—to sell the product to customers, and sell the company itself to investors, the press, and potential hires. At least one of you is going to have to sell.” — Jessica Livingston</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>If you know you want to start a startup one day, but you’re not ready now, start working on smaller projects with friends or potential future co-founders. You’ll be able to filter out who fits the criteria above vs. who doesn’t.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“A good way to ensure that you make something people want is to make something you yourself want. But remember that making something for yourself is just a heuristic to guide you in finding an idea. In the actual execution, you need to focus on users. You need to understand what they want, and be fanatically dedicated to making them happy. One very important piece of advice we give startups is to ‘do things that don’t scale.’ That means to do so much for your early users that you couldn’t possibly keep doing that much if you were bigger.” — Jessica Livingston</span></p>
<p><span>All in all, Jessica finishes with “if you can make something people want, if you can focus on delighting users, and you measure how much you delight them in revenue, then you can start a startup. That’s the standard to hold yourself to, not the stock character founder you see in the press.”</span></p>

								<p><b><i>My two cents</i></b><span>: A thing that I’ve somewhat figured out is that there’s no secret playbook for building a company. There are obviously certain things you need to know (that I’m still figuring out), but it seems to essentially boil down to Jessica’s final quote above. </span></p>

                                <p>Loblaw Companies Ltd. plans to roll out its first autonomous delivery service in January, as Canada's largest retailer explores new ways of shipping goods to customers amid a broad increase in online shopping.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Loblaw partnered with Palo Alto, Calif.-based software startup Gatik AI for the delivery service. Gatik, which also has offices in Toronto, was founded in 2017 and focuses on the "middle mile" of logistics where it hauls goods over short distances for retailers and distributors. The company raised $4.5 million in seed funding in 2018 and counts Walmart Inc. as a customer in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Loblaw said the new service includes five Ford Transit 350 box trucks outfitted with Gatik's self-driving system, which will drive on five fixed routes across the Toronto area for seven days a week, 12 hours a day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The vehicles will provide a contactless delivery solution for transporting goods from Loblawâ€™s automated picking facility to retail locations, the retailer said.</p>

<p>"As more Canadians are turning to online grocery shopping, we need to continue to identify new ways to make our supply chain more efficient," said Lauren Steinberg, senior vice president of Loblaw Digital, in a phone interview. "And 'middle mile' autonomous delivery is a great example of one way we think we can achieve that."</p>

<p>While the number of autonomous trucks remains small in the U.S. and Canada, they have the potential to radically disrupt how merchandise is moved. A 2018 report by McKinsey &amp; Co. found that if trucking companies shifted entirely to autonomous vehicles, it would help cut operating costs by 45 per cent, saving the industry as much as US$125 billion a year.</p>

<p>Loblaw said earlier this month its e-commerce sales climbed 175 per cent in the third quarter, driven by shoppers turning to online shopping to avoid physical bricks-and-mortar stores during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To abide by Canadian regulations, all of Loblaw's self-driving trucks will have a safety driver as a co-pilot. It marks the first autonomous delivery fleet in commercial operation in Canada, according to Gatik.</p>

<p>Steinberg said Loblaw began talks with Gatik for about a year before launching the service, which is expected to handle about 1,000 orders a day. The pilot program will operate for two years, after which Loblaw will determine whether it will expand the service.</p>

<p>"To move these orders autonomously helps us get them there faster, more frequently, and keep up with the increase in demand that we're seeing in the online grocery space generally," Steinberg said.</p>

<p>Oshoma Momoh, chief technical advisor at MaRS Discovery District, said that it should take another seven to 10 years for vehicles to operate fully autonomously and without the need for a safety pilot on Canadian roads. But until then, any driverless cars on the road will be able to collect valuable data on a variety of weather and traffic conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The way all of this works is that companies build up more common use cases or examples of how driving works in real life, and train their software to become more self-sufficient," Momoh said in a phone interview.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Editor's Note: A previous version of this story&nbsp;included incorrect information about when&nbsp;the service would begin. BNN Bloomberg regrets this error.&nbsp;</em></p>

<![CDATA[Guide to OOMKill Alerting in Kubernetes Clusters]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <span>Monday 23 Nov 2020, 18:30</span> <h2>Intro</h2> <p>RAM is most likely the scarcest resource that is first exhausted on your servers. If you’re serious about running software under Linux/Unix, you’re certainly aware of what an OOMKill is.</p> <p>Short refresher: when a program requests a new memory page from the kernel two things can happen.</p> <ul><li>There is a free memory page: The kernel page assigns the page to the process and everything is great.</li> <li>The system is Out Of Memory (OOM): The kernel chooses a process based on its ‘badness’ (mainly by how much ram it uses). It sends a SIGKILL to the process. This forces the receiving process to exit with exit code <code>137</code>. All the memory pages belonging to that process are free and now the kernel can fulfill the memory request.</li></ul> <p>Lately, I had a task to add alerting to a sizeable Kubernetes cluster. The cluster has ~100 active Deployments with autoscaling of nodes up to ~50 nodes at peak times. The cluster is well maintained and has a robust autoscaling strategy. All deployments have resource limits defined. Sometimes, some of the deployed pods would breach the memory limits. In those cases, it would be nice to find out when that happens and investigate the cause of it.</p> <p>Prometheus and Alertmanager were already deployed. So I’ve thought that alerting on OOMKills will be as easy. I just had to find the right metric(s) indicating that OOMKill has happened and write an alerting rule for it. Given the length of this post, you could imagine how wrong I was!</p> <h2>First Attempt</h2> <p>A brief Google search has led me to the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/blob/master/docs/pod-metrics.md" rel="nofollow">kube pod state metric</a>. It turns out it has a metric called <code>kube_pod_container_status_last_terminated_reason</code>. The value of the metric is <code>1</code> when a container in a pod has terminated with an error. Based on the exit code, the <code>reason</code> label will be set to <code>OOMKilled</code> if the exit code was <code>137</code>. That sounded promising! So I’ve created an alert for that.</p> <p>As usual, things are rarely straightforward. As soon as the container restarts, the value of this metric will be <code>1</code>. For alerting purposes, one has to combine it with another metric that will change when a pod restarts. <code>kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total</code> does that. Combine the two - and Bingo! It Worked!</p> <h2>“Invisible” OOMKills</h2> <p>For a brief moment, I’ve thought that I was done. I was about to declare victory over OOMKills in production! But then a puzzle came my way: One of our software developers has come forward. He claimed that one of his pods was running out of memory and he couldn’t see any alerts for it.</p> <p>At first, I wasn’t inclined to believe that his diagnosis of running out of memory was correct. Mainly because his Pod didn’t even restart! But then I looked at the graph of the memory use of the Pod. It did show the usual pattern: Memory usage would grow, reach its peak at the memory limit, and then suddenly drop.</p> <p>I’ve asked the developer for the gory details of the implementation. It turned out that the init process in the container would start a child process and wait for the result of it. If the child process would exit with an error, it would return an error to the requester and not terminate (because - why should it?).</p> <p>That is when it dawned to me - my alerting is effective only if container exits. This is usually the case when the init process of the container is OOMKilled. But there is no guarantee this will happen if a child of the init is OOMKilled. In the case where the container’s init tries to handle OOMKill by itself, my alerting is not triggering!</p> <h2>Trying the Existing Solutions</h2> <p>Given that OOMKills are as old as Unix, I thought: surely someone will have a solution for this already.</p> <p>I’ve ensued onto a frantic search for some kind of metric exporter for this. I just needed the number of OOMKill events in a pod, or at least in a Docker container. Here is what I’ve found:</p> <h3>cAdvisor</h3> <p>My first stop was cAdvisor itself. It turns out that cAdvisor is <a href="https://github.com/google/cadvisor/issues/1837" rel="nofollow">getting the OOMKill events, but not exporting them as a Prometheus metric and no one really seems to care.</a> So that was a dead-end.</p> <h3>kubernetes-oomkill-exporter</h3> <p>My second stop was <a href="https://github.com/sapcc/kubernetes-oomkill-exporter" rel="nofollow">kubernetes-oomkill-exporter</a>. A very promising-sounding project with two huge disadvantages:</p> <ul><li>There is really no documentation for it, literally anywhere.</li> <li>It does not work.</li></ul> <p>I’ve tried the latest version of <a href="https://hub.docker.com/layers/sapcc/kubernetes-oomkill-exporter/0.3.0/images/sha256-b80875b903635f0336ea0b122b332e086da51ec5cd797de5d682dd14c3910b9f?context=explore" rel="nofollow">the Docker image</a>, but once started it crashes and burns with:</p> <pre><code>standard_init_linux.go:211: exec user process caused "no such file or directory"</code></pre> <p>Going <a href="https://hub.docker.com/layers/sapcc/kubernetes-oomkill-exporter/0.2.0/images/sha256-5e1b57f4ac0b57406ef067da3e83f743d70ff89aa1db717d41af2c699dc12f3a?context=explore" rel="nofollow">back one minor version</a> one gets the following output:</p> <pre><code>F1120 22:04:21.571246       1 main.go:73] Could not create log watcher
I1120 22:04:21.572066       1 main.go:64] Starting prometheus metrics</code></pre> <p>As it seems no one has committed any code to in over a year. It has a low number of stars (14). All that meant that I was back to square one.</p> <h2>Rolling my Own: <code>missing-container-metrics</code></h2> <p>Having a hard time finding an existing solution meant only one thing: I will have to write my own.</p> <p>A cursory look at <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/events/" rel="nofollow">Docker’s events</a> delivered everything I needed. There is an event called <code>oom</code>. Docker emits this event every time the OOMKiller process gets active in the container. Now I was only missing a piece of code that will listen to those events and export them as Prometheus metrics.</p> <p>This is how <a href="https://github.com/draganm/missing-container-metrics" rel="nofollow">missing-container-metrics</a> was born. What it does is to connect to a local Docker instance (via <code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>). It lists all existing containers as a starting point. And then it listens to Docker events. Using those events, it keeps track of the currently running containers. It also gathers the basic stats of each container it knows about:</p> <ul><li>Number of restarts</li> <li>Last exit code</li> <li>Number of OOMKills</li></ul> <p>By design, it is not Kubernetes specific. This means it can be used with a plain Docker. But it also has a couple of very convenient Kubernetes specific features.</p> <p>Whenever it finds a container label for the pod name or namespace, it adds them as a label to the exported metrics. Also, label naming is compatible with <code>kube-state-metrics</code>.</p> <p>This keeps things simple for metric joins in PromQL.</p> <h2>Running it in the Cluster</h2> <p>In a Kubernetes cluster, <code>missing-container-metrics</code> needs to run on every node. The simplest way to achieve this is to use a daemon-set. The source code comes with an example <a href="https://github.com/draganm/missing-container-metrics#kubernetes" rel="nofollow">daemon set</a> deployment.</p> <h2>An Interesting Find Using <code>missing-container-metrics</code></h2> <p>The most interesting issue I’ve found was where I’ve least expected it: Fluentd!</p> <p>Fluentd log forwarder for node/pod/kubelet logs to the log aggregator. When the volume of logs was very high, Fluentd is OOMKilled.</p> <p>Looking at the details of how Fluentd works, it becomes clear what is going on.</p> <p>Fluentd has one main process (that ends up being init process in the container). This main process forks a worker process that forwards the logs. When the worker process dies for some reason (for example OOMKill), the main process starts a new one. This leads to an endless loop of spawn/OOMKill.</p> <p>The fact that Fluentd is the log forwarder is very unfortunate. OOMKill loop would stop the log forwarding, so you could not ‘see’ what is going on by inspecting the logs.</p> <h2>Epilogue</h2> <p>If you want to make sure that your Kubernetes cluster is healthy, it is essential to alert on OOMKills. This enables you to know when processes hit their memory limits. Be it because of memory leaks or wrongly configured memory limits.</p> <p>It turns out that monitoring for OOMKills in Kubernetes is not as an easy task as one might think. Using <a href="https://github.com/draganm/missing-container-metrics" rel="nofollow">missing-container-metrics</a> makes it much easier though.</p> <p>So go ahead, deploy <a href="https://github.com/draganm/missing-container-metrics" rel="nofollow">missing-container-metrics</a> to your cluster. You might be surprised how many of OOMKills you have not been noticing.</p> <p>I hope that it will be useful to you, and will save you the time that I’ve spent searching for the solution.</p></article></div>]]>

<p>Thermodynamics is really weird. Most people have probably encountered a bad explanation of the basics at some point in school, but probably don’t remember more than</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy is conserved</li>
<li>Entropy increases</li>
<li>There’s something called the ideal gas law/ideal gas equation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Energy conservation is not very mysterious. Apart from some weirdness around defining energy in general, it’s just a thing you can prove from whatever laws of motion you’re using.</p>
<p>But <em>entropy</em> is very weird. You’ve heard that it measures “disorder” in some vague sense.
Maybe you’ve heard that it’s connected to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy%5F(information%5Ftheory)">Shannon entropy</a> of a probability distribution \(H(p) = \sum_x - p(x)\ln p(x)\).
Probably the weirdest thing about it is the law it obeys: It’s not conserved, but rather it <em>increases</em> with time.
This is more or less the only law like that in physics.</p>
<p>It gets even weirder when you consider that at least classical Newtonian physics is <em>time-symmetric</em>.
Roughly speaking, this means if you have a movie of things interacting under the laws of Newton, and you play it backwards, they’re still obeying the laws of Newton. An orbiting moon just looks like it’s orbiting in the other direction, which is perfectly consistent. A stone which is falling towards earth and accelerating looks like it’s flying away from earth and decelerating - exactly as gravity is supposed to do.</p>
<p>But if there’s some “entropy” quality out there that only increases, then that’s obviously impossible! When you played the movie backwards, you’d be able to tell that entropy was decreasing, and if entropy always increases, some law is being violated.
So what, is entropy some artefact of quantum mechanics? No, as it turns out. Entropy is an artefact of the fact that you can’t measure all the particles in the universe at once. And the fact that it seems to always increase is a consequence of the fact that matter is stable at large scales.</p>
<p>The points in this post are largely from E.T. Jaynes' <a href="https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/macroscopic.prediction.pdf">Macroscopic Prediction</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-proof-that-entropy-doesn-t-always-increase">A proof that entropy doesn’t always increase</h2>
<p>Let \(X\) be the set of states of some physical system. Here I will assume that there is a finite number of states and time advances in discrete steps - there is some function \(T: X \to X\) which steps time forward one step. We assume that these dynamics are time-reversible in the weak sense that \(T\) is a bijection - every state is the future of exactly one “past” state.
Let \(S: X \to \mathbb{R}\) be some function. Assume \(S(x) \leq S(Tx)\) - in other words, \(S\) can never decrease.
Then \(S\) is constant, i.e \(S(x) = S(Tx)\).</p>
<p>Proof: Assume for contradiction \(S(x) &lt; S(Tx)\) for some \(x\). Since \(X\) is finite, let \(\sum_x S(x)\) be the sum of \(S\) over all states. Then clearly \(\sum_x S(x) = \sum_x S(Tx)\), since \(Tx\) just ranges over all the \(x\)s.
But on the other hand, we have \(S(x) \leq S(Tx)\) for all \(x\), and \(S(x) &lt; S(Tx)\) in at least one case. So we must have \(\sum_x S(x) &lt; \sum_x S(Tx)\) - contradiction.</p>
<p>This proof can be generalized to the continuous time and space case without too much trouble, for the types of dynamics that actually show up in physics (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville%27s%5Ftheorem%5F(Hamiltonian)">Liouville’s Theorem</a>). The proof above still requires a <em>bounded</em> phase volume (corresponding to the finiteness of \(X\)). To generalize to other situations we need some more assumptions - the easiest thing is to assume that the dynamics are time-reversible in a stronger sense, and that this is compatible with the entropy in some way.</p>
<p>(You can find easy counterexamples in general, e.g. if \(X=\mathbb{Z}\) and the dynamics are \(T(x) = x+1\), then obviously we really do have that \(S(x) =x\) is increasing. Nothing to do about that.)</p>
<p>Anyways the bounded/finite versions of the theorems do hold for a toy thermodynamic system like particles in a (finite) box - here the phase volume really is bounded.</p>
<h2 id="the-true-meaning-of-entropy">The true meaning of entropy</h2>
<p>Okay, so what the hell is going on? Did your high school physics textbook lie to you about this?
Well, yes. But you’re probably never going to observe entropy going down in your life, so you can maybe rest easy.</p>
<p>Let \(X\) be the physical system under consideration again. But suppose now that we can’t observe \(x \in X\), but only some “high-level description \(p(x) \in Y\). Maybe \(x\) is the total microscopic state of every particle in a cloud of gas - their position and momentum - while \(p(x)\) is just the average energy of the particles (roughly corresponding to the temperature).
\(x\) is called a <em>microstate</em> and \(y = p(x)\) is called a <em>macrostate</em>.
Then the <em>entropy</em> of \(y \in Y\) is \(S(y) = \ln (p^{-1}(\{y\})\) - the logarithm of the number of microstates \(x\) where \(p(x) = y\). We say these are the microstates that <em>realize</em> the macrostate \(y\).</p>
<p>The connection with Shannon entropy is now that this is exactly the Shannon entropy of the uniform distribution over \(p^{-1}(y)\). This is the distribution you should have over microstates if you know nothing except the microstate.
In other words, the entropy measures your uncertainty about the microstate given that you know nothing except the macrostate.</p>
<p>There are more sophisticated versions of this definition in general, to account for the fact that</p>
<ul>
<li>In general, your microstates are probably sets of real numbers, and there are probably infinitely many compatible with the macrostate, so we need a notion of “continuous entropy” (usually called differential entropy, I think)</li>
<li>Your measurement of the macrostate is probably not that certain (but this turns out to matter surprisingly little for thermodynamic systems),</li>
</ul>
<p>but this is the basic gist.</p>
<h2 id="why-entropy-usually-goes-up">Why entropy usually goes up</h2>
<p>Okay, so why does entropy go up?
<em>Because there are more high-entropy states than low-entropy states</em>. That’s what entropy <em>means</em>.
If you don’t know anything about what’s gonna happen to \(x\) (in reality, you usually understand the dynamics \(T\) themselves, but have absolutely no information about \(x\) except the macrostate), it’s more likely that it will transfer to a macrostate with a higher number of representatives than to one with a low number of representatives.</p>
<p>This also lets us defuse our paradox from above. In reality, entropy doesn’t go down for literally every microstate \(x\).
It’s not true that \(S(p(Tx)) &gt; S(p(x))\) for all \(x\) - I proved that impossible above.
What <em>can</em> be true is this: given a certain macrostate, it’s more probable that entropy increases than that it decreases.</p>
<p>We can consider an extreme example where we have two macrostates \(L\) and \(H\), corresponding to low and high entropy.
Clearly the number of low-entropy states that go to a high-entropy state is exactly the same as the number of high-entropy states that go to a low-entropy state. That’s combinatorics.
But the <em>fraction</em> of low-entropy states that go to high-entropy is then necessarily larger than the fraction of high-entropy states that go to low-entropy states.</p>
<p>In other words, \(P(H(x_{t+1})|L(x_t)) &gt; P(L(x_{t+1})|H(x_t))\)</p>
<h2 id="why-entropy--almost--always-goes-up">Why entropy (almost) always goes up</h2>
<p>Okay, but that’s a lot weaker than “entropy always increases”! How do we get from here to there?
I could say some handwavy stuff here about how the properties of thermodynamic systems mean that the differences in the number of representatives between high-entropy and low-entropy states are massive - and that means the right-hand probability above can’t possibly be non-neglible. And that in general this works out so that entropy is almost guaranteed to increase.</p>
<p>But that’s very unsatisfying. It just happened to work out that way? I have a much more satisfying answer: entropy almost always increases because matter is stable at large scales.</p>
<p>Wait, what? What does that mean?</p>
<p>By “matter is stable at large scales”, I mean that the macroscopic behaviour of matter is predictable only from macroscopic observations. When a bricklayer builds a house, they don’t first go over them with a microscope to make sure the microstate of the brick isn’t going to surprise us later. And as long as we know the temperature and pressure of a gas, we can pretty much predict what will happen if we compress it with a piston.</p>
<p>What this means is that, if \(p(x) = p(x')\), then <em>with extremely high probability</em>, \(p(Tx) = p(Tx')\). It might not be literally certain, but it’s sure enough.</p>
<p>Now, let’s say we’re in the macrostate \(y\). Then there is some macrostate \(y'\) which is <em>extremely likely</em> to be the next one. For very nearly all \(x\) so that \(p(x) = y\), we have \(p(Tx) = y'\).
But this means that \(y'\) must have at least that many microstates representing it, since \(T\) is a bijection.
So the entropy of \(y'\) can at most be a <em>tiny</em> bit smaller than the entropy of \(y\) - this difference would be as tiny as the fraction of \(x\) with \(p(Tx) \neq y'\), so we can ignore it.</p>
<p>So unless something super unlikely happens and \(p(Tx) \neq y'\), entropy goes up.</p>
<p>By the way, this also explains what goes wrong with time-reversibility, and why in reality, you can easily tell that a video is going backwards. The “highly probably dynamics” \(Y \to Y\), which takes each macrostate the the most probable next state, don’t have to be time-reversible. For instance, let’s return to the two-macrostate system above.
Suppose that with 100% certainty, low-entropy states become high-entropy.
Let there be \(N_L\) low-entropy states and \(N_H\) high-entropy states.
Then, just because \(T\) is a bijection, there must be \(N_L\) high-entropy states that become low-entropy.
Now if \(N_H \gg N_L\), then practically all high-entropy states go to other high-entropy states.
So \(L \mapsto H\) but \(H \mapsto H\).</p>
<p>Of course in reality, if you start with a low-entropy state and watch this unfold for a <em>really</em> long time, you’ll eventually see it become a low-entropy state again. It’s just extremely unlikely to happen in a short amount of time.</p>
<h2 id="entropy-is-not-exactly-your-uncertainty-about-the-microstate">Entropy is not exactly your uncertainty about the microstate</h2>
<p>The entropy of a given macrostate is the uncertainty …</p></main></div></div>

                    <h2 id="ux-behavioral-economics">UX &amp; Behavioral Economics</h2><p>No matter how mature your digital platform is, there's always space for improvement. We've talked plenty about UX on this blog, understanding it as designing based on your users' insights. However, it's important to <strong>complement UX with behavioral science.</strong> This is a series of insights about human behavior that are <strong>true of all users.</strong> In the following blog posts, I'll reveal some behavioral insights that might help boost your conversions... <strong>Let's start with the first one: scarcity.</strong></p><h2 id="scarcity-motivates-conversions">Scarcity Motivates Conversions</h2><figure><img src="https://lightit.io/blog/content/images/2020/11/image.png" alt="Scarcity example booking"></figure><p>Have you ever booked a hotel on Booking? If you did, it would probably be easy for you to understand the scarcity heuristic.</p><p>Scarcity is<strong> </strong>the event where a product/service is perceived as more attractive because it's presented as limited in availability. Limitation gives people a sense of quality, exclusivity and even gives them the famous FOMO (fear of missing out) on a great product or discount. <strong>The scarcity heuristic can be used to pressure people into taking action</strong></p><p>Booking's example is pretty straightforward. While you're making your reservation, Booking tells you <strong>how many rooms are still available</strong> and even the <strong>number of people that are looking at the hotel simultaneously</strong> as you (and might steal the room you wish!) This last one isn't only a scarcity strategy, but also a social norm we'll look into in the next blog post. This information pressures people into reserving quickly before the other people book the last room.</p><p>I'm not saying Booking's strategy is effective (personally, I believe it's a little exaggerated to the point it looks fake). Still, it's a clear example of using scarcity to <strong>rush customers to make their decision</strong>. </p><p>Another famous example is from a grocery store in Iowa that did an exciting experiment with the discount they offered for Campbell's soups. They always provided the same discount, though some days, they hanged a sign next to the cans that read "Limit 12 Per Person", while other days they didn't have a limit. Take a look at these impressive results.<strong> Customers bought 7 cans on average when the limit was imposed, compared to an average of 3 cans on days with no limit.</strong></p><h3 id="so-how-can-i-take-this-to-my-digital-platform"><br>So... how can I take this to my digital platform?</h3><p>There are several strategies you might try; the key is on<strong> trying different alternatives and tracking down the metrics</strong> so that you figure out which one works. <strong>Remember not to over-do it</strong>; no one trusts sites with discounts and deals that last forever. The typical "subscribe now and get 20% off on your first order" isn't that attractive if it has no time limit. Though, if it has, it might motivate people to make up their minds faster. Benefits must be perceived "here and now" to be more valuable.</p><figure><img src="https://lightit.io/blog/content/images/2020/11/image-4.png" alt="Amazon scarcity example"></figure><p>Bear in mind these strategies aren't only useful for e-commerces, they can be used for other business models too. For example on social networks or communities, creating <strong>waiting lists, deadlines, asking for qualifications to join or limiting invites </strong>can really boost interest by giving a sense of &nbsp;<strong>exclusivity</strong> and FOMO. It's no news that exclusive things are more attractive... but have you ever wondered what came first? Attractiveness or exclusivity?</p><hr><p><strong>Stay tuned for the next post of this collection, </strong>Insights on Behavioral Economics to Improve Your Platform's Results. <strong>Part 2: Social Norms. </strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Subscribe to our newsletter &amp; follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/lightit//" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>.</p>

                    <p>For the last 60 years, we’ve seen consistently low productivity growth rates in the US and across the Western world. Meanwhile, recent scientific discoveries seem to be <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">less fundamental</a> to our understanding of the world than previous breakthroughs have been. While the growth of digital technology has been tremendous since the 1990s, it’s the only significant part of our world that seems to have been changing. To look up from our smartphones is to see a physical environment that looks basically the same as it did in 1970. Innovation has been constrained to the world of bits and left the world of atoms mostly untouched.</p><p>This might finally be changing. Last month, the economist Tyler Cowen <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-05/how-much-worse-can-things-get-that-question-may-be-a-good-sign">speculated</a> that we may be seeing signs that this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-eSpecial-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS">Great Stagnation</a> is ending. Since his article was published, we’ve already seen almost a dozen announcements that have only driven home the point further. There seem to be cracks in the Great Stagnation and light is peaking through on the other end. </p><p><strong>Innovation in the physical world</strong><br>Most obviously, the recent announcement of the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/09/covid-19-vaccine-from-pfizer-and-biontech-is-strongly-effective-early-data-from-large-trial-indicate/">successful development of several vaccines</a> to the novel coronavirus are a sign that America (with some help from Germany) is still capable of achieving Big Things when we are pushed to it. Despite consistent failings of the US regulatory state in <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/14/a-failure-but-not-of-prediction/">delaying the adoption</a> of face masks and in <a href="https://thedispatch.com/p/timeline-the-regulationsand-regulatorsthat">slowing the rollout</a> of mass testing, the US essentially bet the farm that our strong biotech clusters would be able to create a vaccine to a new disease in record time, and it looks like we’re going to be able to do it in under a year! </p><p>It’s worth highlighting just how speedy this development timeline is when compared to the vaccines for diseases like polio and measles. </p><figure><img src="https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 600w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 1000w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 1600w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination</figcaption></figure><p>And not only did we develop a new vaccine, we developed a new *type* of vaccine. mRNA vaccines have long been speculated to work, but this is the <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/11/20/pfizer-and-moderna-vaccines-showing-potential-success-of-mrna-platform-a-first/">first instance</a> of a successful vaccine application in humans using this technique. </p><p>In transportation, the promise of driverless cars has long been a centerpiece for a tech-optimistic vision of safer roads, better-designed cities, and eliminating the drudgery of a morning commute through traffic. But the technical delays of the last few years (when compared to the most optimistic timelines) have become a rallying cry for the <a href="https://blog.piekniewski.info/2018/05/28/ai-winter-is-well-on-its-way/">tech-skeptic</a> as well. </p><p>It seems like they may finally be getting here. A few weeks ago, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/10/waymo-finally-launches-an-actual-public-driverless-taxi-service/">Waymo announced</a> that their long-running pilot program in Arizona is going to be open to the public <a href="https://twitter.com/jjricks_/status/1316318196375330816">without any safety driver</a> in the front seat. Days later, Elon Musk and Tesla rolled out a new self-driving beta program. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These two guys used a drone to make a video of Tesla's new "full self-driving" software in action.

</figure><p>This is a remarkable engineering feat, especially on Waymo’s end. It shows the company can successfully lead product development in an industry that relies on more stringent safety-critical engineering instead of the release-and-iterate model that its parent company grew up with. Waymo is evidence that Silicon Valley can “move at a moderate pace and not break things” when it needs to.</p><p>Granted, it’s unclear how long until and at what pace deployment of AVs to the rest of the country and the world will happen. If the Waymo model looks to be successful, it will be a steady, resource-intensive process of region-by-region expansion as the cars learn to handle new operational design domains and are rigorously validated in each city before the keys are turned over to the AI. In other words, expansion could look more like a cell phone coverage map than a software update that is instantaneously available everywhere. </p><p>But still, this is a significant, tangible mile marker that the industry has passed. AVs are operating in the wild now. We get to talk about *when* we reach the driverless future, not *if*. </p><p>In addition to the almost ho-hum daily progress in solar, wind, and battery technology where prices have fallen <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-pv-has-become-cheaper-and-better-in-the-2010s-now-what">90</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2020/01/21/renewable-energy-prices-hit-record-lows-how-can-utilities-benefit-from-unstoppable-solar-and-wind/?sh=491f10ec2c84">70</a>, and <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-pack-prices-fall-as-market-ramps-up-with-market-average-at-156-kwh-in-2019">87</a> percent over the last ten years, we’ve also started to hear very promising reports about the development of more fundamental breakthroughs. The NYT reports that a compact nuclear fusion reactor is “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/climate/nuclear-fusion-reactor.html?action=click&amp;module=News&amp;pgtype=Homepage">Very Likely to Work</a>” after a major theoretical advancement. There was also a fantastic David Robert’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical">deep dive into geothermal energy</a> and the promise of advanced geothermal (whereby water pumped into the ground through a closed loop reaches a high enough temperature that it becomes “supercritical” and can carry 10x more energy per unit mass), in particular. Either technology, if perfected, would provide abundant, zero-carbon, baseload energy that is available anywhere around the world. </p><p>Cowen mentions briefly the huge market growth we’ve seen in lab-grown meat and plant-based alternatives. A few weeks ago it was announced that Impossible Foods, one of the largest actors in the industry is <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/10/20/impossible-foods-will-double-rd-to-eliminate-animal-farming/">doubling their R&amp;D team</a> as they seek to take on plant-based milk, steak, and fish as well as improve the supply chains for plant proteins. In tandem, McDonald’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2020/11/10/mcdonalds-mcplant-sandwich/">just announced</a> that in 2021 they are going to be testing out a new McPlant menu.</p><p><strong>Digital innovation continues apace</strong></p><p>Not to be left out, in the digital world we’ve been seeing impressive progress as well. AI techniques like deepfakes which have been heralded as the <a href="https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/opinion/deepfakes-destroy-democracy">death knell for democracy</a> are now being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/nvidia-used-neural-networks-to-improve-video-calling-bandwidth-by-10x/">deployed by NVIDIA</a> to increase video fidelity while cutting bandwidth transmission for video calls by a factor of 10. In general, techniques to reduce bandwidth use are greatly underrated, and it’s going to be exciting to see the ways in which smarter compression can perhaps bring similar efficiency gains across the board. </p><p>And now factor in the steady rollout of 5G network technologies which promise to increase the raw bandwidth available to all mobile devices. With the combination of smarter compression and vastly increased bandwidth we could be looking at a baseline 50x increase in network capacity over the next decade. It’s hard to predict ahead of time what new applications will be enabled by all this new capacity, but in retrospect it could look like another example of <a href="https://diff.substack.com/p/how-bubbles-and-megaprojects-parallelize">parallel innovation</a> that both enables and is driven by the growth of VR/AR, driverless vehicles, and telehealth.*</p><p><em>*For those who are skeptical that increased capacity will generate new applications because a few cities have tried gigabit broadband<a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/faster-internet-not-worth-it/"> without much effect</a>, I would argue that both hardware and app developers are optimizing for the baseline user experience and we won’t see a ton of investment in new applications until we’ve changed the baseline capacity that developers can expect a sizeable user base to have. </em></p><p>Equally as impressive, Apple’s new M1 chip that was launched on November 10th seems to have taken the world by storm. As John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_m1_macs">summarizes</a>: “To acknowledge how good they are — and I am here to tell you they are astonishingly good — you must acknowledge that certain longstanding assumptions about how computers should be designed, about what makes a better computer better, about what good computers need, are wrong.” Just as interesting is <a href="https://medium.com/pcmag-access/what-is-the-apple-m1-chip-613935ea0903">how they did it</a>. By miniaturizing the whole system architecture and integrating it onto a single chip (no discrete RAM, graphics card, etc.) Apple has managed to pump out massive efficiency gains both in processing power and in battery life. (There’s perhaps a metaphor here for the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/breaking-up-big-tech-is-hard-to-do-1532290123">value of integration</a> for large tech firms as well…)</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tXP4ZnW93TIsJ_dJe3NVmevfz5eMUnNC6CS40Dz_S0568BDiQKr8K8LqT5Ja-kLnXUKnS1UkDQf_6WYzBhfGa4c99lQDfqudhQaDF-XCYBEkxNoP3Vo3FlGtLl3sGFQcdtHBlGbv" alt=""><figcaption>https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the virtual reality space has seen its most impressive entrant in years with the arrival of the Quest 2 from Facebook on October 13th. There is no VR headset that matches it on a performance/cost basis, and the relative simplicity and elegance of the system makes it an ideal entry point. The deliberately low entry barrier of $299 is meant to entice a large enough user base that it kickstarts the virtuous cycle of having a significant enough market for dedicated VR developers to make significant investments in new applications, which then drives new user growth. Facebook believes we finally have a minimum viable product for VR that means this kind of two-sided market is possible, and it is betting billions of dollars to make it happen. Early signs seem to show that it is working as intended with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541535/oculus-quest-2-preorders-sales-developers-zuckerberg">pre-orders reportedly 5x</a> larger than the original Quest, popular applications like Beat Saber seeing record growth, and all this with the upcoming holiday rush and a massive advertising blitz to come. </p><p>Notably, all of these announcements/developments I’ve outlined have occurred in just the last few months. This is by no means a comprehensive look at the exciting progress being made in many other fields. But the sheer scope and pace of tangible changes to our physical and digital words is something to be excited about.</p><p><strong>A few caveats </strong></p><p>Some of these innovations will boost productivity in the traditional ways that show up in economic growth statistics. We should strive for and celebrate those achievements. But some of these innovations won’t necessarily, instead they make human civilization more durable and sustainable in a variety of ways. In response, we should start to think of increased sustainability as a type of productivity. </p><p>A vaccine to the COVID pandemic is the most obvious example. While economic statistics won’t show a boost in productivity compared to the pre-COVID economy because of the vaccine, the ability to return to trend is itself incredibly valuable. In fact, measured labor productivity from the vaccine will likely fall as lower-wage …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<article>
    <p>You know the feeling of watching your post quickly drowning in the Newest section of Hacker News, right?
It seems like pure, chaotic luck. Or is it?</p>
<p>I tried to crack the code of successful submissions.</p>
<p>I built a tool that parses Hacker News every two minutes and logs the state into the
database. The program has been working for <strong>14 days</strong> so far.</p>
<p>For the latest two weeks, there were <strong>13846</strong> stories, and only <strong>1403</strong> of them reached the first
page of Hacker News.</p>
<p>It’s <strong>10.1329</strong> percents. It doesn’t sound too bad, does it? It turns out <strong>every tenth story
hits the first page</strong>.</p>
<p><em>All time values are in UTC.</em></p>
<h2 id="stories-and-chances-to-hit-the-first-page">Stories and chances to hit the first page</h2>

<p>It seems like Saturday and Sunday are the least active days when it comes to new stories.
But it means you have the biggest chance to hit the first page during these days.</p>
<h2 id="total-number-of-stories-and-chances-by-hour">Total number of stories and chances by hour</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look what about best hours to publish then.</p>

<ul>
<li>I wouldn’t post at 15:00 - 16:00 since it’s the lowest chance to hit the first page. Too many
submissions during these hours.</li>
<li>11:00 - 12:00 looks like a good spot, everyone is getting awake and your post is already waiting
them on the first page.</li>
</ul>

November 23, 2020 | https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/2020/11/install-the-xfce-desktop-on-your-raspberry-pi/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/2020/11/install-the-xfce-desktop-on-your-raspberry-pi/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In this article you’ll learn how to install the XFCE desktop on your Raspberry PI. We’ll take a minimal install of the Raspberry PI operating system as a starting point. The XFCE installation on your Raspberry PI includes setting up all necessary building blocks, such as: display server, display manager, session manager, window manager and desktop environment.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>When you install the default Raspberry PI operating system, it presents you with the PIXEL desktop. The Raspberry PI foundation developed and maintains the PIXEL desktop. It offers a user-friendly desktop, with all basic features and applications included. For example: an application menu, a file manager, a text editor, etc. PIXEL is lightweight, meaning that it doesn’t consume a lot of RAM and CPU resources. This makes it run smoothly, even on a Raspberry PI Zero with only 512 MB of RAM.</p>
<p>So why would you want to switch to another desktop, such as XFCE? I can think of a few reasons:</p>
<ul><li>As a Linux desktop user, you probably did your fair share of desktop environment hopping. You might have settled on the XFCE desktop. Consequently, you prefer to run the XFCE desktop also on your Raspberry PI.</li><li>Your Raspberry PI serves as a Linux learning platform. You would like to find out what it takes to install a desktop environment from scratch.</li></ul>
<h3>The new Raspberry PI 400</h3>
<p>Over the years the Raspberry PI has gotten ever more powerful. It’s no longer just an embedded Linux board. Especially the Raspberry PI 4 packs enough CPU power and RAM for usage as you daily desktop computer. The Raspberry PI foundation thinks so too. Just look at the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/">Raspberry PI 400</a> model they recently released. They market it as a “complete personal computer, built into a compact keyboard”:</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="900" height="365" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/raspi400.png" alt="Image of the Raspberry PI 400. It's a Raspberry PI 4 build into a keyboard. Marketed as a complete personal computer, built into a compact keyboard." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/raspi400.png 900w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/raspi400-300x122.png 300w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/raspi400-768x311.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>
<p>You no longer need to restrict yourself to the PIXEL desktop. The Raspberry PI 4 comes a quad-core 64-bit CPU and 2, 4 or 8 GB RAM. More than sufficient to run a ‘real’ Linux desktop such as XFCE, KDE or Gnome.</p>
<h3>Why the XFCE desktop</h3>
<p>So why did I select the XFCE desktop for this article? In my opinion the XFCE desktop sits nicely between the PIXEL desktop and the more resource intensive desktops such as Gnome and KDE. It offers a full desktop experience, while still being lightweight and with snappy responsiveness. The XFCE desktop is stable, well maintained and available in all major Linux distributions. It’s the desktop environment I personally select, when installing a Linux desktop on older hardware or in a virtual machine.</p>
<h2>What do you need</h2>
<p>To complete the steps in this article and install the XFCE desktop on your Raspberry PI, you need the following:</p>
<ul><li>Any Raspberry PI 4 board, including the new Raspberry PI 400.</li><li>A power supply for the Raspberry PI board.</li><li>A micro-SD card of 8 GB or more in size.</li><li>A USB mouse</li><li>A USB keyboard (not needed for the Raspberry PI 400).</li><li>A computer monitor or TV.</li><li>A cable for connecting the HDMI output to your monitor or TV.</li></ul>
<p>Throughout this article, I assume you already installed the Raspberry PI operating system. I recommend the <em>Lite</em> edition. The <em>Lite</em> edition of the Raspberry PI operating system does not include a graphical desktop environment. That way you start with a clean slate.</p>
<p>I’ll be using my Raspberry PI 4 with 4 GB RAM to install the XFCE desktop. I already installed the <em>Lite</em> edition of the Raspberry PI operating system on it. Furthermore, I added a new user account for user <code>pragmalin</code> and removed the default <code>pi</code> user account, for security purposes. Although not necessary, I recommend that you start with the same foundation. Refer to the previously published tutorial on how to <a href="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/2020/11/perform-a-minimal-install-on-your-raspberry-pi/">perform a minimal install on your Raspberry PI</a> for step-by-step instructions.</p>
<h2>Graphical desktop components</h2>
<p>Before diving right into the installation of XFCE on your Raspberry PI, I would like to present a brief overview of all the components that go into a Linux graphical desktop. This theoretical background information is optional. Feel free to skip to the next section to continue with the hands-on XFCE installation part on your Raspberry PI.</p>
<p>Refer to the following illustration for an overview of all components:</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="410" height="269" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/component_layers.png" alt="Illustration showing all the components that go into a graphical desktop on Linux. To install the XFCE desktop on a Raspberry PI we need these components: Xorg, lightdm, xfce4-session, xfwm4 and xfce4." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/component_layers.png 410w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/component_layers-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px"></figure>
<p>Note the added text after the arrow in the illustration. These are the specific components we’ll install for our XFCE desktop. For a Linux graphical desktop, the specific components can differ. For example, a Gnome desktop environment typically uses the <em>gdm</em> display manager instead of <em>lightdm</em>.</p>
<h3>Display server</h3>
<p>In order to do anything graphically, as opposed to just the basic command line, you need a display server. It provides the foundation needed by all the other components. It handles outputting pixels on the display and detecting input events from the mouse and keyboard.</p>
<h3>Display manager</h3>
<p>Think of the display manager as the login screen. It is the first thing that gets started if the operating system supports a graphical desktop. On this screen you enter your username and password to login. Furthermore, it offers you a choice of the desktop session to start.</p>
<h3>Session manager</h3>
<p>After logging in, the display manager hands control over to the session manager. Simply put, the session manager manages the state of the desktop of the logged in user(s). So which applications are running and what their window state and position is. Furthermore, the session manager makes it possible to save your desktop when you logout. Upon the next login it can automatically restore your desktop for you.</p>
<h3>Window manager</h3>
<p>The window manager controls the placement, movement and look of all windows and their controls (button, check box, etc). Its the one that draws the border around each window and adds the title bar. Additionally, the window manager enables you to tile, stack and move windows around.</p>
<h3>Desktop environment</h3>
<p>To have a fully functional graphical desktop you still need a bit more. For example an application menu, a task-bar panel showing running applications and notification icons. And then your basic suite of applications such as a file manager, terminal program, text editor, etc. The desktop environment combines all these parts. Its goal is to provide you with a cohesive and productive graphical user experience.</p>
<h2>Install the XFCE desktop components</h2>
<p>At this point you have a good understanding of what components you need, to install the XFCE desktop on your Raspberry PI. Time to get our hands dirty. We’ll install all the XFCE desktop components in one go on your Raspberry PI. This includes:</p>
<ul><li><em>Xorg</em> display server</li><li><em>lightdm</em> display manager</li><li><em>xfce4-session</em> session manager</li><li><em>xfwm4</em> window manager</li><li><em>xfce4</em> desktop environment</li></ul>
<p>Power up your Raspberry PI and login with your username and password at the console. Next, run the following command to install the XFCE desktop components on your Raspberry PI:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt install -y xserver-xorg xfce4 xfce4-goodies</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="769" height="569" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apt_xfce_install.png" alt="Terminal screenshot of installing the XFCE desktop related packages on the Raspberry PI. The following command is used: sudo apt install -y xserver-xorg xfce4 xfce4-goodies." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apt_xfce_install.png 769w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apt_xfce_install-300x222.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px"></figure>
<p>As you can see in the last line of the screenshot, all XFCE desktop components consume about 1 GB of disk space. With all the XFCE desktop components installed on your Raspberry PI, we continue with setting them up.</p>
<h2>Setup the XFCE desktop components</h2>
<p>In the previous section, we installed all XFCE desktop components on your Raspberry PI. As a next step we make sure the right desktop components are selected. If you started with a minimal install of the Raspberry PI operating system, this will most likely be the case already. However, if you previously installed a different desktop environment, we need to double-check this selection, to make sure it works for an XFCE desktop.</p>
<h3>Select the display server</h3>
<p>You probably only have one display server installed (<em>Xorg</em>), so you do not have to explicitly select one. However, it could be that you didn’t have a display sever installed before. In this case we need to verify that the display server gets started during boot.</p>
<p>Systemd should handle this for us. Without the presence of a display server, Systemd’s default boot target is the multi user shell. Also called <code>multi-user.target</code>. When installing a display server, Systemd’s default boot target should change to a graphical multi user shell. This one is called <code>graphical.target</code>.</p>
<p>To determine Systemd’s default boot target, run this command:</p>
<p><code>sudo systemctl get-default</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="713" height="33" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/systemd_get_default.png" alt="Terminal screenshot that shows the output of running the &quot;sudo systemctl get-default&quot; command. It should output &quot;&quot;graphical.target&quot;." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/systemd_get_default.png 713w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/systemd_get_default-300x14.png 300w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/systemd_get_default-700x33.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px"></figure>
<p>It should output <code>graphical.target</code>. If it doesn’t, then you can set it manually by running the command:</p>
<p><code>sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target</code>.</p>
<h3>Select the display manager</h3>
<p>The following component to select is the display manager. We want to select <em>lightdm</em> as the display manager. Easily achieved by running the following command:</p>
<p><code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="416" height="23" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_display_manager.png" alt="Terminal screenshot that shows what command to run for selecting the lightdm display manager." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_display_manager.png 416w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_display_manager-300x17.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px"></figure>
<h3>Select the session manager</h3>
<p>Next we’ll go ahead and select the session manager. Type this command in the terminal:</p>
<p><code>sudo update-alternatives --config x-session-manager</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="764" height="153" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_session_manager.png" alt="Terminal screenshot that shows how to select the session manager, with the help of the update-alternatives command. Make sure to select startxfce4 here and not xfce4-session." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_session_manager.png 764w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_session_manager-300x60.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px"></figure>
<p>On this screen we need to make sure <em>startxfce4</em> is selected as the session manager. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> if startxfce4 is already selected, otherwise enter the number of the <em>startxfce4</em> session.</p>
<p>A bit odd, right? In an earlier section I mentioned that we want the <em>xfce4-session</em> session manager. The selection menu lists <em>xfce4-session</em>, so why not pick it? The <em>startxfce4</em> file consists of a script that initializes the XFCE session and under the hood calls the <em>xfce4-session</em> executable for us. This makes <em>startxfce4</em> the better option here.</p>
<h3>Select the window manager</h3>
<p>Continue with the selection of the window manager. Run the following command:</p>
<p><code>sudo update-alternatives --config x-window-manager</code></p>

<p>On my Raspberry PI, <em>xfwm4</em> is the only available window manager. Therefore no additional configuration is needed.</p>
<h3>Select the desktop environment</h3>
<p>You select the desktop environment on the login screen. So now would be the right time to reboot our Raspberry PI and wait for the login screen to show up. On the top right corner of the screen, there is a little icon you can click. Select <em>Xfce Session</em> from the drop-down menu:</p>

<h2>Configure the XFCE desktop</h2>
<p>At this point we completed installing and selecting the right components for the XFCE desktop on our Raspberry PI. In this section we’ll make some final configurations for our XFCE desktop. If you …</p></div></div>

	<p>Back in spring 2019, I was a student working as an intern at the Intel Open
Source Graphics Center in Finland. I was mainly focused on improving
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/igt-gpu-tools/">igt-gpu-tools</a>, the test suite that runs each time a patch is submitted for
the i915 kernel driver. I really liked the work I was doing there, and enjoyed
interacting with all of the people on site. While I was there, I had an
opportunity to say “no” to an assigned task that I considered unethical.</p>
<p>Naturally, lots of Intel kernel developers were working on fixing bugs and
implementing new features. When a developer wants to add a new feature to their
kernel driver, they also need to provide a patch for a user-space program to
exercise the feature in a real-world scenario and prove that the new user-space
API is sensible<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. For instance, when adding HDR support to i915, the kernel
developers worked with the Kodi team.</p>
<p>At that time, I had just been nominated as release manager for the Wayland and
Weston projects. Additionally, some Intel engineers were working on upstreaming
Weston patches to add a new feature to their driver. In fact, the kernel
patches were ready to be merged and only blocked by the user-space
requirements. Some deadlines were set too, so it was important to get the
patches merged in a timely manner. My manager asked me to help with the
upstreaming process. That was a pretty good idea – because my experience could
help Intel developers to learn how to contribute to Weston, and because I like
mentoring people. So what was the catch?</p>
<p>It turned out the feature being developed was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-bandwidth_Digital_Content_Protection">HDCP</a>. It’s a form of <abbr title="Digital Restrictions Management">DRM</abbr> that encrypts the video
stream between the GPU and the screen. I’m personally not okay with DRM in
general, and I find DRM to be unethical. I’m not going to start to argue why I
feel this way, because it doesn’t really matter in the context of this article.
Feel free to replace DRM with whatever you find unethical.</p>
<p>So, I started participating in meetings and discussing how to get the
HDCP patches merged. I wasn’t very comfortable with the whole situation, and
tried to stay away from it when possible. I considered saying “no”, but I was
scared. I was only working at Intel for a few weeks, I was still a student, I
didn’t know my teammates and managers too well, and I was interested in
eventually getting a job offer. I just continued as if nothing was wrong.</p>
<p>At some point, after asking advice and discussing with some friends, I realized
that I ought to speak up. If I didn’t say “no” this time, it would get a lot
more difficult to say “no” the next time. So I ignored the anxiety and clumsily
explained to my manager that I’d like to stop working on HDCP.</p>
<p>To my surprise, my manager just said that it was fine, that there was no
problem. After this event, absolutely nothing else changed, and at some point I
even got an employment offer. When I recall it now, I can only tell myself that
it was a lot of fuss for nothing. In hindsight, I should’ve been less scared
and said no earlier, but in these situations it’s easy to imagine nightmare
scenarios in your head!</p>

<p>Few years ago I did some <a href="https://hforsten.com/homemade-synthetic-aperture-radar.html">simple synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) imaging
experiments</a> with the second version of my homemade
FMCW radar. Since then I made a much improved <a href="https://hforsten.com/third-version-of-homemade-6-ghz-fmcw-radar.html">third version of the
radar</a> but didn't do any SAR measurements due to the
amount of effort it would have required. I did have plans to do some SAR
experiments afterwards but it took until now to have enough time and
motivation.</p>
<p>Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging is a way to synthesize very large antenna
array by moving single antenna on a known path. If there are no moving targets
in the scene then one radar taking many measurements along a path gives the same
result as one ridiculously large radar that is as long as the movement path.</p>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/fmcw3-sar/sar_imaging.png" width="40%/"></p><p>SAR imaging of a single target. As the radar
    moves the measured distance follows a parabola.</p>
</div>

<p>If we move on a straight path while radar pointing 90 degrees from the direction
of the path measures a distance to the single target, we will find that the
measured distance follows a parabola. This follows directly from the Pythagorean
theorem. The SAR imaging problem is finding out the target position from the
measured distance data. Of course in a real scene we have multiple targets and
the solution isn't as simple as looking where the closest approach is as could
be done in the picture above.</p>

<p>There are few different algorithms for solving this problem, but the one I'm
going to use is called Omega-k algorithm. It is a fast imaging algorithm
utilizing FFT which also makes it efficient to calculate on GPU. The derivation
mostly follows <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7878107">a paper by Guo and
Dong</a>.</p>
<p>The radar I have is a frequency modulated constant wave (FMCW) radar. It
transmits a short frequency sweep. The transmitted waveform can be modeled as: </p>
<p>$$ s_t(\tau) = \exp(j 2 \pi f_c \tau + \pi \gamma \tau^2),\quad -T_s/2 &lt; \tau &lt; T_s/2 $$</p>
<p>, where <span>\(j&nbsp;= \sqrt{-1}\)</span>, <span>\(f_c =\)</span> RF carrier frequency, <span>\(\tau =\)</span> time variable,
<span>\(\gamma = B/T_s =\)</span> sweep bandwidth / sweep length <span>\(=\)</span> sweep rate.</p>
<p>The transmitted wave reflects off a target at some distance and is received after
time <span>\(t_d\)</span>. Ignoring the amplitude, the received wave is a time-delayed copy
of the transmitted signal: <span>\(s_r(\tau) = s_t(\tau - t_d)\)</span>. Signals from multiple
targets are summed.</p>
<p>The receiver mixes the received signal with the transmitted signal. This mixing
is called dechirping and it removes the high frequency RF component. The result
is a low frequency signal, usually some few kHz to MHz and is easy to digitize
with low-cost ADC. With the complex signals we take complex conjugate of the
transmitted signal to get the low-pass product and the resulting mixing product is:</p>
<p>$$ s_{\text{IF}}(\tau) = s_t(\tau - t_d) s_t^*(\tau) = \exp(-j 2 \pi f_c t_d
- j 2 \pi \gamma t_d \tau + j \pi \gamma \tau^2) $$</p>
<p>During SAR measurement the radar repeats this measurement while moving on
a straight path with a constant speed. The position of the radar on the path is:
<span>\(x = v \tau + x_n\)</span>, where <span>\(v\)</span> is speed of the radar platform and <span>\(x_n
= v n T_p\)</span>. <span>\(n\)</span> is the index for measurements and <span>\(T_p\)</span> is the transmit
repetition interval.</p>
<p>If the radar target is at position <span>\((x_0, y_0)\)</span> the distance to the target can
be written as:</p>
<p>$$ R(x) = \sqrt{y_0^2 + (x_0 - x)^2}&nbsp;$$</p>
<p>We set the y-coordinate of the path to be 0 and x position is limited to <span>\(-L/2
&lt; x &lt; L/2\)</span>, where <span>\(L\)</span> is length of the path.</p>
<p>Since electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light and radar signal needs
to travel to the target and back to the radar, we get expression
for received signal time delay <span>\(t_d = 2R(x)/c\)</span>, where <span>\(c\)</span> is the speed of light.</p>
<p>The recorded signal can be written as:</p>
<p>$$ s_{\text{IF}}(\tau, x) = \exp\left(-j \frac{4 \pi}{c} (f_c + \gamma \tau) R(x)\right)
\exp\left(j \frac{4 \pi \gamma^2}{c^2} R^2(x)\right) $$</p>
<p>The last term in the above expression is called residual video phase term and
it's an undesirable by-product from dechirping operation. It should be removed
before further processing by multiplying by <span>\(\exp(-j \frac{4 \pi \gamma^2}{c^2}
R^2(x))\)</span>.  However this form is inconvenient because it depends on <span>\(R(x)\)</span>. Using
the fact that <span>\(R(x) = c t_d / 2\)</span> and that <span>\(t_d\)</span> can be expressed in terms of
frequency of the IF signal: <span>\(f = -2 \gamma R(x) / c = -\gamma t_d \Rightarrow
t_d = -\frac{f}{\gamma}\)</span> we can write the correction term as <span>\(\exp(-j \pi f^2
/ \gamma)\)</span>. This form can be applied easily to the Fourier transformed signal.</p>
<p>With RVP term removed the signal is:</p>
<p>$$ s(\tau, x_n) = \exp\left(-j \frac{4 \pi}{c} (f_c + \gamma \tau) \sqrt{y_0^2 + (x_n - x_0 + v \tau)^2}\right) $$</p>
<p>Ideally we would like to have the signal in form <span>\(\exp(-j 2 \pi f_y y_0)\exp(-j
2\pi f_x x_0)\)</span>, then we could apply two dimensional inverse Fourier transform to
get a delta function centered at <span>\((x_0, y_0)\)</span> focusing the image. Currently the
signal <span>\(s(\tau, x_n)\)</span> is not in this form and inverse Fourier transform doesn't
give anything interesting. We need to find some processing steps to apply to the
signal to get it to the required form so that inverse Fourier transform can be
applied. The reason to look specifically for this kind of form is that FFT can
be performed very efficiently.</p>
<p>As a first step, note that <span>\(\gamma\)</span> has units of Hz/s and <span>\(\tau\)</span> has units of s.
The product <span>\(\gamma \tau\)</span> has units of Hz so it's a frequency. This product is actually
instantenous modulation frequency of the sweep. We do substitution <span>\(\gamma
\tau \rightarrow f_\tau\)</span> to get rid of the time variable. <span>\(\tau\)</span> range was <span>\(-T/2
\ldots T/2\)</span> and the new range for <span>\(f_\tau\)</span> is <span>\(-B/2 \ldots B/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>$$ S(f_\tau, x_n) = \exp\left(-j \frac{4 \pi}{c} (f_c + f_\tau) \sqrt{y_0^2 + (x_n - x_0 + \frac{v f_\tau}{\gamma} )^2}\right) $$</p>
<p>Also instead of using frequency the math is cleaner and the implementation of
the algorithm is easier when using wavenumbers instead. We define range
wavenumber <span>\(K_r = K_{rc} + \Delta K_r\)</span>. <span>\(K_{rc} = \frac{4\pi f_c}{c}\)</span>, <span>\(\Delta
K_r = \frac{4\pi f_\tau}{c} = -\frac{2\pi B}{c} \ldots \frac{2\pi B}{c}\)</span>.</p>
<p>$$ S(K_r, x_n) = \exp\left(-j K_r \sqrt{y_0^2 + (x_n - x_0 + \frac{v c \Delta K_r}{4 \pi \gamma} )^2}\right) $$</p>
<p>Next step is to do Fourier transform in azimuth direction (direction of the
movement) to move also the <span>\(x_n\)</span> variable to frequency domain.</p>
<p>$$ S(K_r, K_x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty S(K_r, x_n) \exp(-j K_x x_n)\, dx_n  = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp(j\Phi(x_n))\, dx_n $$</p>
<p><span>\(K_x = 2\pi f_x\)</span> is wavenumber in the azimuth direction. This integral doesn't have
exact solution, but there is a method to calculate quite accurate approximation
using a method called principle of stationary phase (PSOP). Phase of the
function being integrated can be written as:</p>
<p>$$ \Phi(x_n) = -K_r \sqrt{y_0^2 + \left(x_n - x_0 + \frac{v c \Delta K_r}{4 \pi \gamma} \right)^2} - K_x x_n $$</p>
<p>If we plot the phase <span>\(\Phi(x_n)\)</span> for some realistic values we get a plot that
looks something like below:</p>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/fmcw3-sar/phi_plot.png" width="40%/"></p><p>Phase and real part of the function being
    integrated.</p>
</div>

<p>There is one point where derivative of the phase is zero (stationary point) and
the function varies slowly, but away from that point the function is highly
oscillatory. As we integrate the function the oscillations far away from the
stationary point cancel out and mainly the area around the stationary point
contributes to the result of the integral.</p>
<p>We can expand the function around the stationary point <span>\(\frac{d}{dx_n}\Phi(x_n) \rvert_{x_n=x_n^\star} = 0\)</span>, as
<span>\(\Phi(x_n) = \Phi(x_n^\star) + 0 + \frac{1}{2}\Phi^{''}(x_n - x_n^\star)^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Plugging the Taylor expansion in to the integral we get:</p>
<p>$$ \begin{aligned}S(K_r, K_x) &amp;\approx \exp(j\Phi(x_n^\star)) \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp\left(j\frac{1}{2}\Phi^{''}(x_n^\star)(x_n-x_n^\star)^2\right)\, d x_n \\
&amp;= \exp(j\Phi(x_n^\star)) \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp\left(j\frac{1}{2}\Phi^{''}(x_n^\star)s^2\right)\, d s \\
&amp;= \exp(j\Phi(x_n^\star)) \sqrt{\frac{2\pi j}{\Phi^{''}(x_n^\star)}} \end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>Since <span>\(\Phi(x_n)\)</span> is purely real function, if <span>\(\mu\)</span> is sign of the
<span>\(\Phi(x_n^\star)\)</span>, then the square root term can be written as
<span>\(\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{|\Phi^{''}(x_n^\star)|}} exp(j\pi \mu/4)\)</span>. The second
derivative contributes amplitude term and constant phase term, neither of them
which is important for focusing image which mainly depends on aligning the
phases. We have ignored the amplitude since beginning and it ends up being slowly
varying function so we will just approximate it away.</p>
<p>The stationary point of the function <span>\(\frac{d}{dx_n}\Phi(x_n)
\rvert_{x_n=x_n^\star} = 0\)</span> can be solved to be:</p>
<p>$$ x_n^\star = x_0 - \frac{K_x y_0}{\sqrt{K_r^2 - K_x^2}} - \frac{c \Delta K_r
v}{4\pi\gamma} $$</p>
<p>Plugging in the stationary point to the <span>\(S(K_r, K_x)\)</span> equation above we get the
solution of the integral:</p>
<p>$$ S(K_r, K_x) \approx \exp\left(j(-y_0 \sqrt{K_r^2 - K_x^2} - K_x x_0 + \frac{c \Delta K_r K_x
v}{4\pi\gamma})\right) $$</p>
<p>The last term is phase offset caused by the movement of the radar during the
sweep. It can be removed by multiplying with exponential in the opposite phase.</p>
<p><span>\(x_0\)</span> term is already in the correct form as it is multiplied only by <span>\(K_x\)</span>, but
<span>\(y_0\)</span> term depends on both <span>\(K_r\)</span> and <span>\(K_x\)</span>. <span>\(K_r, K_x\)</span> dependence can be fixed
by making a substitution <span>\(\sqrt{K_r^2 - K_x^2} \rightarrow K_y\)</span>. This step is
called Stolt interpolation as it is implemented by interpolating the data to
a new grid.</p>
<p>After the Stolt interpolation the signal is in form:</p>
<p>$$ S(K_y, K_x) = \exp(j(-K_y y_0 - K_x x_0)) $$</p>
<p>Taking 2D inverse Fourier transform gives the focused image with delta function
centered at <span>\((x_0, y_0)\)</span>.</p>

<p>The Omega-k algorithm is mainly large FFTs and interpolation. Both can be
implemented well on GPU which requires large parallelism from the program. Well
written GPU implementation should be several times faster than CPU
implementation. For convenience I'll implement the algorithm using Tensorflow
library. Although it's …</p></div></article></section></div></div></div></div>

            <p>Securing containers is a complex task.  The problem space is broad, vendors are on fire, there are tons of checklists and best practices and it’s hard to prioritize solutions. So if you had to <strong>implement a container security strategy</strong> where would you start?</p>

<p>I suggest to start from the basics: understanding <strong>what container security is about</strong> and build a model to navigate risks.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-devops-life-cycle">Follow the DevOps Life Cycle</h2>

<p>Every security initiative is eventually constrained by where security controls can be implemented, so I find practical to just follow the standard DevOps life cycle to <em>surface patterns™</em> and <em>unlock synergies™</em>.</p>

<p>The DevOps Lifecycle is an infinite iteration of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Build</li>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Release</li>
<li>Deploy</li>
<li>Operate</li>
<li>Monitor</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cloudberry.engineering/devops-lifecycle.jpg" alt="DevOps Lifecycle - source: ryadel.com"></p>

<p>Containers are included in the application in the form of a Dockerfiles but are not really part of it. As such they don’t interest the planning and coding phase.</p>

<p><em>(no, writing Dockerfiles is not coding.)</em></p>

<p>Every other step is in scope from a security point of view, and I would group them like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Build Time</strong>: build, test and release.</li>
<li><strong>Container Infrastructure</strong>: deploy and operate.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime</strong>: monitor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why? Every security strategy is only effective if it can be implemented. And every step in each group share a common facility where security controls can be injected without adding much friction:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build Time: The CI/CD infrastructure, the container registry</li>
<li>Container Infrastructure: the container orchestrator</li>
<li>Runtime: the production environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have three macro areas we can use as a starting point to do our risk assessments.</p>

<h2 id="security-at-build-time">Security at Build Time</h2>

<p>At build time we have in input a bunch of source files and a Dockerfile, and we get as output a Docker image.</p>

<p>This is where most vendors tend to cluster while trying to sell you the narrative of the importance of scanning container images and calling it a day.  Container security scanning is important, yes, but it’s not enough.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>minimize the risk of supply chain attacks.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="container-images-hygiene">Container Images Hygiene</h3>

<p>First, decide how your images should look like, with a focus on how software dependencies are introduced:</p>

<ul>
<li>what base images are developers allowed to use?</li>
<li>are software dependencies pinned? From where are they pulled?</li>
<li>are there any labels that are needed to simplify governance and compliance?</li>
<li>lint the Dockerfile</li>
<li>follow <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/dockerfile-security-best-practices/">Docker security best practices</a> when writing Dockerfiles</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these checks are static and can be implemented for cheap as a step in the build pipelines.</p>

<h3 id="container-images-scanning">Container Images Scanning</h3>

<p>Then we can move into scanning the container image.</p>

<p><strong>Do not scan the image as a step in the build pipeline</strong>, instead setup continuous scanning in the container registry.</p>

<p>Why? Vulnerabilities are continuously discovered while your services are not necessarily continuously built. Secondly, builds are additive: every build will generate a new image. So, assuming  your container orchestrator trust your registry, every tag you publish can always be deployed and need to be assessed.</p>

<p><em>(It’s also very slow to scan at build time)</em></p>

<p>This is where you start thinking about defining <strong>patch management</strong> and <strong>shelf life</strong> processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>patch management: results from the scanning will feed a patching process that will result in a new version of the image</li>
<li>shelf life: unpatched/old/unsafe images are deleted from the registry</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(next article will be about how to choose a container scanning solution, if you are facing the dilemma right now feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@clouberry.engineering">ping me</a>)</em></p>

<h2 id="container-infrastructure-security">Container Infrastructure Security</h2>

<p>The container infrastructure is comprised of all the moving parts that are in charge of pulling your images from the registry and run them as containers in production.</p>

<p>It’s mostly going to be the container orchestrator – <em>*cough* kubernetes *cough*</em>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goals</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid platform misconfigurations with security implications</li>
<li>Minimize the <strong>breadth</strong> of an attack from a compromised container</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="security-of-the-infrastructure-misconfigurations">Security OF the Infrastructure: Misconfigurations</h3>

<p>Container orchestrators are complex, Kubernetes in particular. As of now they fail the promise of DevOps and I think we are still an abstraction layer (or two) away from being a mainstream solution without too much operational overhead.</p>

<p>Every complex platforms is prone to be misconfigured, and this is the part you want to focus on.</p>

<p>You have to threat model your infrastructure to <strong>ensure it can’t be abused</strong>.
This particular thread model should focus on every actor but a compromised container (we will cover that next).</p>

<p>I can’t go into details here, because it really depends on what you are running. For Kubernetes a good starting point for threat modelling is <a href="https://www.marcolancini.it/2020/blog-kubernetes-threat-modelling/">this</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you are not doing it yet, this is also a <strong>good argument in favour of using a managed platform</strong>: the complexity is reduced if you can leverage a shared responsibility model with your (trusted) provider.</p>

<h3 id="security-in-the-infrastructure-lateral-movements">Security IN the infrastructure: Lateral Movements</h3>

<p>Next we can talk about what happens when a container is compromised.</p>

<p>You want to minimize the <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/lateral-movement-cloud/">attacker’s ability to move laterally</a>, focusing on these two layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>The network layer</li>
<li>The Identity and Access management (IAM) layer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The network should not be flat</strong>. You can start by brutally segment everything into subnetworks and work your way up to a full fledge service meshes.</p>

<p>On the IAM layer work your way toward having a <strong>single identity for each container</strong> in order to fine tune the authorization grants. This is particularly important in multi tenant platforms: without granular identities it’s impossible to achieve least privilege.</p>

<p><em>(Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) has a nifty feature for this called <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity">Workload Identity</a>)</em></p>

<p>Finally, since they are supposed to be immutable, a wonderful strategy would be to <strong>reduce the amount of time containers can run</strong>: the window of opportunity for attackers to move laterally and gain persistence is as long as the container running lifetime. Continously shut down and spin up your containers.</p>

<p>And this final consideration allow me to smoothly move into the next area.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-security">Runtime Security</h2>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is the security of your running workloads.
At this point most of the hardening is done and here is when we move into the realm of reactive security controls, the grim land of <strong>post-fail</strong>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>is to minimize the <strong>impact</strong> of an attack from a compromised container.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="detection-and-incident-response">Detection and Incident Response</h3>

<p>The best way to control the impact of an attack is to minimize the time between the breach to when the security team is alerted.</p>

<p>Detecting an ongoing breach is another area where vendors are scrambling to find a silver bullet. There are many approaches, most of them will require side cars and/or daemon sets actively monitoring pod’s traffic and system calls.</p>

<p>Most solutions will provide some value but my advice is to start simple and iterate: use your existing SIEM, ingest your platform, application and audit logs.</p>

<p><strong>Incidents will happen</strong>, and it’s fine: have an incident response process.</p>

<p>The first bullet point of every post-mortem should be: <em>“how can we detect this quicker next time?”</em> answering will allow you to identify your blind spots, which you can then use to understand what signals you are missing and what makes sense to buy.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Container security is a broad problem and it is not just about scanning images.</p>

<p>This is the model I built and used to reason about container risks and solutions. It’s very high level and of course, as with every model, <strong>it’s not necessarily the right one</strong>.</p>

<p>We all know that in reality each infrastructure is a snowflake: so start with your own threat model and use this one <strong>as an inspiration</strong>.</p>

	<h4>A Walmart-exclusive Wi-Fi router, and others sold on Amazon &amp; eBay contain hidden backdoors to control devices <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/walmart-exclusive-routers-others-made-in-china-contain-backdoors-to-control-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports CyberNews</a>.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Researchers discovered that many low cost, Chinese-made Wi-Fi routers contain a hidden backdoor which is being actively exploited to create botnet attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>CyberNews researchers discovered suspicious backdoors in a Chinese made router sold under the name ‘Jetstream’. This router is part of Walmart’s new line of affordable Wi-Fi routers.</p>
<blockquote><p>This backdoor would allow an attacker the ability to remotely control not only the routers, but also any devices connected to that network.</p></blockquote>

<p>The researchers contacted Walmart to get a statement, and a Walmart spokesperson had this to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We are looking into the issue to learn more. The item in question is currently out of stock and we do not have plans to replenish it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>CyberNews researchers also discovered that ‘Wavlink’ branded routers, often sold on Amazon or eBay, <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/walmart-exclusive-routers-others-made-in-china-contain-backdoors-to-control-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contain similar backdoors</a>.</p>
<p>Worryingly, they also discovered that these <strong>backdoors are being actively exploited</strong>, and there have been attempts to add the routers to a botnet with malware that allows them to be used in large scale DDoS attacks, which have <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/walmart-exclusive-routers-others-made-in-china-contain-backdoors-to-control-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the past taken down major websites</a> such as Reddit, Netflix, CNN, GitHub, Twitter, AirBnb and more.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p>Jetstack is mainly a Kubernetes professional services company founded in 2015 and recently acquired by Venafi, a security company specialized in different areas mainly machine identity. According to the <a href="https://www.venafi.com/blog/why-venafi-acquisition-good-jetstack-community">Venafi</a>:</p><blockquote>The combination of speed and security creates an interesting dilemma. How do you build software quick enough to compete, without the risk of being exploited? This is the challenge that Jetstack and Venafi will solve.</blockquote><p>Back to cert-manager, Jetstack recently announced the release of the v1 API for this tool, which made the technology more mature and powerful. This release allows developers to have greater visibility and control over their certificates.</p><p>Currently, the Venafi+Jetsack team has been working towards integrating Google's new Certificate Authority Service (CAS) with cert-manager. This will offer developers private CA keys as a service, using HSMs, which are validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 3.</p></div></section><section><section><div><blockquote>
                Itâ€™s exciting to see cert-manager join the CNCF Sandbox. Itâ€™s been several years in the making to get to 1.0, and weâ€™re hugely thankful to a community of over 250 contributors, and many end-users, to get it to where it is today. This is a foundational add-on to many Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters, and the project will benefit from being part of the CNCF and its ecosystem. We look forward to attracting a diverse contributor base and extending our partnership and cooperation with many other projects to further enhance the developer and operator experience.

Ask a manager</h4><p>Approval is loose and informal. PMs and EMs briefly mention it to their managers over email or their regular check-in.</p><p>Managers won’t require much justification for approval. Why? Its an immaterial amount of money and they trust their employees’ judgment.</p><h4>2. Find a credit card</h4><p>With very few exceptions, PMs and EMs (at the levels I’m targeting) don’t have company credit cards. So how do they pay after getting approval?</p><h5>Pay with personal credit card</h5><p>This is a common practice for team meals, social events, and one-off software purchases. A senior team member will pay with a personal card and file an expense report.</p><p>But people are more hesitant to pay for a <em><strong>recurring</strong></em> team subscription with a personal card.</p><h5>Find a company credit card</h5><p>This varies from company to company, but the most common places people go are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Finance</strong> (manages budgets)</p></li><li><p><strong>IT</strong> (manages access to company subscriptions)</p></li><li><p><strong>Lowest person above them in the org chart with a company card</strong> (usually a Director or VP, depending on company size)</p></li></ol><h2>😁 Why my strategy will work</h2><h5>✅  Loose approval process</h5><p>I mentioned this before, but it’s worth restating. <strong>This means that the PM or EM using <a href="https://www.hellohailey.io/">HelloHailey</a> is the primary decision maker.</strong></p><p>No bureaucracy. No long, complex sales cycles.</p><p><strong>I just need to build a great product.</strong></p><h5>✅  Fits into an existing budget</h5><p>It’s my hypothesis that teams will pay for HelloHailey using their team “social” budgets. These budgets cover expenses like meals, games, or team events.</p><h5>✅  Takes a small percentage of that budget</h5><p>Team social budgets range from $10-$100 / person / month, with a median somewhere in the middle.</p><p>With a price of $2-$3 / person / month, HelloHailey would eat up only 5% of that budget on average.</p><h5>✅  Social budgets have been underutilized with sudden shift to remote work</h5><p>Half the people I talked to haven’t used their social budgets at all since being forced into remote work.</p><p>Most of the other half has used it sparingly for virtual team events.</p><h2>😢 Why it might not work</h2><p>Until companies <em>actually</em> start paying me, my strategy will be full of uncertainty.</p><p>Here are some ways it might fail:</p><h5>💩  Doesn’t fit into an existing budget</h5><p>Maybe companies don’t think it’s appropriate to pull from team social budgets for this kind of purchase.</p><p>If it doesn’t fit nicely into <em>any</em> existing category, it’ll be much harder for companies to buy it.</p><h5>💩  Hard to budget for a product with expanding price</h5><p><a href="https://www.hellohailey.io/">HelloHailey</a> will get more expensive as more users and teams are added within a company. </p><h5>💩  <strong>What happens when a product purchased with Team A’s social budget adds users from Team B and gets more expensive? </strong></h5><p>I don’t know 🤷‍♂️ (<em>Do you? <a href="https://twitter.com/AnotherTimJones">Share your wisdom and help me out</a> </em>🙂 ).</p><p>But I’m not the first person to face this problem. There are precedents in place and I’m confident I’ll figure it out.</p><h5>💩  Approval process is more difficult than expected</h5><p>The people I interviewed could be outliers. Maybe a typical manager requires more convincing to approve this kind of purchase.</p><h2>What about expanding?</h2><p>I now feel confident about landing. <strong>So how will I expand?</strong></p><p>I have some ideas for how I can build growth mechanisms into a product like this.</p><p>But if I’m being honest, I’m not sure yet 🤷‍♂️. And I’m OK with that.</p><p><strong>With a successful “land” strategy, and low to moderate expansion revenue, I can build a great business.</strong></p><p>Intra-company virality would be a must if I wanted to become a VC-backed rocket ship.</p><p><strong>But that’s not my goal.</strong></p><p><strong>I want to build a small, profitable company that solves a problem I’m passionate about.</strong></p><p>I can sell to unicorns. But I don’t want to <em>become</em> one.</p><h2>What did I get wrong?</h2><p>I learned a lot this week, but I’ve never done this before. </p><p><strong>Do you have SaaS sales experience?</strong></p><p>Don’t pull your punches! Help me out on my Twitter thread:</p><p>Don’t have any tips for me? <strong>Maybe you could help me out with a like or a retweet.</strong></p><p><strong>As a solopreneur with no funding or income, I’ll take all the help I can get 😁</strong></p><h2>🤔 Reducing uncertainty one week at a time</h2><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac3da08-e921-4064-b421-eebf46ef563b_920x248.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac3da08-e921-4064-b421-eebf46ef563b_920x248.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cac3da08-e921-4064-b421-eebf46ef563b_920x248.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:248,&quot;width&quot;:920,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:490,&quot;bytes&quot;:29061,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00e39b8-5136-450c-b442-675c0cd2fd7f_478x184.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00e39b8-5136-450c-b442-675c0cd2fd7f_478x184.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d00e39b8-5136-450c-b442-675c0cd2fd7f_478x184.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:184,&quot;width&quot;:478,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:23531,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>I’m finally feeling confident about my go-to-market strategy.

<p>Here we go again. Just when you figured out what all these weird abbreviations (DKIM, SPF, DMARC) are, one more pops up on the horizon. Weren’t you safe enough already? Weren’t the spoofers, seeing your robust DNS records, quietly running away? Not all of them. The bad news is that you need to become familiar with the new kids on the block –&nbsp; BIMI records. Good news – we’ve got them covered for you. Read on!<br></p>



<h2><span id="What_is_a_BIMI_Record">What is a BIMI Record?</span></h2>



<p>BIMI stands for <strong>Brand Indicator for Message Identification</strong>. It’s a new approach that aims to prevent spoofing attempts but also increases the credibility of email senders. When fully implemented, hackers will have a very hard time trying to impersonate brands in emails, and maybe in a lot of other places too.<br></p>



<p><strong>A BIMI record is a DNS TXT record indicating what a brand’s logo is</strong>. When properly certified and authenticated, brands will be able to display their logo next to each message in an inbox, just like in the example below.<br></p>

They’ll also learn to recognize the brand they know and like, coming with obvious benefits for the companies. We will cover more about that later.<br></p>



<p>BIMI email authentication is developed as an open standard and it is possible that not only email clients will adopt it. Among the most likely candidates, messaging and social media apps are mentioned. Companies present there could also benefit from additional security. The platforms will probably be eager to get verified accounts on board. BIMI records could make a lot of difference.<br></p>



<p>We’ll see how it all plays out. At the time of writing (Dec. 2019), BIMI is in a pilot stage with Verizon Media Group (Yahoo!, AOL). Google recently also <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/google-joins-authindicators-working-group-and-commits-to-bimi-pilot-300890074.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">announced that they will be trialing BIMI in 2020.</a> If everything works out as expected, we can see BIMI records being adopted more in the coming years.<br></p>



<h2><span id="What_are_the_requirements_to_join_the_BIMI_club">What are the requirements to join the BIMI club?</span></h2>



<p>For BIMI to work, several conditions need to be met:</p>



<ul><li>The sender’s domain needs to be DMARC-authenticated, with either ‘reject’ or ‘quarantine’ policy set up</li><li>The domain’s owner needs to obtain the right certification</li><li>A good sending history needs to be built</li></ul><p>Let’s discuss these conditions one-by-one.<br></p>



<h3><span id="Be_DMARC-certified">Be DMARC-certified</span></h3>



<p>We already discussed DMARC on our blog, but if you wish to read more about it, check out our <a href="https://blog.mailtrap.io/dmarc-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">DMARC Explained</a> article, along with our tips on <a href="https://blog.mailtrap.io/dmarc-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">how to set up DMARC record</a>.<br></p>



<p>Long story short, DMARC is an authentication method that works on top of SPF and/or DKIM.<br></p>



<p><a href="https://blog.mailtrap.io/spf-records-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">SPF</a> is used to specify which IP addresses are allowed to send emails on behalf of a given domain. <a href="https://blog.mailtrap.io/dkim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">DKIM</a>, on the other hand, allows incoming servers to verify the headers and body of a message, so that they look just like they did when they were leaving the sender’s inbox.</p>



<p>DMARC runs either check (or both) and performs a separate domain alignment test for the methods used. Finally, a policy assigned with DMARC can suggest an incoming server if emails that fail a test should be:</p>



<ul><li>Reject -&gt; discarded and not delivered to the recipient’s inbox</li><li>Quarantine -&gt; sent to the spam folder</li><li>None -&gt; treated as though no check was made (good for testing)</li></ul><p>As we mentioned earlier, to qualify for BIMI, the policy needs to be set to either ‘quarantine’ or ‘reject’. Of course, the DMARC record needs to be properly configured.<br></p>



<p>DMARC doesn’t require both DKIM and SPF to be set up (though it’s a smart thing to do). For the BIMI record to have any effect, either of these methods should be in place, along with DMARC, of course. A check will be performed every time a message is due to be delivered, so it’s worth triple-checking if everything is intact.<br></p>



<h3><span id="Obtain_a_certification">Obtain a certification</span></h3>



<p>To add an additional layer of security, bodies governing BIMI, referred to as Mark Verifying Authorities (MVA), will ask for additional proof of domain ownership.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>To get in, you’ll need to obtain an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Validation_Certificate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">EV (Extended Validation) certificate</a> and meet several additional requirements:</p>



<ul><li>Prove the ownership or the right to use a registered trademark</li><li>Have this trademark registered in a competent jurisdiction</li><li>Make sure the logo from the BIMI record matches the trademark</li><li>Assure the owner of a trademark is also a registrant of a given domain name (alternative, those using a trademark under a license must be registered as licensees of a domain)</li></ul><p>Only if all of these conditions are met, the MVA will proceed to issue a respective certification.<br></p>



<p>Keep in mind that these rules may change at any point. CNN was the first company to obtain a certificate from MVA and <a href="https://martechtoday.com/cnn-com-receives-first-verified-mark-certificate-in-preparation-for-bimi-email-standard-236255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">it happened only in October 2019</a>. Before the program is rolled out to the public, the rules will likely be re-evaluated a number of times and some tweaks might be introduced. We’ll do our best to update this article if any of these happen.<br></p>



<h3><span id="Maintain_a_good_sending_history">Maintain a good sending history</span></h3>



<p>The last requirement is rather vague, but is important to keep in mind. In order to qualify for BIMI, you’ll need to have a good sending reputation, both for your domain and IP address.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This means having a healthy, engaged list of subscribers. Of course, you should avoid <a href="https://blog.mailtrap.io/soft-vs-hard-bounce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">email bounces</a> and spam reports, but the fact that your emails are regularly opened by the recipients will also play a significant role.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>You also will need to have a track record of sending a significant volume of emails. Smaller senders may also be granted access to BIMI at some point but for now, only bigger brands will have a shot.</p>

Unsubscribe anytime.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>



<h2><span id="How_to_implement_BIMI_records">How to implement BIMI records?</span></h2>



<p>Once you meet all the requirements and obtain respective certifications, you can go on and add a proper record to your Domain Name System (DNS).<br></p>



<p>Then, you’ll need to upload your logo, necessarily in SVG format to a public HTTPS address. It’s recommended that it’s square-shaped and transparent. You may also want to avoid any unnecessary text as the logo displayed will be really small, making reading nearly impossible.<br></p>



<p>Finally, you will add a TXT record for <em>default._bimi.DomainAddress</em> in the following format: </p>



<pre><code>v=BIMI1; l=logoURL;</code></pre>



<p>For example, for Mailtrap it could be:</p>



<pre><code>v=BIMI1; l=https://www.mailtrap.io/logo123.svg;</code></pre>



<p>(it’s not really a valid address but if you wish to use our logo, let us know!)<br></p>



<p>That’s all. If you’re approved into the program and everything was configured properly, you should see the first effects within a few days.<br></p>



<h2><span id="Where_can_BIMI_authentication_make_a_difference">Where can BIMI authentication make a difference?</span></h2>



<p>When talking about BIMI authentication and its impact, the first thing that comes up is email security. After all, that’s precisely what BIMI record was introduced for. We also can’t underestimate the marketing impact it can have on brands. Let’s talk about these two aspects.<br></p>



<h3><span id="Security_impact">Security impact</span></h3>



<p>While DKIM and SPF help prevent spoofing, skillful fraudsters can bypass these measures, especially if only one of them is set up. DMARC is much more difficult, as domain alignment is also checked. Chances are someone will pass through.<br></p>



<p>That’s when BIMI comes very handy. Most users don’t check email addresses of the senders and email clients don’t display them right away. Instead, all users see is the display name of a sender, sometimes with company initials.<br></p>



<p>This can be easily spoofed. <strong>When a BIMI record is in place, a brand’s missing logo may raise a yellow flag </strong>for those used to seeing the branding displayed for each email.<br></p>



<p>Popularizing BIMI will also directly <strong>impact the adoption rate of DMARC</strong>. Even after several years since the release, most companies still don’t use this technology and, according to <a href="https://www.agari.com/insights/ebooks/2018-q4-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Agari’s research</a>, only 8% of Fortune 500 companies have ‘reject’ or ‘quarantine’ policies in place. All the others are vulnerable to attacks, most of which can be easily prevented with the more sophisticated tools.<br></p>



<p>It’s in the best interest of both users and email service providers to drive the adoption of DMARC. BIMI has a chance to finally move the numbers in the right direction.<br></p>



<h3><span id="Marketing_impact">Marketing impact</span></h3>



<p>BIMI implementation can have a major impact on marketing efforts. Since BIMI is and will be free to participate in, brands will get <strong>free exposure with almost no effort</strong>. Users will learn to recognize their logos right on the spot.<br></p>



<p>Emails signed with logos will also <strong>build users’ trust</strong>, especially if the content that follows is valuable. They will certainly feel safer opening emails from familiar sources.<br></p>



<p>BIMI will likely expand at some point to other forms of online communication. Those that participate will be able to continuously develop brand awareness and quickly gain recognition.<br></p>



<p>Since the BIMI logo for an email is fetched from a DNS every time a message is delivered, <strong>rebranding will also run smoother than it usually does</strong>. All it will take is updating an SVG file in the domain’s DNS and changes will be applied with the next email delivered.<br></p>



<h2><span id="Wrapping_up">Wrapping up</span></h2>



<p>All of this sounds really exciting and we’ll be watching closely how this all evolves. Many companies will surely take advantage of this opportunity and once the pilots wrap up, many more will follow their steps.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Chances are that a few years from now, we’ll be looking suspiciously at emails coming in without company logos. Or who knows, maybe a completely different approach will take over by then and change the way we think about email authentication.<br></p>



<p>Whether you’re eligible for the program or not, you likely have a vital interest in making your emails better, and rightly so.

<p>Hell, you'd be surprised at how many people buy games with a moderate length and never finish them. On PC over 50 percent of the people who bought the latest Wolfenstein, a game you can beat in under 15 hours, never earned the achievement for finishing the story. Only 31 percent of Dishonored players on the PC beat the game. People think game length is mandatory, but even shorter games aren't finished by the majority of players.

<p>Especially if you're starting out, try to do small projects and don't worry too much about polishing them, don't worry about shipping the perfect game, embrace the messiness of getting into games for the first time, embrace not knowing what you're doing exactly yet.

<p>Small-scale works are often derided for feeling embryonic or unfinished, throwaway motifs or fledgling ideas that the artist failed to integrate into a sufficiently ambitious whole. Game designer Jake Elliott, who drew the title of his Ruins from Schumann’s appraisal of Chopin’s preludes, defended their proportion in an interview: “Maybe [Chopin] felt like they were complete objects, but there wasn’t a vocabulary for talking about pieces of music that were short at the time. Their length is what drew me … there is a lot that’s unspoken.” Having conventionally privileged length, magnitude, and formal unity, games too have left critics bereft of a clear rubric for evaluating intentionally abbreviated, serialized, even disorderly exercises in interactive design.<br><strong>— Peter Lido: Undertale, one year later</strong><br><a href="https://killscreen.com/articles/undertale-one-year-later/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://killscreen.com/articles/undertale-one-year-later/</a></p>

<p>The final idea that we brought over as gamers, the final idea that we had to let go of, was that a longer game makes a better game. We felt that the sense of completion and catharsis that you get when you watch our ending was so critical to the experience, that we decided that we had to help as many people as possible to complete Monument Valley. And that was more important than making the game longer or more difficult.<br><strong>— Ken Wong: Games Without Gamers (#DICE2014 Europe)</strong><br><a href="http://youtu.be/YdSClYHDow0?t=13m37s" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/YdSClYHDow0?t=13m37s</a></p>

<p>I value games being short, it makes them easier to fit into life, they get to the point sooner, it's possible to play them more times, trying out different possibilities, there's a clearer connection between decisions and outcome.<br><strong>— Michael Brough: imbroglio notes 6 - meditation</strong><br><a href="http://mightyvision.blogspot.de/2016/08/imbroglio-notes-6-meditation.html?m=1" rel="nofollow noopener">http://mightyvision.blogspot.de/2016/08/imbroglio-notes-6-meditation.html?m=1</a></p>

<p>Small games must be protected from their own defenders!! They must be defended against a rhetoric of convenience, as if fitting helpfully into the meagre free time allotted us by rentiers was something to be proud of rather than something to grind against - they must be defended against the meagre virtues of "minimalism", parsimony, elegance, the values of those with enough cultural cachet that they can afford to speak softly, and which hold the same relation to an actual human economy of wants and needs as does a millionaire who doesn't tip.<br><strong>— thecathamites: Small Game Manifesto (part of&nbsp;Buttertown, 10 manifestos for groups of no people)</strong><br><a href="https://thecatamites.itch.io/buttertown">https://thecatamites.itch.io/buttertown</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2><p>Traditionally services were deployed on bare metal and in the last decades we have seen the rise of virtualisation (running additional operating systems in a operating system process) and lately containerisation (running an operating system process in a separate security context from the rest of processes on the same host). Virtualisation and containerisation offers different levels of isolation by moving some operating system functionality to the guest systems.</p><p>The following chart illustrates that pretty well:</p><p><img src="https://dev.l1x.be/img/isolation.png" alt="OS functionality location"></p><p>Source: <a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/multifacet/papers/vee20_blending.pdf">https://research.cs.wisc.edu/multifacet/papers/vee20_blending.pdf</a></p><p>In this article, I perform a deep dive into Firecracker and how it can be used for deploying services on Raspberry Pi (4B).</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2><p>There are few paths to take here. First I am going to try the easy one, using Ubuntu. Later on we can investigate the use of Alpine Linux which is much more lightweight than Ubuntu, ideal for devices like RPI.</p><h3 id="installing-the-image-on-a-microsd-card">Installing the image on a microSD card</h3><p>We need a 64 bit Ubuntu image and a microsd card. For the imaging I use <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">Balena Etcher</a> that makes the imaging process super easy.</p><p>Getting the pre-installed image:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">wget https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/20.04/release/<span>\
</span><span></span>ubuntu-20.04.1-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img.xz
</code></pre></div><p>Preinstalled means that we get a fully working operating system and there is no need for additional installation steps after booting up. With Balena Etcher it is super easy to write the compressed image file to the sd card and boot the system up once ready. SSHD starts up after the installation and we can log in via ssh if we know the IP address that the DHCP server issues to our device (assuming DHCP server is present in our LAN).</p><p>There are few mildly annoying things with Ubuntu (snaps, unattended-upgrades) that I usually remove. I also prefer to use Chrony over the systemd equivalent. Ansible repo for these is available here: <a href="https://github.com/l1x/rpi/blob/main/ubuntu.20/ansible/roles/os/tasks/main.yml">https://github.com/l1x/rpi/blob/main/ubuntu.20/ansible/roles/os/tasks/main.yml</a></p><h3 id="installing-firecracker-jailer-and-firectl">Installing Firecracker, Jailer and Firectl</h3><ul><li>Firecracker: The main component, it is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and run microVMs.</li><li>Jailer: For starting Firecracker in production mode, applies a cgroup/namespace isolation barrier and then drops privileges.

November 23, 2020 | https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this post I’ll show you how to use a Raspberry Pi and some soldering skills to automate old Somfy blinds via the MQTT protocol exposed to Home Assistant and Google Home.</p><p>We’ve moved to a new apartment and one of its features are external blinds (a.k.a. covers) that are controlled through a dedicated remote of the Somfy brand. However, just like with a TV, finding the remote is often tricky, so I decided to try and automate the external blind movements through Home Assistant and further voice commands of Google Home.</p><p>The system in place is a Somfy’s Telis 4 RTS Pure remote, with two remotes, each being able to program 5 channels (4 individual ones and combined). The system uses a legacy, proprietary radio protocol called <a href="https://service.somfy.com/downloads/nam_v4/rts_pocket_guide_dec_2017.pdf">RTS</a>, which only Somfy and Telis use.</p><p>Somfy offers a RTS bridge called <a href="https://www.somfysystems.com/en-us/products/1811403/mylink">Somfy MyLink</a> for a wooping ~300CHF, which is a little steep for something that is not necessary and just scratching an itch. Also, there’s not much fun in that.</p><p>Turns out, <a href="https://github.com/Nickduino/">Nickduino</a> had a similar itch to scratch. Using 3-4 CHF-worth of hardware components, it is quite easy to build a software radio that will immitate a Somfy Telis remote and control the blinds.</p><p>There’s an bare-bones <a href="https://github.com/Nickduino/Somfy_Remote/blob/master/Somfy_Remote.ino">Somfy Remote Arduino sketch</a> that shows how the protocol works. I originally wanted make the blind controller as small as possible and base it on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32">ESP32</a>, taking that sketch and controlling it via <a href="https://github.com/256dpi/arduino-mqtt">arduino-mqtt</a>.</p><p>Turns out there is a full MQTT/web interface script <a href="https://github.com/Nickduino/Pi-Somfy">Nickduino/Pi-Somfy</a> that also only goes into the details of how to solder things, and connect things onto a Raspberry Pi. Laziness won the day, especially as I wanted to use my spare Pi for something anyway.</p><h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2><p>Usually for 433MHz signals you could easily use a ready-made module such us <a href="https://www.berrybase.ch/raspberry-pi-co/raspberry-pi/module-sensoren/433mhz-sender-empf-228-nger-superregeneration-modul-fs1000a-xy-fst-xy-mk-5v">this 2CHF sender-receiver pair</a>. However, in order for Somfy to make their RTS even more proprietary than it already was, it is not using the typical <code>433.93MHz</code> frequency but <code>433.42MHz</code> 🤦‍♂️. This means one will need to do some soldering.</p><p>The PiSomfy <a href="https://github.com/Nickduino/Pi-Somfy#2-hardware">hardware guide</a> is excellent in telling you what you need. I got:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/5x-433Mhz-RF-transmitter-and-receiver-kit-Module-Arduino-ARM-WL-MCU-Raspberry-Fc-/254607185239?hash=item3b47c55557">5 ready <code>433.93MHz</code> sender circuits</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/10pcs-433-42m-433-42mhz-r433-f433-saw-resonator-crystals-to-39-/331637441887?hash=item4d3721c55f">10 pieces of the <code>433.42MHz</code> oscilator</a> - because my soldering is terrible</li><li><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/40PCS-20cm-2-54MM-FF-FM-MM-Dupont-wire-jumper-cables-male-to-female-For-Arduino/312724733910?hash=item48cfd8bfd6:g:05sAAOSwlbZdSZ6E">male-male jumper cables</a> - to avoid soldering 😉</li><li>(already had it) a solid copper cable to use as an antenna</li></ul><p>After 4 weeks, all the eBay items were in place, and I could start soldering. Turns out de-soldering things off is much harder than soldering things on. I managed to peel away the original oscillator with by applying leverage underneath it using a swiss army knife and heating its connectors one by one. Soldering the new one was quite easy in comparison.</p><figure><img src="https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/soldering.jpg" alt="It&amp;rsquo;s not pretty but it worked." width="600"><figcaption><p>It’s not pretty but it worked.</p></figcaption></figure><p>I then took a 17cm piece of solid copper cable, and wrapped it into a small coil. Turns out soldering a think 1mm cable to a tiny connector was the trickiest bit, but with the right amount of patience, things will stick eventually.</p><p>Eventually, the fully connected sender fits nicely into a Raspberry Pi enclosure after connecting everything to the GPIO 4 pin:</p><figure><img src="https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/final_side_by_side.jpg" alt="All fits nicely into a standard Pi enclosure. The remote we&amp;rsquo;ll be replacing are on the left." width="700"><figcaption><p>All fits nicely into a standard Pi enclosure. The remote we’ll be replacing are on the left.</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="programming">Programming</h2><p>Installing Pi-Somfy is super easy, just follow <a href="https://github.com/Nickduino/Pi-Somfy#3-software">these steps</a>. It assume you install it under the default <code>pi</code> user in <code>/home/pi</code>, and comes with a handy <code>systemctl</code> service for auto-starting the system.</p><p>By default it will come up on port <code>:80</code> of your Pi. Programming the blinds takes a little bit of time. The procedure is as follows:</p><ul><li>Set the right channel (individual blind, or all) on the remote you’re programming from.</li><li>Measure the time in seconds it takes for each blind to come fully down.</li><li>Click <em>Add new</em> to put in the name (this will be your MQTT name by the way) and add in the time.</li><li>Using a pen, press the “hole” on the other side of the remote. This sends the signal to the blind to accept programming a new remote.</li><li>Press <em>Save</em> and follow the instructions. The blind should “wiggle” once programmed.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: The system relies on time to figure out where the blind is percentage-wise. It can often get things wrong (e.g. if you stopped it mid-through), or on the all-channel if blinds have different lengths (e.g. balcony). But in practice it works remarkably well.</p><figure><img src="https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/pi_remote.png" alt="Fully programmed blinds." width="700"><figcaption><p>Fully programmed blinds.</p></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT">MQTT</a> is a standard protocol for message brokers, and finds a lot of use in home IoT. For most use cases, it has a simple publish-subscribe mechanic based on topics.</p><h2 id="installing-mosquitto">Installing Mosquitto</h2><p>Home Assistant has an embedded MQTT broker, but it is <em>highly advised</em> to use an external one, such as Mosquitto. You should install it on the same machine that runs Home Assistant, as it will act as a hub for other MQTT-connected services. To do that on Ubuntu:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
</code></pre></div><p>Now let’s set up a password file in <code>/etc/mosquitto/passwd</code> with a user for <code>homeassistant</code> and <code>pisomfy</code>.</p><pre><code>sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd homeassistant
Password: YourHomeAssistantPassword
sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd pisomfy
Password: YourPiSomfyPassword
</code></pre><p>Then, enforce use of passwords in mosquitto by editing <code>/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/default.conf</code> and changing it to:</p><pre><code>allow_anonymous false
password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd
</code></pre><p>For debugging purposes, open a separate tab on the same machine and subscribe to all messages under the <code>home-assistant/#</code> topic via:</p><pre><code>mosquitto_sub -u homeassistant -P YourHomeAssistantPassword -p 1883 -h 127.0.0.1 -v -t "home-assistant/#"
</code></pre><p>This will come in handy to check things are working.</p><h2 id="configuring-home-assistant">Configuring Home Assistant</h2><p>Update your <code>/etc/homeassistant/configuration.yaml</code> to add:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>mqtt</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>broker</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>127.0.0.1</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>username</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>homeassistant</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>password</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"YourHomeAssistantPassword"</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>discovery</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Restart Home Assistant</p><pre><code>sudo systemctl restart homeassistant
</code></pre><h3 id="configure-pisomfy">Configure PiSomfy</h3><p>On your Pi machine, open <code>/home/pi/operateShutters.conf</code> and edit the `[MQTT] section to look as follows</p><div><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>[MQTT]</span>
<span># Location (IP Address of DNS Name) of the MQTT Server</span>
<span>MQTT_Server</span> <span>=</span> <span>myHAmachine # or hostname of your home assistant machine</span>
<span># Port of the MQTT Server</span>
<span>MQTT_Port</span> <span>=</span> <span>1883</span>
<span># Username for the MQTT Server</span>
<span>MQTT_User</span> <span>=</span> <span>pisomfy</span>
<span># Password of the MQTT Server</span>
<span>MQTT_Password</span> <span>=</span> <span>YourPiSomfyPassword</span>
<span># Enable auto discovery</span>
<span>EnableDiscovery</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And restart the service:</p><pre><code>sudo systemctl restart shutters.conf`
</code></pre><p>At this point the tab with the subscriptions should be full of messages. These are auto-discovery messages over MQTT for each of the programmed covers. This will cause Home Assistant to automatically add the entities.</p><p>They should show up with the same names as in PiSomfy.</p><figure><img src="https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/home_assistant_entities.png" alt="Home Assistant Entities auto discovered via MQTT." width="800"><figcaption><p>Home Assistant Entities auto discovered via MQTT.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Adding them to a dashboard is relatively trivial, for example:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>type</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>entities</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>entities</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- <span>entity</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>cover.lr_all</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Living Room Covers</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>In order to simplify things, I wanted to only expose the <code>_all</code> blinds (a.k.a. covers) to Google Home/Assistant. For that I added an explicit section in the <code>/etc/homeassistant/configuration.yaml</code> section of <code>google_assistant</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>google_assistant</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span># ...</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>exposed_domains</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span>- <span>fan</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>entity_config</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>cover.br_all</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>      </span><span>expose</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>

</span><span>      </span><span>aliases</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>        </span>- <span>"Living Room Covers"</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>After restarting Home Assistant, and uttering the magical <em>Ok Google, Sync All Devices</em>, the covers will show up in your Home App:</p><figure><img src="https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/google_home.jpg" alt="Looks like a blind, acts as a blind." width="300"><figcaption><p>Looks like a blind, acts as a blind.</p></figcaption></figure><p>This means you can controll it using keywords:</p><ul><li><em>Ok Google, close Bedroom covers</em></li><li><em>Ok Google, open Bedroom covers</em></li><li><em>Ok Google, set Bedroom covers to 50%</em></li></ul><p>The killer feature is setting this up as a routine to open/close the blind as you wake up, go to sleep.</p><p>Happy hacking :)</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>This article – the first in a series – will walk you through the basics of Portapack MAYHEM firmware, installation and some hands-on testing of RF spoofing, DoS and Replay Attacks.</p><p>The PortaPack is  add-on for the HackRF software defined radio  which allows you to go portable with the HackRF and a battery pack. It features a small touchscreen LCD and an iPod like control wheel that is used to control custom HackRF firmware which includes an audio receiver, several built in digital decoders and transmitters too. With the PortaPack no PC is required to receive or transmit with the HackRF.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/7edf36e9aaecaea695b6914190d5ec2ad2cb49d7c4d8bb94ae8535996ba0931f.jpeg"></p><p>Running the MAYHEM firmware onto your Portapack which will then give you some a really amazing amount of cool features. While listening to transmissions from ships, planes or emergency services is hardly news to police scanner owners using the Portapack is as easy as entering the correct frequency. </p><p>Channel information for almost any Police/Fire Deparment Radio could be found on RadioReference Wiki, sample <a href="https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/New_York_Times_Square_New_Year's_Eve_ball_drop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Scanner frequencies for the annual Times Square New Years Celebration</a>.</p><p>But where the MAYHEM firmware stands out is in the ability to receive and transmit data from digital messaging systems, remote controls, smart car sensors and others. It can even spoof critical beacon signals as those from aircraft transponders or GPS satellites. </p><p>As of the time of this post the currently available decoders and transmit options can be seen in the screenshots below.  Note that for the transmitter options, there are some there that could really land you in trouble with the law so be very careful to exercise caution and only transmit what you are legally allowed to.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/37de762b5b6f97bb464fdd6179ce9f37cdd05785731fee0b8d461eb55bf0f84c.png"></p><p>Although the PortaPack add-on hardware was released several years ago  the firmware was not developed very far beyond listening to audio and implementing a few transmitters. For a time this interesting device was forgotten compared to its brother HackRF. But after some years the third party 'Havoc' firmware by 'furrtek' greatly expanded the list of  decoders and transmit options. Unfortunately the havok firmware is no longer maintained so we're now looking at the open-source <a href="https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">MAYHEM firmware</a> by ’eried’, an active fork with even more features.</p><p>Another reason why the Portapack is becoming more popular is because of its dropping price. Both the Portapack and the HackRF are open source hardware, anyone can produce their own device based on the code and available designs. Therefore a "clone" of Portapack is just as good as an original one. With open source code hardware there is no such thing as genuine hardware. For this reason, right now it is possible to find a complete <a href="https://bit.ly/2UUKgRG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HackRF and Portapack kits offers from China for less than $200</a>, when years ago this would have cost us over $500.</p><p><strong>Installation</strong></p><p>There are two versions of the portapack: the Portapack H1 and the Portapack H2, the only difference is the screen size. Both are fully compatible with MAYHEM, in my case I choose the H1 because is cheaper.</p><p>Installing the firmware is really easy. One of the characteristics of the HackRF along with the Portapack is that it is practically impossible to brick, so there is no need to worry about this process. It is always recommended to update the firmware with the latest realease of the project, since although some vendors even include the old Havoc or even the new Mayhem firmware, they are rarely the latest version since it is a project that adds constant improvements.</p><p>Download last release from <a href="https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/releases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/releases</a></p><h4>Windows</h4><ol><li>Connect the device via USB</li><li>Switch to HackRF mode via the on-screen option (in the PortaPack)</li><li>Double click <code>flash_portapack_mayhem.bat</code> and follow the instructions</li><li>Reboot the device</li></ol><h4>Linux</h4><ol><li>Connect the device via USB</li><li>Switch to HackRF mode via the on-screen option (in the PortaPack)</li><li>Upload the firmware with <code>hackrf_spiflash -w new_firmware_file.bin</code></li><li>Reboot the device</li></ol><h2><strong>Hands-on Testing</strong></h2><p>The list of supported radio protocols on MAYHEM is impressive: Police Scanner, IQ file replay,  Microphone FM transmit with CTCSS, CTCSS decoder, Frequency manager (save &amp; load from SD card, with categories and notes), "Soundboard" wave file player from  files in SD card , ADS-B receiver with map view, ADS-B transmitter (aircraft spoof), SSTV transmitter, Fully configurable jammer, POCSAG transmitter, POCSAG receiver/decoder, Morse transmitter (FM tone and CW), OOK transmitter for common remote encoders (PT2262, doorbells, remote outlets, some garage doors, ...), RDS (Radio Data System) PSN, RadioText and Time groups transmitter, Meteorological ballon radiosonde receiver (M10, M2K2, ...) , AFSK receiver, AFSK transmitter (Bell202, ...) , Nuoptix DTMF sync transmitter, French LCR (Language de Commande Routier) message generator,  Street lighting control transmitter (CCIR tones), Fully configurable RF signal generator, car TPMS decoder, car keyfoob spoofer (Subaru), Nordic NRF decoder, APRS decoder and transmitter, RSSI audio output as pitch (for direction finding), BurgerPager Spoofer, and more. </p><p>For audio RX/TX you need a TRRS (3 ring) jack plug with the Left-Right-Mic-Ground arrangement.

Quadrature signals, also called IQ signals, IQ data or IQ samples, are often used in RF applications. They form the basis of complex RF signal modulation and demodulation, both in hardware and in software, as well as in complex signal analysis. </p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/e1e529faea7da42ebc0d3c7482281688438d438bd58d75248778ff1c9ffa95d7.png"></p><p>For simplicity, you can consider that an IQ capture is a raw capture without any type of demodulation applied and that holds enough information to later be able to analyze its content and decode. Conversely, if we encode a RF signal in IQ format, it will be very easy to send it to the air.</p><p>Black Hills Infosec has a great introduction to RF Replay attacks over their blog. <a href="https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/how-to-replay-rf-signals-using-sdr/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/how-to-replay-rf-signals-using-sdr/</a></p><p>The best thing about the Portapack is that you do not need practically any RF knowledge or work to launch this attack, therefore it is very easy to check whether a system is vulnerable or not, before taking the time to analyzing the protocol in more depth.</p><p><strong>REMOTE CONTROLS</strong></p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/9622d19919fe2d8c3271835fea7fb2ccf707994339c8d3d0b433f910ca416ee7.jpeg"></p><p>Many of the remote-control systems we use today still use insecure protocols without any encryption or spread spectrum. Furthermore, systems based on fixed codes are still extensively used. That make basic wireless remote control rather easy to implement, but also utterly insecure. They are commonly used in inexpensive wireless devices to control garage doors, fans, toys and even some alarm systems.</p><p>Our Portapack supports sending command through various remote-control protocols. Among them the PT2262/PT2272. These ICs utilize fixed address codes and no inherent encryption so they are not high security devices.</p><p>PT2272 presents 4 bits of data and uses 8 bits address. Keep in mind that these are tri-state bits, so they can have low, float and high states. Capturing these codes from the air is incredibly easy with an SDR and software like rtl_433.  Addressing is often implemented with solder pads but, occasionally with jumpers and rarely with tri-state dip switches.  And a special note, as we have said the floating value (without any soldering) is totally valid and would work fine. Therefore in the world there are possibly thousands or tens of thousands  PT2272 devices installed by default where no code was configured so are working using the FFFFFF address.</p><p><strong>POCSAG</strong></p><p>A pager (also known as a beeper) is a wireless telecommunications device that receives and displays alphanumeric or voice messages. Pagers became widely used by the 1980s. In the 21st century, the widespread availability of cellphones and smartphones has greatly diminished the pager industry. Nevertheless, pagers continue to be used by some emergency services and public safety personnel, because pager systems reliability in some cases, including during natural and man-made disasters. This resilience has led public safety agencies to still adopt pagers over cellular and other commercial services for critical messaging.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/36d41b79f69415348d802e12e78e7ccc8d4922b4a522414a135a3823baa01405.png"></p><p>Although there are several protocols for Pagers the most common is POCSAG. This protocol dates from the 80s and although there are more modern alternatives, it has become the de facto standard in the industry. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/nhs-pagers-medical-health-data/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACZR9IHPYbq7SUYuzrM7Fs-IXdOi6U2iEmmte1ckW9sdBkKjXuwog8HTVBNTPTJd0gxyb-Xr68nClGiopHSYFVhgBXZbrgWOd0L88OyPaGncTCA77v55GXcwGY99gQHiwhq3H2t4vLRPViqJVlY9aoKlTfO89v6SBfTo8hNXaf9W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Pagers have been under the scrutiny of information security experts for some time now as it is common for hospital pagers to spew out unencrypted patient data into the air for anyone with a radio and computer to decode</a>.

We only need to know the Freq, RIC address and the speed expected by the destination pager. All of this information could be easly be sniffed using the POCSAG sniffer or with  HackRF running software like <a href="https://github.com/EliasOenal/multimon-ng" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Multimon-ng</a>.

<p><em>Why do we only grow certain crops in certain areas?</em></p>



<p>One observation of agriculture production is the difference in species adaptation of various places around the world: bananas grown Central America, nuts and vegetables in California, citrus fruits in Florida, apples in Washington or New York, peanuts from the Southeast, etc. The is mostly a product of economic realities and efficiency: It is easier and cheaper to manage production (of whatever) when things are located physically near each other. This isn’t unique to agriculture, as many supply chains coalesce around centralized regions (electronic device productions, automobiles, etc.). Agriculture and food production supply chain occupy a different place on humanities priority list however, and despite applying a similar ethos to essential and luxury items, there have been few catastrophic consequences from these decisions. Agriculture and the food supply chain has mostly <em>found a way</em> over the past ~100 years. It may be time to rethink or start planning for a different strategy. One possible strategy to overcome disease and pest issues that currently reduce or harm our food production systems is to <em>decentralize</em> the areas we produce many of these crops. This would potentially alleviate several problems: 1) if a pest or pathogen infests one area, the entire crop is not lost 2) transportation costs can be reduced to the consumer resulting in 3) faster delivery from harvest to consumer (thereby increasing quality and taste).</p>



<p>To be clear, decentralization is catching on in various industries (e.g. finance technology platforms), but the concept has always been baked into agriculture without much fanfare. Residents of the United States that have travelled to Hawaii may remember <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/home/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/home/" target="_blank">USDA APHIS</a> having an interest in certain plant species you may may brought along (or are trying to remove). All of that paperwork and questionnaire’s are to mitigate unintended introductions of invasive species or pathogens. One of the most economically devastating pests to harm soybean production (in the United States) is the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/disandpath/nematode/pdlessons/Pages/SoyCystNema.aspx" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/disandpath/nematode/pdlessons/Pages/SoyCystNema.aspx" target="_blank">soybean cyst nematode</a>. This pathogen was not native to the United States and was <em>introduced</em> ~75 years ago. Any mitigations to prevent its spread were ineffective due to its pathogenicity and the sheer scale of soybean production in the United States. Major rows crops such as maize, soybean, wheat, and cotton reside in a different tier regarding scale of production compared to ‘specialty’ crops (namely fruits, vegetables, nuts, spices, etc.) and are not candidates for decentralizing strategies.</p>



<p>There are several high level strategies for optimizing production and profitability of the food we eat. For example, over the past ~125 years we have been optimizing maize production for the Midwest region of the United States via technological (tractors, chemical) and scientific (adapted hybrids) means. We have been successful doing this because maize was already able to be grown in Midwest thanks to the thousands of years of gradual adaptation to the United States from a plant native to Mexico (that plant being: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2009/03/23/corn-domesticated-from-mexican-wild-grass-8700-years-ago/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2009/03/23/corn-domesticated-from-mexican-wild-grass-8700-years-ago/" target="_blank">teosinte</a>). For as ubiquitous as maize is to the Midwest region of the United States, mother nature did not produce that outcome, man did. It took a long time, but humans successfully shifted the areas of adaptation of maize and indeed many other crops to what we currently see today. Tomatoes are another good example of humans bending plants to our will: Italy <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/italy-italian-processed-tomato-overview-2018#:~:text=Italy%20is%20a%20world%20leading,more%20than%20%E2%82%AC3.1%20billion.&amp;text=Italy%20is%20both%20a%20leading%20exporter%20and%20importer%20of%20tomato%20products." data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/italy-italian-processed-tomato-overview-2018#:~:text=Italy%20is%20a%20world%20leading,more%20than%20%E2%82%AC3.1%20billion.&amp;text=Italy%20is%20both%20a%20leading%20exporter%20and%20importer%20of%20tomato%20products." target="_blank">produces around 50% of European and ~15% processed tomatoes</a> despite tomatoes not being introduced until the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery" target="_blank">Age of Discovery</a>. Bending or manipulating useful plants to grow in non-native areas is as old as farming (~10,000 BCE). Better yet, all of this adaptation was accomplished using <em>existing, </em>or native, genetic variation within their own species.</p>



<p>The theme of these examples is: ‘<em>It is possible</em>‘. With modern genomic information, we now have the tooling to do this for innumerable species. We need to start doing the same for more high value crops–namely species that are grown in geographically concentrated areas (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/graphics/orgmap.png" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/graphics/orgmap.png" target="_blank">citrus</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/rssiws/al/crop_production_maps/us/USA_Peanut_Total_Lev2_Prod.png" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/rssiws/al/crop_production_maps/us/USA_Peanut_Total_Lev2_Prod.png" target="_blank">nuts</a>, vegetables, etc.). Modern tools (genome editing, genomic sequence data, phylogeny trees, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3189332/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3189332/" target="_blank">mutagenesis</a>) could allow us to make these species adapted to more diverse growing regions via photoperiod sensitivity changes, cold tolerance, heat tolerance, altitude sensitivity, flowering time and length, growth habitat, and many more traits that define ‘adaptation’ to a given geographical unit. Many scientific studies focus on utilizing natural diversity to make production greater in <em>existing</em> areas of adaptation. This makes sense (despite being short-sighted on rare occasions): growing crops is a for-profit industry so it makes sense to harness the species that are already well-adapted to the region maximize those efficiencies. But again, food production cannot be exclusively dominated by this myopic view; after all many government would deem food supply and production as a national security topic. Clearly, the United States government acts as if they believe this to some degree as well, with heavily subsidies buoying maize, soybean, cotton, and wheat production (along with several other meat and dairy industries).</p>



<p>There are other reasons to look into decentralizing production of key species though. If we had citrus that was adapted to Kansas, Colorado, Utah, Michigan, these growing regions could avoid the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests/the-threat/citrus-greening/citrus-greening-hp" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests/the-threat/citrus-greening/citrus-greening-hp" target="_blank">citrus greening problems</a> of the Southeast United States by sheer physical isolation. To be clear this problem does not have an all or none solution. We need strategies to circumvent disease and pathogens <em>in</em> their current areas of production and even if production of most fruits, vegetables <em>could</em> be done in dozens of decentralized regions it adds overhead to research and development programs as they might have to tackle 5 small problems versus 1 big problem. These are known problems in centralized structures versus decentralized structures. Since food production has unique value to humans, it worth exploring whether the costs outweigh the benefits. Fruit species in particular are extremely perishable, so while the consumers values taste and quality, the producer and supplier values transportability and storage. If we remove the logistics of long distance transport via increasing production centers, scientists could focus on improving taste and quality.</p>



<p>An obvious argument against pursuing a decentralized strategy in specialty crops is the potential rise of indoor/vertical (and de-facto isolated) farms. This is an interesting proposition but I maintain the scale of production for many species of interest is simply too large to be handled in a cost effective manner in a indoor operation. Remember, outdoor grown crops have free energy in the sun and free nutrients from the soil. Indoor agriculture has to supply these somehow (and they are not free). That’s not to dismiss indoor agriculture as a supplementary component as it already is for several crops, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=92604" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=92604" target="_blank">as about ~25% of tomatoes non-outdoor origins</a>. I continue to maintain indoor agriculture production systems can only even be sustainable for extremely high-value, low utilization specialty crops that cannot harness outdoor production systems (think spices, niche vegetables). It should be an active goal to get fruit, vegetables, and nut production decentralized in an outdoor setting that can harness soil and sunlight that are already prevalent.</p>



<p>High level movements like this are needed in agriculture to secure the food supply and add some shock absorbers to any potential pest or pathogen disruption. There is to much technology at our fingertips to not get something going. It simply appears the marker is ignoring this segment while most of the focus remains on <em>current</em> production regions.</p>

<p>So day one went fairly smooth. Nothing too difficult to implement, as you can
expect from a first challenge. Since I’ve done some of the challenges last year
(implemented them in Go), I know that there will be a rapid ramp-up in
difficulty and that a number of challenges build “on top of each other”.
Perfect opportunities to start exploring how to write reuseable Haskell code.</p>
<p>But we’ll tackle that when the opportunity actually presents itself and not
make things more difficult than needed.</p>

<p>I will not describe the entire problem again, Advent of Code is way better at
that. But to make things simple: read numbers from a file, start at the first
number, execute an action based on the number and write the result of the
action somewhere.</p>
<p>In the first “note” (I wouldn’t call these ramblings articles) I started out
with some boilerplate by setting up the required files for Cabal, but lets not
do that this time, since I realised we don’t really need it (just yet).</p>
<p>I’ll just create a directory, create a Main.hs file and run stuff from GHCi to
get things working. In the end I’ll try to modify the program to take the input
program (intcode program) from the standard input, just as a challenge.</p>

<p>Lets get our environment setup.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">jeroen@DESKTOP:~/taoc19$ cd day2
jeroen@DESKTOP:~/taoc19/day2$ touch Main.hs
jeroen@DESKTOP:~/taoc19/day2$ ghci
GHCi, version 8.6.5: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? <span>for</span> help
Prelude&gt; :load Main.hs
<span>[</span><span>1</span> of 1<span>]</span> Compiling Main             <span>(</span> Main.hs, interpreted <span>)</span>
Ok, one module loaded.
*Main&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Great, that worked. The <code>Main.hs</code> file is still empty, but it works, no Cabal
or Stack needed to get something done. Now to open the editor from GHCi (with
<code>:edit</code> or <code>:e</code>) and start implementing this intcode machine.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">*Main&gt; :e
editor not set, use :set editor
*Main&gt; :set editor vim
*Main&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Oops, let make a mental note to actually set <code>$EDITOR</code> in my environment, guess
I don’t use it as often as thought.</p>
<p>So filling the Main.hs file with the same boilerplate as last time:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>module</span> Main <span>where</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> ()
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
        raw <span>&lt;-</span> readFile <span>"input.txt"</span>
				        print raw
</code></pre></div><p>Running the <code>main</code> function in GHCi does exactly as expected, it outputs the contents of the <code>input.txt</code> file. No big deal.</p>
<p>So after stubbing out the general outline of the program this is what I came up with:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>module</span> Main <span>where</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> ()
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
        raw <span>&lt;-</span> readFile <span>"input.txt"</span>
        <span>-- split the input up into instructions (split on ,)</span>
        <span>let</span> input <span>=</span> parseInput raw
        <span>-- run the program</span>
        <span>let</span> output <span>=</span> runProgram input
        <span>-- get the value from first position in memory</span>
        <span>let</span> solution <span>=</span> output <span>!!</span> <span>0</span>
        print solution

<span>-- parseInput takes a string as input and outputs</span>
<span>-- an array of integers</span>
<span>parseInput</span> <span>=</span> id

<span>-- runProgram takes a piece of memory and returns</span>
<span>-- the state of memory after the program has completed</span>
<span>runProgram</span> <span>=</span> id
</code></pre></div><p>So we have two high level functions to define, sounds doable.</p>
<p>First challenge is to find a way to split the input string on the comma’s
separating the individual memory values. I heard “real Haskell programmers” use
<a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/">Hoogle</a> to find the functions they are looking for
based on the type signature they think “should get the job done”.</p>
<p>Since we’re looking to split a string based on a different string, the required
type signature should look something like <code>String -&gt; String -&gt; [String]</code>. But
after <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=String+-%3E+String+-%3E+%5BString%5D&amp;scope=set%3Ahaskell-platform">searching Hoogle for
it</a> I couldn’t find anything that looks like it might do the job. Of course I could
have just searched for a function called split, or some variation of it, but I wanted
to do it “the real way"TM. Luckily, after reading an article on <a href="https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2017/5/15/untangling-haskells-strings">Monday Morning Haskell</a>
I remembered that Haskell also has a <code>Text</code> type, offering some additional string handling
abilities.</p>

<div>
	<p>
    💡 I remain blisfully unaware of other benefits of using the `Text` type, please enlighten me if you want to.
  </p>
</div>
<p>Re-running the search with <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=Text+-%3E+Text+-%3E+%5BText%5D&amp;scope=set%3Ahaskell-platform"><code>Text -&gt; Text -&gt; [Text]</code></a> yielded exactly the result I was looking for: <code>splitOn</code>. So feeding the <code>raw</code> data into <code>splitOn</code> and splitting on <code>,</code> gives us a <code>[String]</code> which we only need to convert into a <code>[Int]</code>. The <code>splitOn</code> function is included in the <code>Data.Text</code> package, so we’ll have to import that as well. But then, the <code>readFile</code> we use to load the data gives us a <code>String</code>, so we’ll have to import <code>Data.Text.IO</code> as well to be able to utilize the <code>readFile</code> function from that (all found by using Hoogle).</p>
<p>At this point, let’s reconsider our solution of using the <code>splitOn</code> function as provided by <code>Data.Text</code> and research Hoogle for a different <code>splitOn</code> function. Turns out, there is a <code>splitOn</code> variant in <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/split-0.2.3.4/docs/Data-List-Split.html#v:splitOn"><code>Data.List.Split</code></a> that is generic (i.e. it accepts anything of the type <code>Eq a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [[a]]</code>) so will probably accept a <code>String</code> as well. Let’s try it out in GHCi.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">GHCi, version 8.6.5: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? <span>for</span> help
Prelude&gt; :m + Data.List.Split
Prelude Data.List.Split&gt; splitOn <span>","</span> <span>"1,2,3,4,5"</span>
<span>[</span><span>"1"</span>,<span>"2"</span>,<span>"3"</span>,<span>"4"</span>,<span>"5"</span><span>]</span>
Prelude Data.List.Split&gt; :t splitOn <span>","</span> <span>"1,2,3,4,5"</span>
splitOn <span>","</span> <span>"1,2,3,4,5"</span> :: <span>[[</span>Char<span>]]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Awesome, we get something back that looks like a <code>[String]</code> (since a <code>String</code> is a <code>[Char]</code>). So we’ll be good to go to use this.</p>
<p>So let’s write a simple function to do this, iterate (<code>map</code>) over all the individual items and <code>read</code> them into a <code>[Int]</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- parseInput takes a string as input and outputs</span>
<span>-- an array of integers</span>
<span>-- parseInput :: String -&gt; [Int]</span>
<span>parseInput</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]
<span>parseInput</span> x <span>=</span> map read <span>$</span> splitOn <span>","</span> x
</code></pre></div><p>That takes care of getting our input ready. The second step involves a small nuance in the challenge:</p>
<pre><code>    Once you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity
    assist program (your puzzle input) to the "1202 program alarm" state it had
    just before the last computer caught fire. To do this, before running the
    program, replace position 1 with the value 12 and replace position 2 with the
    value 2. What value is left at position 0 after the program halts?
</code></pre>
<p>So we have to set the first value of the program to 12, and the second value to 2. This calls for a function
to replace a certain index in a <code>List</code>. At this point we could choose to replace the usage of <code>List</code> with <code>Data.Vector</code> which
offers this functionality by default. But for simplicity sake, let’s stay with our current solution and create a <code>replace</code> function
that takes an <code>Int</code> (the index), another <code>Int</code> (the new value) and a <code>List</code>, and returns a <code>List</code>. To build this function we use the <code>splitAt</code> function
provided by <code>Data.List.Split</code>, which we imported in the previous step anyway.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>replace</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]
<span>replace</span> i v xs <span>=</span> <span>let</span> (hxs, <span>_</span><span>:</span>txs) <span>=</span> splitAt i xs <span>in</span>
								   hxs <span>++</span> v <span>:</span> txs
</code></pre></div><p>which, when tested in GHCi, yields exactly what we want:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>[</span><span>1</span> of 1<span>]</span> Compiling Main             <span>(</span> Main.hs, interpreted <span>)</span>
Ok, one module loaded.
*Main&gt; replace <span>2</span> <span>99</span> <span>[</span>1,2,3,4,5<span>]</span>
<span>[</span>1,2,99,4,5<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So we can construct our actual program with <code>replace 1 12 $ replace 2 2 input</code>, store it in a variable and use that to run the actual program.</p>

<div>
	<p>
    💡 Turns out, `Data.List.Index` has a function called `setAt` which does EXACTLY the same as our `replace` function. Unfortunately, this is only available as an external library, so I choose not to use it.
  </p>
</div>

<p>We have a list of numbers, which somehow translates to instructions to be executed by a virtual computer, mutating memory. Sounds easy right?</p>
<p>IMO, this is actually the easy part, it involves us creating a function that takes 4 numbers from the list, applying a certain mutation to memory based on the values in those four numbers, taking the next four numbers, etc. Untill we find the number 99.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>runProgramAt</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]
<span>runProgramAt</span> pc m <span>=</span> <span>let</span> opcode <span>=</span> m <span>!!</span> pc
												left <span>=</span> m <span>!!</span> (m <span>!!</span> (pc <span>+</span> <span>1</span>))
												right <span>=</span> m <span>!!</span> (m <span>!!</span> (pc <span>+</span> <span>2</span>))
												result <span>=</span> m <span>!!</span> (pc <span>+</span> <span>3</span>)
												next <span>=</span> pc <span>+</span> <span>4</span> <span>in</span>
										<span>case</span> opcode <span>of</span>
												<span>-- 99 signals the end of the program, just return</span>
												<span>-- the entire memory</span>
												<span>99</span> <span>-&gt;</span> m
												<span>-- 1 indicates addition (left + right -&gt; result), continue</span>
												<span>-- with the next operation at pc + 4</span>
												<span>1</span> <span>-&gt;</span> runProgramAt next <span>$</span> replace result (left <span>+</span> right) m
												<span>-- 2 indicates multiplication (left * right -&gt; result), continue</span>
												<span>-- with the next operation at pc + 4</span>
												<span>2</span> <span>-&gt;</span> runProgramAt next <span>$</span> replace result (left <span>*</span> right) m
												<span>-- and to satisfy the compiler, give it a fallback case</span>
												<span>-- which just returns the entire memory and stops</span>
												otherwise <span>-&gt;</span> m
</code></pre></div><p>Now when I change my <code>runProgram</code> function to use this function to run the program starting at position 0 by changing it into
<code>runProgram = runProgramAt 0</code>, and running this from GHCi I get my correct answer:</p>

<p>Really typical, part 2 of the challenge involves us finding a set of input that yields a certain output. This reeks like a standard brute-force search. These can be done really efficiently in Haskell by using <a href="https://dev.to/awwsmm/relearn-you-a-haskell-part-2-list-comprehensions-tuples-and-types-g29">list comprehensions</a>. So probably we’ll end up with something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>findSolution</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>findSolution</span> s m <span>=</span> head [noun <span>*</span> <span>100</span> <span>+</span> verb <span>|</span> 
                    noun <span>&lt;-</span> [<span>0</span><span>..</span><span>99</span>], 
                    verb <span>&lt;-</span> [<span>0</span><span>..</span><span>99</span>], 
                    runProgram (replace <span>1</span> noun <span>$</span> replace <span>2</span> verb m) <span>!!</span> <span>0</span> <span>==</span> s]

</code></pre></div><p>When calling this function with the input supplied by the challenge:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- get the required input to complete part 2</span>
<span>let</span> nounverb <span>=</span> findSolution <span>19690720</span> input
<span>print</span> nounverb
</code></pre></div><p>it yields the correct solution, right away:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>[</span><span>1</span> of 1<span>]</span> Compiling Main             <span>(</span> Main.hs, interpreted <span>)</span>
Ok, one module loaded.
*Main&gt; main
<span>3101844</span>
<span>8478</span>
</code></pre></div><p>where the second answer is the answer for part 2. Given that I ran this in GHCi I expected it to be a bit slower, so let’s see if that’s the case:</p>
<pre><code>*Main&gt; :set +s
*Main&gt; main
3101844
8478
(1.04 secs, 3,337,885,928 bytes)
*Main&gt;
</code></pre><p>That seems about right, let’s try compiling and timing this as a standalone binary:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">jeroen@DESKTOP:~/taoc19/day2$ ghc Main.hs
<span>[</span><span>1</span> of 1<span>]</span> Compiling Main             <span>(</span> Main.hs, Main.o <span>)</span>
Linking Main ...
jeroen@DESKTOP:~/taoc19/day2$ time ./Main
<span>3101844</span>
<span>8478</span>

real    0m0.567s
user    …</code></pre></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Do the work.</p><p>That's all the productivity advice you need, and the only <em>useful</em> productivity advice you're ever going to get. You can direct your attention to a million optimizations— email, meetings, notes, calendar, time tracking, goals, todo lists, time estimates, prioritization frameworks, quantified self sensors, analytics, apps, documents, journaling. But don't. Ignore all this, and do the work. When you do the work, everything else optimizes itself.</p><p>If the only thing you must do is the work, why is there so much productivity advice? Blog posts, courses, seminars, software? Because when there is demand, there is supply. Work is hard. People will latch onto anything to avoid doing it. The market is happy to oblige.</p><p>Work means sitting down, getting through that calculus chapter, and doing the exercises. No amount of productivity hacking will make that easier. You don't need pomodoro alarms, bullet journals, time tracking apps, animated explainer videos, or different color highlighters. Everyone doesn't learn differently. Everyone learns calculus in the same way— by doing the work. You need Rudin's book, a pen, paper, and time. More tools give you negative utility. They won't make the work go faster. But they will consume as much time as you are willing to waste.</p><p>Building a new startup? Same thing. Talk to users all day. Then sit down and write the code. Get others to join you. Repeat. People do new founders a disservice by constantly proselytizing how complex startups are. In one sense they are. But in another sense they're surprisingly simple. For a long time you're doing the same three things over and over. Sell. Code. Recruit. Then do it all over again tomorrow. Startups don't get built by watching startup advice videos on YouTube. They get built by doing the work. All you need is a laptop and a metrocard.</p><p>I read a lot of biographies. People who have biographies written about them have two things in common. First, they are obsessed. Second, they never stray from doing the work. John Carmack was obsessed with game engines. Orville and Wilbur Wright were obsessed with manned flight. Leonardo da Vinci was obsessed with the structure of things. So they would code, construct, and paint. That's not to say they did no meta thinking. Carmack published plan files, the Wright brothers maintained extensive correspondence detailing their experiments, and Leonardo da Vinci is known for his magnificent notebooks. But you'd be hard pressed to find them writing letters about writing letters. They were busy doing the work.</p><p>An important ingredient for doing the work is boredom. That's how I got into programming. School was boring. We had three channels of television, and they were almost always boring. I had computer games, but I sucked at gaming and games quickly got frustrating. I read all the books that we had laying around. The only thing left was BASIC. So I started there and never stopped. The simple reason is that programming computers was the most interesting activity around.</p><p>If boredom is a necessary ingredient, then portable internet is a disaster for doing the work. How are you supposed to get excited about anything if you're never bored? I don't know if I ever would have learned to program if I had modern internet. Why would I, if something more interesting was always a click away? This is true to this day. I can't get anything done when I'm online. There is always something on the internet that's locally more interesting or more important than writing the next paragraph, or threading a flag through a series of function calls, or reading a book. The only way I can get anything done is to turn the internet off.</p><p>So I do. I have a work computer, and a router with parental controls that blocks every possible internet distraction on it. No Twitter, no Hacker News, no YouTube. Router administration is set up so I can't make changes over WiFi. If I want to unblock something, I have to physically get to the router and plug in a cable to change the settings. I power off every other device. No silent mode, no do not disturb, no hibernation. Power off. Recently a reader suggested putting my phone in a <a href="https://amzn.to/3fmBx4n">kSafe</a> (thanks Robert!) It works great, and now I’m doing that too. All this constructs enough physical barriers between me and temptation that the internet loses and my laziness wins.</p><p>Then I get properly bored. And then I do the work.</p></div></div>]]>

November 23, 2020 | https://panelbear.com/blog/tech-stack/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://panelbear.com/blog/tech-stack/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Being an engineer at heart, each time I see a company write about their tech stack, I brew a fresh cup of coffee, sit back and enjoy reading the newfound little treat.</p><p>There’s just something fascinating about getting to know what’s under the hood of other people’s businesses. It’s like gossip, but about software.</p><p>A couple of months ago I started working on <a href="https://panelbear.com/blog/why-panelbear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yet another private analytics service</a>, a project which has gone through numerous iterations, and I feel lucky that 400+ websites have already integrated with it, even though it's still in the early stages.</p><p>That’s why, in the same spirit as Jake Lazaroff’s <a href="https://jake.nyc/words/tools-and-services-i-use-to-run-my-saas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tools and Services I Use to Run My SaaS</a>, I thought it’s now my turn to do a short write up of the technologies I’m using to run this new service.</p><h2>Languages</h2><p>Over the years I have added many programming languages to my toolbelt, but for solo projects I have converged to two in particular that strike a good balance of productivity and reliability.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python</a>: Most of the backend code is in Python. Which has enabled me to ship features incredibly fast. Additionally, I use <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mypy</a> for optional type hints, which helps keep the codebase manageable.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Typescript</a>: I used to avoid working on the frontend as much as I could. That is until I discovered Typescript about 4 years ago. It just makes the whole experience a lot better, and I now use it for all my projects together with React.</p></li></ul><h2>Frameworks and libraries</h2><p>This list could have been huge, as I stand on the shoulders of giants who have published the vast amount of open-source code which I rely on. But I'd like to highlight only a handful due to their major role in the stack:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Django</a>: It's like a superpower for solo developers. The longer you work in this industry, the more you appreciate not having to reinvent the wheel for the 100th time. A monolithic framework can get you <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/web-service-efficiency-at-instagram-with-python-4976d078e366" target="_blank" rel="noopener">really</a>, <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">really</a> <a href="https://djangostars.com/blog/10-popular-sites-made-on-django/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far</a>. To me, it's about predictable software that's fast in every way that matters. In case you're interested, I talk more about this topic on <a href="https://panelbear.com/blog/boring-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Choose Boring Technology</a>.</li><li><a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React</a>: The web app for the dashboards is built using React + Webpack. After using Angular for a long time, I switched to React because it's just a pluggable view layer that doesn't get in the way. I use the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/Frojd/django-react-templatetags" target="_blank" rel="noopener">django-react-templatetags</a> to embed the React components in my Django templates.</li><li><a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextJS</a>: I use it for the landing pages, documentation and the blog which you are currently reading. It enables me to re-use various React components, and still reap the performance and SEO benefits of a statically generated site.</li><li><a href="https://docs.celeryproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celery</a>: I use it for any kind of background/scheduled tasks. It does have a learning curve for more advanced use-cases, but it's quite reliable once you understand how it works, and more importantly when it fails.</li><li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bootstrap 4</a>: I built a custom theme on top of Bootstrap. It has saved me a lot of time, and there's lots of documentation around it. That's why I picked it.</li></ul><h2>Databases</h2><p>I originally stored all data in a single SQLite database, doing backups meant making a copy of this file to an object storage like S3. At the time, it was more than enough for the small sites I tested Panelbear with. But as I added more features and websites, I needed more specialized software to support those features:</p><ul><li><a href="https://clickhouse.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clickhouse</a>: I believe this is one of those technologies that over time will become ubiquitous. It's honestly a fantastic piece of software that enabled me to build features that initially seemed impossible on low-cost hardware. I do intend to write a future blog post on some lessons learned from running Clickhouse on Kubernetes. So stay tuned!</li><li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PostgreSQL</a>: My go-to relational database. Sane defaults, battle-tested, and deeply integrated with Django. For Panelbear, I use it for all application data that is not analytics related. For the analytics data, I instead wrote a simple interface for querying Clickhouse within Django.</li><li><a href="https://redis.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redis</a>: I use it for many things: caching, rate-limiting, as a task queue, and as a key/value store with TTL for various features. Rock-solid, and great documentation.</li></ul><h2>Deployment</h2><p>I treat my infrastructure as <a href="https://joachim8675309.medium.com/devops-concepts-pets-vs-cattle-2380b5aab313" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cattle instead of pets</a>, things like servers and clusters are meant to come and go. So if one server gets "sick", I just replace it with another one. That means everything is described as code in a git repo, and I do not change things by SSH'ing into the servers. You can think of it like a template to clone my entire infrastructure with one command into any AWS region/environment.</p><p>This also helps me in case of disaster recovery. I just run a few commands, and some minutes later my stack has been re-created. This was particularly useful when I moved from DigitalOcean, to Linode, and recently to AWS. Everything is described in code, so it's easy to keep track of what components I own, even years later (all companies have some AWS IAM policy or VPC subnet lurking around which was created via clicky-clicky on the UI, and now everyone depends on it).</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terraform</a>: I manage most of my cloud infrastructure with Terraform. Things like EKS clusters, S3 buckets, roles, and RDS instances are declared in my Terraform manifests. The state is synced to an encrypted S3 bucket to avoid getting in trouble in case something happens to my development laptop.</li><li><a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker</a>: I build everything as Docker images. Even stateful components like Clickhouse or Redis are packaged and shipped as Docker containers to my cluster. It also makes my stack very portable, as I can run it anywhere I can run Docker.</li><li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes</a>: Allowed me to simplify the operational aspects tremendously. However, I wouldn’t bindly recommend it to everyone, as I already felt comfortable working with it after having the pleasure of putting down multiple production fires for my employer over the years. I also rely on managed offerings, which helps reduce the burden too.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Actions</a>: Normally I’d use <a href="https://circleci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CircleCI</a> in the past (which is also great), but for this project I prefer to use GitHub Actions as it removes yet another service which needs to have access to my repositories, and deployment secrets. However, CircleCI has plenty of good features, and I still recommend it.</li></ul><h2>Infrastructure</h2><p>I started in a single $5/mo instance in DigitalOcean, then moved to the managed Kubernetes offering as I was reinventing the wheel for a lot of things Kubernetes already gives me out of the box (service discovery, TLS certs, load balancing, log rotation, rollout, scaling, fault-tolerance, among others).</p><p>Unfortunately, I had <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/kubernetes-unable-to-connect-to-the-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reliability issues</a> with DigitalOcean's Kubernetes offering, even on larger instances. The cluster API would often go down randomly and no longer recover, this disrupted a lot of cluster services including the load balancer, which translated into downtime for me. I had to create a new cluster each time this happened, and while Terraform made it trivial, this was not something that inspired a lot of confidence about their managed service. I suspect their control plane was underprovisioned, which would be kind of understandable given the price tag.</p><p>Unfortunately I was not able to resolve the issue after several weeks. That's why I decided to move to <a href="https://www.linode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linode</a>, and had exactly 0 problems during the 1.5 month-long honeymoon that followed.</p><p>However, I recently moved once again, this time to AWS due to a pretty good deal I received. It also enabled me to use managed services like RDS to offload managing PostgreSQL, which is a big plus. What made all these migrations relatively easy, was that all my infrastructure was described via Terraform and Kubernetes manifests. The migrations essentially consisted of an evening, some tea, and patience. But that's for another post.</p><ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS</a>: Predictable, and lots of managed services. However, I use it at my full-time job, so I didn't have to spend too much time figuring things out. The main services I use are EKS, ELB, S3, RDS, IAM and private VPCs. I might also add Cloudfront and Kinesis in the future.</li><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare</a>: I mainly use it for DDoS protection, serving DNS, and offloading edge caching of various static assets (currently shaves off 80% of the egress charges from AWS - their bandwidth pricing is insane!).</li><li><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let’s Encrypt</a>: Free SSL certificate authority. I use cert-manager in my Kubernetes cluster to automatically issue and renew certificates based on my ingress rules.</li><li><a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Namecheap</a>: My domain name registrar of choice. Allows MFA for login which is an important security feature. Unlike other registrars, they haven't surprised me with an expensive renewal every few years. I like them.</li></ul><h2>Kubernetes components</h2><p>The following components automate most of the devops work for me. I use several others too, but some of the main ones I use are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ingress-nginx</a>: Rock-solid ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX as a reverse proxy, and load balancer. Sits behind the NLB which controls ingress to the cluster nodes.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cert-manager</a>: Automatically issue/renew TLS certs as defined in my ingress rules.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">external-dns</a>: Synchronizes exposed Kubernetes Services and Ingresses with DNS providers (such as Cloudflare).</li><li><a href="https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prometheus-operator</a>: Automatically monitors most of my services, and exposes dashboards via Grafana.</li><li><a href="https://fluxcd.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flux</a>: GitOps way to do continuous delivery in Kubernetes. Basically pulls and deploys new Docker images when I release them.</li></ul><h2>CLI tools</h2><p>There’s plenty here, but frequently used include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kubectl</a>: To interact with the Kubernetes cluster to watch logs, pods and services, SSH into a running container, and so on.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/wercker/stern" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stern</a>: Multi pod log tailing for Kubernetes. Really handy.</li><li><a href="https://htop.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">htop</a>: Interactive system process viewer. Better than “top” if you ask me.</li><li><a href="https://curl.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cURL</a>: Issue HTTP requests locally, inspect headers.</li><li><a href="https://httpie.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTTPie</a>: Like cURL, but simpler for JSON APIs.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/rakyll/hey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hey</a>: Load testing HTTP endpoints. Gives a nice latency distribution summary.</li></ul><h2>Monitoring</h2><ul><li><a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prometheus</a>: Efficient storage of time series data for monitoring. Tracks all the cluster and app metrics. It was a lot cheaper than using Cloudwatch for app metrics.</li><li><a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grafana</a>: Nice dashboards for the Prometheus monitoring data. All dashboards are described in JSON files and versioned in the …</li></ul></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jamstack is a new architectural approach with the core principle of pre-rendering aiming to make web applications to:</p>
<ul>
<li>run faster,</li>
<li>be more secure,</li>
<li>be easier to scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that achieved with the use of many modern tools to bring productivity to the maximum. Sounds interesting right? This approach is gaining a lot of popularity which makes a market for new tooling supporting the Jamstack approach. RedwoodsJS is one of the new shining stars, its team believes that JAMstack is a huge leap forward in web development and they are doing their best to make it even more pleasant to work with.</p>
<h2>RedwoodJS</h2>
<p>Redwood is an open-source project initiated by <strong>Tom Preston-Werner, the co-founder of GitHub &amp; creator of Jekyll</strong> - one of the first static site generators. So what is Redwood?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Imagine a React frontend, statically delivered by CDN, that talks via GraphQL to your backend running on AWS Lambdas around the world, all deployable with just a git push—that’s Redwood.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>RedwoodJS is a highly opinionated, full-stack, serverless web application framework that aims to make building and deploying JAMstack apps as easy as possible. </p>
<h2>The stack</h2>
<p>RedwoodJS uses some of the most popular cutting-edge technologies and by giving up the freedom of choosing your tech stack, you are gaining a significant reduction of the level of complexity of setting up all services to make your infrastructure work as intended:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frontend</strong> - this part is covered by React supported by Apollo and it has a lot of code generators involved which let you create everything i.e. routes, pages, cells (even with already pre-configured tests) out of the box.</li>
<li><strong>Backend</strong> - it’s becoming difficult to talk about cutting-edge technologies without putting GraphQL into the equation. Redwood uses Prisma for its GraphQL backend, enabling quick creation of backends with graphical interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong> - Redwood’s development team has support for several deployment targets on their roadmap with a top-priority to make deployment strategies in a way that makes it easy for additional targets to be added, as well as to make it easy to adjust to user’s own deployment strategy. Right now it offers out of the box deployment to Netlify and Vercel, with AWS and Google Cloud Run high on their road map.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Concepts &amp; features</h2>
<p>Redwood features a lot of new interesting concepts as well as brings a breath of fresh air to well-known ones. One of the most interesting ones are definitely:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cells</strong> - they are one of the signature modes of abstraction in Redwood. Cells represent a declarative approach to data fetching which creates space (by providing conventions around data fetching) in between the request and the response which Redwood can utilize to perform its optimizations. All of this without writing a line of imperative code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Not a 1.0 version</h2>
<p>RedwoodJS software has not reached a stable version 1.0 yet.
Its team put Redwood in the later stages of the “make it work” phase in the “make it work; make it right; make it fast” paradigm. Although this makes it not suitable for production use, Redwood is a concept that is definitely worth following.</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs. Our all-in-one development environment for GraphQL will help you build, manage &amp; deploy your GraphQL API much faster thanks to dozens of built-in micro features. Its graphical interface will also fix communication within your product team. Visualization is the key!</p></div>]]>

As you can see I have this blog: <a href="https://paulie.dev/">https://paulie.dev</a> and a commercial portfolio: <a href="https://www.pauliescanlon.io/">https://www.pauliescanlon.io</a></p><p>Both sites are built on top of my Gatsby theme: <a href="https://gatsby-theme-terminal.netlify.app/">gatsby-theme-terminal</a> which is Open source and can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-theme-terminal">GitHub</a></p><p>Using a Gatsby Theme solves one of my issues as I'm able to have two sites that look and work pretty much the same way and any changes I make to the theme are inherited by both my sites. It's kind of like managing your own multi brand design system, but just for yourself.</p><p>There was one other problem though. 🤔</p><p>I wanted both sites to have the same "intro" section, but every time I made a change to one I had to make the same change to the other site to ensure they were both displaying the same intro text.</p><p>This might be fine if I weren't a developer but doing something twice is one time too many IMO.</p><p>It was also a little frustrating because I also wanted my Twitter profile description to be in sync with both the sites so, again another place to remember to update my personal blurb.</p><p>One option I considered would have been to hook up a Content Management System, and this would have been fine and it would have kept both my sites in sync but it wouldn't have been able to update my Twitter profile blurb...</p><p>So, I've decided to reverse engineer the Twitter API and use that as a CMS to populate both my sites. The idea is quite simple. I'll use the Twitter profile description as though it were a field from a CMS. Naturally any changes I make to this will appear on my Twitter profile and below is how I pull that same info into both of my sites.</p><h2>Demo</h2><p>Here's what I'll be showing you how to build:</p><ul><li>App / API <a href="https://gatsby-netlify-twitter.netlify.app/">https://gatsby-netlify-twitter.netlify.app</a></li><li>GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-netlify-twitter">https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-netlify-twitter</a></li></ul><p>... but the actual API I use for my blog and site is here: <a href="https://paulie-api.netlify.app/">https://paulie-api.netlify.app</a></p><h2>Tech</h2><h3>Netlify Functions</h3><p>"Power your site without managing servers" is how Netlify describe Functions and for all intents and purposes thats exactly what they are. Similar to how you might create an <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> app and deploy it somewhere but without the hassle of having to setup server side environments and more crucially any really dweeby server uptime monitoring.</p><h3>Twitter API v2</h3><p>A set of endpoints that can be used to get data from Twitter. Any Twitter requests must be done server side and use a set of keys and tokens. You can't unfortunately hit the Twitter API from the browser so we need a "server" or as mentioned above, a Netlify Function</p><p>Using both of the above i've made my own API endpoint which goes off and hits the Twitter API and returns my Profile information which I can then display in the intro section of my blog and site. I've deployed this API to Netlify and it's completely de-coupled from either of my sites but will return data which can be fetched from client side "fetch" request from within my site and blog. That url again is here: <a href="https://paulie-api.netlify.app/">https://paulie-api.netlify.app</a></p><h2>Before we start</h2><p>Before we get started there's a couple of things you'll need to have in place.</p><h3>Twitter API v2</h3><p>Apply for access to the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api">Twitter API</a>.

                    <p>Game design is such a wide and varied discipline that job titles in the field have become increasingly granular over the years – and ever since we started working on our debut title Lacuna, I've become more and more convinced that "detective game designer" merits its own denomination as well. Detective gameplay (or "investigation gameplay") poses a number of unique challenges centered around two main problems: the <strong>struggle between story and puzzles</strong> (or "cases") as well as <strong>communication between the player and the game</strong>.</p>
<p>Since some of the explanations will be using our own game as an example, let me give you a quick rundown: Lacuna is a story-driven adventure with platformer controls and investigation elements. Its four fundamental gameplay types are dialogs (with choices), moving around, examining objects, and solving puzzles. All of them are staples of the point &amp; click genre, but their execution is quite unique; I don't want to go into more detail here because it's not pertinent to the topic, but you can <a href="http://lacuna.game/">check out the game on Steam</a> if you want to know more.</p>
<p><img alt="Gameplay" src="https://digitales.games/user/pages/03.blog/detective-game-design-problems/gameplay-movement.gif"><br>
<em>This is what the game looks like</em></p>
<h2>Story vs. puzzles</h2>
<p>A handful of abstract game design principles lie at Lacuna's core. For instance, "no takebacks" dictates that the player only get one shot at every decision, dialog, and puzzle. The game auto-saves and doesn't allow you to go back if you performed poorly or regret an earlier decision. There's also "limited feedback", which means that the player often isn't told immediately whether a solution was correct and what the consequences of their actions and decisions will be.</p>
<p>However, there's one in particular I want to highlight here because it concerns the above mentioned divide between story and puzzling in detective games: <strong>No getting stuck.</strong></p>
<p>The thought process behind it was simple: In games with both a story and puzzles (e.g. most P&amp;C games), story progress is almost always tied directly to puzzle progress. Until you solve the puzzle at hand, you don't get to see the next part of the story. For some players, especially those most interested in the story, this can become a problem. If they're stuck for too long, there's a chance they'll just drop out and never pick the game up again. Even if that doesn't happen, hard puzzles always run the risk of messing up the story's pacing and interrupting your immersion in the game – because you're becoming frustrated or, even worse, because you decide to tab out and Google the solution. To avoid people getting stuck, we considered a number of solutions:</p>
<p><strong>Solution 1: Make the puzzles very easy?</strong><br>
This isn't our favorite since it somewhat defeats the purpose of puzzles. They'd still play a role as a change of pace now and then, but if puzzles aren't a little hard, nobody will feel like a detective solving them. Some early puzzles in Lacuna are easy, but most aren't.</p>
<p><strong>Solution 2: Provide hints?</strong><br>
Hint systems can be found in many adventures featuring puzzles. Unfortunately, they often take the player out of the experience in one of three ways: In some cases, the hint is provided by extradiegetic UI (e.g. in the pause menu) and therefore seems to come out of nowhere in the game world. In other cases, the player character is the one giving the hint, disconnecting the player from their avatar’s perspective. The third option of NPCs providing hints is a little better; however, it is often hard to justify <em>why</em> an NPC would be able to point the player in the right direction without possessing the rest of the solution to the ongoing puzzle (and why they didn't volunteer it in the first place). The two types of (sort-of) hint systems we went with in Lacuna are <em>Highlight Mode</em>, which displays optional outlines around objects and NPCs that hold new information, and <em>redundant information</em>, meaning that sometimes the player is given two ways of obtaining an important clue.</p>
<p><img alt="Hints" src="https://digitales.games/user/pages/03.blog/detective-game-design-problems/solutions-hints.png"><br>
<em>"YOU ARE PLAYING A GAME RIGHT NOW"</em></p>
<p><strong>Solution 3: Decouple story progress from puzzle progress?</strong><br>
Why not simply make a story-driven game throughout which the player can solve the occasional puzzle if they feel like it? Well, because it would require that puzzles be somewhat detached from the story. As a result, they run the risk of feeling meaningless since solving them is not rewarding and failing is not punishing. However, this <em>can</em> work quite well when combined with...</p>
<p><strong>Solution 4: Make branching content for different solutions?</strong><br>
Instead of impeding the player’s progress, wrong or missing puzzle solutions could lead to a less desirable continuation and/or outcome of the story. Unfortunately, creating a new story branch for each and every wrong solution to a puzzle is hardly feasible. However, there are less extreme ways of realizing this. For instance, the game could account for the player’s <em>overall</em> puzzling performance at certain points in the game, e.g. trigger the “good” finale to an act if they got more than x% of the puzzles right, and the “bad” one if not. There could also be cascading consequences of sorts, e.g. solving one case correctly may give the player an edge in a later one. These approaches have similar downsides as optional puzzles do, but to a lesser degree; puzzle success no longer being required for progress makes them feel more detached from the story and removes immediate feedback. Regardless, we have found this to be the best solution, which is why we employ it quite a bit in Lacuna (while trying to avoid all the pitfalls). By the way, if all of this is becoming too abstract for you, bear with us! The second half of this post is all about a real example from the game.</p>
<p><img alt="Detroit: Become Human" src="https://digitales.games/user/pages/03.blog/detective-game-design-problems/solutions-branching-content.jpg"><br>
<em>Detroit: Become Human offers an astonishing number of different outcomes depending on player action, but not everybody has that kind of money to burn</em></p>
<p>Despite all of these measures being taken to make sure that the player won't get stuck, Lacuna can still be called a hard game. While it's not difficult to get <em>to</em> the end, it's pretty difficult to get a <em>good</em> ending and not mess things up on your way there. In other words, rushing through the whole story is possible if you don't mind bringing it to a terrible conclusion.</p>
<h2>Communicating with the game</h2>
<p>While the previous chapter only concerns detective games that also prominently feature a story, this next one is relevant to pretty much every detective game every made. It addresses the topic of communication between the player and the game, and especially how the player can express their thoughts to it. Several principles have proven to make for a good experience across countless approaches to this problem over the years:</p>
<p><strong>Principle 1: Many channels out, few channels back in.</strong><br>
If the game conveys information to the player on many different channels and in many different ways, the process of piecing the solution together tends to feel more interesting and rewarding. In Lacuna, the player picks up clues from dialogs, objects, environments, the news, and e-mails (with all sorts of attachments). At the same time, the channels via which the player communicates that solution back to the game are kept to a minimum, namely cloze texts we like to call "Case Sheets" and (to a lesser degree) dialog choices. Having one or two central mechanics for player input makes the experience more coherent and transparent and facilitates designing the mysteries around it.</p>

<em>Return of the Obra Dinn by Lucas Pope provides a bunch of different sources of information, but just one central mechanic for the player to communicate back to the game</em></p>
<p><strong>Principle 2: Have the player communicate only the solution.</strong><br>
It is near impossible to create a system through which the player communicates to the game <em>how</em> they arrived at a solution. Luckily, this is not necessary. A well-designed puzzle provides all the information, then moves the entire solution process solely <em>into the player’s head</em>, and finally prompts the player to input only their answer. The player’s objective should be stated clearly, but in a very general way at the start of a case (e.g. “find the culprit”).</p>
<p><strong>Principle 3: Give the player maximum freedom in communicating the solution.</strong><br>
The way in which the player communicates the answer to the game is the most crucial part to get right. One aspect is to give the player many choices (or a large combination of choices) to pick from. Two things should be avoided: 1. Giving the player a high probability to succeed by picking a random answer. 2. Making it easy for the player to guess correctly because only one or a few of the available answers appear plausible. An example for a bad solution like this would be to give the player three dialog choices to solve the puzzle; even worse would be if one of them obviously made the most sense. A better approach would be to give the player a cloze text with a bunch of plausible options for each gap. Another possibility is to have the solution be an unguessable string of characters that the player needs to enter manually. Both ideas utilize combinatorial explosion to make guessing and brute-forcing nearly impossible.</p>

<em>Good luck brute-forcing your way through Detective Grimoire's cloze texts</em></p>
<h2>Puzzle example</h2>
<p>Hopefullly all this will become crystal clear when put to concrete use! The following is an early level in Lacuna. It doesn't contain some of the difficulties added later (like a large number of channels communicating potential evidence). In harder cases, the player will need to have paid attention to testimonies, news articles etc. from earlier levels to arrive at the correct conclusion, and some cases span multiple levels. Not this one, though; all the information required to solve it is directly contained in the clues and dialogs of the one level where it starts and ends.</p>
<p>This chapter won't reveal much of importance about the story, but it will spoil the solution to this one puzzle, so consider yourself warned.</p>

<p>Exactly-once is a desirable (if not critical) message delivery guarantee and a remarkably complex engineering challenge to solve. In this blog post, we will look at what exactly-once means in the context of distributed pub/sub systems, and the exactly-once guarantees that the <a href="https://www.ably.io/">Ably</a> realtime pub/sub messaging platform provides. Ably often acts as the broker in data streaming pipelines: publishers send messages to our platform, and we deliver these messages to subscribers. As a broker, Ably provides regional &amp; global fault tolerance, which ensures message availability and survivability. We also offer a set of capabilities via SDKs that enable clients to use idempotent publishing, and recover in the event of a failure while resuming precisely where they left off, with no lost or duplicate messages.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/11/4-pillars-exactly-once-semantics-cover.png"></figure><h2 id="exactly-once-delivery-is-one-of-the-hardest-engineering-challenges">Exactly-once delivery is one of the hardest engineering challenges<br>
</h2>
<p>In the context of distributed <a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/pub-sub">pub/sub</a> systems, exactly-once is a popular concept and a desirable, if not critical, system property. It also leads to confusion and diverging opinions within the development community. On the one hand, some argue that <a href="https://bravenewgeek.com/you-cannot-have-exactly-once-delivery/">exactly-once is simply unachievable.</a> On the other hand, there are systems such as <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#semantics">Kafka that claim to support exactly-once semantics</a>. </p>
<p>We believe that a lot of the confusion around the concept has to do with the fact that there's no clear definition of what exactly-once actually means. It's arguably impossible to come up with a definition to satisfy everyone and every use case. That's because exactly-once can mean different things for different systems and different use cases. Regardless of how you look at it, though, exactly-once is, without a doubt, a distinctively complex engineering challenge. </p>
<p>Let’s now define what exactly-once means for Ably in particular. In our case, exactly-once is a guarantee that once acknowledged, a message published to Ably is <strong>delivered</strong> to a consumer precisely once, even in the context of individual system components failing. Note that most often, Ably is used to deliver messages in real time directly to end-user devices.</p>
<p>It’s crucial to mention that exactly-once is a system-wide property, and you only achieve it if all the constituent components play their part. This doesn’t mean that all the components must display exactly-once characteristics. For example, in our case, you can have a publisher that displays at-least-once behaviour. However, Ably provides an idempotent interface, which cancels out the fact that the producer may occasionally publish messages more than once. As long as at the other end of the pub/sub pipeline each message is delivered to subscribers precisely once, exactly-once behaviour is achieved as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-messaging-semantics">Types of messaging semantics<br>
</h3>
<p>Before we dive deeper into exactly-once delivery, let’s review the main types of messaging semantics. When a system is fully operational and working as intended, exactly-once delivery is the behaviour you generally expect. However, we must also consider how faults in the pub/sub system or, indeed, clients affect this behaviour. While most components fail independently in a distributed pub/sub system, without directly impacting other components, the overall quality of service can be affected. Depending on how the system behaves when failures do occur, you get several different types of messaging semantics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>At-most-once semantics</strong>. The easiest type of semantics to achieve, from an engineering complexity perspective, since it can be done in a fire-and-forget way. There's rarely any need for the components of the system to be stateful. While it's the easiest to achieve, at-most-once is also the least desirable type of messaging semantics. It provides no absolute message delivery guarantees since each message is delivered once (best case scenario) or not at all.</li>
<li>
<strong>At-least-once semantics. </strong>This is an improvement on at-most-once semantics. There might be multiple attempts at delivering a message, so at least one attempt is successful. In other words, there's a chance messages may be duplicated, but they can't be lost. While not ideal as a system-wide characteristic, at-least-once semantics are good enough for use cases where duplication of data is of little concern, or scenarios where deduplication is possible on the consumer side.</li>
<li>
<strong>Exactly-once semantics</strong>. The ultimate message delivery guarantee and the optimal choice in terms of data integrity. As its name suggests, exactly-once semantics means that each message is delivered precisely once. The message can neither be lost nor delivered twice (or more times). Exactly-once is by far the most dependable message delivery guarantee. It’s also the hardest to achieve.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/11/exactly-once-semantics-messaging-semantics-overview.gif" alt="Overview of message delivery semantics: at-most-once delivery, at-least-once delivery, exactly-once delivery."><figcaption>High-level overview of message delivery semantics</figcaption></figure><p>What most distributed pub/sub systems can genuinely guarantee is <strong>mostly-once </strong>delivery. This means that when the system is functioning as intended, messages are delivered exactly once. However, when failures are involved, there’s always a chance some messages will be delivered either at-most-once or at-least-once.</p>
<h3 id="failures-that-prevent-exactly-once-delivery">Failures that prevent exactly-once delivery<br>
</h3>
<p>To demonstrate just how hard it is for distributed <a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/pub-sub">pub/sub</a> systems to achieve exactly-once semantics, we must talk about failures—specifically, components that can fail and how these failures can be mitigated.<br></p>
<p><strong>Publisher failure</strong></p>
<p>When a publisher fails, some sort of recovery process takes place. Depending on its design, after recovery, the publisher may reattempt to publish a message that has already been sent to and acknowledged by the broker. In such an event, the publisher failure causes at-least-once behaviour. Another scenario is that the publisher’s recovery procedure fails to realise that the publish attempt failed, which leads to at-most-once behaviour. </p>
<p>A strategy often used after a publish failure is to retry publishing the same message a fixed number of times. This is a pragmatic approach, but unsatisfactory in the context of exactly-once. Imagine that the publisher recovers and unsuccessfully tries to republish the same message five times, and then gives up. Practically none of the three semantics is achieved. To mitigate publisher failures Ably supports <a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/idempotency">idempotent publishing</a>, which ensures that regardless of how many times the same message is published to Ably, it will be delivered to subscribers exactly-once. <br></p>
<p><strong>Broker failure</strong></p>
<p>A broker failure has the potential to lead to all sorts of issues, including data loss. That’s why it’s recommended to design your system around the idea of mitigating or preventing loss of data. From a producer perspective, this could mean having the ability to publish messages at-least-once, so they can be resent to the broker if needed. </p>
<p>From a broker perspective (Ably included), let’s start by reviewing what a message ACK means. Obviously, it’s an acknowledgment that a published message has been received. Additionally, it should also imply that no subsequent failure will result in that message not being delivered to subscribers. In other words, it should be an acknowledgment that the broker provides sufficient redundancy to ensure continuity of service and onwards processing, even in the context of multiple infrastructure failures. Of course, nothing can be done to prevent or mitigate certain types of critical failures. When that happens, the sensible thing for the broker to do is to respond with a failure response (with HTTP, this is typically a 5xx status code), indicating clearly to the producer that the publish attempt was unsuccessful. </p>
<p><strong>Subscriber failure</strong></p>
<p>The most common subscriber failure that prevents exactly-once delivery involves short disconnections. For example, a client app on a mobile device will disconnect and quickly reconnect when the user switches from a mobile data network to a Wi-Fi network or goes through a tunnel. To counter this scenario and ensure exactly-once behaviour, the stream of messages must resume precisely where it left off when the subscriber recovers. For this to be possible, the connection state must be persisted and resynced when the subscriber reconnects.</p>
<p>If the broker is the one keeping track of the last message sent, you are unlikely to provide exactly-once semantics. That’s because a broker might send a message, and the subscriber might successfully receive it and then disconnect before sending an ACK to the broker. In such a case, once the subscriber reconnects, the broker will resend the respective message (at-least-once semantics) since it has no way of knowing that the subscriber had received it before disconnecting.</p>
<p>To ensure exactly-once behaviour, the responsibility of keeping track of the last message received should sit with the subscriber - something we also do at Ably, via serial numbers. This way, when the subscriber reconnects, it notifies the broker of the last message it has received so that the stream can be accurately resumed from a point in time.</p>

<p>In the world of distributed pub/sub systems, exactly-once semantics has been and continues to be extremely hard to achieve. Equally, almost everywhere you look in software development, exactly-once is a highly desirable system-wide property, if not an essential one. For example, exactly-once is crucial for most transactional messaging use cases. At its core, a transactional message is triggered by a consumer action, and it usually includes necessary or high-priority info, e.g., a bank balance inquiry or an order confirmation. </p>
<p>Ordered operations represent another use case where exactly-once is fundamental. Let’s say you want to use <a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/message-delta-compression/">delta compression</a> to only stream changes from the previous message to subscribers each time there’s an update. To achieve this, you need to use a transport that ensures data integrity through guaranteed message ordering and exactly-once semantics.</p>
<p>If not crucial, exactly-once is at least highly desirable, because it improves overall system predictability and provides better experiences to users in general. For example, …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>Halbert W. Hall Speaker’s Series on Science Fiction and Fantasy,&nbsp;Texas A&amp;M University</p>
<p>February 2, 2018</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vZQXkxJ9FVwCmhHZTBGkuxMHGF8hoWK_">Full Audio</a></p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Thank you so much to Texas A&amp;M for hosting me, and especially to the Science Fiction Archivist, Jeremy Brett, who invited me and orchestrated everything. He’s been a supporter of my work for years, and I’m so delighted to finally meet him, and to have the chance to address all of you. I’d also like to thank TAMU Libraries, the Glasscock Center for Humanities Research and its Science Fiction Studies Working Group, the Department of English, the Department of International Studies, and the Department of Visualization. I’m so honored by such an intersectional effort to bring me here. So thank you.</p>
<p>As Jeremy said, I write a lot of things, but when people ask me what I am, the first thing I say is that I’m a science fiction writer. I gave Jeremy a name for this talk before I wrote any of it, because I was still finishing my next novel. It’s called <em>The Actual Star. </em>It’s taken me six years to write. My agent is reading it as we speak. It jumps back and forth from the distant past, during the collapse of ancient Maya civilization; to the present, specifically the year 2012; to the far future, when a new global religion has brought lasting peace to humankind. So I spent a lot of the past year in the year 3012, in my head, imagining what the world will look like a thousand years from now. I want to talk to you about it because, like all science fiction, even though it’s set in the future, it’s a response to our present moment. My talk is called “Instructions for the Age of Emergency,” which is the time period we’re living in right now. In the far future, there are entire fields of study devoted to it, and to the people who lived in it, and what we must have been thinking.</p>
<p>During the last year, I locked myself out of social media for months at a time. I had to concentrate on work and, to be honest, protect my mental health after the election. I only read <em>The Washington Post</em> on my phone in bed in the morning—I still do—and that was enough. Everything I read, I asked myself, “How did we get here? What are the root causes? How can things be different?” And then I would try to answer those questions in the day’s writing.</p>
<p>The possibility I wanted to explore is that things didn’t start going astray after 9/11, or because of Nixon, or with the Industrial Revolution, or even with the invention of race that enabled the Native American genocide and the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. I wanted to explore the possibility that humanity lost its way in the Neolithic Era. We regard the Neolithic as the beginning of history, and if we mean written history, maybe. But humans lived for two hundred thousand years before that—before the fall of Troy, before permanent settlements, before the invention of surplus and property and money and agriculture. All of that is only about twelve thousand years old, or, 6% of our history. The fact that we don’t have newspapers from the other 94% of our history doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. It also doesn’t make it any less important when thinking about the range of human possibility, and the range of possible human futures.</p>
<p>Much of science fiction deals with imagining dystopia. I’ll talk about why that is later, but I strongly believe that, at this moment in time, we need to remember that one of the highest callings of science fiction is imagining utopia. I don’t mean starry-eyed visions of a fairyland that drops out of the sky. I also don’t mean a static society built on some fundamental irony like panopticon or the suppression of free will. I mean honest, earnest engagement with the question of what a better world looks like.</p>
<p>In the <em>Earthseed </em>trilogy, Octavia Butler’s characters go through hell in their struggle to establish a utopian community. In the <em>Mars </em>trilogy, Kim Stanley Robinson’s characters go through several revolutions and constitutions in building a better world than the one they came from (Earth). Ursula K. Le Guin—who died while I was composing this talk—is the leader of us all in this regard. Her work engages the idea of realistic utopia over and over again—through Hain, Anarres, Gethen, Earthsea, and of course, Omelas.</p>
<p>My novel <em>The Actual Star </em>is an attempt to work in that same tradition. The distant past—the collapse of Maya civilization—takes place amid the failure of monarchy. The present—our age, the “Age of Emergency”—takes place amid the failure of capitalism. So, what does the year 3012 look like? I’ll first describe it, and then describe how I got there, extrapolating from this moment in time.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>In 3012, the world operates by the twin philosophy of accumulation and dispersion. Put as simply as possible, The Law of Accumulation states that accumulation of any human property ultimately leads to human suffering. For example, accumulation of capital leads to inequality. Accumulation of family ties leads to feuds. Accumulation of feuds leads to war. Accumulation of population leads to disease. Accumulation of territory and power leads to war. Not necessarily at first, or even for centuries—but eventually, always.</p>
<p>The antidote is the Law of Dispersion. Put as simply as possible, it states that lasting peace can only result from the constant temporal and spatial dispersion of all human properties. In other words, we build a society that flows with, not against, the entropic nature of the universe.</p>
<p>In 3012, there are no borders. There are no nations. There are no families, aside from the human family. We call every other person “carnala,” a Mexican Spanish term meaning “a blood relation.” The average life expectancy is 130 years. The world population is steady at one billion. We roam the earth as permanent nomads, and, by common agreement, only own as much as we can carry—this is why the system is called Laviaja, a feminized form of “El Viaje,” Spanish for “the journey.” Those of us who cannot move or walk are accommodated so radically by mutual aid, artificial intelligence, and augmented reality that the very concept of disability no longer exists. In fact, many of us <em>choose </em>to have what we think of as disabilities, and call them “gifts,” because they are ways of creating community.</p>
<p>We eat primarily by foraging, a practice now aided by advanced artificial intelligence and augmented reality. No one eats animals, since we began learning their languages. Where there isn’t much to be foraged, our photosynthetic skin takes over. When we want home-cooked food, we go to a wayhouse. Wayhouses are places where we can rest for up to a period of nine days, in exchange for a few hours of work a day. We gather for two daily meals plus, in many areas of the world, teatime. Agribots—farming robots—do the majority of farming and gardening, strictly on a subsistence basis, near wayhouses. In other words, no one goes hungry. Food security is simply not an issue. This is because, at a certain point, around the 23<sup>rd</sup> century, all technology was built to serve humankind, not profit.</p>
<p>None of us stay in the same place for more than nine days. None of us even stay with the same people for more than nine days. But whomever we lose, we regain. With whomever we meet on the road, we fall into any number of familiar roles—sister and sister, lover and lover, mother and child, aunt and niece, elder and youth—and one of the greatest joys of life is that dance of discovery, of what each new person is to the other. If we give birth, we gladly give up our baby within nine days; assured that our child will come back to us again and again in the form of other children, throughout our lives.</p>
<p>There is no space travel, since space programs were dependent on capitalism. There are aliens, but they’re so far away that we have to wait a few hundred years every time we want to say anything, so it doesn’t affect our lives very much. There are no weapons; the very idea is strange. Crime is very rare; when it does happen, in the worst cases, the crime is made public and the perpetrator is marked for others to see and avoid if they wish, but the criminal is still allowed free movement in the world. Their exile is social.</p>
<p>There’s no currency or system of money; there’s a worldwide, perpetual gift exchange. Objects have no value beyond their practical use; a plastic bowl is as good as a porcelain bowl. There’s no manufacturing because there’s no need for material goods. Everything is used on a recycled basis.</p>
<p>There are approximately fifteen hundred genders. Anyone who wants to bear a child can do so. No pregnancy is unplanned. There’s no correlation between genitalia and gender. Some of the genders are in fact the descendants of nationalist and ethnic identities, as there have long ceased to be nations or ethnic groups in any meaningful way, given the Law of Dispersion. Identity is completely voluntary and mutable.</p>
<p>The system of government, such as it is, is a worldwide sortition democracy, which is actually a very old form of democracy. A legislature is randomly selected from a pool of all available citizens, from the age of seven years old. This legislature is in session twenty-four hours a day, its members refreshed every hour, on the hour, mostly just to re-ratify a basic Bill of Rights, but also to take up whatever special questions apply on the global scale. As a citizen, you’re called to serve for about one hour every year or two. For local matters, moving clusters of people are governed by algorithms called “umbrellas” that take into account each person’s needs and preferences. An umbrella may govern a single wayhouse, or an area of a hundred square kilometers, depending on the number of people present, which is always changing.</p>
<p>A person can opt out of this system. They aren’t punished. They aren’t banned. They’re never refused food or shelter, care or companionship, wherever they go. The highest law is the rule of the road, which is radical …</p></div></div>

	<h3>Facebook is facing a new wave of criticism for providing a platform for a white supremacist network with over 80,000 online followers.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Facebook only removed these pages after being contacted by large media organisation the <em>Observer</em>. The Center for Countering Digital Hate claim they were made aware of this two years ago.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Guardian reports this Neo-Nazi network also has ties to the UK far right, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/22/facebook-condemned-for-hosting-neo-nazi-network-with-uk-links" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including a student facing terrorism charges</a>. Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;“Facebook’s leadership endangered public safety by letting Neo-Nazis finance their activities through Facebook and Instagram. Facebook was first told about this problem two years ago and failed to act.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the <em>Observer</em> contacted Facebook, they began taking down the material with a Facebook spokesperson stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have removed the content which violates our policies prohibiting dangerous organisations. We regularly work to improve our technology to find and remove this content faster, and, while there is more work to do, we are making progress. We’ve banned over 250 white supremacist organisations from Facebook and Instagram.”</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>On our first set of data structures, we get into the definition and scope of non-primitive structures. Have a look at the previous read on  <a target="_blank" href="https://thegreencodes.com/the-power-of-data-structures">The Power of Data structures</a> in case you feel a little lost. Right off the batt, we define what it means to be a non-primitive set, and how this can be further broken down.</p>
<p>Let's get right into it. A non-primitive structure is what happens when you combine two or more primitives. What we mean is simple. A <code>char</code> and  <code>int</code> , for instance,  are primitives. The simplest representations of data. </p>
<p>Broadly speaking, linear non-primitives can be grouped further as below:</p>
<h2 id="linear-non-primitives">Linear non-primitives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stacks</li>
<li>Queues</li>
<li>LInked lists</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, as stated before, data is sequential - one after another. Some of these structures might <a target="_blank" href="https://thegreencodes.com/memory-management-deep-and-shallow-copying">ring a bell</a>, stackify, is that you?. </p>
<h3 id="arrays">Arrays</h3>
<p>These are what we call stores of homogenous (meaning similar) data. So one might have an array like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>my_array</span> = [<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>5</span>,<span>6</span>,<span>7</span>,<span>8</span>,<span>9</span>] 

<span>vowels</span> = [<span>' a'</span>, <span>'e'</span>, <span>'i'</span> , <span>'o'</span>, <span>'u'</span> ] 
</code></pre><p>Note how <code>my_array</code> has only integers while <em>vowels</em> has <em>char</em>. In both instances, our array has a collection of primitives - <strong>one type of primitive per array</strong>. </p>
<p>Arrays are of a fixed size. Once declared, the computer knows the amount of memory reserved for items to be stored there.  You might ask:</p>
<p><em>"But what if the type of data I have changes in size greater than the array?" </em></p>
<p>Well, you might need to consider a different type of structure to store this data. 
Use arrays, for instance, to store months of the year. We will not be changing this count anytime.</p>
<p>Above declared, the sizes of the arrays are inferred. Meaning the types, since not defined per se, are  'figured out' based on the values and how we use them.</p>
<p>We might as well have this:</p>
<p>For python.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>import</span> array

count_down = array.array(<span>'i'</span>, [<span>5</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>1</span>])


</code></pre>
<p>Types may go on as:</p>
<p><code>c</code> for <em>char</em>
<code>f</code> for <em>float</em>
<code>d</code> for <em>double</em>
<code>u</code> for <em>unicode</em> and so forth.</p>
<p>Have a look at the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html?highlight=arrays">documentation</a> for more insight into this. AS well, take note that the <code>array module</code> has different functions to enable array manipulation.</p>
<p>Rust:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> count_down: [<span>i32</span>; <span>5</span>] = [<span>5</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>1</span>];


</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Important pointer:
    Python lists and arrays are not the same!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Operations on an array will be based on the <code>index</code> of the array element, with indexing starting from <em>0</em>. Hence, the first item, in either case, would be:</p>
<pre><code><span>count_down</span><span>[0]</span>
</code></pre><p>The result from the above is 5 (the semi-colon has been left out for brevity but should be used based on the language you are using).</p>
<p>Let's take a look at another structure that looks similar, but is not the same - <strong>Linked lists</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="linked-lists">Linked lists</h3>
<p>Unlike arrays, linked lists store data in a non-contiguous form. This implies one piece of data is not placed side by side to the other as: <code>[1,2,3,4,5]</code>, rather it is stored in form of nodes with pointers to the next as so:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>[data1, pointer_to_data2]</span> ...  <span>[data1, pointer_to_data3]</span> ... <span>and</span> <span>so</span> <span>on</span>
</code></pre><p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605257211148/M0hJg9a9v.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="linked_list.png"></p>
<p>The last item in our linked list, since there is no pointer to the next, would have <code>null</code>. </p>
<p>As well, linked lists are dynamic-  their size is not fixed at initialization. </p>
<p>Linked lists will be further broken to:</p>
<p>a) Singular linked lists (used in the elaboration of linked lists above)</p>
<p>b) Circular linked lists</p>
<p>c) Doubly linked lists</p>
<h4 id="circular-linked-lists">Circular linked lists</h4>
<p>These have three items in a node: the previous data, the data, and finally, the next data in the sequence.</p>
<pre><code><span>[null, data1, pointer_to_data2]</span> ...  <span>[pointer_to_data_1 ,data1, pointer_to_data3]</span>
</code></pre><p>The first item (the head), has a <code>null</code> as the previous pointer while the last node has <code>null</code> on the next pointer.</p>
<h4 id="doubly-linked-lists">Doubly linked lists</h4>
<p>Similar to circular linked lists, these have two pointers as well. The only difference would be the last node, instead of a <code>null</code>, has a pointer back to the first item in the list. 1 + 1 = circular.</p>
<p>In most of what we implement through code, we have implementations of linked lists. You will hardly get yourself doing this manually, but understanding that some of the things we call 'mutable arrays ' are actually implementations or wrappers around more complex structures.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
If navigating through my directory, my computer needs to know where I am, where I'm from, and possibly have the correct link/structure to the nested directory I'm navigating to. So to the top-level directory, I cannot go any higher, no previous node. Likewise to the last directory or file, there is no 'next' option.</p>
<p>Till now, we have come to understand the importance of data structures, the groups they have been placed into, and we have an idea of what some of the linear data structures involved. We could go on and on on the details of each, but that is a tale for another day. A breather for us both at this point.  Go read something non-algorithm-like for a moment. We'll still meet here, same time,  same drive. </p>

	<div>
		<p>This is a piece about the loss of skills — even ones that are marks of great beauty and mastery — due to a change in environment.</p>
<p>It’s an extreme example but a fun one to think through: who would play a Stradivarius violin in interstellar space?</p>
<p>As a way to think through an extreme environmental (not meaning climate here) change, I make the assumption that in coming centuries, whether one, five, or 10, humans will become an interstellar or extrasolar species. That is, some part of humanity will cease living in this solar system, and will instead live on other planets, space ships, or other artificial homes. <strong>I count that assumption as the less interesting part of this post and instead focus on the unintended consequences caused by a dramatic change in environment.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s think through what happens to a specific type of human mastery (and by extension, a framework to apply to many others) as humans make extreme choices (like leaving earth).</p>
<p><em>Q: Who will play the Stradivarius in interstellar space or on extrasolar planets? A: No one. Longer answer below.</em> <span id="more-947"></span></p>
<p>Today, on earth, many people achieve mastery in some skill.</p>
<p>We can include “common” skills such as learning your native language to fluency and skills that are innate, like learning to walk. The rarer skills I consider here require more concerted effort to acquire.</p>
<p>Types of skills in demand are plentiful but change over time. Some skills used to be mainstream but are now niche or largely lost except in small isolated groups, such as navigation by stars, foraging, or making clothing from scratch. Bringing those skills back to an <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/acquiring-ignorance/">ignorant</a> larger population would not make sense today. Some skills are preserved by small niches of people within families or initiates (such as Chinese <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfGdJIzYZs">“face changing” or bian lian</a>). Some are preserved widely by those who opt in by putting in the work, such as chess, forms of painting and ceramics, and musical performance.</p>
<p><strong>For some of the skills with modern masters, leaving earth will mean that future humans will neither preserve those skills, nor be able to acquire them even if they wanted to.</strong></p>
<p>I chose music because it is an enduring human behavior, unlikely to disappear. I chose Stradivarius violins because they represent mastery in physical instrument construction and rarity.</p>
<p>With only 650 instruments remaining (around 500 violins) and <a href="http://www.stradivarius.org/price/">often sold</a> for prices in the millions, I make the assumption that people who typically play a Stradivarius violin are violin masters whether or not they own the instrument themselves.</p>
<p>Here are examples related to the acquisition and maintenance of skill mastery, as demonstrated on a Stradivarius. In interstellar space.</p>

<p>Acquiring mastery in an uncommon skill takes uncommon effort.</p>
<p>It takes so much effort that acquiring an uncommon skill often also requires family and economic support. A small percentage of those who play the violin will pursue the instrument for over a decade of focused study and practice to have a chance to attain a level of mastery.</p>
<p>Those future interstellar humans’ new environment may not allow for them to put in that uncommon effort. Or, just as dangerous, where today there is a community of masters to practice and play with, in the future interstellar state, there may be so few masters that a string quartet is never possible. Less humans to practice and play with is probably assured.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/The_Dark_Forest">ravine-like</a> global crash that eliminates all violin players, teachers, and even knowledge of classical music is a possibility. What happens when there is no place to which the players can escape, survive, and continue until the situation improves? The ravine impacts violinists regardless of location.</p>
<p>Without a continual string of teachers and students, mastery becomes mystery and impossible to acquire. With effort put on making humans interstellar, will there be energy left for mastery of the violin?</p>

<p>Life in interstellar environments may not allow people to maintain an extreme practice regimen or to build excellent finger dexterity. There’s just no excess capacity to do so. They could in theory acquire the skills but never have time or physical capability.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease">Baumol’s Cost Disease</a> explains why certain types of work become more expensive over time. “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110724151936/http://publishing.eur.nl/ir/repub/asset/782/TOWSE%20EBOOK_pages0103-0113.pdf">It takes four musicians as much playing time to perform a Beethoven string quartet today as it did in 1800</a>.” That’s without considering the amount of time to acquire mastery in playing the instruments.</p>
<p>In an interstellar society, while people may have excess free time, learning to play with mastery excludes people from other, more productive activities. Spending years to become a violinist has an opportunity cost that could be more extreme than today. Longer lifespans might shift that somewhat.</p>

<p>It’s possible that skill acquisition advances beyond current imagination make it possible for novices to become masters overnight. If that happens and future humans value violin mastery, then perhaps it is more likely to see violin masters in the future, whether in interstellar environments or earth.</p>

<p>It will certainly be possible to build a robot with equal or better manual dexterity to a human. So in the future, even if there is a ravine, perhaps the robots will be preferred as violinists and will play every Strad. Why risk the instruments in human hands?</p>

<p>Why listen to live performances if, at least for classical music, there are no masters around to play live or they are worse than high-quality immersive recordings (or robots)?</p>
<p>It’s possible that future violinists play mostly for themselves.</p>

<p>Music has a shelf life. It’s long for some genres and pieces and short for others. The status quo of the classical repertoire can only be preserved for so long.</p>

<p>Consider what happened to music in the 20th century. The development of good quality microphones and electronic effects led to many new forms of music including the broad types of rock, disco, and rap. Those musical genres were created in part when musicians learned how to apply new technology. The same thing will happen again, as musicians (human or otherwise) apply music technology in new ways.</p>
<p>It’s possible that classical music will no longer be all that good in comparison to future music. Classical music’s popularity has been falling for the past 100 years since the genre stopped being pop music.</p>

<p>It’s worth considering that the original Stradivarius violins will eventually be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/music/stradivarius-sound-bank-recording-cremona.html">too fragile to play</a>. Cremona, Italy (where Stradivari worked) has been recording at high-quality the sound of each potential note of its Stradivarius violins in order to preserve that sound for posterity. Can anyone really expect to play a 1,000 year old violin?</p>

<p>Future humans may prevent Stradivarius violins and many other other examples of earth’s artistic mastery from leaving earth. Then again, future humans may want a certain number of Strads to leave as a hedge against future destruction.</p>

<p>Humans are not objective in their appraisal of violins. A double-blind <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/21/5395">study of violinists</a> (they wore goggles) playing modern and Stradivarius violins challenges the belief that Stradivarius is the best. The Strads are often valued in the millions because of their history, and most would claim, their sound. But the overwhelming majority of the violinists in the experiment preferred the modern violins. This is not to say that humans should just accept a forced preference in violin. An argument for why Strads sound (or seem to sound) better has been made from a <a href="http://www.brandstoryonline.com/stradivarius-violins-better/">brand perspective</a>, of all things. It’s the same argument made for fine (expensive) art: that part of the value, maybe most of the value, comes from things that are not objective. Story and history have a big impact on value.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some skills will become impossible to acquire when humans make a large environmental change. These skills are not transferable across vastly different environments and are lost.</li>
<li>Skill loss happens all the time in human history, though certain events speed it up.</li>
<li>Some events make skill loss impossible to undo.</li>
<li>Future humans will deal with different unintended consequences if they build an interstellar society.</li>
<li>Can we build a set of rules to help us assess unintended consequences from dramatic environmental changes?</li>
</ul>

<p>When a company with millions of consumers such as DoorDash builds machine learning (ML) models, the amount of feature data can grow to billions of records with millions actively retrieved during model inference under low latency constraints. These challenges warrant a deeper look into selection and design of a feature store — the system responsible for storing and serving feature data. The decisions made here can prevent overrunning cost budgets, compromising runtime performance during model inference, and curbing model deployment velocity.</p>



<p>Features are the input variables fed to an ML model for inference. A feature store, simply put, is a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/nosql/key-value/">key-value store</a> that makes this feature data available to models in production. At DoorDash, our existing feature store was built on top of <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>, but had a lot of inefficiencies and came close to running out of capacity. We ran a full-fledged benchmark evaluation on five different key-value stores to compare their cost and performance metrics. Our benchmarking results indicated that Redis was the best option, so we decided to optimize our feature storage mechanism, tripling our cost reduction. Additionally, we also saw a 38% decrease in Redis latencies, helping to improve the runtime performance of serving models.</p>



<p>Below, we will explain the challenges posed in the task of operating a large scale feature store. Then, we will review how we were able to quickly identify Redis as the right key-value store for this task. We will then dive into the optimizations we did on Redis to triple its capacity, while also uplifting read performance by choosing a custom serialization scheme around strings, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffers</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/google/snappy">Snappy</a> compression algorithm.</p>



<h2>Requirements of a gigascale feature store</h2>



<p>The challenges of supporting a feature store that needs a large storage capacity and high read/write throughput are similar to the challenges of supporting any high-volume key-value store. Let’s elaborate upon the requirements before we discuss the challenges faced when meeting these requirements specifically with respect to a feature store.</p>



<h3>Persistent scalable storage: support billions of records</h3>



<p>The number of records in a feature store depends upon the number of entities involved and the number of ML use cases employed on these entities. At DoorDash, our ML practitioners work with millions of entities such as consumers, merchants, and food items. These entities are associated with features and used in many dozens of ML use cases such as <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/10/01/integrating-a-scoring-framework-into-a-prediction-service/">store ranking</a> and cart item recommendations. Even though there is an overlap in features used across these use cases, the total number of <em>feature-value</em> pairs exceeds billions.</p>



<p>Additionally, since feature data is used in model serving, it needs to be backed up to disk to enable recovery in the event of a storage system failure.</p>



<h3>High read throughput: serve millions of feature lookups per second</h3>



<p>A hit rate of millions of requests per second is a staggering requirement for any data storage system. The request rates on a feature store are directly driven by the number of predictions served by the corresponding system. At DoorDash, one of our high volume use cases, <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/10/01/integrating-a-scoring-framework-into-a-prediction-service/">store ranking</a>, makes more than one million predictions per second and uses dozens of features per prediction. Thus, our feature store needs to support tens of millions of reads per second.</p>



<h3>Fast batch writes: enable full data refresh in a nightly run</h3>



<p>Features need to be periodically refreshed to make use of the latest real world data. These writes can typically be done in batches to exploit batch write optimizations of a key-value store. At DoorDash, almost all of the features get updated every day, while real time features, such as “average delivery time for orders from a store in the past 20 minutes”, get updated uniformly throughout the day.</p>



<h2>Specific design challenges in building a feature store</h2>



<p>When designing a feature store to meet the scale expectations described above, we have to deal with complexities that are specific to a feature store. These complexities involve issues such as supporting batch random reads, storing multiple kinds of data types, and enabling low-latency serving.</p>



<h3>Batch random reads per request add to read complexity</h3>



<p>Feature stores need to offer batch lookup operations because a single prediction needs multiple features. All key-value stores support unit lookup operations such as Redis’s <a href="https://redis.io/commands/get">GET command</a>. However, batch lookups are not a standard especially when keys are in no particular sequence. For example, <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/">Apache Cassandra</a> doesn’t support batch random lookups.</p>



<h3>Heterogeneous data types require non-standardized optimizations</h3>



<p>Features can either be simple data types such as integers, floats, and strings, or compound types such as <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2018/04/02/personalized-store-feed-with-vector-embeddings/">vector embeddings</a> or lists. We use integers or strings for categorical features such as <em>order protocol,</em> for whether an order was received by merchants via email, text, or iPad. We use lists for features such as a <em>list of cuisines chosen by a customer in the past 4 weeks.</em> Each one of these data types needs to be individually treated for optimizing storage and performance efficiency.</p>



<h3>Low read latency but loose expectations on write latency</h3>



<p>A feature store needs to guarantee low-latency reads. Latency on feature stores is a part of model serving, and model serving latencies tend to be in the low milliseconds range. Thus, read latency has to be proportionately lower. Also, typically, writes and updates happen in the background and are much less frequent than reads. For DoorDash, when not doing the batch refresh, writes are only 0.1% of reads. Low-latency requirements on reads and loose expectations with writes gives a direction for building towards a read-heavy key-value store but one that is fast enough for large batch writes.</p>



<h2>Identifying the right key-value store by benchmarking key performance metrics&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The choice for an appropriate storage technology helps greatly in increasing the performance and reducing the costs of a feature store. Using Yahoo’s cloud serving benchmark tool, <a href="https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB">YCSB</a>, we were able to identify Redis as a key-value store option that best fit our needs.</p>



<h3>What we need from a benchmarking platform</h3>



<p>Before we lay out our benchmarking setup, it is worthwhile to emphasize key requirements of a benchmarking platform. The four major required capabilities of a benchmarking setup are:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Data generation using preset distributions</li></ul>



<p>Using data generation is a faster and more robust approach to benchmarking than ingesting real data because it accounts for possible values that a system’s random variables can take and doesn’t require moving data around to seed a target database.</p>



<ul><li>Ability to simulate characteristic workloads</li></ul>



<p>The workload on a database can be defined by the rate of requests, nature of operations, and proportions of these operations. As long as we can guarantee the same fixed request rate across tests, we can enable a fair comparison between the different databases.</p>



<ul><li>Fine-grained performance reporting</li></ul>



<p>The suite should be able to capture performance with appropriate statistical measures such as averages, 95th percentile, and 99th percentiles.</p>



<ul><li>Reproduction of results on demand</li></ul>



<p>Without reproducibility, there is no benchmark, it’s merely a random simulated event. For this reason, any benchmark platform needs to be able to provide a consistent environment where the results can be reproduced when running the same test over and over.</p>



<h3>Using YCSB to do a rapid comparison of key-value stores</h3>



<p>YCSB is one of the best benchmarking tools out there for analysing key-value stores. So much so that it not only meets all of the needs we described above but also provides sample code to benchmark a vast number of key-value stores. This setup ensures we have a flexible playground for rapid comparisons. Below, we describe our approach of using YCSB to validate our selection of Redis as the best choice for a feature store. We will first describe our experiment setup and then report the results with our analysis.</p>



<h2>Experiment setup</h2>



<p>When setting up the benchmarking experiment, we need to start with the set of key-value stores that we believe can meet the large scale expectations reliably and have a good industry presence. Also, our experiment design is centered around Docker and aims to optimize the speed of iterations when benchmarking by removing infrastructure setup overheads.</p>



<h3>Candidate set of key-value stores</h3>



<p>The key-value stores that we experimented on in this article are listed in Table 1, below. <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a>, <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/">CockroachDB</a>, and <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> have a presence in the DoorDash infrastructure, while we selected <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/">ScyllaDB</a> and <a href="https://www.yugabyte.com/">YugabyteDB</a> based on market reports and our team’s prior experience with these databases. The intention was to compare Redis as an in-memory store with other disk-based key-value stores for our requirements.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Database name</strong></td><td><strong>Version</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Cassandra</td><td>3.11.4</td></tr><tr><td>CockroachDB</td><td>20.1.5</td></tr><tr><td>Redis</td><td>3.2.10</td></tr><tr><td>ScyllaDB</td><td>4.1.7</td></tr><tr><td>YugabyteDB</td><td>2.3.1.0-b15</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption><em>Table 1.</em> We considered five<em> data stores for benchmarking, three that were in current use at DoorDash and two others that showed promise in external market reports.</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3>Data schema</h3>



<p>For data storage, we chose following patterns:</p>



<ul><li>SQL/Cassandra</li></ul>



<pre><code lang="sql">CREATE TABLE table (key varchar primary key, value varchar)</code></pre>



<ul><li>Redis</li></ul>



<pre><code lang="bash">SET key-value
GET key</code></pre>

<p>Today I’m going to see if I can use a PC water cooling kit to make a water cooled Raspberry Pi 4. I’ve seen a couple of people try this on older model Pi’s, using reducers and adapters to get to a small cooling block onto the CPU, but I’m going to try and make an adapter to fit a larger 30mm cooling block onto a Pi 4.</p>



<p><span data-ez-name="the_diy_life_com-box-3"></span>Just to be clear, this is totally unnecessary and is more of a let’s do it because we can, not because we should type of project.  But we’ll have fun building it anyway, and hopefully it works well in the end!</p>



<p>Here’s a video of the build and the test, read on for the write-up:</p>

<p>I bought a kit that included a 120mm fan and a radiator, a 12V pump, a reservoir and some tubing. These kits are commonly available online for significantly less than the name brand components sold for high-end PCs, but it’s still quite expensive just to mess around with.</p>

<p>The kit also included a full size CPU cooling block. It looks quite cool (excuse the pun) but is way too big to try and fit onto the Pi, so I’m going to be using one of these smaller 30 x 30mm blocks which can accommodate a half-inch or 12mm tubing.</p>

<h2>Building The Water Cooled Raspberry Pi 4</h2>



<h3>Mounting The Cooling Block To The Pi</h3>



<p>I’m going to start out by making a bracket to hold the cooling block in place on the Pi over the CPU. </p>

<p>We’ll need a square section to locate the block and hold it down onto the CPU and then some legs off to the four mounting holes to hold it in place. I’ve tried to avoid covering the GPIO pins and the major components, the bracket will be quite high up, so won’t interfere with any of the surface mount components.</p>

<p>The cooling block can’t be mounted straight onto the CPU as the display connector is too high. We’ll need to put a spacer in between the CPU and cooling block to lift it above the display connector, with enough room for the tubes. </p>

<h2>Making The Cooling Circuit Stand</h2>



<p>Now that we’ve got our cooling block mounted onto our Pi, we can start working on mounting the rest of the cooling circuit. </p>

<p>Rather than just connecting all of the components together on a desk, I decided to design a stand to mount the water cooling components and Raspberry Pi, so that it looks more complete.</p>



<p>I’m going to use clear acrylic for the stand with some fluorescent green legs to match the cooling block bracket. The water cooling components should just bolt straight onto this sheet once it’s been cut out.</p>

<p>Again, I cut this stand out on my laser cutter from 3mm acrylic, this time clear.</p>



<p>Now that we’ve got our stand components made, lets start putting them together. </p>

<p>Next, I need to glue the Raspberry Pi stand components onto the main cooling water stand. I clamped the components in place and allowed the cement to cure for a couple of hours before trying to mount the Pi.</p>

<p>Once the glued had properly cured, I put two lengths of tubing onto the heat sink so that I didn’t have to try push them on in the tight space between the Pi and the pump, and then mounted the Pi onto the stand using four nylon M3 nuts on the bottom of the standoffs.</p>

<p>I then added the fittings and finished off the tubing.</p>



<p>One side of the cooling block goes to the pump and the other to the radiator. We also need a section of tube from the radiator to the top of the reservoir.</p>



<p>The last thing to do is to add a small acrylic block to the base of the pump to hold the weight of the pump and reservoir. The legs on the stand are not strong enough to support all of the cooling components and I didn’t want to make them bigger as I like the look of the thinner sections. You’ll also hardly notice the block under the pump if it’s clear.</p>

<p>Our water cooled Pi is now complete, we just need to fill it up with water or cooling liquid and try it out. The system took around 300ml of cooling liquid to fill.</p>



<h2>Testing The Water Cooled Raspberry Pi 4</h2>



<p>The fan and pump are actually quite quiet when running, the system is a lot quieter than some of the small case fans I’ve used on a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Now let’s try and do a stress test on the water cooled Raspberry Pi to see how well this cooling system works.</p>



<h3>CPU Test At 1.5GHz</h3>



<p>With the CPU clock frequency set to the default 1.5Ghz, we start out with a temperature of around 28°C. This was in a room of around 25°C, so it was done with quite a warm ambient temperature. </p>

<p>There was a small spike initially where the temperature went up to 31°C but it stayed between 31°C and 33°C for the rest of the test and dropped off quickly when the test was stopped. </p>

<h3>CPU Test At 2.0GHz</h3>



<p>Now I’m going to try overclocking the Pi to test it at a higher CPU frequency. </p>

<p>Here’s a graph of the CPU temperature for the duration of the 2Ghz test.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The water cooling system on this Pi works really well at keeping the CPU cool. Even when overclocked to 2.0Ghz, the  Raspberry Pi 4’s CPU temperature never went above 40°C. I wasn’t able to test the Pi at the maximum 2.147Ghz as my Pi wouldn’t boot up at this frequency, probably due to under-voltage. I’ll try and get this fixed and do a test at the maximum frequency as well at some stage.</p>



<p>To get an idea of whether this is worthwhile, I’m going to be comparing this water cooling system to an <a href="https://www.the-diy-life.com/diy-raspberry-pi-4-desktop-case-with-oled-stats-display/">Ice Tower</a>, a standard acrylic case and fan and then just a Pi with a static heat sink on it in the next week or two. So make sure that you check back here, or subscribe to my Youtube channel and turn on notifications so that you don’t miss out on that.</p>

<figcaption>The Offenbacher Schrift Alphabet</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Above is a sample of <em>Offenbacher Schrift</em>, a style of handwriting
designed by the type designer (and, regrettably, enthusiastic German
nationalist), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Koch">Rudolf
Koch</a>. Offenbacher Schrift
was arguably the final incarnation of the venerable German handwriting
style known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurrent">Kurrent</a>, a
tradition particular to German-speaking areas for hundreds of years,
up until the Nazis fucked it up in some historically interesting
ways. It’s closely related also to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BCtterlin">Sütterlin</a>, which was
the dominant form of Kurrent in its final flowering.</p>

<p>One of the attractive and interesting qualities of the Kurrent
scripts, especially in comparison to English cursive, is their
abhorrence of re-crossing and overlapping lines. For instance, the
lower-case <em>c</em>: <a href="https://loopsandtails.com/cursive/cc/">in English cursive</a>, the pen, starting
from the lower-left, slopes up to the top part of the c, and then
doubles back along the same line to make the bottom part. This is
studiously avoided in the Sütterlinschrift, which opts for the single
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minim_(palaeography)">minim</a>. </p>

<p>It’s also this quality that is responsible for Offenbacher’s most
extravagant peculiarities. There’s a lot that’s attractive about it
(I’m someone who also has a lot of difficulty with those parts of the
letter that have to cross over each other; when writing in cursive, I
usually pick up the pen and start again when I have to write an <em>a</em>,
<em>c</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>g</em>—in other words, when I have to cross from the bottom
left to the upper right in order to start a letter), but unmodified,
Kurrent is a little too eccentric to the Anglophone eye. </p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the eccentrics, <em>a</em> <em>g</em> <em>q</em>:</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>And <em>r</em> <em>v</em> <em>w</em> <em>y</em>: </p>

<img src="https://blog.zdsmith.com/images/offenbacher-rvwy.png" alt="Offenbacher: r, v, w, y">
<figcaption>Offenbacher: r, v, w, y</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We can see what’s happening here. In each case, the letter has
acquired a little gap in it: in the top row, it bows downwards, and in
the bottom row, it bows upwards, but in each case, the hand needs to
establish a bit of distance between a straight stroke and a curve in
order to ensure they don’t abut each other. </p>

<p><img src="https://blog.zdsmith.com/images/offenbacher-agq-arrows.png" alt="Offenbacher: a, g, q">
<img src="https://blog.zdsmith.com/images/offenbacher-rvwy-arrows.png" alt="Offenbacher: r, v, w, y"> </p>

<p>For my needs, this is the mania against the intermingling of lines
taken to an unhealthy extreme. I want to avoid having to pass over a
letter’s body in order to start it; on other hand, I’m perfectly
comfortable with the round bit and the straight bit of my <em>y</em> rubbing
up against each other. It’s the year 2020, after all.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, the regular construction of the script means we can
apply an equally regular simplification. We can simply eliminate the
gap in each of the above cases, and the regularity of it guarantees
that we won’t end up with a mangled or inconsistent script.</p>

<figcaption>Offenbacher, before and after</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This strikes me as a very fine compromise, having kept a lot of the
regularity and cleanliness that I like out of Kurrent while making the
letters generally a little simpler and more recognizable.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of the whole thing put together:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://blog.zdsmith.com/images/offenbacher-pangram.png" alt="An Offenbacher pangram">
<figcaption>An Offenbacher pangram</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="postscriptum">POSTSCRIPTUM</h3>

<p>I’d like to offer one alternate rendering: </p>

<p>Arguably, the one outlier in the above is the treatment of <em>r</em>. It’s
not necessarily that I don’t think the principle applies—I think
that the short, bowed stroke on the bottom is a gap inserted to avoid
the downstroke and the upstroke intermingling, and I think it can be
eliminated in exactly the same way as the others are—it’s just that
the <em>r</em> character is so minimal that, by accident or not, the
gap-stroke is much more prominent in that letter than in the
others. Especially when you consider that the last stroke, the curving
one after the upstroke, will be the connector to the next letter (if
the <em>r</em> isn’t last), one could make the argument that, visually
speaking, the gap-stroke of the <em>r</em> becomes the dominant graphical
feature of the letter and to eliminate it is to fundamentally alter
its character. </p>

<p>In the spirit of that possible objection, I want to offer an
alternative in the form of the <em><a href="https://www.vhmmlschool.org/latin-insular">insular r</a></em>, ꞃ, which I have
plucked out of its Irish origin and found to be a good match:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://blog.zdsmith.com/images/offenbacher-insular-r.png" alt="Offenbacher with the insular r">
<figcaption>Offenbacher with the insular r</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It works very well because its construction is almost identical to
that of the Kurrent <em>e</em>, with its two upright strokes and its
connecting stroke beginning midway-or-greater up the first one<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote">[1]</a>. In
the case of the insular r, we simply give the first stroke a
descender. The degree to which the two share a character—while being
very clearly distinguishable—tells me that the substitution is quite
a natural one.</p>

<p>The Casio F-91W is one of the most iconic watches of the past few decades. It’s notoriously cheap, reliable, and retro; in fact, it’s probably the only watch that was worn by both <a href="https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/hC8faiWSsiFpNpszRf0lb7yAkIA=/fit-in/960x550/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Casio_F-91W_terrorist-002.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Obama</a> <em>and</em> <a href="http://ethiopiaforums.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/osama-bin-laden-seated.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Osama</a>. At just under $10, it’s the perfect daily beater watch. And in the age where you need to charge your Apple Watch every day, the Casio’s battery can last up to a decade. Still, though, it has a few downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>The resin strap is liable to break</li>
<li>The watch is barely water resistant</li>
</ul>
<p>The former is easily rectified by switching to a vinyl or leather NATO strap; but what about the latter? Is there any way to turn the F-91W into a deep sea diver?</p>
<h2>The Magic of Fluid Incompressibility</h2>
<p>Fluids are said to be “virtually incompressible.” Generally speaking, a gas (like air) is compressible: when pressure increases, volume decreases. The compressibility factor \(\beta\) may be expressed as</p>
<p>$$\beta = -\frac{1}{V}\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}$$</p>
<p>where \(V\) is volume and \(p\) is pressure. A trick to achieve incredible depth ratings has been to submerge the internals of a watch in inert, non-reactive, non-corrosive, non-polar liquids. Mineral oil (a byproduct of petroleum refinement) is a fantastic choice — and this is exactly what I’ll be doing to my Casio F-91W. Theoretically, as water pressure increases around the watch, due to the fact that it’s filled with an incompressible liquid (as opposed to a compressible gas), it can successfully “push back” against the water and it will not succumb to implosion due to increasing pressures.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Preparing the watch</h3>
<p>First, we take off the stock resin straps and wipe off the watch of excess oils and debris.</p>
<p><img src="http://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0004.jpg" alt="" width="3888" height="2592" srcset="https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0004.jpg 3888w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0004-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0004-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0004-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3888px) 100vw, 3888px"></p><h3>Step 2: Unscrew the back plate</h3>
<p>We next unscrew the back plate and remove the watch internals, also removing the white tape on the back of the battery compartment. All parts are wiped carefully with with rubbing alcohol.</p>
<p><img src="http://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0011.jpg" alt="" width="3888" height="2592" srcset="https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0011.jpg 3888w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0011-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0011-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0011-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3888px) 100vw, 3888px"></p><h3>Step 3: Fill bowl with mineral oil</h3>
<p>Some sources suggest heating the mineral oil to ~50° Centigrade, but I’m not exactly sure what the reasoning for that might be, so I stuck with room temperature. For some extra flair, I added a fat-soluble colorant which will give the viewport a nice bluish tint and set it apart from a stock F-91W.</p>
<p><img src="http://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0022.jpg" alt="" width="3888" height="2592" srcset="https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0022.jpg 3888w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0022-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0022-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0022-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3888px) 100vw, 3888px"></p><h3>Step 4: Submerge</h3>
<p>Slowly submerge all watch parts in the mineral oil. Ensure that there are no air bubbles in either the watch chassis or electronic internals. Leave watch submerged while mixing slowly for a few minutes to make sure there are no air bubbles.</p>
<p><img src="http://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0025.jpg" alt="" width="3888" height="2592" srcset="https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0025.jpg 3888w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0025-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0025-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0025-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3888px) 100vw, 3888px"></p><h3>Step 5: Re-assemble the watch</h3>
<p>Re-assemble the watch by securing the back-plate via the Phillips screws while submerged in the oil. Make sure no air bubbles accidentally form while screwing in the screws.</p>
<p><img src="http://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0027.jpg" alt="" width="3888" height="2592" srcset="https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0027.jpg 3888w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0027-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0027-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0027-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3888px) 100vw, 3888px"></p><p>Here, you’ll notice I decided to switch to a reddish tint after my first failed attempt.</p>
<h3>Step 6: Extract watch and clean</h3>
<p>Remove the assembled watch from the oil mixture and wipe it down, cleaning any excess oil. Add a fancy strap, and <em>et voila</em>!<br>
<img src="http://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0039.jpg" alt="" width="3888" height="2592" srcset="https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0039.jpg 3888w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0039-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0039-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0039-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3888px) 100vw, 3888px"></p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>If you decide to use colorant, as I did, keep in mind this will effectively reduce visibility to zero and it will be very difficult (but not impossible) navigating the murky oil solution by touch alone. Also, keep in mind that after this procedure the F-91W’s nigh-useless LED light will be even more useless due to the oil’s refractive index. Finally, even though mineral oil is “virtually incompressible,” it’s still <em>technically</em> compressible. Professional dive watches filled with oil will often have a flexible chassis that will allow for around a \(\pm0.5\%/1000\text{psi}\) wiggle room in volume to account for this compression at high ambient pressures.</p>
<p>So what kind of pressure can my little Casio handle? I don’t have any way of testing, but <a href="http://mygshock.com/2008/10/13/g-shock-hydro-conversion-pressure-test-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a similar experiment (on a Casio G-Shock)</a> allowed for pressures of up to 1200PSI, so I would expect similar numbers out of my watch. Another enthusiast did this experiment on an <a href="https://www.thewatchsite.com/34-watchmaking-tinkering/8273-superlative-oil-filled-f-91wthe-making-superlative-oil-filled-casio-f-91-a.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">F-91W with olive oil</a>. However, olive oil will oxidize, so if you’ll give this a try, I would suggest a synthetic compound.</p>
<p>Overall, this was a fun little project and not a bad way to spend a lazy Sunday.</p>

                        <p>Symmetric encryption with a default key on Ubiquiti’s UniFi network devices combined with remotely-hosted UniFi Controllers leads to risk of undetectable observation of network configuration and usage data.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-unifis-inform-protocol">Overview of UniFi’s “inform” protocol</h2>
<p>Ubiquiti’s UniFi product line consists of routers, switches, and WiFi access points.</p>
<p>These devices do not have any local management, instead relying on controller software<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> running locally or hosted remotely.</p>
<p>Devices discover their controller<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> through a combination of broadcast traffic on the local network, DHCP option 43, and trying to resolve the hostname <code>unifi</code>.
In the case of option 43 or resolution of the <code>unifi</code> hostname, the device will attempt to communicate with the controller by sending a HTTP POST request to <code>[ADDR]:8080/inform</code>.</p>
<p>This POST request contains a JSON payload<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and is repeated every 30 seconds. Controllers respond with a JSON payload containing configuration data, commands, or instructions to check in at a later time.</p>

<p>When sending JSON-encoded data to an API endpoint, one might expect to see a MIME type of <code>application/json</code> combined with HTTP over TLS. This is not the case.</p>
<p>Instead, the JSON payload is encrypted with AES in GCM or CBC mode depending on the combination of device and firmware version, wrapped with a bespoke binary protocol<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and transferred without benefit of TLS<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The encryption key used prior to adoption by a controller is the md5sum of <code>ubnt</code><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>During the adoption process, the controller generates a new key and sends it to the device as a inform response along with any other initial configuration data. Consequently, anyone observing network traffic during the adoption process can observe any future traffic between the device and controller.</p>
<p>Operators have been questioning<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Ubiquiti’s decision to not utilize TLS by default for several years. Eventually Ubiquiti removed<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> the ability for operators to force usage of TLS for inform traffic.</p>

<p>Network configuration data by itself can be considered sensitive but does not directly impact user privacy.
Unfortunately, inform traffic also contains data that can identify specific devices in place and time. With a UniFi router, it can associate browsing activity with a device’s mac and IP addresses.</p>
<h2 id="switches">Switches</h2>
<p>Switch tables contain MAC addresses of user devices and can be used to associate a user with a location.</p>
<p>See: <a href="https://jade.wtf/words/unifi-l3inform-crypto/inform-switch.json">example inform</a> from a USW-PRO-24 running firmware 4.0.64.10823.</p>
<h2 id="wifi-access-points">WiFi Access Points</h2>
<p>MAC addresses of users, data on neighboring WiFi AP signal strength provides sufficient information to geolocate the AP<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> using commonly available services.</p>
<p>See: <a href="https://jade.wtf/words/unifi-l3inform-crypto/inform-ap.json">example inform</a> from a UAP Flex HD running firmware 4.0.42.10433.</p>
<h2 id="routers-unifi-security-gateway">Routers (UniFi Security Gateway)</h2>
<p>Router inform contains DPI, DHCP, and ARP tables that can be used to associate a device with usage of specific applications such as Facebook and Spotify.</p>
<p>Exerpt showing DPI update for a host (<code>app</code> and <code>cat</code> correspond to application and category identifiers used in the controller dashboard):</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Reliance on symmetric encryption means that anyone that possesses the key can observe inform traffic. This traffic contains information that, if disclosed, could have an adverse effect on users of the network.</p>
<h2 id="surveillance-and-targeting">Surveillance and targeting</h2>
<p>An aid worker installs a UniFi switch in a refugee camp. They use a UniFi controller hosted in a cloud VM for remote monitoring and management.
It’s easy for an adversary to monitor<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> these internet connection. The adversary gathers end-user device MAC addresses<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> from the switch table data contained in the inform message. How parties to a conflict could use such data is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<h2 id="location-discovery-via-passive-observation-or-dns-hijacking">Location discovery via passive observation or DNS hijacking</h2>
<p>Someone acquires a UniFi WiFi access point (AP) and installs it on their home network. They didn’t realize that a controller was required and order a UniFi cloud key controller, but did not unplug the AP while waiting for the controller to arrive.</p>
<p>Their internet provider uses wildcard DNS monetization<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> to show ads on domain names that do not exist. This leads to the <code>unifi</code> hostname resolving to the monetization provider’s server. Because of privacy regulations the ISP is prohibited from giving detailed information (such as physical location) to the ad provider, so the ad provider is incentivized to find ways to geolocate clients to deliver more targeted ads.</p>
<p>The neighboring networks / interference avoidance data included in the AP’s inform message contains sufficient information to utilize WiFi-based geolocation to associate the IP address with a physical address.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the feasibility of information extraction, I built a tool to automate information extraction from Unifi inform packets: <a href="https://github.com/jda/pixiedust">pixiedust</a>.</p>
<p>In key extraction mode, pixiedust follows inform traffic and learns keys as devices are provisioned or reconfigured.</p>

<p>Use TLS. Even self-signed certificates are better than the current state because you can log certificate IDs to detect MITM.</p>
<p>Inform messages should contain the minimum information necessary for adoption until after the device has been paired with a controller to prevent inadvertent disclosure of network configuration and personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>All UniFi devices to date are affected, except for the UniFi Dream Machine (UDM) product line (including UDM Pro).
The UDM series are not affected because they run a local instance of the controller software and cannot use a remotely hosted controller,
so there is no opportunity for an attacker to eavesdrop on UDM🡘controller communication.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>VS Code is designed to elegantly handle all kinds of repos: Mono. Many. Multi. Even hybrids. Settling a discussion to determine what repo-structure is best for a project is as futile as having a room full of people agree on the world's best ice cream flavor.</p><p><img alt="Marquee Blog" src="https://marquee.activecove.com/blog/7/headline.jpg"></p><p>While building Marquee we lean on VS Code's excellent support working inside both folders and workspaces. Being able to quickly pop open a folder to inspect a project proved to be as important as pulling up a familiar workspace with a set of interrelated projects. The only real downside is that it's easy to get lost and sharing information between VS Code windows is hard.</p><blockquote><p>Install <a href="https://marquee.activecove.com/">Marquee</a>, if you haven't already 🤩</p></blockquote><p>If you're like us and you are compulsively hoarding VS Code windows like browser tabs we suggest you keep reading to find out how we have enhanced Marquee to support you in your VS Code quests.</p><h2>🏄 Ubiquitous Notes, Snippets, &amp; Todos</h2><p>When working with multiple repos, no matter a project's structure, it is immensely helpful to focus information displayed in Marquee to the currently active VS Code window. A single click on the scope toggle allows lookups of information across workspaces without expensive context switching.</p><p>Since we have received feedback from users that workspace-specific todos are hugely popular we expanded the workspace vs global filter option to snippets and notes too.</p><p><img alt="Marquee Blog" src="https://marquee.activecove.com/blog/7/toggle.gif"></p><h2>💫 Ranked Recent Projects &amp; Workspaces</h2><p>Opening many different projects in VS Code over time will inevitably make you lose sight of the important ones. Marquee offers the Projects widget which out of the box will use a relevance sort order and optionally be toggled to use alphabetical order. Relevance will show projects ordered by the how many todos, notes, and snippets are associated with them.</p><p><img alt="Marquee Blog" src="https://marquee.activecove.com/blog/7/projects.gif"></p><h2>🥁 Only Auto-Launch in Workspaces</h2><p>Based on your feedback we have learned that you ❤️ love Marquee but it does sometimes get in your way. We agree that losing focus when you open folders in new windows can be annoying. Which is why we introduced the <code>Only auto-launch Marquee in Workspaces</code> toggle in the global settings (top-level ⚙️) which will only auto-launch Marquee in workspaces as opposed to the more ephemeral VS Code in folders.</p><p><img alt="Marquee Blog" src="https://marquee.activecove.com/blog/7/autolaunch.gif"></p><h2>🍧 What's your favorite flavor?</h2><p>Repos: Many. Ice cream: vanilla. That's our short answer. If there's anything we can do to make Marquee better for your day-to-day VS Code-ing, let us know! We're taking feature requests. Needless to say it's totally cool to just drop us a line with your favorite ice cream flavor. Make sure you <a href="https://marquee.activecove.com/">give Marquee a spin in VS Code</a> if you haven't already!</p><p><sub></sub>Title photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/47515486@N05/50097365703/in/photolist-97sG6K-dkSZ4h-bBWVJU-2enqKnG-7APByH-ggyZg-4e1HdM-dQc53Y-mi3g5-6HMWtQ-2V5AJ-c1yZvU-2jjW6sx-c1z173-5idxHJ-5i96Nz-7QN95t-6vB45u-YfNpRD-dQ6s9Z-dkSVt4-fW91Aa-8JCrhJ-3HuBoY-5i9dp2-c1z1AN-4gX9us-27wS4LL-7QRnEo-2ew82Yx-7Wa82u-23YdLUe-4haspb-dFpUW3-7pTdXP-byt4Js-6qztNq-ePq638-nhDanS-nsSMtz-8zSYmt-58DPS-nHCqpA-8sEorb-35wuFd-2fnFRAW-7Wa81C-KT37Nw-86fGoR-4Q8kkb">Hefin Owen</a><sub></sub></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Are the pixie fairies sprinkling gold dust on bitcoin’s market again? By the looks of things, you might think so. </p>



<p>Like in the bubble days of 2017, the price of bitcoin is headed ever upward. On Wednesday morning, it surpassed $18,000 — a number not seen since December 2017 when bitcoin, at its all-time peak, scratched $20,000.</p>



<p>Of course, the market <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-12/crypto-s-crash-just-surpassed-dot-com-levels-as-losses-reach-80">crashed spectacularly</a> the following year, and retailers lost their shirts. But here we are once again, trying to unravel the mysteries of bitcoin’s latest price movements. </p>



<p>Several factors may explain it — Tether, PayPal, and China’s crackdown on over-the-counter desks — but before we get into that, let me reiterate how critical it is for bitcoin’s price to stay at or above a certain <em>magic number</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin miners — those responsible for securing the bitcoin network by “mining” the next block of transactions on the blockchain — need to sell their newly minted bitcoins for real money, so they can pay their <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-bitcoin-network-now-consumes-7-nuclear-plants-worth-of-power/#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20CBECI%20says%20the,terawatt%2Dhours%20of%20energy%20consumption.">massive energy bills.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roughly $8 million to $10 million in cash gets sucked out of the bitcoin ecosystem this way every day. So, in order for the miners — the majority of whom are in China — to turn a profit, bitcoin needs to be priced accordingly. Otherwise, if too many miners were to decide to call it quits and unplug from the network all at once, that would leave bitcoin vulnerable to attacks. The entire system, and its current $345 billion market cap, literally depends on keeping the miners happy.</p>



<p>Now let’s jump to May 11, an important day for bitcoin. That was the day of the “halvening,” an event hardwired into bitcoin’s code where the block reward gets slashed in half. A halvening occurs once every four years.</p>



<p>Before May 11, miners received 1,800 bitcoin a day in the form of block rewards, which meant they needed to cash in each bitcoin for $5,000. But <em>after</em> the halvening, the network would produce only 900 bitcoins per day, so miners knew they needed to sell each precious bitcoin for at least $10,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But trouble loomed. Just months before the halvening, the price of bitcoin went into free fall. Between February and March, when the world was first gripped by the COVID crisis, bitcoin lost half its value, sliding to $5,000 — barely enough to pay the system’s energy costs post-halvening. Miners were likely pacing, wringing their hands, wondering how they would stay in business. Who would guarantee their profits?</p>



<p>That is when Tether — a company that produces a dollar-pegged stablecoin of the same name — sprung into action and started issuing tethers in amounts far greater than it ever had before in its five years of existence.</p>



<p>Tethers, for the uninitiated, are the main source of liquidity for unbanked crypto exchanges, which account for most of bitcoin’s trading volume. Currently, there are $18 billion (notional value) worth of tethers sloshing around in the crypto markets. And nobody is quite sure what’s backing them.</p>



<p>Due to Tether’s lack of transparency, its failure to provide a long promised audit, and the fact that the New York Attorney General is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitfinex-used-tether-reserves-to-mask-missing-850-million-probe-finds-11556227031">currently probing</a> the firm along with Tether’s sister company, crypto exchange Bitfinex, for fraud, a good guess is nothing. Tethers, many suspect, are being minted out of thin air.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Tethers were initially promised as an IOU where one tether was supposed to represent a redeemable dollar. But that was long before the British Virgin Island-registered firm began issuing tethers in massive quantities. And no tethers, to anyone’s knowledge, have ever been redeemed—except for when Tether <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-just-burned-500-million-usdt-stablecoin-tokens">burned 500 million tethers</a> in October 2018, following the <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/04/26/new-york-attorney-general-bitfinex-is-hiding-850-million-in-losses/">seizure of $850 million</a> from its payment processor Crypto Capital.)</p>



<p>According to data from <a href="https://amycastor.com/2020/11/21/are-pixie-fairies-behind-bitcoins-latest-bubble/blank">Nomics</a>, at the beginning of 2020, there were only $4.3 billion worth of tethers in circulation. That number remained stable through January and February and into March. But starting on March 18, just five days after bitcoin dipped below $5,000, the tether printer kicked in.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wquSWQQ2kEfLCnshYnCiE7RZY2tuh9JtkWwPvnSsImvegfwkMzdhboJKFhSdpxqc5CtbcOh-5xqaro5F5DQAupoThjDcw6DYUf9wQTPBgfSMOV2TObswcJbuZoiOi2z46e9AR4Wg" alt=""><figcaption><em>BTC price and USDT supply. </em><a href="https://nomics.com/"><em>Image: Nomics.com</em></a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tether minted $1.9 billion worth of tethers in March, and another $1.5 billion worth in April — crypto’s own version of an economic stimulus package. The price of bitcoin rose in tandem back up to $10,000, just in time for the halvening. Yet the Tether printer kept printing, pushing the price of bitcoin ever skyward and giving bag holders an opportunity to cash out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May, June and July, Tether issued a combined total of $6 billion in tethers. In August, when the price of bitcoin reached $12,000, it spun out $2.5 billion in tethers. And in September, when BTC slid to $10,000, Tether infused the markets with another $2 billion in tethers, although, even that couldn’t lift bitcoin up to $12,000 again. It just hovered in the $10,000 range.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then in October — just after US prosecutors <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/founders-and-executives-shore-cryptocurrency-derivatives-exchange-charged-violation">charged the founders of BitMEX,</a> a Seychelles-registered, Hong Kong-based bitcoin derivatives exchange, for failing to maintain an adequate anti-money laundering program — the price of BTC started to soar. What happened?</p>



<h2><strong>Tether’s frenzied pumping</strong></h2>



<p>One theory is that Tether just kept issuing tethers, billions and billions of them, and those tethers were used to buy up bitcoin. A high demand drives up the price — even if it’s fake money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only unlike in 2017, the effort to drive up bitcoin’s price is requiring a lot more tethers than ever before. (At the end of 2017, before the last bitcoin bubble popped, there were only $1.3 billion worth of tethers in circulation, a fraction of what there are today.)</p>



<p>Nicholas Weaver, a bitcoin skeptic and a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, is convinced&nbsp;bitcoin’s latest price moves are 100% synthetic.</p>



<p>“The amount of tether flooding into the system is more than enough explanation for the price as it is well more than the amount needed to buy up all the newly minted bitcoin,” he told me. “If it was organic, there would at least be some significant increase in the outstanding amount of non-fraudulent stablecoins.”</p>



<p>What he means is, if real money was behind tether, we’d be seeing a similar demand for regulated stablecoins. But that is not the case. Only one regulated stablecoin has seen substantial growth — <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/81422/stablecoin-supply-has-surged-past-20-billion-driven-by-derivatives-market">Circle’s USDC</a> — but that growth is far overshadowed by Tether, and mainly a result of the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) market — a topic for another time.</p>



<p>Jorge Stolfi, a professor of computer science at the State University of Campinas in Brazil, who in 2016 wrote a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-batsbzx-2016-30/batsbzx201630-2.htm">letter to the SEC</a> advising about the risks of a bitcoin ETF, which the SEC published, agrees.</p>



<p>“As long as fake money can be used to buy BTC, the price can be pumped to whatever levels to keep the miners happy,” he told me. He went on to <a href="https://twitter.com/JorgeStolfi/status/1329952095286472711">explain</a> in a Twitter thread that the higher the bitcoin price, the faster real money flows out of the system — assuming miners sell <em>all</em> their bitcoin for cash. Multiply bitcoin’s current price of $18,600 times 900, and that’s nearly $17 million a day. Investors will never get that money back, he said.</p>



<p>Klyith (not his real name) from Something Awful, a predecessor site to 4Chan, <a href="https://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?noseen=0&amp;threadid=3838405&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=797#post505143737">explains Tether</a> this way:</p>



<p>“A bunch of pixies show up and start flooding the parchment market with fairy gold, driving prices to amazing new heights. But when any of the player characters try to spend the fairy gold in other towns or to pay tithes to the king, it turns into worthless rocks.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/fairy.jpg"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="4784" data-permalink="https://amycastor.com/fairy/" data-orig-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/fairy.jpg" data-orig-size="564,775" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="fairy" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/fairy.jpg?w=218" data-large-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/fairy.jpg?w=564" src="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/fairy.jpg?w=564" alt="" width="291" height="400" srcset="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/fairy.jpg?w=291 291w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/fairy.jpg?w=109 109w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/fairy.jpg?w=218 218w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/fairy.jpg 564w" sizes="(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px"></a></figure></div>



<p>“If you denounce the pixies to the peasants or start using dispel magic to reveal that fairy gold is rocks, the price of parchments will collapse and the peasants may stop using them altogether. But if you ignore the pixies and keep the parchment economy going, you will end up with more and more worthless rocks instead of gold. The pixies can of course tell the difference between fairy gold and real gold at a glance. So they will quickly drain all the real gold from the whole township if you don’t act. What do you do?”</p>



<p>Still, it is hard to imagine that outside events don’t have some impact on bitcoin’s price. Two other events are being talked about right now as reasons behind bitcoin’s price gains—and they are getting a lot more media attention than Tether.</p>



<h2><strong>PayPal’s shilling</strong></h2>



<p>One of the biggest companies in the world is now <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/826eedac-b0cd-4591-897a-9e83cf697060">promoting crypto</a>, giving retail buyers the impression that bitcoin is a safe investment. After all, if bitcoin were a Ponzi or a scam, why would such a well-known, respectable company embrace it? I should add that <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/microstrategy-ceo-bitcoin-better-than-antiquated-gold">MicroStrategy</a>, <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/2020-bitcoin-investment">Square</a>, <a href="https://decrypt.co/48252/wall-streets-fidelity-mounts-defense-for-bitcoin">Fidelity Investment</a> and Mexico’s third-richest person, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-18/billionaire-salinas-has-10-of-liquid-portfolio-in-bitcoin">Ricardo Salinas Pliego</a>, are also currently shilling bitcoin on the internet. </p>



<p>On Oct. 21, PayPal <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency">announced a new service</a> for its users to buy and sell crypto for cash. And on Nov. 12, the service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/paypal-says-all-users-in-u-s-can-now-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrencies/">became available to U.S. customers</a>, who can now buy and sell bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, and litecoin via their PayPal wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are a PayPal user, you have already gone through the process of proving you are who you say you are. And that removes the hassle of having to sign up with an crypto exchange, like Coinbase in the U.S., and take selfies of yourself holding up your driver’s license or passport.</p>



<p>Of course, there are limitations. You can’t transfer crypto into or out of your wallet, like you can on a centralized exchange. But you can pay PayPal’s 26 million merchants with crypto — although, not really, because what they receive on their end is cash. And the transaction is subject to high fees, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/paypal-to-let-you-buy-and-sell-cryptocurrencies-in-the-us/">2.3% for anything under $100</a>, so what is the point? All you are doing is taking out a bet against PayPal that the price of bitcoin is going to rise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stolfi describes PayPal <a href="https://twitter.com/JorgeStolfi/status/1330207860484153347">on Twitter</a> as “a meta-casino where you can choose to use special in-house chips with a randomly variable value.”</p>



<p>The broader point is that PayPal makes it easy to buy crypto for people who are less likely to understand how crypto really works or know about …</p></div></article></div>

<p>A few weeks ago, a friend came to me with a bad idea.</p>



<p>He wanted us to start a dietary supplement and nootropics company together. We would use <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/what-is-dropshipping">dropshipping</a> to offload most inventory and management costs, then go to a mutual friend for cheap web design, and then tap into our networks for some surprisingly good sales and endorsement opportunities.</p>



<p>He acknowledged that I have no formal biology background besides AP Bio and watching <strong>House</strong>. He also had no formal background. This might lead an objective observer to conclude that we were not the best qualified individuals for selling other people chemicals to put in their bodies.</p>



<p>But… we had both started and run businesses successfully. He had had been using supplements and nootropics on a daily basis for years, and had put an impressive amount of effort into understanding them as evidenced by his ability to rattle off chemical components and mechanisms with the slightest prompting. He also had unique access to people who could promote and sell our product.</p>



<p>Most importantly, the entire supplements/nootropics field was in the “Wild West” (his words). Entrepreneurs all over the world were putting out bundled nootropic supplements with names like <a href="https://www.onnit.com/alphabrain/">Alpha Brain</a> and <a href="https://www.infowarsstore.com/brain-force?imt=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAtK79BRAIEiwA4OskBh6ir5a4-EWFNkmevrRBa-d55F195X-XrtQD5WT8sJfI5BqNM7WKvhoC5eAQAvD_BwE&amp;utm_campaign=Infowars+Life+&amp;utm_source=Google+Shopping&amp;utm_medium=PPC&amp;utm_content=Google+Shopping">Brain Force Plus</a>, and so if we, in the spirit of scientific adventure, put our heads together and actually tried to run a legitimate company which used only the most scientifically verified substances, we could pass the low bar set by the current market, and then rely on marketing skills and connections to carve out our own little chunk of a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/02/19/1987135/0/en/Nootropics-Market-To-Reach-USD-5-32-Billion-By-2026-Reports-And-Data.html#:~:text=19%2C%202020%20(GLOBE%20NEWSWIRE),cognitive%20performance%20of%20an%20individual.">two billion dollar industry</a>.</p>



<p>This was a really, really bad idea.</p>



<p>It wasn’t a bad idea in a cynical, amoral, profit-maximizing sense. I’m pretty sure we could have actually made money if we tried.</p>



<p>It was a bad idea because it was a path to becoming borderline-snake oil salesmen.</p>



<p>I wasn’t 100% sold on the concept of starting a dietary supplement and nootropics company at first, but I was excited by it. I wanted to start another company, to build it, to make money with someone I greatly respected and admired. I wanted it to happen.</p>



<p>So it became my really bad idea too.</p>



<hr>



<p>Like every IQ-obsessed rationalist-ish person on earth, I had on occasion wondered about the viability of nootropics. After a 40 minute phone call with my friend, I finally took the deep dive into the subject and read everything I could find on nootropics for seven days.</p>



<p>Among other things, I read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic">nootropics Wikipedia page</a>, a dozen other Wikipedia pages on specific nootropics, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/01/2016-nootropics-survey-results/">Slate Star Codex’s 2016 Nootropics Survey Results</a>, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Nootropics">Gwern’s discussion of the 40 nootropics he tried</a>, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nootropics/wiki/beginners">r/nootropics beginner’s guide to nootropics</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/top/?t=all">a bunch of the top all time posts on r/nootropics</a>, some stuff on the <a href="https://humannootropicsindex.com/">Human Nootropics Index</a>, and a lot of basic neuroscience so I could get a handle on the biological mechanisms. I also talked to a few friends, including a professional psychiatrist.</p>



<p>At the end of the week, my evaluation of the viability of nootropics was updated to:</p>



<ul><li>A small percentage (5-10%) of nootropics definitely and obviously work (or at least have some sort of effect), but have major negative side effects, often including addiction potential. These include Adderall, modafinil, nicotine, and many pharmaceutical stimulants.</li><li>The vast majority of nootropics (80%+) either don’t work, or have subtle, highly individualized effects. Often, even if they do have positive effects, they are pretty much impossible to verify. These include piracetam, ALCAR, <s>kratom</s>, noopept, and any exotic root from Zimbabwe.</li><li>A small percentage (5-10%) of nootropics hit the sweet spot of being both effective and not having any serious drawbacks. You can take them every day and they provide a mild desired effect. These nootropics are (IMO) caffeine, melatonin, and maybe L-theanine.</li></ul>



<p>(As far as I could tell, most workout supplements work if you take them the right way, but everyone already knows that and the market is saturated.)</p>



<p>From the perspective of our potential business:</p>



<ul><li>We mostly couldn’t legally sell nootropics in the first category. What we could do if we wanted to live life on the edge is keep an eye out for emerging nootropics and sell them before the FDA inevitably scheduled them and made their sale illegal. But this was obviously risky and stupid, even by the standards of this entire enterprise.</li><li>We could sell the nootropics in the second category, but it was difficult to do so honestly. Most nootropics companies make outrageously exaggerated claims about the potency and efficacy of their ingredients, though some will at least try to back their claims with (out-of-context) clinical evidence. We could either follow their lead and be slimy, or try to honestly advertise that putting this ground up Zimbabwean root in your tea each morning may-or-may-not produce a very slight augmentation in your focus for the day, though its effects will probably be entirely swamped by the moderate amount of caffeine in your tea.</li><li>We could sell the nootropics in the third category, but everyone on earth knows what caffeine is and how to get it, and anyone who wants melatonin can get it at Walgreens (which includes me for the last five years). So there isn’t really any way to provide a novel or valuable product to customers.</li></ul>



<p>To clarify, I don’t think nootropics are a scam or not worth investigating. But I think they’re something fun for hobbyists to mess around with, and there’s no low-hanging fruit. It’s for people like me who like doing experiments on themselves to have interesting experiences and gain insights into how our bodies work. But, there that aren’t many of these type of people out there, or at least not enough to support the type of business we were looking to create. The standard purchaser of nootropics, or at least nootropics bundles like <a href="https://patientsvitamins.com/product/limitless-pills-20ct-bottle-atomixx-blend-mood-focus-anti-anxiety-stress-free-2/?dTribesID=44a551361661c3b547b69135771c0add%7Cadtribes%7C345129&amp;utm_source=Google%20Shopping&amp;utm_campaign=112&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=345129">Atomixx Blend Limitless Pills</a>, seems to be fitness enthusiasts looking for a consistent boost, not nerds who want to do double-blind experiments on themselves.</p>



<p>This evaluation shifted my sentiments toward the business considerably. I called my friend/potential business partner and expressed my reservations. He’s a persuasive guy, and I guess sometimes I’m a gullible one, because by the end of the call, I was a little more optimistic. The way I saw it, if we were going to try to do this thing, we had two potential paths:</p>



<p>We could buy dozens of raw nootropics, mix them together in a bunch of different ways, and experiment on ourselves to see what works to find the best novel bundled nootropic combination. We could take our time, test it over months, even do double-blind experiments on ourselves and others. We could keep it simple, only use a handful of ingredients in the final product, and use them in sufficient quantities since my friend kept insisting that ordinary nootropic bundles used excessively small doses. We are smart, we can do this better than the good folks who make <a href="https://justifiedlaboratories.com/products/mega-brain-boost-5000-nootropic-improve-focus-memory-stimulate-mind">Mega Brain Boost 5000</a>.</p>



<p>Or we could just say “fuck it,” and put together a bunch of the typical ingredients (mostly caffeine) into a single pill, give it a cool name (we were throwing around “X-alt”), use our endorsements and marketing channels, and then throw it out on to the market. It wouldn’t be bold or innovative, but it could work. We could muscle in on a small slice of the market share, keep costs low with the droppshipping model, and see where it goes. And at least our product would be no worse than any other bundled nootropics company’s.</p>



<p>While my friend and I discussed these two plans, we weren’t on nootropics, but we were huffing a lot of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Hopium">hopium</a>.</p>



<p>On the first plan, another friend of mine finally knocked some common sense into me. If the thousands of obsessive nerds in r/nootropics, the rationalist community, and dozens of communities across the internet hadn’t discovered a truly viable bundled nootropic that outperformed straight caffeine, even after tinkering with these chemicals for decades, then how on earth were my friend and I going to do so in a few months? A little Efficient Market Hypothesis goes a long way to explaining how dumb many business plans are, and my case is no different, especially since Gwern had already elegantly applied the EMH to evolutionary biology and nootropics with the <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Drug-heuristics">Algernon Argument</a>.</p>



<p>The second plan was more viable, but only in that cynical, amoral, profit-maximizing sense. <em>If</em> we were producing a real product that had real benefits, then I would have no problem with strongarming our way into the market via marketing and endorsements and taking our cut. But…</p>



<p>Would we be selling a real, valuable product? Would our bundled nootropics pill stuffed with caffeine, creatine, L-theanine, and whatever else made us feel good after a few weekends of sloppy experimentation actually bring benefits to our customers?</p>



<p>The correct answer was… we didn’t know. Fortunately, my friend and I were honest enough to admit that to ourselves and each other. We took a few days to mull over the whole idea.</p>



<p>The final death blow to our glorious business plan was Slate Star Codex’s <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/10/brief-cautionary-notes-on-branded-combination-nootropics/">Brief Cautionary Notes on Branded Combination Nootropics</a> which devastatingly argues that throwing a bunch of nootropics into a pill is somewhere between highly inefficient and immoral.</p>



<p>To me, the experience of reading great writing often consists of an author reaching into my subconscious, grabbing something I know to be true but have never articulated, and dragging it to the surface of my mind into a state of explicit conceptualization.</p>



<p>Reading this article at this time was an extremely powerful form of that, almost to an eerie degree. It was like Scott Alexander had listened in on our phone calls and then traveled back in time to write an article about our stupidity.</p>



<p>I swear, my friend and I went through just about every argument in the essay. We reasoned that the nootropics market is mostly awful and it’s easy to clear the current quality …</p></div></article></div>

Mark Zuckerberg's Ponzi Scheme<br>
<span color="#A0A0A0">Congress and the FTC brought a knife to a gun fight.</span></p><div>

<p>It's already a campaign issue for the next presidential election: should we, or should we not, break up the big tech companies? Elizabeth Warren says yes. Beto O'Rourke wants "stronger regulations."  Kamala Harris would rather talk about privacy. Everyone elseâ€”even Donald Trumpâ€”generally agrees that something needs to be done. But what?</p><p>There are plenty of law professors, think tanks and political consultants eager to share their ideas, but none of them are asking the right questions. In the case of Facebook, distractions are understandable when the company arguably has the worst track record of any major technology company in history (and will soon pay a record, if toothless, $5 billion fine). Yet the unspoken issue at the center of it all remains: although Wall Street, Congress and the Federal Trade Commission haven't figured it out, Mark is running a Ponzi scheme.</p><p>At this point it should come as no surprise to anyone paying attention that Mark is a bad-faith actor. He has no appreciation for the rule of law, or the role of a free press, and he has a dangerous tendency to view himself as infallible. After discovering a gaping security flaw in his product that revealed bulk information about friends of friends, exactly like Cambridge Analytica, I warned Mark in writing about the way his sloppy code would inevitably lead him to cross paths with the FTC and cause massive privacy and security concernsâ€”in <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/timeline.pdf" target="_new">April 2005</a>. His response: problems with the "Mark Zuckerberg production" were actually someone else's responsibility and "not worth arguing about."</p><p>Clearly, Mark can no longer argue that his decisions as Facebook's CEO are immaterial (though he has <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/11/11/13596792/facebook-fake-news-mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump" target="_new">tried</a>). Many have already lost their lives, whether through avoidable suicides or avoidable genocidal acts in Myanmar, due to his string of increasingly tone-deaf and spectacularly dishonest decisions. Now, fifteen years and approximately as many false apologizes after my classmate started a grand social experiment that first captivated the media, then locked it in a profitless box, and then played a major supporting role in bringing fascism to America, the general consensus is that the best way to handle Mark and his tech brethren is through the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. But the consensus is wrong, based on a mountain of misapprehensions.</p><p>In a nutshell, the argument in favor of anti-trust action is that in the midst of the longest economic expansion in U.S. history, it's the Progressive Era all over again. A recent New York Times op-ed penned by Mark's former roommate and co-founder, Chris Hughes, made essentially this point, relying heavily on input from the Roosevelt Institute. The Open Markets Institute agrees. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM9GMGDsKUU&amp;t=24m40s" target="_new">talk at Harvard Law School</a>, Matt Stoller argued that Facebook, Google and Amazon were "born as monopolists."</p><p>It's a compelling story, so long as one is willing to ignore the reality on the ground. For one thing, software products are not railroads, which require significant physical capital and labor to establish. Were he determined to do so, it would take Mark a few weeks to re-build Instagram and WhatsApp, and there really isn't any way the government could stop him. For another, I know that on this particular issue, Stoller is incorrect, because I was there when The Facebook was born on my hard drive on September 19, 2003, in Lowell House. It hardly resembled a monopoly. Monopolies are what happen as the result of prolonged neglect by law enforcement. They're not born; they're nourished by years and years of perverse incentives.</p><p>The biggest problem with treating Facebook as a monopoly, as opposed to the byproduct of what Jesse Eisenger calls "The Chickenshit Club," is that it wrongly affirms Mark's infallibility and fails to see through him and his scheme, let alone the reality that he's not even in control anymore because no one is. On October 26, 2012, Mark's friend and lieutenant, Sam Lessin, wrote, "we are running out of humans (and have run-out of valuable humans from an advertiser perspective)."  At the time, it was far from clear that Facebook even had a viable business model, and according to Frontline, Sheryl Sandberg was panicking due to the company's poor revenue numbers.</p><p>How times have changed; now there's a different source of panic. Facebook now has a market capitalization approaching $600 billion, making it nominally one of the most valuable companies on earth. It's a true business miracle: a company that was out of users in 2012 managed to find a wellspring of nearly infinite and sustained growth that has lasted it, so far, half of the way through 2019. So what is that magical ingredient, that secret sauce, that "genius" trade secret, that turned an over-funded money-losing startup into one of America's greatest business success stories? It's one that Bernie Madoff would recognize instantly: fraud, in the form of fake accounts.</p><p>Old money goes out, and new money comes in to replace it. That's how a traditional Ponzi scheme works. Madoff kept his going for decades, managing to attain the rank of Chairman of the NASDAQ while he was at it. Zuckerberg's version is slightly different, but only slightly: old users leave after getting bored, disgusted and distrustful, and new users come in to replace them. Except that as Sam Lessin told us, the "new users" part of the equation was already getting to be a problem in 2012. To balance it out and keep "growth" on the rise, all Facebook had to do was turn a blind eye. And did it ever.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/3bvv82ier/california-northern-district-court/singer-v-facebook-inc/" target="_new"><i>Singer v. Facebook, Inc.</i></a>â€”a lawsuit filed in the Northern District of California alleging that Facebook has been telling advertisers that it can "reach" more people than actually exist in basically every major metropolitan areaâ€”the plaintiffs quote former Facebook employees, understandably identified only as Confidential Witnesses, as stating that Facebook's "Potential Reach" statistic was a "made-up PR number" and "fluff."  Also, that "those who were responsible for ensuring the accuracy â€˜did not give a shit.'"  Another individual, "a former Operations Contractor with Facebook, stated that Facebook was not concerned with stopping duplicate or fake accounts."</p><p>That's probably because according to its <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2019/Q1/Q1-2019-Earnings-Presentation.pdf" target="_new">last investor slide deck</a> and basic subtraction, Facebook is not growing anymore in the United States, with zero million new accounts in Q1 2019, and only four million new accounts since Q1 2017. That leaves the rest of the world, where Facebook is growing fastest "in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines," according to Facebook CFO David Wehner. Wehner didn't mention the fine print on page 18 of the slide deck, which highlights the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam as countries where there are "meaningfully higher" percentages of, and "episodic spikes" in, fake accounts. In other words, Facebook is growing the fastest in the locations worldwide where one finds the most fraud. In other other words, Facebook isn't growing anymore at allâ€”it's shrinking. Even India, Indonesia and the Philippines don't register as many searches for Facebook as they used to. Many of the "new" users on Instagram are actually old users from the core platform looking to escape the deluge of fakery.</p><p>The last time Mark suggested that Facebook's growth heyday might be behind it, in July 2018, the stock took a nosedive that ended up being the single largest one-day fall of any company's stock in the history of the United States. In about an hour, it <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-stock-crushed-after-revenue-user-growth-miss-2018-07-25" target="_new">plunged 20%</a> from around $220 per share to about $165. Needless to day, the loss of about $120 billion in market capitalization in an hour provided a sufficient disincentive for Mark to avoid a repeat performance.</p><p>Having narrowly escaped the ire of Wall Street, Mark knows he cannot get off the growth treadmill he set in motion years ago. The only solution: lying to investors about growth in an attempt to convince them that everything is fine. Yet signs that Mark's fake account problem is no different than Madoff's fake account statement problem are everywhere. Google Trends shows worldwide "Facebook" queries down 80% from their November 2012 peak. (Instagram doesn't even come close to making up for the loss.)  Mobile metrics measuring use of the Facebook mobile app are down. And the company's own disclosures about fake accounts stand out mostly for their internal inconsistencyâ€”one set of numbers, measured in percentages, is disclosed to the SEC, while another, with absolute figures, appears on its "transparency portal."  While they reveal a problem escalating at an alarming rate and are constantly being revised upwardâ€”Facebook claims that false accounts are at 5% and duplicate accounts at 11%, up from 1% and 6% respectively in Q2 2017â€”they don't measure quite the same things, and are <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/realitycheck/facebook.html" target="_new">impossible to reconcile</a>. At the end of 2017, Facebook decided to stop releasing those percentages on a quarterly basis, opting for an annual basis instead. Out of sight, out of mind.</p><p>One could argue that SEC disclosures are subject to strict regulations under the Securities Exchange Act and that Facebook would never be so bold as to lie to investors in black and white. That's true: it qualifies its fake account disclosures with the quizzical legal phrase "significant judgment" and it chose the color orange instead of black (insert Netflix joke here) for its transparency portal graph disclaimers that read, "These metrics are in development."  And one could further argue that the transparency portal metrics are reviewed by a team of academics, known as the Data Transparency Advisory Group (DTAG), who are supposed to vouch for their validity. But the DTAG academicsâ€”not one of whom is a statistician, despite Facebook's direct claim to the contrary, now erasedâ€”fully admit that they are paid by Facebook, and even after months of hard work, their <a href="https://law.yale.edu/system/files/area/center/justice/document/dtag_report_5.22.2019.pdf" target="_new">final report</a> released in April mentioned fake accounts only three times, and all three …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I took Heroku for granted, and a month into setting up my own infra, I now know how much it bought me.</p>
<p>A lot of my past work has been infrastructure-adjacent.
I often find myself filling in the Build &amp; Integration role - the person that gets continuous integration off the ground and keeps it actually continuing rather than falling flat on its face.
But often I’ve just been building one of a constellation of services, so the core infrastructure was already there,
or I’ve been targeting something like Heroku, where you basically pick your poison, git push, and bob’s your uncle.</p>
<p>This time, I’m putting the pieces together using the AWS toolkit.
And to smoosh them all together, I’m using Terraform,
because heck if I’m going to be hand-writing YAML or JSON and praying it’s formatted right.
Plus there’s more I want to orchestrate than just AWS, like, say, GitLab.</p>
<p>I don’t wanna talk about AWS just now.
It reminds me of learning Foundation &amp; Cocoa - you look at one piece, and it can do so much, and then you gotta put all those individually deep &amp; complex pieces together to do more stuff.
I figure if I put in the hours reading docs, learning what’s all there, and getting stabbed by the pointy bits, it’ll probably all come out fine in the end.</p>
<p>So, Terraform.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<ul>
<li>It mostly works!</li>
<li>When it doesn’t, it generally fails in a useful way, and then I can fix it and try again.</li>
<li>There are docs for most things.</li>
<li>Autoformatting works great.</li>
<li>Linting works pretty well.</li>
<li><em>Terraform: Up &amp; Running</em> is excellent, and Terragrunt makes it even easier. Huge thanks to their team for providing the <a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2018/03/23/ducttape/">duct tape</a> we need. 🙌</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-not-so-good">The Not So Good</h2>
<ul>
<li>terraform-lsp is supposed to provide autocomplete, but it mostly doesn’t, in my experience. First it flipped its lid that I dared to have a repo with multiple root modules in it, so I just aimed VS Code at the folder with a single root module. Then the language server says it’s all hunky dory AFAICT, and yet it autocompletes nothing beyond bare language syntax. As a result,  I’m manually referencing docs and writing stuff down and wasting tons of time that tools like autocomplete and integrated linting ought to be saving me from.</li>
<li>State files contain secrets in plaintext. (You might enjoy the <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/516">six-year-old GitHub issue about the plaintext secrets problem</a>.) You can mark outputs as secret, so they don’t get printed at the end of applying your infra spec, but run <code>terraform show</code> instead of <code>terraform apply</code>, and there they are, staring back at you. At least you can lock down and encrypt the S3 bucket holding the state.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/config/#secrets">Pulumi’s secrets management</a> is far more satisfying. But Pulumi is even more cutting-edge than v0.whatever Terraform, and I expect Hashicorp to keep TF running for a good while, while I’m not so confident in Pulumi, so I’m using TF. (Hashicorp of course would recommend <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault">Vault</a>.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Annoying asymmetries in the language about how you *<em>declare and reference</em> things in slightly variant ways - I trip over these over and over as a beginner:
<ul>
<li>You declare locals in a <code>locals</code> block, but you reference them as <code>local.thing</code>, not <code>locals.thing</code>.</li>
<li>You declare a variable in a <code>variable</code> block, but you reference it as <code>var.thing</code>.</li>
<li>You declare data sources as <code>data "provider_thingy" "my_name_for_this_data"</code>, and then you have to access it as <code>data.provider_thingy.my_name_for_this_data</code>. (This is actually pretty darn consistent, at least. Though, like, why the quotes around the provider thingy?)</li>
<li>You declare resources as <code>resource "provider_thingy" "my_name"</code>. But you do NOT reference them as <code>resource.provider_thingy.my_name</code>. Nope, you just reference them as bare <code>provider_thingy.my_name</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For that matter, there are other oddities as well. Pieces of syntax that seem like they should be orthogonal just aren’t. <code>for_each</code> stands out here:
<ul>
<li>You can generate multiple resources by just dropping a <code>for_each</code> in the block: <code>resource "provider_thing" "mine" {}</code> becomes <code>resource "provider_thing" "mine" { for_each = of_these }</code></li>
<li>But nested <em>argument</em> blocks require conversion from like <code>setting { namespace = "blah" }</code> to <code>dynamic "setting" { for_each = thingy; content { namespace = "blah" }}</code>. Have fun looking that up a few times.</li>
<li>And you can’t even use the <code>for_each</code> trick with module imports. It just isn’t supported. Sorry, sucks to be you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Annoying gaps in the docs:
<ul>
<li><strong>Required vs optional parameters</strong> are not very clearly called out and are not at all segregated. So you get to play the game of “what is the minimal skeleton to declare this resource”. Actually running it a few times to see what you screwed up takes longer than just looking at the docs and puzzling it out, due to the lengthy iteration times in infra-land (see below).</li>
<li><strong>Types are not shown in the docs!!!</strong> All the outputs and arguments are typed. You have to declare those types. It’s right there in the code. But the docs don’t say what any of the types are. You just hit a type error at runtime. Fun fun!</li>
<li><strong>The HCL language is doc’d under the CLI tool, not in and of itself.</strong> It was really hard to actually find the docs since my first thought when I have syntax questions isn’t “let’s look at the docs for the tool.” It’d be like pulling up the manpage for GCC (carefully draw your triangle of art first) when you have a question about C syntax.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Annoying asymmetries in the AWS provider:
<ul>
<li><strong>Missing links:</strong> Sometimes you get into a “can’t get there from here” situation. Like trying to find the zone ID for an Elastic Beanstalk environment’s CNAME so you can aim a Route 53 alias at it. (Hint, you need a completely different resource, the <code>aws_elastic_beanstalk_hosted_zone</code>.)</li>
<li><strong>Irregular naming:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes something is <code>zone_id</code>, but other times it’s maybe just <code>id</code>.</li>
<li>Sometimes you can fish stuff out by <code>arn</code>, or maybe by <code>id</code>, or maybe it’s by <code>name</code> - good luck. Keep the docs close to hand.</li>
<li>(It’s totally possible this is inherited from the AWS APIs themselves, but the whole point of an abstraction layer is to make things better and more usable, dangit.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-different">The Different</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iteration times are way longer than with even mobile apps.</strong> Like, “you’re liable to task-switch while waiting to see plan output” longer.</li>
<li><strong>Testing is a pain.</strong> I haven’t pulled in <a href="https://terratest.gruntwork.io/">Terratest</a> yet, because anyone maintaining this after me is unlikely to have Go experience, and my focus here isn’t builing reusable infra anyway - it’s building <em>this</em> infra – so I’ve just been using <code>bats</code> and Bash shell scripts (with <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/blob/master/README.md">shellcheck</a>, which is amazing) for some after-the-fact sanity checking using the AWS CLI. (Pro tip: Use the community-maintained fork <a href="https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core"><code>bats-core</code></a> rather than the no-longer-maintained sstephenson original.)
<ul>
<li>Policy assertions feel like a different flavor of test, but the tooling here seems to be fairly immature, with perhaps the exception of if you’re targeting Kubernetes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I expect I’ll get used to most of the rough edges of the syntax in another month. And Terraform is stil v0, so hey, maybe some breaking changes will clear all this mess away. 🤞</p>
<p>I’m intentionally not getting sucked into hacking around the docs frustrations just now. Or even the <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/432#issuecomment-371467507">very tempting open issue about silencing all the Terragrunt logspew</a>.</p>
<p>I do plan to spend a bit of time trying to get autocomplete working for resource and data source types and their arguments/attributes from the language server, at least. That would be a huge help.</p>
<p>It still feels like magic to run a command and have infrastructure just…happen.
You hit return, wait a bit, and suddenly servers are serving and domains are aliasing and a whole constellation of systems are interoperating.
It kinda reminds me of the magic of home automation with blinkenlights, only without any of that messy “hardware” stuff to break on you.</p>

<p>There’s a famous thought experiment in economics known as the “prisoner’s dilemma.” In it, two men have been caught committing a crime. Each of them is placed in a separate interrogation room and effectively has two options: confess or lie. There are three possible outcomes (the payoffs of which are illustrated in the payoff matrix below):</p>



<p><strong>Outcome 1</strong>: Both confess, and both serve eight years in prison (illustrated by payoff “-8, -8” in Figure A).</p>



<figure><img src="https://zandernethercutt.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/cec19-1vvzfhu09tthxuusxda1zeg.png" alt=""><figcaption>Figure A: The Prisoner’s Dilemma. Credit:&nbsp;Author</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Outcome 2</strong>: Both men lie, and both serve one year in prison (illustrated by payoff “-1, -1” in Figure A).</p>



<p><strong>Outcome 3</strong>: One man confesses while the other lies. The liar serves the longest possible sentence, 10 years, while the confessor goes free (illustrated by payoff “-10, 0” in Figure A).</p>



<p>So, if both men lie, they both get off with a lighter sentence. That appears to be the full story — except it isn’t.</p>



<p>The importance of the prisoner’s dilemma is understanding that in selecting a strategy, each player should account for the effectiveness of that strategy given what the other player might do.</p>



<p>Knowing this, consider the game from the perspective of Prisoner 1. If he thinks Prisoner 2 will lie, he should confess, because serving zero years in prison is better than serving one. If he thinks Prisoner 2 will confess, he should also confess, because serving eight years in prison is better than serving 10. In this situation, confessing is both players’ dominant strategy, the strategy they should play regardless of what the other player does.</p>



<p>This thought experiment illustrates how two self-interested individuals with a clear way to maximize their collective utility fail to do so. It also happens to be a fantastic way to understand our current moment. Millennials — not all of us, but many of us — are burned out, and the prisoner’s dilemma can shed light on why.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it also sheds light on a distressing conclusion: Barring some miracle of human coordination, our quest to optimize our lives will never slow, let alone stop. If anything, it will accelerate.</p>



<hr>



<p>Imagine a two-player labor market represented by the prisoner’s dilemma matrix. Now imagine both players encountered a service that would help optimize their lives. For a real-world example (and one I use), let’s take the premade meal delivery service Freshly.</p>



<p>Freshly claims to save people approximately two hours a week in the time they don’t have to spend grocery shopping, meal prepping, or cooking. Now imagine that both players had two choices of how they could spend those hours: either on extra leisure (e.g., sleep, Netflix, a book, etc.,) or on productivity (e.g., optimization/work).</p>



<p>What would each player choose?</p>



<p>Well, if wealth is considered freedom from busyness, or freedom to spend your time as you wish, the hour would be best spent on leisure. When forming a strategy, however — like with the prisoner’s dilemma — players must consider those strategies in the context of what the other players in the game might do. Consider the adjusted payoff matrix below:</p>



<p><strong>Outcome 1</strong>: Both players use the time afforded by the service’s convenience to optimize/work harder and thus remain in a state of constant acceleration (illustrated by payoff “1, 1” in Figure B).</p>



<figure><img src="https://zandernethercutt.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/92958-1qccvg4lbzz4zmcjpbuhs6w.png" alt=""><figcaption>Figure B: The Millennial Dilemma (leisure vs. work). Credit:&nbsp;Author.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Outcome 2</strong>: Both players use the time afforded by the service’s convenience to relax (illustrated by payoff “8, 8” in Figure A).</p>



<p><strong>Outcome 3</strong>: Player 1 uses the time afforded by the service’s convenience to optimize/work harder, while Player 2 uses it to relax. Player 1 reaps the benefits of being the only provider of labor in a market and corners it. Player 2 languishes as the world accelerates endlessly and leaves him behind (illustrated by payoff “10, 0” in Figure A).</p>



<p>Borrowing earlier analysis, it’s clear that given the payoffs, both players have a dominant strategy: work. If Player 2 relaxes, Player 1 should work because a payoff of 10 is better than a payoff of 8. If the Player 2 works, Player 1 should also work because a payoff of 1 is better than a payoff of zero.</p>



<p>Now, remember, these payoffs — and their explanations — are completely made up. In the modern era, there is no reason to be convinced that torturing yourself with additional employment is associated with any improvement in your lifestyle. And yet this is exactly how most people behave.</p>



<p>Thus, we arrive at our new Nash equilibrium: Both players use a service — mind you, a service built to supposedly make their lives easier and more relaxing — that ends up making their lives more stressful and complex. Put another way, both players burn out.</p>



<hr>



<p>In a recent viral BuzzFeed article, “<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">How Millennials Became The Burnout Generation</a>,” Anne Helen Petersen notes this seeming paradox of leisure, specifically as it pertains to freed up time. She writes:</p>



<blockquote><p>Attempts [by companies] to discourage working “off the clock” misfire, as millennials read them not as permission to stop working, but a means to further distinguish themselves by being available anyway.</p></blockquote>



<p>In other words: Attempts by companies like Google or Freshly to create services that save you time misfire, as millennials see them not as services that will give them more time to relax, but as services that will increase the amount of time they’re available to work.</p>



<p>As employees in a hyperproductive, work-obsessed world, we’ve become acutely aware of any opportunity for optimization. Our Instagram feeds are filled with every possible combination of meal delivery service and online shopper that exists. Startups emerge daily to automate every mundane activity ever scrawled on and scratched off a legal pad.</p>



<p>The escalators I take to work are filled with the same desperate faces and vacant eyes I feel staring through me on the subway, except instead of standing still, they’re bounding up it, subconsciously aware that below their feet is yet another opportunity to optimize on an existing convenience. This, if anything, is a symptom of our current moment: People ignoring the luxury of a moving staircase in favor of whatever sprinting up it can transport them to faster.</p>



<p>There’s a kind of sick satisfaction derived from optimizing one’s own life, and there’s a good reason: Being able to do so is a status symbol. Only the most successful are free enough to spend their time finding better ways to spend their time. For those at the very top, I imagine these methods of optimization can actually exist in a vacuum; billionaires can optimize for the sake of optimizing, rather than to keep their head above water. For the rest of the world, optimization is a survival mechanism. To them, the tools that are luxuries to those at the top are good for one thing and one thing only: freeing up time that is only ever used to get more done.</p>



<hr>



<p>The one bright side to all this productivity should be that everyone makes more money, but that’s all too often not the case. The popular narrative is that we’re all working harder, but “wages haven’t risen in 40 years,” and “purchasing power is lower now than any point in recent memory.” The economist in me has always struggled with this line of thinking. Wages are only truly relevant indicators of wealth in the sense that they allow you increased control over how you spend your time. If you’re earning a wage and a service comes along that saves you the time and effort you’d normally have to expend to access a certain good (read: Freshly for meals), that service effectively increases the value of your existing wage. Thus, even though you’re not earning any more money, you’re now wealthier.</p>



<p>For consumers, services like Google and Freshly do exactly this.</p>



<p>The media, though — and a select few politicians — prefer a different narrative. “There’s a finite amount of money in the world,” they effectively claim, “and since we’re making less, and tech companies are making more, it follows that tech companies are to blame for wage stagnation, which is a net bad, always.”</p>



<p>Reality, though, isn’t that simple.</p>



<p>Though companies like Google and Amazon do generate healthy — and yes, <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/corporate-profits" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">quite frankly absurd</a> — returns for their executive teams and shareholders, they’re valuable because people find whatever they offer to be worth more than whatever they’re being asked to pay for it. In the case of Google, that offering is time (via frictionless access to information), and its price is effectively zero. The partial rationalization I make for stagnant wages, then, is that Google and services like it allow people to get more out of the same wage.</p>



<p>In this world, Google and its contemporaries are to blame for wage stagnation, but only because they’re creating a world where wages are no longer necessarily synonymous with wealth. Ergo, wage stagnation at the hands of tech companies — everyone’s favorite narrative — is a feature, not a bug.</p>



<p>The problem with this line of thinking, though, gets at the root of both the millennial …</p></div></div>

      <h2 id="flatbuffer-as-serialization-agnostic-idl">FlatBuffer as serialization agnostic IDL</h2>

<p>Many popular IDLs mix the following two separate concerns into one leading to less than optimal results.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Language agnostic type system supporting enums, types and variants/unions.</li>
  <li>RPC oriented wire format with backward compatibility as a first class concern</li>
</ul>

<p>Mixing these two concerns has many downsides. The first one is the weakening of the type system.
Suppose we have a union containing two things:</p>



<p>The generated code from the IDL compiler may add a third state - “not defined” or similar to deal with the
case that the RPC was sent from an old client. This concern now permeates code at other layers in the stack
where one doesn’t necessarily need to worry about this third state. This could happen for example if we fail
the request at the lower levels of the stack and deal with only two possibilities in the application logic.</p>

<p>Secondly, scalars and types may have different syntax in how optionality is expressed. My understanding is that
this is also driven by the serialization concern in the flatbuffer IDL.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-serialziation-then">What about serialziation then?</h2>

<p>Yes, someone has to do the work for serialization. A good way forward is to do it in a language specific library.
Rust has <code>serde</code> and Python has pure-protobuf.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>@message
@dataclass
class Cat:
    name: str
    age: int
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="example-idl">Example IDL</h2>

<p>This work (<a href="http://github.com/adsharma/flattools">flattools</a>) separates these two concerns as described above. It adopts the flatbuffer IDL (since it doesn’t have the
field numbering concern in the IDL, significantly simplyfying the language). Attributes have been used to support 
high level type safe concepts such as Protocols and Views (a concept similar to graphql fragments).</p>

<p>Here is a flatbuffer derived IDL file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>enum Color : byte { Red = 1, Green, Blue }

table NamedAnimal (protocol) {
    name : string (required);
    age : short;
}

table Colorophile (view) {
    favorite_color: Color;
}

table Animal {
    name : string (required);
    length: ulong;
}

// Some languages prefer protocols like NamedAnimal
// as a subclass syntactically. When all supported
// languages do so, it's ok to add the protocol here
table Person (Animal, Colorophile) {
    address : string;
    age : short = 18;
}

table Product {
    label: string;
    price: int;
}

union Item {
    Product,
    Person,
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running it through the generator results in the following Rust code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// automatically generated by the FlatBuffers compiler, do not modify
#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
enum Color {
    Red = 1,
    Green = 2,
    Blue = 3,
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
pub struct NamedAnimal {
    pub name: String,
    pub age: Option&lt;i16&gt;,
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
pub struct Animal {
    pub name: String,
    pub length: Option&lt;u64&gt;,
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
pub struct Person {
    pub address: Option&lt;String&gt;,
    pub age: Option&lt;i16&gt;,
    pub favorite_color: Color,
}

impl Default for Person {
    fn default() -&gt; Person {
        Person {
           age: Some(18),
          ..Default::default()
        }
    }
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
pub struct Product {
    pub label: Option&lt;String&gt;,
    pub price: Option&lt;i32&gt;,
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
enum Item {
    Product,
    Person,
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similar output exists for Kotlin, Swift and Python3 + dataclasses in the same directory.</p>

<h3 id="backward-compatibility">Backward Compatibility</h3>

<p>Using the <code>deprecated</code> attribute is recommended.</p>

<h3 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Expand the set of supported languages</li>
  <li>Add decorators for serialization</li>
</ul>

<p>In the realm of ultra-powerful ARM Silicon for mobile computers, Apple and Microsoft can claim they have the two most powerful, but between them which one performs the best? We will examine specs for both Apple’s new M1 and Microsoft’s SQ2 chip. </p>



<p>Apple’s commitment to move all of their Macs to Apple-made Silicon has culminated in the three new Macs announced yesterday, Mac mini, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro powered by Apple’s M1. Apple’s continued innovation with its silicon and is chips are still the ones to beat in the industry.</p>

<p>Microsoft is taking a different approach, the company is developing Windows 10 for both x86 and ARM chips concurrently, which could maintain its dominance in enterprise and gaming but could deprive the oxygen Windows 10 on ARM needs to win over developers and prosumers alike. Perhaps our recent reporting that <a href="https://platform-decentral.com/2020/09/30/arms-race-windows-x64-emulation-and-more-is-coming-to-arm-pcs-in-november/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://platform-decentral.com/2020/09/30/arms-race-windows-x64-emulation-and-more-is-coming-to-arm-pcs-in-november/">Windows 10 on ARM is gaining 64-bit legacy app emulation</a> support this month, will help a bit.</p>

<h2>Apple’s M1 benchmarks</h2>



<p>Apple’s new M1 in the MacBook Air has new benchmarks revealing the massive performance of Apple’s new silicon. Below is a screenshot of Apple’s recent claims that Apple M1 outperforms the “Latest PC laptop chip” but without any specifics on which one. At least when compared to the Surface Pro X Apple’s new M1-powered MacBook Air wipes the floor with it, it’s not even close.</p>

<p>The Surface Pro X has something that none of the M1-powered Macs have, LTE. The Surface Pro X has LTE which means that even if you are not near Wi-Fi, you will still be connected. It is likely that the M1 will outperform the SQ2 in the benchmarks because the A14 Bionic in the iPad Air slightly outperforms  the SQ2 chip inside the Surface Pro X.</p>

<h3>This is for you if:</h3>



<ol><li>Your python IDE of choice is PyCharm</li><li>You wish you had a command-line replacement for PyCharm on all the places you ssh into</li><li>You wish you had access to at least <em>some</em> of the niceties of PyCharm when editing a one-off script, without having to create/import it into a new project.</li><li>You are somewhat familiar with vim and can comfortably edit a single file on vim. You also know what a <code>.vimrc</code> is</li></ol>

<h3>Motivation</h3>



<p>PyCharm has worked wonderfully well for me, and the only time where I have to use something else is when I ssh into a server to put together a quick script. That something else tends to be vim, and this is an attempt to get vim as close to PyCharm as possible – especially  the shortcuts so that I can work on vim the way I work on PyCharm (well, almost). The end result is still a far cry from PyCharm, but it makes navigating a codebase over ssh significantly less painful (at least for me) </p>



<h3>But PyCharm can work over ssh</h3>



<p>Yeah, but I don’t use PyCharm for one-off scripts. Besides, it pleases me to know that if I can ssh into the server (from an ipad, a phone, or a washing machine), I have an (approximate) IDE I can work on. </p>



<h3>List of working approximations</h3>



<ul><li>Sorta kinda uses the same colorscheme as PyCharm</li><li>Toggles a project navigation sidebar (NERDTree) using <code>alt + 1</code> . Approximates PyCharm’s <code>Ctrl+1</code> </li><li>Comment/uncomment multiple lines using <code>Ctrl+/</code>, just like PyCharm</li><li>Autocomplete</li><li>Navigate to the definition of a method/variable using <code>Ctrl + Left click</code> or <code>Ctrl + b</code>, just like PyCharm</li><li>Jump to the previous location using <code>Alt + -</code> . Approximates PyCharm’s <code>Ctrl + Alt + Left Arrow</code></li><li>Fuzzy search for files using <code>Ctrl + o</code>. Approximates PyCharm’s double shift press</li><li>Search the entire code base using <code>Alt + f</code>.

<h3>Why not just use python-mode?</h3>



<p>I simply could not figure out the shortcuts that <a href="https://github.com/python-mode/python-mode">python-mode</a> used. I thought it would be easier and more flexible if I install and configure the plugins myself.</p>



<h3>Prerequisites</h3>



<ul><li>vim 8</li><li>A Python virtualenv (or a conda environment). There’s some <code>pip install</code> involved, though this is optional</li><li>Patience</li></ul>



<h3>TL;DR</h3>



<p>Go <a href="https://github.com/kevinmartinjos/vimcharm">here</a> for the <code>.vimrc</code></p>



<h3>Let’s start from a blank .vimrc</h3>



<p>If you need a project-specific <code>.vimrc</code>, see <a href="https://andrew.stwrt.ca/posts/project-specific-vimrc/">this</a>. If not, everything goes into your <code>~/.vimrc</code></p>



<p>Let us begin by being able to see line numbers and some sort of syntax highlighting everywhere. Put these on your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>


<pre title="">" Some basic stuff
set number
set showmatch
syntax on
imap jj &lt;Esc&gt;
</pre>


<p>The <code>set showmatch</code> is for highlighting matching parentheses – that’s useful. The last line maps double pressing the <code>j</code> key in insert mode to <code>&lt;Esc&gt;</code> – no more reaching for that far away Escape key using your pinky!</p>



<h3>NERDTree for the sidebar</h3>



<p>We’ll start our plugin-hoarding with <a href="https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree">NERDTree</a>. With Vim 8, we can simply copy over a plugin directory to a certain place and Vim would just “pick it up” – there’s no need to use a  plugin manager for achieving VimCharm. Create the necessary directory structure and clone NERDTree:</p>


<pre title="">mkdir ~/.vim/pack/vimcharm/start/ -p
git clone https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree.git ~/.vim/pack/vimcharm/start/nerdtree
</pre>


<p>Open some file (any file) on vim and type <code>:NERDTreeToggle</code> – you should see the sidebar. Executing the same command again would close the NERDTree. PyCharm by default opens/closes the sidebar using <code>Ctrl + 1</code> . However, the terminal (and consequently Vim) cannot differentiate between 1 and <code>Ctrl + 1</code>, so we’ll map this to <code>Alt + 1</code> instead. Before we do that, we need to determine what characters are sent by the terminal when we press the key combo. Simply run <code>cat</code> without any arguments, and press <code>Alt + 1</code>. You should see something like this:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="307" data-permalink="https://kevinmartinjose.com/alt1/" data-orig-file="https://kevinmartinjose.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/alt1.png" data-orig-size="287,71" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="alt1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://kevinmartinjose.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/alt1.png?w=287" data-large-file="https://kevinmartinjose.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/alt1.png?w=287" src="https://kevinmartinjose.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/alt1.png?w=287" alt="" srcset="https://kevinmartinjose.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/alt1.png 287w, https://kevinmartinjose.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/alt1.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px"></figure>



<p>You would also see that <code>1</code> and <code>Ctrl+1</code> produces the same character on <code>cat</code> – as far as I know, there’s no way around this.</p>



<p>We need to map the character sequence for <code>Alt + 1</code> to <code>:NERDTreeToggle</code> on our <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>


<pre title="">set &lt;A-1&gt;=^[1
nmap &lt;A-1&gt; :NERDTreeToggle&lt;CR&gt;

</pre>


<p><strong>Take care not to simply copy paste the character sequence on to your <code>.vimrc</code>! </strong>That won’t work. You should open your <code>.vimrc</code> on Vim, go to <code>insert</code> mode, and press <code>Ctrl+v</code> – this would put a caret under your cursor – now press <code>Alt + 1</code> and it should fill in the necessary characters there. Restart vim, and <code>Alt+1</code> should now open and close NERDTree.</p>



<h3>Making it <em>look</em> like PyCharm</h3>



<p><a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox">Gruvbox</a> looks like the default PyCharm theme, kinda, so let’s get that:</p>


<pre title="">git clone https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox.git ~/.vim/pack/vimcharm/start/gruvbox

</pre>


<p>According to the <a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox/wiki/Installation">installation</a> page, we need to add this to our <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>


<pre title="">autocmd vimenter * ++nested colorscheme gruvbox
</pre>


<h3>Commenting and Uncommenting lines using Ctrl + /</h3>



<p>We are going to use <a href="https://github.com/preservim/nerdcommenter">NERDCommenter</a> for this. Clone it into the right directory, just as before:</p>


<pre title=""> git clone https://github.com/preservim/nerdcommenter ~/.vim/pack/vimcharm/start/nerdcommenter

</pre>


<p><code>Ctrl+/</code> cannot be directly mapped on your <code>.vimrc</code>. So just like before, we insert the correct escaped character sequence into our <code>.vimrc</code> by going into insert mode, pressing <code>Ctrl+v</code>, and then pressing the desired keycombo (<code>Ctrl + /</code> in this case).</p>


<pre title="">" The part after "=" in the below line should be inserted using Ctrl+v while in insert mode and then pressing Ctrl+/
set &lt;F13&gt;=^_
noremap &lt;F13&gt; :call NERDComment(0,"toggle")&lt;CR&gt;

" So that NERDCommenter can automatically decide how to comment a particular filetype
filetype plugin on

</pre>


<p>We are telling Vim to map the character sequences that <code>Ctrl + /</code> produces to the <code>F13</code> key, which probably does not exist on your keyboard, and then we map <code>F13</code> to the appropriate command to toggle comments. Restart Vim, open (or create) a python file and try <code>Ctrl + /</code> while in normal mode – it should comment/uncomment the line.</p>



<h3>Autocomplete</h3>



<p>Autocomplete on Vim does not feel as “fluid” as on PyCharm  – for example, I haven’t managed to get it to work on imports – but it is still besser als nichts. Get <a href="https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim">jedi-vim</a>:</p>


<pre title=""> git clone https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim ~/.vim/pack/vimcharm/start/jedi-vim

</pre>


<p>Restart vim, and <code>Ctrl + space</code> should already be giving you autocomplete suggestions. IMHO, jedi-vim displays too much information (what even is that bar thing that comes up on  top?) – all I wanted was a simple autocomplete prompt. Put this on your <code>.vimrc</code> to Make Autocomplete Great Again:</p>


<pre title="">let jedi#show_call_signatures = 0
let jedi#documentation_command = ""
autocmd FileType python setlocal completeopt-=preview

</pre>


<h3>Go-to definition using Ctrl+click</h3>



<p>This is something that jedi-vim already does – all we need are some <code>.vimrc</code> entries:</p>


<pre title="">set mouse=a
let g:jedi#goto_command = "&lt;C-LeftMouse&gt;"
map &lt;C-b&gt; &lt;C-LeftMouse&gt;

</pre>


<p>The above lines enable mouse support on Vim, sets <code>Ctrl + left click</code> as the combination for jedi’s goto command, and then recursively maps <code>Ctrl+b</code> (which is also what PyCharm uses by default) to <code>Ctrl + left click</code> as a keyboard-friendly alternative.</p>



<p>I also prefer the goto command to open a new tab when navigating to a different file. Here’s how to enable that, along with <code>Shift+j</code> and <code>Shift+k</code> to move between tabs:</p>


<pre title="">let g:jedi#use_tabs_not_buffers = 1
nnoremap J :tabp&lt;CR&gt;
nnoremap K :tabn&lt;CR&gt;
</pre>


<h3>Jump to previous location using Alt + minus</h3>



<p>If you end up navigating multiple tabs away using <code>Ctrl+b</code>, you can press <code>Ctrl+</code>o repeatedly to jump back to your original position.  Press <code>Ctrl+i</code> to go in the other direction. These would come in handy if you have to quickly <code>gg</code> to the beginning of the file to add an import – you can then press <code>Ctrl+o</code> to go back to the line you were editing. I believe in PyCharm the default mappings for this are <code>Ctrl + Alt + Left arrow</code> and <code>Ctrl + Alt + right arrow</code> respectively.  I remapped these to <code>Alt + -</code> and <code>Alt + Shift + -</code> (that would be in fact <code>Alt + _</code> ):</p>


<pre title="">set &lt;A--&gt;=^[-
noremap &lt;A--&gt; &lt;C-O&gt;
set &lt;A-_&gt;=^[_
noremap &lt;A-_&gt; &lt;C-I&gt;

</pre>


<p>Remember that copy-pasting these won’t work and you will have to enter insert mode and press <code>Ctrl+v</code> and then <code>Alt + -</code></p>



<h3>Fuzzy file search</h3>



<p>Fuzzy file search is what PyCharm does when you press the Shift key twice. </p>



<p>Download <a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">CtrlP</a>:</p>


<pre title="">git clone https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim.git ~/.vim/pack/vimcharm/start/ctrlp
</pre>


<p>By default pressing <code>Ctrl+p</code> should bring up the search prompt. We can’t map this to double shift (as in PyCharm) since vim can’t recognize <code>Shift</code> key presses (unless it’s combined with a printable character). I decided to map this to <code>Ctrl + </code>o instead (“o” for open), though this is not any better than the default setting. On your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>


<pre title="">let g:ctrlp_map='&lt;C-O&gt;'
let g:ctrlp_cmd='CtrlPMixed'
</pre>


<p>The second line above specifies that the search should be over files, buffers, tags e.t.c – you may omit it if you do not want buffers to show up on your search. <code>ctrl+t</code> on a search result will open it in a new tab. </p>



<h3>Search everywhere and replace</h3>



<p>One of the most useful features in PyCharm is the “search in project” dialog that <code>Ctrl + Shift + f</code> brings up. For example, if  I delete/rename a hard-coded string literal, this is the dialog that I would bring up to look for all occurrences of that string literal so that I can rename/delete all of them – right from the search window.</p>



<p>Instead of using the built-in <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Find_in_files_within_Vim">vimgrep</a> or making an external call to the ubiquitous grep, we are going to use <a href="https://beyondgrep.com/why-ack/">ack</a> because it excludes annoying things like gitignore and binaries from the search results by …</p></div></article></div>

Why and how did I do it?</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>Whenever I need to quickly look something up (or use a calculator), I open a
new terminal (using a keyboard shortcut) and start typing into it. Slow bash
startup disrupts this workflow as I would often type before the shell prompt:</p>

<p><img src="https://work.lisk.in/img/even-faster-bash-startup/mistype.png" alt="messed up prompt"></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/danpker">Daniel Parker</a> recently wrote an excellent blog post <a href="https://danpker.com/posts/2020/faster-bash-startup/">Faster Bash
Startup</a> detailing his journey from 1.7 seconds to 210&nbsp;ms. I start at 165&nbsp;ms
and need to go significantly lower than Daniel, therefore different techniques
will be needed.</p>

<h3 id="investigation">Investigation</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine">hyperfine</a> is a brilliant command-line tool for benchmarking commands that
I discovered recently (thanks to Daniel!), so let’s see where we are now:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):     165.8 ms ±   0.7 ms    [User: 156.3 ms, System: 12.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):   164.9 ms … 167.1 ms    17 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we need to find out what’s taking so long. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5014823/how-to-profile-a-bash-shell-script-slow-startup/20855353">How to profile a bash shell
script slow startup?</a> Most Stack Overflow answers suggest some
variant of <code>set -x</code>, which will help us find any single command that takes
unusually long.</p>

<h4 id="man">man</h4>

<p>In my case, that command was <code>man -w</code>, specifically <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/7d14190467fe22bf5d4f85a7b202118d2341e3ed/.bashrc.d/10_env.sh#L8-L10">this piece of my
<code>.bashrc.d/​10_env.sh</code></a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>MANPATH</span><span>=</span><span>$HOME</span>/.local/share/man:
<span># FIXME: workaround for /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/man</span>
<span>MANPATH</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>man <span>-w</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Turns out none of this is needed any more, <code>man</code> and <code>manpath</code> now add
<code>~/.local/​share/​man</code> automatically so I can just drop it and save more than
100&nbsp;ms<sup id="fnref:man-seccomp" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:man-seccomp">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h4 id="death-by-a-thousand-cuts">death by a thousand cuts</h4>

<p>But that’s it. No other single command stands out, it’s just a lot of small
things that add up. Daniel says “it has to take <em>some</em> time,” and he’s mostly
right, but I still have one trick up my sleeve.</p>

<p>My <code>.bashrc</code> is split into several smaller parts in <code>~/.bashrc.d</code>, so I can
profile these and see if anything stands out. My
<a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/68964611b4b578b646cf5f13a47a4ee77e93e740/.bashrc"><code>.bashrc</code></a>
thus becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for </span>i <span>in</span> ~/.bashrc.d/<span>*</span>.sh<span>;</span> <span>do
	if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$__bashrc_bench</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
		</span><span>TIMEFORMAT</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$i</span><span>: %R"</span>
		<span>time</span> <span>.</span> <span>"</span><span>$i</span><span>"</span>
		<span>unset </span>TIMEFORMAT
	<span>else</span>
		<span>.</span> <span>"</span><span>$i</span><span>"</span>
	<span>fi
done</span><span>;</span> <span>unset </span>i
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s see what happens…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ __bashrc_bench=1 bash -i
/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/10_env.sh: 0,118
/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/20_history.sh: 0,000

/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/90_fzf.sh: 0,011
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>118&nbsp;ms in <code>10_env.sh</code> was caused by <code>man -w</code> and we know what to do with that.</p>

<h4 id="completions">completions</h4>

<p>11&nbsp;ms in <code>31_​completion.sh</code> which loads <a href="https://github.com/scop/bash-completion">bash-completion</a>. That’s
certainly better than Daniel’s 235&nbsp;ms, probably because up-to-date
bash-completion only loads a few necessary completions and defers everything
else to being loaded on demand. I couldn’t live without the completions, so
11&nbsp;ms is a fair price.</p>

<p>8&nbsp;ms for <code>50_​git_​dotfiles.sh</code>, which defines a few aliases and
sets up git completions for my <code>git-dotfiles</code> alias, seems too much, though.
Good news is that we don’t need to drop this. We can use bash-completion’s
on-demand loading. Whenever completions for command <code>cmd</code> are needed for the
first time, bash-completion looks for
<code>~/.local/​share/​bash-completion/​completions/​cmd</code> or
<code>/usr/​share/​bash-completion/​completions/​cmd</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore,
<a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/68964611b4b578b646cf5f13a47a4ee77e93e740/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/git-dotfiles"><code>~/.local/​share/​bash-completion/​completions/​git-dotfiles</code></a>
becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>. /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/git
complete -F _git git-dotfiles
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="fzf">fzf</h4>

<p><code>90_fzf.sh</code> loads key bindings and completions code so that <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> is used
when searching through history, completing <code>**</code> in filenames, etc. Well worth
the 11&nbsp;ms it needs to load<sup id="fnref:fzf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fzf">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h4 id="are-we-done-yet">are we done yet?</h4>

<p>After these changes, I got:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ __bashrc_bench=1 bash -i
/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/10_env.sh: 0,001
/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/20_history.sh: 0,000

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s 29&nbsp;ms, brilliant! Or… is it? <emoji>🤔</emoji></p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):      55.7 ms ±   1.0 ms    [User: 47.6 ms, System: 11.1 ms]
  Range (min … max):    54.8 ms …  58.9 ms    53 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="history">history</h4>

<p>Some of those additional 26&nbsp;ms are spent reading my huge
(<code>HISTSIZE=​50000</code>) <code>.bash_​history</code> file. I will skip the details
about how I investigated this, because I didn’t: I stumbled upon this by
chance while testing something else.</p>

<p>We can see that using an empty history file brings us down to a little under
40&nbsp;ms:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ HISTFILE=/tmp/.bash_history_tmp hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):      38.6 ms ±   0.7 ms    [User: 34.0 ms, System: 7.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):    37.8 ms …  42.3 ms    75 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, cutting 17&nbsp;ms by sacrificing the shell history is probably not a good
deal for most people. I settled for setting up a systemd
<a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/f978be7424946afebe56dbe5ecc85c9f36d1e057/.config/systemd/user/liskin-backup-bash-history.timer">timer</a>
to <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/f978be7424946afebe56dbe5ecc85c9f36d1e057/bin/liskin-backup-bash-history">back up
<code>.bash_​history</code></a>
to git once a day and lowered <code>HISTSIZE</code> to 5000<sup id="fnref:history" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:history">3</a></sup>. This still keeps
my bash startup below 40&nbsp;ms:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):      39.9 ms ±   0.5 ms    [User: 36.1 ms, System: 6.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):    39.1 ms …  42.1 ms    73 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>By dropping unnecessary invocation of <code>man -w</code>, deferring loading of git
completions to when they’re needed, and shortening my shell history file, I

<p>More importantly, I no longer type before the prompt, even if I try!</p>

<p>Redditor <em>buttellmewhynot</em> (pun intended)
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/jxfm2y/even_faster_bash_startup_165_ms_40_ms/gcxiigg/">comments</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel like it shouldn’t matter that the shell starts with a delay. If you
start a shell, the computer should assume that you want further input
directed there and queue somewhere to send it to the shell when it’s up.</p>

  <p>I understand that there’s probably a lot of weird quirks about how terminals
and shells work and how processes get created but surely there’s a way to do
this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They’re right on both points. The input is queued somewhere, and there is a
way to fix the messed up prompt. As some might suspect, <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a> handles it
fine: try running <code>sleep 5</code> and type some input in the meantime:</p>

  <table>

</tr>
</tbody></table>
  <figcaption>pending input handling without custom prompt</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We can see that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in all cases, the input appears twice (bit annoying, but tolerable)</li>
  <li>zsh prompt is never messed up</li>
  <li>bash prompt is messed up if there’s no newline after the input<sup id="fnref:readline-assumes" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:readline-assumes">5</a></sup></li>
  <li>no input is discarded, in contrast to the first image of this post</li>
</ul>

<p>Turns out <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/460bdc3c5fa814b874c19d172ce0e3955e278207/.bashrc.d/20_prompt.sh#L13-L27">my PROMPT_COMMAND</a> which was meant to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/19943482/3407728">ensure
the prompt always starts on new line</a> was discarding
the pending input. Zsh uses <a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/blob/19390a1ba8dc983b0a1379058e90cd51ce156815/Src/utils.c#L1599">a different approach</a>,
printing <code>$COLUMNS</code> spaces and then a carriage return
(<a href="https://serverfault.com/a/97543">explanation</a>), which I don’t like as it messes
up copy/paste. But I <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/compare/a5db1831b37f89e00a637bcc20594a4fcf16de1d^...322ad36ec1d3ee5485c7b637e4c41fff7ea6745c">managed to improve my solution</a> to
correctly detect pending input and not discard it.</p>

<p><img src="https://work.lisk.in/img/even-faster-bash-startup/earlytype.png" alt="not messed up prompt after early typing"></p>

<p>It’s not perfect (so I’ll still try to keep bash startup fast), but it’s
definitely an improvement, and it will be useful whenever I get impatient with
a slow command and start typing the next command before the prompt appears.</p>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/buttellmewhynot"><em>buttellmewhynot</em></a> for
nudging me in the correct direction.</p>

November 22, 2020 | https://informedpm.com/posts/great-product-manager | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://informedpm.com/posts/great-product-manager">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>What sets great product managers apart from merely good ones? </span></p> <p><span>It is a difficult question to answer because there are so many things that "great" product managers do. And because the discipline itself is changing very quickly. There is no universal answer. But it is a question worth asking.</span></p> <p><span>I tackled this question by interviewing industry leaders, drawing on my own experience, and research. </span></p> <p><span>Here are the top traits, principles, and tactics I collected, that great product managers tend to share.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Data + Intuition</span></h3></p> <p><span>As product managers, we face many decisions every day. But what does "effective decision making" mean?</span></p> <p><span>Being "data-driven" is a good start. But the term is so overused that it has lost its meaning. It also has its blind spots. </span></p> <p><span>Here is how </span> <a href="https://twitter.com/trevin" target="_blank"><span>Trevin Chow</span></a> <span>, Director of Product at Nike, put it:</span></p> <div><blockquote><span>Great product managers are able to find the right balance between data and intuition at any given moment to inform and drive their decision making. This could be something as small a bug fix, or something much larger such as which features to include in a v1 vs what to cut.

The best product managers I've worked with are able to do this very well, balancing all sorts of inputs of "data" and combining it with their intuition to find the right balance of any given moment on what to index on.</span></blockquote></div>  <p><h3><span>Truth-Seeking</span></h3></p> <p><span>Both scientists and product managers play a truth-seeking game — scientists test their ideas in the natural world; product managers test theirs in the market.</span></p> <p><span>﻿</span> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielfalabella" target="_blank"><span>Daniel Falabella</span></a> <span>, Director of Product at Duolingo, believes that "90% of a Product Manager’s job is to find 'truth'". And this is one reason why Daniel thinks that entrepreneurs make the best PMs. He added,</span></p> <div><blockquote><span>Lots of PMs go through the motions: they talk to teammates, become familiar with vanity metrics, talk to 2 users, or assume that their managers are right. They give the illusion of having the right inputs, only to pay up the price when it's time to discuss outputs.</span></blockquote></div>  <p><h3><span>Adaptable</span></h3></p> <p><span>Product managers are responsible for the success of their products. But the path to get there is rarely straight-forward.  </span></p>  <div><blockquote><span>Great PMs are adaptable. They know when to go into execution mode, and when to step back and work on strategy. They make everyone around them feel heard. At the end of the day, they make their customers and business successful, and their teams and cross functional partners want to work with them over and over again.</span></blockquote></div>   <div><blockquote><span>Underrated skill for founders: Altitude shifting. 

People are often either good at high-level strategy or atomic-level execution, but rarely both.

It's the ability to zoom out &amp; paint the 5 yr vision, and then drop down into the weeds of day-to-day, &amp; see how the two connect.</span></blockquote></div>  <p><h3><span>First Principles</span></h3></p> <p><span>﻿</span> <a href="https://blackboxofpm.com/" target="_blank"><span>Brandon Chu</span></a> <span>, VP Product &amp; GM of Platform at Shopify, </span> <a href="https://blackboxofpm.com/the-first-principles-of-product-management-ea0e2f2a018c" target="_blank"><span>wrote in an article</span></a> <span> that some of the best PMs he knows make their decisions based on first principles. He explained,</span></p> <div><blockquote><span>First principle thinking helps PMs because as companies scale, communicating the rationale behind historical, current, and future decisions can be simplified in a way that their team and stakeholders can rally around. </span></blockquote></div> <div><blockquote><span>This enables people around the PM to move quickly in the same direction, decouple, and make smart trade offs without their presence.</span></blockquote></div>    <p><h3><span>Deep Understanding of the Problem</span></h3></p> <p><span>It is tempting, especially for the technically-minded folks, to start with an idea for a solution and run with it. But building a great product requires understanding the problem, and understanding the person behind the problem.</span></p>  <div><blockquote><span>If you get on the ground and hear what people are suffering from, then you can have a deeper understanding of what needs to be done. It’s not just empathy. It’s being specific and zoning in on the areas of improvement based on people’s real experiences."</span></blockquote></div>  <p><span>﻿</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/lissijean" target="_blank"><span>Melissa Perri</span></a> <em>, </em> <span>CEO and founder of Produx Labs, </span> <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/melissa-perri/" target="_blank"><span>said in an interview</span></a> <span> that "
what sets a decent product manager apart from a really great product manager, is really the way they think and approach problems". She continued,</span></p> <div><blockquote><span>To me, thinking like a product manager is about problem solving. It’s about synthesizing a lot of information, understanding the system, trying to piece together what is the problem, breaking it down into small manageable chunks so you can analyze it, and then figuring out what is the right solution from there.</span></blockquote></div>  <p><h3><span>Humble and Coachable</span></h3></p> <p><span>Being humble/coachable is what Daniel (from earlier) considers the other important trait of a great product manager.</span></p> <p><span>Related to the truth-seeking point, you will be wrong a lot throughout your career. This may be a tough pill to swallow for the smart and ambitious ones. But it is an important part of growing as a person and learning to make better decisions over time.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Evangelize</span></h3></p> <p><span>Your work isn't done when the requirements are defined, or even when the product gets shipped. </span></p>  <div><blockquote><span>If you’re not sick of saying it, you probably aren’t saying it enough. Constant communication might feel like “fluff,” but it isn’t. Evangelism is a critical part of the role—and it’s your job to make sure the organization is aligned and swimming in the same direction.</span></blockquote></div> <p><span>And that,</span></p> <div><blockquote><span>For you [product managers], communication&nbsp;</span> <em>is</em> <span>&nbsp;a primary “output,” and it should be exceptional.</span></blockquote></div>  <p><h3><span>Resourceful</span></h3></p> <p><span>There are always more things to build than there is time for. And often, you don't get as many people working on your product as you would like.</span></p> <p><span>Mastering the art of stretching resources given a tight budget is valuable.</span></p> <p><span>This could mean finding cheaper technical workarounds. This could mean ruthlessly focusing on the small number of things that will really move the needle.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Love of Making Things</span></h3></p> <p><span>﻿</span> <a href="https://www.ellenchisa.com/" target="_blank"><span>Ellen Chisa</span></a> <span>, Co-founder of Dark and former VP of Product at Lola, </span> <a href="https://mokriya.com/blog/the-new-product-manager-a-conversation-with-ellen-chisa/" target="_blank"><span>said in an interview</span></a> <span> that, "You have to really love making things, but you have to be okay with not being the person actually making the thing."</span></p> <p><span>Having a genuine love for making things is powerful. This intrinsic motivation can keep you going, especially when things get difficult.</span></p> <p><span>This genuine interest also translates to you noticing other cool products in your life and building things outside of work.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>At the End of the Day</span></h3></p> <p><span>Ultimately, your responsibility as a product manager to ship successful products. To help your business and customers succeed. </span></p> <p><span>Being on top of things. Delivering results. These are attributes of a great PM that few would disagree.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Further Readings</span></h3></p>  <p><span>﻿</span> <a href="https://blackboxofpm.com/the-first-principles-of-product-management-ea0e2f2a018c" target="_blank"><span>The First Principles of Product Management</span></a> <span> by Brandon Chu.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

	<h2>Opinion – Google ReCAPTCHA</h2>
<p>You’re no doubt familiar with clicking on a box declaring that you are not a robot, that looks something like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/e62.gif" alt="" width="383" height="102"></p>
<p>For most people, this only takes a few seconds, validates, and lets them continue on their way. However, if you’re not signed into your Google Account, don’t use Google Chrome and have any kind of tracking protection in your browser, there’s a good chance you’ll be <em>treated</em> with the opportunity of helping train Google’s Machine Learning image recognition algorithms:</p>
<figure id="attachment_395" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-395"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/google-recaptcha-issue-1024x707.png" alt="" width="800" height="552" srcset="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/google-recaptcha-issue-1024x707.png 1024w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/google-recaptcha-issue-300x207.png 300w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/google-recaptcha-issue-768x530.png 768w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/google-recaptcha-issue.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-395"><a href="https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2019/06/internet-users-unite-to-speak-up-against-the-inconveniences-caused-by-recaptcha.html">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has a history of mass-outsourcing free labour to the global population of internet users, with ReCAPTCHA v2, they employed the involuntarily help of millions to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/captcha-if-you-can-how-youve-been-training-ai-for-years-without-realising-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transcribe scanned books</a>, which lead to <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/11/google-books-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large copyright cases</a>.</p>
<p>With ReCAPTCHA v3, or the <em>I’m not a robot</em> checkbox, <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google tracks your usage around the website</a> it is embedded on before you even get to the Captcha form.</p>
<h3>You agree to Google’s Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Ever clicked <em>I’m not a robot</em>? In doing so, you agree to Google’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’re thinking it’s easy to avoid, but let me assure you it isn’t – once you start paying attention to every place using Google ReCAPTCHA v3, you’ll be shocked!</p>
<p>I choose to use Firefox and DuckDuckGo, and to avoid Google services as much as possible. But if I want to do something like track a package, I have to agree to Google’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Google’s tracking code is <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ta-googleanalytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on more websites than any other</a>, including Facebook.</p>
<h3>Alternatives</h3>
<p>In my opinion, Google clearly holds monopolies in many areas least of all this, and needs to be broken up. Failing this, ReCAPTCHA needs to be redesigned such that it doesn’t serve as tracking and free labour for image recognition, and instead purely serves as a validation tool. A good start to this would be making the code FOSS, and allowing webmasters to self host it, rather than relying on Google’s black box proprietary cloud services.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re a website owner and looking to replace Google ReCAPTCHA, here is a <a href="https://switching.software/replace/google-recaptcha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fantastic guide</a>.<br>

<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.hcaptcha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hCaptcha</a> is a much more privacy friendly, drop in replacement for Google ReCAPTCHA.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <blockquote>I remember vividly why I wanted to write code. &nbsp;I wanted to be a hacker...</blockquote><div><p>When <code>.com</code> was free, people built their websites using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage">frontpage</a> or <a href="https://guidebookgallery.org/pics/gui/applications/office/notepad/win98.png">notepad</a>.<br>Websites looked very different than now. Blinking texts were the coolest thing you could put on your website, and marquee meant you could have a news bar; static nevertheless, so you need to change the HTML and upload the page using FTP again every time you need something new to show up. I am not going to talk about connecting a database to your website because, frankly, I didn't know what a database is even back then.</p><p>Circa that time, WindowsXP was around the corner, I was a recurring guest to internet cafes, and I noticed some websites looked shady, with skull pictures and lists of numbers or passwords. I tried to talk to the people who were using these websites to know what is it. But they didn't help. They just mentioned that they were hackers.</p><p>Of course, it was not true that they were hackers -no hacker will tell you he's a hacker, right ?-, I mean, they might use some tools or software - as I learned them later - to crack into someone's computer or steal his mail's password. But they didn't know how to write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing)">trojan</a> or what's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack">password dictionary</a>. Anyhow, that was how I started to get into the rabbit's hole. What followed was years of doing script kiddy's stuff, using <a href="https://malware.wikia.org/wiki/Sub7">sub7</a> and <a href="https://malware.wikia.org/wiki/ProRat">prorat</a>, guessing a lot of passwords when it was possible, bombing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGI">CGI</a>'s, cracking into DB's, and getting credit cards. I lived in a country where there weren't laws against that at all back then.</p></div><p>I knew I lacked something.<br>I didn't want to use someone else's software.<br>I needed to write viruses myself. I wanted to know how to write a worm that makes me super cool like Zero Cool in the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/"><em>Hackers</em></a><em>.</em><br>As you can see, I was very young and naive.<br></p><p>One day, I found: <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">How To Become A Hacker</a>, <em>by Eric Steven Raymond</em>.<br>I couldn't comprehend the whole article. I was merely searching on how to become a real hacker. And that article contained a full section towards that goal.</p><blockquote>Basic Hacking Skills</blockquote><p><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#skills1">Learn how to program</a>. That was it, I will learn programming languages so I can be a hacker, I didn't know the reason, but programming languages and viruses must be connected. No wonder.</p><p>Years later, I forgot about hacking completely being a teenager and living my age, but I was always good with machines. I started learning programming languages in college at some point as I went to study computer science. I started with C# and ASP.NET. Started doing freelancing as a side job and earning money was a good sign that I made the right decision.</p><p>Three years passed, and I still felt I lacked real programming skills.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://zapier.com/how-it-works">Zapier</a> is a no-code workflow automation tool that can be used to integrate apps and make them work together. I have been using Zapier for a bunch of my side projects and it was been pretty useful to hook up services like Stripe with Gmail. However, I recently started hitting their <a href="https://zapier.com/pricing">free tier limits</a> and started exploring the possibility of building a simple Zapier alternative, mostly for fun.</p>
<p>The requirements that I came up with :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Completely serverless</strong>: I don’t want to manage any infrastructure</li>
<li><strong>(almost) Free</strong>: It should cost close to $0 for my use-case which I will talk about below.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-step workflows</strong>: Currently, Zapier’s free tier only lets you perform one action for a particular trigger. I wanted the ability to perform multiple actions (for e.g. send an email and a slack message) for a particular trigger.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks support</strong>: I’m a big fan of <a href="https://zapier.com/page/webhooks/">Zapier’s webhooks</a> functionality and want to replicate that.</li>
<li><strong>Polling-based workflows</strong>: Ability to poll an API endpoint and take action if there is new data available</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The following section will provide an overview of the system based on the requirements we came up with.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-workflow">What is a workflow?</h3>
<p>A workflow can be defined as a Trigger and a series of actions that are taken as a result of the Trigger. The trigger can be based on webhooks or polling.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/workflow.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/workflow.png"></p>
<p>There are various ways to model a workflow. Some of the most common ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using code</strong>: In a system like <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a>, a workflow (called a DAG) is defined in Python using Airflow specific abstractions.</li>
<li><strong>Using config files</strong>: A workflow engine like <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/projects/argo/">Argo</a>, which is built on top of Kubernetes, uses YAML to define workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep our system simple, we will define our workflows using JSON. JSON is natively supported in Python (my language of choice) along with many other programming languages.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-trigger">What is a Trigger?</h3>
<p>A trigger is the root node of a workflow. We will support two types of triggers in our system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong>: The workflow will expose a webhook that can be used to initiate this particular workflow. The webhook will accept POST requests.</li>
<li><strong>Polling:</strong> The workflow will specify an API endpoint which will be polled at a regular interval. If new data is available, then specified actions will be run</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-an-action">What is an Action?</h3>
<p>An action is performed as a result of a workflow being triggered. We will support two types of actions in our system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email</strong>: Send an email with the data coming from the trigger</li>
<li><strong>Slack</strong>: Send a slack message with the data coming from the trigger.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="designing-the-system">Designing the system</h2>
<p>In the following section, we will take a look at the various services we will be using to build the system based on our requirements.</p>
<h3 id="creating-webhooks">Creating Webhooks</h3>
<p>Since one of the main requirements for the system is to be serverless, we will leverage API Gateway and Lambda to support webhooks. API Gateway will create a single endpoint that we can use to send webhooks and we will do the filtering in our Lambda function.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/webhooks.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/webhooks.png"></p>
<h3 id="supporting-polling-based-triggers">Supporting Polling-based Triggers</h3>
<p>Polling triggers are slightly more involved. The system comprises of the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-cloudwatchevents-expressions.html">Lambda function scheduled</a> at a regular frequency. This lambda function will go through all the workflows that are polling-based and put them in an SQS queue. The benefit of decoupling the scheduling of the workflow from the processing of the workflow is that we will be communicating with external services that could be unreliable. If there is a failure, we want to isolate it to a particular workflow.</li>
<li>Lambda function which gets triggered whenever there is a new workflow has been enqueued. This function is responsible for executing the trigger i.e. querying the API endpoint and checking if there is any new data available.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/polling-trigger.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/polling-trigger.png"></p>
<h3 id="de-duplication">De-duplication</h3>
<p>We only want to execute our actions for the polling-based workflows when there is new data. To support this, we will use a de-duplication identifier similar to <a href="https://zapier.com/help/create/basics/data-deduplication-in-zaps">Zapier</a>. We will use DynamoDB to store the identifiers we have already processed for a particular workflow. Since our data model is pretty straightforward, DynamoDB is a good fit for us.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/deduplication.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/deduplication.png"></p>
<h3 id="performing-actions">Performing Actions</h3>
<p>Since we want to support workflows where a single trigger could lead to multiple actions, we will use SQS to decouple the trigger from the action.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lambda function which processes the trigger and if there are any actions to run, enqueue them to SQS.</li>
<li>Lambda function which runs the actions as a result of messages being enqueued to S3.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the benefits of this architecture are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actions are isolated from each other. If one action fails, other actions won’t be affected. We could even use a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html">Dead-Letter queue</a> to debug and process failed actions.</li>
<li>Trigger and action are decoupled. Since there could be multiple actions that could take a variable amount of time, processing everything in a single Lambda function could lead to Lambda timeouts.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/action.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/action.png"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="cost">Cost</h2>
<p>Now that we have a rough idea of how to build such a system, let’s look at what it will potentially cost us. I came up with a rough estimate of how this system would be used based on my current usage of Zapier:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run 5 workflows</strong>: 3 of them are webhooks based, the rest are polling-based. For simplicity, let’s assume each of these workflows have 2 actions.</li>
<li>The webhooks based workflows are triggered roughly 10 times a day. Thus, the total number of webhooks-based workflow executions would be <strong>30/day</strong>.</li>
<li>The polling workflows would run once <strong>every 12 hours</strong> and they would check for any new data in the API endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, let’s look at the pricing of the various AWS services we are planning to use.</p>
<h3 id="aws-lambda">AWS Lambda</h3>
<p>AWS Lambda has a pretty generous free tier which includes 1M free requests per month and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month.</p>
<p>These are the Lambda functions that we currently have in the system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: This function accepts any incoming webhooks and if a matching workflow exists, enqueues downstream tasks to SQS.</li>
<li>Polling Trigger: There are two lambda functions to support polling triggers. The first one runs once every 12 hours and enqueues any poll-based workflows whereas the second function runs once for each poll-based workflow and checks if any new data is available.</li>
<li>Actions: We run one Lambda function for every action in a workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on our previous assumptions of usage, the number of Lambda requests we would have every month are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: 30 requests / day * 2 actions / workflow = 60 / day = 1800 / month</li>
<li>Polling: 2 requests / day + 2 workflows * 2 actions / workflow = 6 / day = 180 / month</li>
</ul>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, we can assume that our Lambda functions on average run for 30 seconds (probably much lower than this) and they take 1024 MB of memory.</p>
<p>Using these assumptions, our total compute will be (1024 MB * 30s * 1880 request) / 1024 = 56400 GB-seconds per month. We are under the free tier limit on Lambda.</p>
<p>Cost for Lambda (using free tier): <strong>$0 / month</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled.png"></p>
<p>Cost for Lambda (assuming we aren’t eligible for the free tier): $0.20 + <strong>56400 * $0.0000166667 = $ 1.14 / month</strong></p>
<h3 id="sqs">SQS</h3>
<p>Similar to Lambda, SQS also has a pretty generous free tier. The first 1 million monthly requests are free. Every API action counts as a request.</p>
<p>A rough estimate of the number of requests we would make to SQS are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: For every webhooks request we get, we would enqueue the actions for the workflow to SQS. Then, Lambda functions which execute the actions would dequeue these actions and run them.</li>
<li>Polling-based: Every time a polling-based workflow is scheduled, we would first enqueue all the polling-based workflows into SQS. Then, a Lambda function would dequeue these workflows and then enqueue any actions in these workflows to a different SQS queue which would eventually get dequeued by the Lambda function which runs the actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the description above, the number of SQS requests we would make are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: 30 requests / day * 2 actions / workflow (enqueued) * 2 actions / workflow (dequeued) = 120 requests / day = 3600 requests / month</li>
<li>Polling-based: 2 requests / day * 2 polling-based workflows (enqueued) * 2 polling-based workflows (dequeued) * 2 actions / workflow (enqueued) * 2 actions / workflow (dequeued) = 32 requests / day = 960 requests / month</li>
</ul>
<p>Total number of requests to SQS in a month: ~5000 requests / month</p>
<p>Cost for SQS (regardless of tier): <strong>$0 / month</strong></p>
<h3 id="api-gateway">API Gateway</h3>
<p>The API Gateway will only be used by our webhooks workflows. Based on our assumptions above, we will make roughly 900 requests/month to our API Gateway.</p>
<p>Cost for API Gateway: <strong>~$0 / month</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%201.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%201.png"></p>
<h3 id="dynamodb">DynamoDB</h3>
<p>DynamoDB has the most complicated pricing model out of all the services we are planning to use. More details about pricing is available <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We will be using DynamoDB only for polling-based workflows to ensure we can deduplicate any data.</p>
<p>The schema for our table would look like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span>
    <span># primary_key
</span>    <span>"workflow_id"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"S"</span><span>:</span> <span>"my_workflow"</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>"processed_keys"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"SS"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>"1234"</span><span>,</span> <span>"1235"</span><span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
<li>Primary key would be the name of the particular workflow</li>
<li>We would also store the set of processed unique identifiers for the data. For the sake of simplicity, we can assume these identifiers would be approximately <strong>10 characters</strong> in length.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on our usage model, we expect to make the following requests to DynamoDB:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read requests</strong>: 2 polling workflows * 2 triggers / day * 1 read request = 4 requests/day or 120 requests/month</li>
<li><strong>Write requests</strong>: A Write request would only be made when there is new data available in the API. Let’s assume we will have new data every time the workflow is triggered: 4 requests/day or 120 requests/month.</li>
</ul>
<p>I used this pricing calculator for DynamoDB and used conservative estimates that we calculated above.</p>
<p>Cost for Dynamo: ~<strong>0.50 / month</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%202.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%202.png"></p>
<h3 id="total-cost">Total Cost</h3>
<p>If we assume that we are within the limits of the free tier usage for Lambda and SQS, this system will cost us ~<strong>$0.50 / month.</strong></p>
<p>If we include the cost for Lambda, our system will cost us <strong>~$1.64 / month</strong>.</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p><strong>By Michelle Ark and Chris Wu</strong></p>
<p>In January of 2014, Shopify built a data pipeline platform for the data science team called Starscream. Back then, we were a smaller team and needed a tool that could deal with everything from ad hoc explorations to machine learning models. We chose to build with PySpark to get the power of a generalized distributed computer platform, the backing of the industry standard, and the ability to tap into the Python talent market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast forward six years and our data needs have changed. Starscream now runs 76,000 jobs and writes 300 terabytes a day! As we grew, some types of work went away, but others (like simple reports) became so commonplace we do them every day. While our Python tool based on PySpark was computationally powerful, it wasn’t optimized for these commonplace tasks. If a product manager needed a simple rollup for a new feature by country, pulling it, and modeling it wasn’t a fast task.</p>
<p>We’ll show you how we moved to a SQL modelling workflow by leveraging <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/" target="_blank" title="Analytics engineering is the data transformation work that happens between loading data into your warehouse and analyzing it. dbt allows anyone comfortable with SQL to own that workflow." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">dbt</a> (data build tool) and created tooling for testing and documentation on top of it. All together, these features provide Shopify’s data scientists with a robust, production-ready workflow to quickly build straightforward pipelines.</p>

<p>When we interviewed our users to understand their workflow on Starscream, there were two issues we discovered: <em>development time</em> and <em>thinking</em>.</p>
<p><em>Development time</em> encompasses the time data scientists use to prototype the data model they’d like to build, run it, see the outcome,and iterate. The PySpark platform isn’t ideal for running straightforward reporting tasks, often forcing data scientists to write boilerplate and it yields long runtimes. This led to long iteration cycles when trying to build models on unfamiliar data.</p>
<p>The second issue, <em>thinking</em>, is more subtle and deals with the way the programming language forces you to look at the data. Many of our data scientists prefer SQL to python because its structure forces consistency in business metrics. When interviewing users, we found a majority would write out a query in SQL then translate it to Python when prototyping. Unfortunately, query translation is time consuming and doesn’t add value to the pipeline.</p>
<p>To understand how widespread these problems were, we audited the jobs run and surveyed our data science team for the use cases. We found that 70% or so of the PySpark jobs on Starscream were full batch queries that didn’t require generalized computing. We viewed this as an opportunity to make a kickass optimization for a painful workflow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our goal was to create a SQL pipeline for reporting that enables data scientists to create simple reporting data faster, while still being production ready. After exploring a few alternatives, we felt that the dbt library came closest to our needs. Their tagline “deploy analytics code faster with software engineering practices” was <em>exactly</em> what we were looking for in a workflow. We opted to pair it with Google BigQuery as our data store and dubbed the system and its tools, Seamster.</p>
<p>We knew that any off-the-shelf system wouldn’t be one size fits all. In moving to dbt, we had to implement our own:</p>
<ul>
<li>source and model structure to modularize data model development</li>
<li>unit testing to increase the types of testable errors</li>
<li>continuous integration (CI) pipelines to provide safety and consistency guarantees.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Source Independence and Safety</h2>
<p>With dozens of data scientists making data models in a shared repository, a great user experience would</p>
<ul>
<li>maximize focus on work&nbsp;</li>
<li>minimize the impact of model changes by other data scientists.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, dbt declares raw sources in a central <code>sources.yml</code>. This quickly became a very large file as it included the schema for each source, in addition to the source name. It creates a huge bottleneck for teams editing the same file across multiple PRs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To mitigate the bottleneck, we leveraged the flexibility of dbt and created a top-level ‘sources’ directory to represent each raw source with its own source-formatted yaml file. This way, data scientists can parse only the source documentation that’s relevant for them and contribute to the <code>sources.yml</code> file without stepping on each other’s toes.</p>

<p><em>Base models are one-to-one interfaces to raw sources.</em></p>
<p>We also created a Base layer of models using the <a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-structure-our-dbt-projects/355" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">‘</a><a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-structure-our-dbt-projects/355" target="_blank" title="How we structure our dbt projects" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">staging’ concept from dbt</a> to implement their best practice of <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/best-practices/#limit-references-to-raw-data" target="_blank" title="Limit references to raw data - dbt" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">limiting references to raw data</a>. Our Base models serve as a one-to-one interface to raw sources. They don’t change the grain of the raw source, but do apply renaming, recasting, or any other cleaning operation that relates to the source data collection system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Base layer serves to protect users from breaking changes in raw sources. Raw external sources are by definition out of the control of Seamster and can introduce breaking changes for any number of reasons at any point in time. If and when this happens, you only need to apply the fix to the Base model representing the raw source, as opposed to every individual downstream model that depends on the raw source.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Model Ownership for Teams</h2>
<p>We knew that the tooling improvements of Seamster would be only one part of a greater data platform at Shopify. We wanted to make sure we’re providing mechanisms to support good dimensional modelling practices and support data discovery.</p>
<p>In dbt, a model is simply a .sql file. We’ve extended this definition in Seamster to define a model as a directory consisting of four files:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><code>model_name.sql</code></li>
<li><code>schema.yml</code></li>
<li><code>README.md</code></li>
<li><code>test_model_name.py</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can further organize models into directories that indicate a data science team at Shopify like ‘finance’ or ‘marketing’.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To support a clean data warehouse we’ve also organized data models into these rough layers that differentiate between:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>base</strong>: data models that are one-to-one with raw data, but cleaned, recast and renamed</li>
<li>
<strong>application-ready</strong>: data that isn’t dimensionally modelled but still transformed and clean for consumption by another tool (for example,&nbsp; training data for a machine learning algorithm)</li>
<li>
<strong>presentation</strong>: shareable and reliable data models that follow dimensional modelling best practices and can be used by data scientists across different domains.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these two changes, a data consumer can quickly understand the data quality they can expect from a model and find the owner in case there is an issue. We also pass this metadata upstream to <a href="https://shopify.engineering/solving-data-discovery-challenges-shopify" target="_blank" title="How We’re Solving Data Discovery Challenges at Shopify" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">other tools</a> to help with the data discovery workflow.</p>
<h2>More Tests</h2>
<p>dbt has native support for ‘schema tests’, which are encoded in a model’s schema.yml file. These tests run against production data to validate data invariants, such as the presence of null values or the uniqueness of a particular key. This feature in dbt serves its purpose well, but we also want to enable data scientists to write unit tests for models that run against fixed input data (as opposed to production data).</p>
<p>Testing on fixed inputs allows the user to test edge cases that may not be in production yet. In larger organizations, there can and will be frequent updates and many collaborators for a single model. Unit tests give users confidence that the changes they’re making won’t break existing behaviour or introduce regressions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seamster provides a Python-based unit testing framework. Data scientists write their unit tests in the <code>test_model_name.py</code> file in the model directory. The framework enables constructing ‘mock’ input models from fixed data. The central object in this framework is a ‘mock’ data model, which has an underlying representation of a Pandas dataframe. You can pass fixed data to the mock constructor as either a csv-style string, Pandas dataframe, or a list of dictionaries to specify input data.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="Input and expected MockModels are built from static data. The actual MockModel is built from input MockModels by BigQuery. Actual and expected MockModels can assert equality or any Great Expectations expectation" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/input-expected-mock-models.jpg?v=1605811967" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/input-expected-mock-models.jpg?v=1605811967"><br><em>Input and expected MockModels are built from static data. The actual MockModel is built from input MockModels by BigQuery. Actual and expected MockModels can assert equality or any Great Expectations expectation.</em></p>
<p>A constructor creates a test query where a common table expression (CTE) represents each input mock data model, and any references to production models (identified using dbt’s ‘ref’ macro) are replaced by references to the corresponding CTE. Once you execute a query, you can compare the output to an expected result. In addition to an equality assertion, we extended our framework to support all expectations from the open-source <a href="https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations" target="_blank" title="Great Expectations - Always know what to expect from your data." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Great Expectations</a> library to provide more granular assertions and error messaging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main downside to this framework is that it requires a roundtrip to the query engine to construct the test data model given a set of inputs. Even though the query itself is lightweight and processes only a handful of rows, these roundtrips to the engine add up. It becomes costly to run an entire test suite on each local or CI run. To solve this, we introduced tooling both in development and CI to run the minimal set of tests that could potentially break given the change. This was straightforward to implement with accuracy because of dbt’s lineage tracking support; we simply had to find all downstream models (direct and indirect) for each changed model and run their tests.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Schema and Directed Acyclic Graph Validation on the Cheap</h2>
<p>Our objective in Seamster’s CI is to give data scientists peace of mind that their changes won’t introduce production errors the next time the warehouse is built. They shouldn’t have to wonder whether removing a column will cause downstream dependencies to break, or whether they made a small typo in their SQL model definition.</p>
<p>To achieve this accurately, we would need to build and tear down the entire warehouse on every commit. This isn’t feasible from both a time and cost perspective. Instead, on every commit we materialize every model as a view in a temporary BigQuery dataset which is created at the start of the validation process and removed as soon as the validation finishes. If we can’t build a view because its upstream model doesn’t provide a certain column, or if the SQL is invalid for any reason, BigQuery fails to build the view and …</p></div></div>

<i>Disclaimer: despite the controversial title, this article is not trying to show that RPC is a superior approach to REST, or GraphQL is superior to RPC. Instead, the goal of the article is to give you an overview of the approaches, their strengths and weaknesses. The final choice anyway will be a trade-off.</i></p>
<p>Even though HTTP is an application layer (i.e. L7), protocol, when it comes to API development, HTTP de facto plays the role of a <em>lower-level</em> transport mechanism.</p>
<p>There are multiple conceptually different approaches on how to implement an API on top of HTTP:</p>
<ul>
<li>REST</li>
<li>RPC</li>
<li>GraphQL</li>
</ul>
<p>...but the actual list of things an average API developer needs to be aware of is not limited by these three dudes. There are also <em>JSON</em>, <em>gRPC</em>, <em>protobuf</em>, and many other terms in the realm. Let's try to sort them out, <del>once and for all</del>!</p>
<div><p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/api-developers-never-rest/kdpv.png" width="80%"></p></div>


<h2 id="a-namerestarepresentational-state-transfer-rest"><a name="rest"></a>Representational state transfer (REST)</h2>
<p>First and foremost, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> is just a software architectural style. It's a set of design constraints, not a concrete protocol. REST relies on the idea of a resource. I.e. a REST API is comprised of a set of resources (nouns) and a fairly limited number of actions (verbs) to interact with these resources (fetch, create, update, delete, etc). It's ideologically very close to the original HTTP design heavily based on the concepts of resources (URLs) and methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Thus, from the implementation standpoint mapping of the REST model to the HTTP protocol is relatively straightforward:</p>
<pre><code># Create new book
POST http://myapi.com/books/ (author="R. Feynman", year=1975) -&gt; book_id

# Get book with ID = 1
GET http://myapi.com/books/1 () -&gt; (id=1, author="R. Feynman", year=1975)

# Update book with ID = 1
PUT http://myapi.com/books/1 (id=1, author="Richard Feynman", year=1975) -&gt; (...)

# Delete book with ID = 1
DELETE http://myapi.com/books/1 () -&gt; null</code></pre><p>Probably every modern web framework provides all the needed facilities to build a RESTful web service out of the box. And from the client-standpoint, calling a REST API is pretty trivial - it just needs to be able to send the specified HTTP methods to the set of predefined URLs.</p>
<p>However, from the API designer standpoint, it may be not so obvious how to express a real-world domain model in terms of resources (i.e. nouns) keeping the number of allowed actions (i.e. verbs) limited. Surprisingly, inspite of a super-widespread (ab)use of the word <em>REST</em> nowadays, not so many contemporary APIs can be actually considered truly RESTful. Trying to play a purist while designing a RESTful web service can lead you to a really clunky API design.</p>
<h2 id="a-namerpcaremote-procedure-call-rpc"><a name="rpc"></a>Remote procedure call (RPC)</h2>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">RPC</a> is also an API design technique. RPC focuses on the idea of actions (verbs) and that often makes the involved resources (nouns) fairly primitive and ad hoc. For every procedure or transaction in the business model an API designer simply adds an RPC endpoint:</p>
<pre><code># Create new book
createBook(author, year) -&gt; book_id

# Get book by ID
getBook(book_id) -&gt; book

# Change book's author
setBookAuthor(book_id, author) -&gt; null

# Delete book by ID
deleteBook(book_id) -&gt; null</code></pre><p>Under the hood, there should be another layer mapping such procedure calls to the HTTP requests. E.g. <code>setBookAuthor(1, "Richard Feynman")</code> can be mapped to something like:</p>
<pre><code>POST http://myapi.com/set-book-author/ (book_id=1, author="Richard Feynman") -&gt; null</code></pre><p>Now, let's compare the tasks of changing the author's name in the REST and RPC worlds. While the implementation seems trivial in the case of RPC, there is a bunch of controversial questions that need to be answered in case of the RESTful implementation. If the author's name is an attribute of the book, should we provide the full book object with the modified author field while sending <code>PUT /books/1</code>? What if there is no full book object around on the client-side? Should we fetch the book first or can we just send only the book ID and the new author name? But what's about the rest of the attributes on the server-side? Should they be zeroed out if an almost empty <code>PUT</code> request arrives (that would be disastrous but fully aligned with the REST principles decision)? Or maybe we should give up on the HTTP <code>PUT</code> method and start using <code>PATCH</code> (have you ever heard of it)?</p>
<p>Luckily, if we follow the RPC approach, we can simply omit most of the questions from above. But of course, there is always a downside - a typical RPC API usually consists of a pretty high number of custom procedures. Obviously, it makes the mapping of the RPC model to the HTTP layer a non-trivial task. The good thing is that API designers rarely need to think of this part at all. There are a lot of libraries implementing the RPC layer on top of HTTP and some of them are truly prominent (yes, I'm talking about Google's gRPC and Facebook's Thrift). But there is another, probably much more complicated problem with the RPC approach...</p>
<p>A dozen rich REST resources combined with 3-5 HTTP methods usually can cover a hundred use cases. REST API deliberately brings a regular structure to the domain model making its growth and evolution much more controllable. On contrary, RPC APIs grow organically. Introducing a new use case often require adding a few more API endpoints to the already bloated list. Since there is no entity-oriented structure enforced by the API design, over a relatively short period of time the number of RPC calls may exceed the maximum level of complexity a team can handle.</p>
<h2 id="a-namegraphqlagraphql"><a name="graphql"></a>GraphQL</h2>
<p>By this time, we already learned that neither RPC nor REST approach is ideal. REST suffers from <a href="https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/rest-vs-graphql-418eac2e3083">over and under fetching problem</a> and may lead to a significant mental overhead on the design phase. But if we try to avoid the entity-oriented design by replacing it with a hundred ad hoc RPC endpoints, over time the maintenance of the overgrown RPC API may become a nightmare.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL">GraphQL</a> tries to address the weaknesses of both techniques. Assuming the entity-oriented domain model contributes to the peace of mind of developers in the long term, the GraphQL approach starts from defining a schema, i.e. set of resources (i.e. nouns) and their interconnections. Sounds like a graph, doesn't it? Having a formal scheme definition, GraphQL bumps a fairly complex server and client on top of it. The thick client allows querying (QL stands for query language) custom and compound resources. The thick server knows how to populate the response based on the client's query and the domain schema.</p>
<p>Thus, GraphQL API basically consists of a single endpoint. I.e. no more bloated APIs. At the same time, its super-flexible and tailored queries help to avoid fetching unnecessary data from the server. Additionally, developers still benefit from the formal entity-oriented domain schema. But magic always comes at a price (c). And the price in that case is the utter complexity of the GraphQL client and server sides. So, yeah, it's all about trade-offs...</p>
<h2 id="a-namecontent-encodingawhats-up-with-protobuf-json-etc"><a name="content-encoding"></a>What's up with protobuf, JSON, etc?</h2>
<p>What could help with wrapping your head around the API development realm is the proper categorization of the moving parts. At this time we already know that REST and RPC are just architectural styles. And GraphQL, well... I tend to consider it as a style as well, even though technically it's a formal language backed by a runtime.</p>
<p>But if GraphQL is backed by a particular implementation, we probably could expect the same from RPC and REST. And indeed, there is a bunch of prominent RPC frameworks - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRPC"><em>gRPC</em></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Thrift"><em>Apache Thrift</em></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Avro"><em>Apache Avro</em></a> to name a few. Surprisingly though, there seem to be no clear leaders among REST frameworks. Probably because REST is technically super-close to HTTP and almost every web framework already plays well with it.</p>
<p>Hm, but what's the deal with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers"><em>protobuf</em></a>? Apparently, it's just one of the ways to serialize your data before it will be sent over the wire or stored somewhere. It just so happened that gRPC, a particular RPC framework, fully relies on <em>protobuf</em>. And since they often used hand in hand and have been released altogether, lots of people negligently use the terms <em>gRPC</em> and <em>protobuf</em> interchangeably. However, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/35349813/1201488">it's perfectly fine to use <em>protobuf</em> in your RESTful API</a> as an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type">encoding format</a> and we do it currently at work for some of our services. Thus, <em>protobuf</em> should not be compared with REST or RPC frameworks but instead, it can be compared with <em>XML</em> or <em>JSON</em>.</p>
<p>To confuse you even further, <em>Apache Thrift</em> has its own serialization format called... <em>Thrift</em>! I.e. there is <em>gRPC over protobuf</em> and <em>Thrift over Thrift</em> 🙈</p>
<p><strong>Summarizing</strong>, there are different architectural styles to design an HTTP API. The three most popular ones are REST, RPC, and GraphQL. Every style in turns can be implemented in many ways and there is a bunch of well-known frameworks such as gRPC or Apache Thrift. Under the hood, they rely on lower-level mechanisms like data serialization (<em>protobuf</em>, <em>JSON</em>, <em>XML</em>) or protocols (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC"><em>JSON-RPC</em></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC"><em>XML-RPC</em></a>). And these lower-level bits sometimes can be reused between styles making the whole realm of API development looking pretty convoluted at first sight.</p>

<div>
<p>Expanding a business can be profitable, but at the same time, it can add new expenses such as a larger payroll and succeeding expenditures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A strong freelance workforce gives companies a significant game-changing advantage. Niche freelancers boost your company’s flexibility, allowing you to bring in critical talent for increased productivity and innovation. This is invaluable for firms looking to scale up but may not have or want the additional overhead expenses of having additional regular employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Upwork, in 2019, freelancers contributed almost $1 trillion to the <a href="https://websitebuilder.org/blog/freelance-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US economy</a>, which covers roughly 5 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. As a point of comparison, the freelance economy contributed more than that of the construction industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To maximize the benefits of having freelancers on your team, your recruitment strategy must be on point. Below are 7 tips for companies who are breaking barriers and looking into exploring freelancers to supplement in-house staff:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Clearly Define Needs and Project Description&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If you are wondering how to hire freelancers, the first thing you need to ensure clarifying your&nbsp; company’s overall objective and completing project details. Some critical details to iron out include the project budget, expected deliverables with project deadlines, as well as the skills, tools, and expertise needed to complete the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of these details should be reflected in a project description that will be the basis of recruiters in assessing applicants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. <strong>Prepare a Realistic Budget&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Having an adequate budget for the project is only one aspect of financial preparation. Considering the expertise required during the contract period, companies should gauge existing rates for the required skills as reference for your budget. It is also important that your budget is not wholly based on the most economical rate in the market. At the end of the day, you get what you pay for. If budget is a concern, re-adjust your project implementation plan and consider shortening the duration or removing deliverables that may be taken on by your in-house team.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Identify and Advertise in Quality and Wide-Reaching Marketplaces</strong></p>
<p>Finding freelancers requires referrals and posting much like finding regular employees. There are many popular <a href="https://freelance-platforms.financesonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freelance platforms where you can find good freelancers</a>. These freelance recruitment and advertising websites display the resumes of available freelancers and also allow recruiters to post project opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the talent you are looking for, it is best to post on reputable sites that have a wide reach and a large pool of freelancers. When reviewing applications and profiles, pay careful attention to professional rates and professional history.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong><strong>Review Sample Work</strong></p>
<p>Freelancers are typically expected to be quality candidates in their fields of specialization. As part of the screening process, request for their portfolio or sample work for review. You need freelancers to perform efficiently, and asking for sample work relevant to your project will be a strong and objective indicator if they are a fit for the job. Freelancers who will provide a work sample will likely need to be paid because of the time they would allot for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. Check References for Feedback&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If you are wondering how to recruit freelancers that perform as expected with high quality outputs, it is important to perform due diligence prior to hiring a freelancer to ensure that they can deliver your expectations. Once you have narrowed down the list of potential candidates, request references who can testify to the quality of their performance. Also, marketplaces are a great way to narrow down the field to some choice talent and they typically have spaces for previous client feedback and ratings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. <strong>Agree on a Project Scope and Payment Scheme</strong></p>
<p>Using your project description as a take-off point, it is vital that every aspect of the engagement is clear to all parties. The chosen freelancer should understand their responsibilities, line of reporting, the timeline for completion, list of deliverables, as well as the schedule and basis for payment. This should be done before the work begins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can be in the form of a contract that outlines all of those elements mentioned above. If the freelancer will be gaining access to confidential information, proprietary technology, and/or business details, you can also consider enforcing a non-disclosure agreement to protect your company from your competition. This is usually a concern for <a href="https://xpertspool.com/is-flutter-app-development-going-to-dominate-mobile-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mobile app development</a>, technology, and research and development firms.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. Ensure Open and Constant Communication</strong></p>
<p>When talking about tips for hiring freelancers, you cannot overlook the importance of communications. Most freelancers work remotely, but it is vital to have constant and open lines of communication with your freelancer. Prior to hiring, it is recommended that you have directly communicated at least via face-to-face interview, phone conversation or video conference. This humanizes your interaction and paves the way for a personal rapport – the foundation of a warm professional relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A freelancer who is unwilling to have a meeting or evasive when it comes to communication and deadlines may be an indication of professional habits and attitudes that may be a challenge for you in the long run.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jumpstart Your Business Expansion with Freelance Talent</strong></p>
<p>The future of work is digital, remote-based, and highly specialized. Every year there has been an <a href="https://xpertspool.com/why-hiring-freelancers-after-2020-is-going-to-stay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase in the number of small business hiring freelancers</a>. Hiring freelancers is advantageous because it allows you temporary skill sets you may need intermittently. It is also a cost-effective alternative to recruitment agencies or bolstering your in-house team.</p>
<p>Hiring freelance labor can boost your company’s skill set, expertise, and talent all the while being a cost-saver to your businesses. Be mindful of the recruitment process and treat them fairly and they can be an asset that helps you expand your business.</p>

  <p><time datetime="2020-11-21T00:00:00Z">Sat, Nov 21, 2020</time></p><p>Don’t we all love it when things “just work”? Colab is exactly that. Whether you want to play around with Python in your browser or need to test your machine learning pipeline, it makes your life easier.</p>
<p>While using Colab for the last couple of years, I was looking for ways to optimize its workflow. In this article, I will be sharing tweaks, solutions to the inconveniences I faced, and new ways of utilizing Colab’s power.</p>
<h2 id="mounting-google-drive">Mounting Google Drive</h2>
<p>I hated having to mount my Google Drive each time I opened my notebook or my virtual machine (VM) crashed. I had to go in the link, copy the code, and paste it back into the notebook. That’s no way of living. Fortunately, Google added a one-time mounting mechanism to allow you to link your notebook with your Google Drive. You can find it on the left menu you <code><svg viewBox="0 0 45 20" focusable="false" style="width: 5%; height: 5%;">
    <g>
        <path d="M20 6h-8l-2-2H4c-1.1 0-1.99.9-1.99 2L2 18c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h16c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2V8c0-1.1-.9-2-2-2zm0 12H4V8h16v10z"></path>
    </g>
</svg>Files</code> &gt; <code><svg viewBox="0 0 45 20" focusable="false" style="width: 5%; height: 5%;">
    <g>
        <path d="M20,6H12L10,4H4A2,2,0,0,0,2,6V18a2,2,0,0,0,2,2H20a2,2,0,0,0,2-2V8A2,2,0,0,0,20,6ZM13.57,9.32,13,8.4l.34-.6h3.11l3.69,6.5H16.38M12.11,17l-.67,1.2h-1L9,15.42,12.72,9l2,3.46h0M19.3,18.2H12.09l.67-1.2,1.15-2h6.64l.34.6Z"></path>
    </g>
</svg>Mount Drive</code>. Now each time you allocate or reconnect to a VM through that notebook, Google Drive is mounted automatically.</p>
<p>Once you mount your Drive, you should not be fetching individual files <a href="https://colin-scott.github.io/personal_website/research/interactive_latency.html">across the network</a>. The best solution is zipping your files and copying them to your VM on Colab. A single request to fetch all your files and then work on your local storage. I used this code to copy an audio dataset from my Drive to my local storage:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>copy_clips_dataset</span>(name): 
  <span>"""
</span><span>  Copies files from Google Drive to local storage
</span><span>
</span><span>  Keyword arguments:
</span><span>    name: of the tar file
</span><span>  """</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>not</span> os<span>.</span>path<span>.</span>exists(f<span>'/content/{name}/'</span>):
    <span>!</span>cp <span>"/content/drive/My Drive/audio-clips/{name}.tar.gz"</span> <span>/</span>content<span>/</span>
    <span>!</span>tar <span>-</span>xzf <span>/</span>content<span>/</span>{name}<span>.</span>tar<span>.</span>gz <span>-</span>C <span>/</span>content<span>/</span>
  <span>!</span>ls <span>-</span>l <span>/</span>content<span>/</span>{name}<span>/</span>clips <span>|</span> egrep <span>-</span>c <span>'^-'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This function checks if the path exists; in which case you might be running the cell a second time. If the path doesn’t exist, it will copy the <code>.tar.gz</code> file to the storage on the current VM, decompress it, then print the number of files inside it.</p>
<h2 id="timing-your-code">Timing your code</h2>
<p>I needed more control over time than <code>%timeit</code> and <code>%time</code> (<code>%lsmagic</code> for the full list of magic commands). So instead of injecting time logic throughout my code, I am using decorators. By doing so, I avoid boilerplate and get the flexibility I want.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># Source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/27737385</span>

<span>from</span> functools <span>import</span> wraps
<span>from</span> time <span>import</span> time

<span>def</span> <span>timing</span>(f):
    <span>@wraps</span>(f)
    <span>def</span> <span>wrap</span>(<span>*</span>args, <span>**</span>kw):
        ts <span>=</span> time()
        result <span>=</span> f(<span>*</span>args, <span>**</span>kw)
        te <span>=</span> time()
        <span>print</span>(f<span>'{f.__name__}{args}, {kw} took: {te-ts:2.6f} sec'</span>)
        <span>return</span> result
    <span>return</span> wrap
</code></pre></div><p>and to use it, all you have to do is:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>@timing</span>
<span>def</span> <span>calculate</span>(num):
  <span>return</span> sum([i <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(num)])
</code></pre></div><p>Each time you execute this function, the output would be something like this:</p>
<p><code>calculate(10000000,), {} took: 0.979142 sec</code></p>
<h2 id="reusing-code">Reusing Code</h2>
<p>Often I find myself reusing portions of code across multiple notebooks. That’s a sin. Thus, I created a repository to aggregate my utility functions. All I have to do now, to set up my notebook, is clone that repository. Keep in mind that your default <code>!pwd</code> in Colab is <code>/content</code>. When you clone your repository using:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>!</span>git clone <span>"https://github.com/AYBLBD/utils.git"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You will be creating a folder inside your present working directory, matching <code>/content/utils</code>. For you to use your module like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> utils <span>import</span> utils_colab <span>as</span> uc
uc<span>.</span>save_model(model)
</code></pre></div><p>Your folder structure should resemble something like this:</p>
<pre>+-- __init__.py
+-- utils
|   +-- __init__.py
|   +-- utils_colab
|   +-- ...
</pre>
<h2 id="using-mlflow">Using MLflow</h2>
<p>Have you ever tried to manage your hyperparameters using an Excel file? or worse a text file? I know the feeling. Luckily, there are tools to do that tedious work. The industry standard is <a href="https://mlflow.org/">MLflow</a>. However, new tools are arising, such as <a href="https://neptune.ai/">Neptune</a> and <a href="https://www.comet.ml/site/">Comet</a> that provide storage, data exploration, and teamwork management. I wanted to experiment with these tools without adding another dependency to my projects. And luckily again, these tools implement interfaces to integrate with MLflow. So by using MLflow, I was able to switch between tools as they emerged, experimenting with little to no changes to my code, and all while staying grounded to industry standards.</p>
<p>In this example, I will be using MLflow linked to Neptune. We can start by installing dependencies:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>!</span>pip install mlflow<span>==</span><span>1.12</span><span>.</span><span>1</span>
<span>!</span>pip install neptune<span>-</span>mlflow<span>==</span><span>0.2</span><span>.</span><span>5</span> future<span>==</span><span>0.18</span><span>.</span><span>2</span>
</code></pre></div><p>After creating a Neptune account, you will receive a <code>NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN</code> to use. It’s up to you to create and pick a project name. Once you have those two variables, you can set them up in your environment:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">os<span>.</span>environ[<span>'NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN'</span>] <span>=</span> <span>'''[Your key here]'''</span>
os<span>.</span>environ[<span>'NEPTUNE_PROJECT'</span>] <span>=</span> <span>'[User name]/[Project name]'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then in your code, do your thing with MLflow:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># witchery stuff</span>
<span>...</span>
mlflow<span>.</span>log_metric(<span>'validation_loss'</span>, validation_loss, step<span>=</span>epoch)
mlflow<span>.</span>log_metric(<span>'validation_cer'</span>, avg_cer, step<span>=</span>epoch)
mlflow<span>.</span>log_metric(<span>'validation_wer'</span>, avg_wer, step<span>=</span>epoch)
<span>...</span>
<span># more witchery stuff</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Once you have those metrics, you can persist them to the storage offered by Neptune by executing:</p>
<p>Et voilà! You can now access and visualize the history of your hyperparameters and models, per experiment, through the Neptune dashboard.</p>
<h2 id="using-pyspark-in-colab">Using Pyspark in Colab</h2>
<p>Who doesn’t get the urge to run some Spark code on the fly? Right? The following setup is my go-to for that:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> os
<span>import</span> site

<span>def</span> <span>install_pyspark</span>():
  <span>!</span>pip install pyspark
  PACKAGES_PATH <span>=</span> site<span>.</span>getsitepackages()[<span>0</span>]
  os<span>.</span>environ[<span>"SPARK_HOME"</span>] <span>=</span> f<span>"{PACKAGES_PATH}/pyspark"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The function <code>site.getsitepackages()</code> will return a list of paths to the installed packages in the system. We are interested in the first one that should be <code>/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages</code>. Then <code>os.environ["SPARK_HOME"] = f"{PACKAGES_PATH}/pyspark"</code> will add that path as an environment variable.</p>
<p>After that, you are ready to go! To run a Spark session:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> pyspark.sql <span>import</span> SparkSession

spark <span>=</span> SparkSession<span>.</span>builder<span>.</span>appName(<span>"Spark in Colab"</span>)<span>.</span>config(<span>"spark.ui.port"</span>, <span>"4050"</span>)<span>.</span>getOrCreate()
</code></pre></div><p>Then test that it works:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">spark<span>.</span>createDataFrame([(<span>1</span>, <span>"Hello"</span>), (<span>2</span>, <span>"World"</span>)], [<span>"id"</span>, <span>"name"</span>]) \
     <span>.</span>show()
</code></pre></div><p>And yes, there is a way to check Spark UI. The following code snippet is proudly stolen from <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs246/">CS246</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> time

<span>def</span> <span>create_spark_ui_link</span>():
  <span>!</span>wget <span>-</span>q https:<span>//</span>bin<span>.</span>equinox<span>.</span>io<span>/</span>c<span>/</span><span>4</span>VmDzA7iaHb<span>/</span>ngrok<span>-</span>stable<span>-</span>linux<span>-</span>amd64<span>.</span>zip
  <span>!</span>unzip <span>-</span>qq ngrok<span>-</span>stable<span>-</span>linux<span>-</span>amd64<span>.</span>zip
  get_ipython()<span>.</span>system_raw(<span>'./ngrok http 4050 &amp;'</span>)
  time<span>.</span>sleep(<span>3</span>) <span># For when the tunnel takes seconds to open</span>
  <span>!</span>curl <span>-</span>s http:<span>//</span>localhost:<span>4040</span><span>/</span>api<span>/</span>tunnels <span>|</span> python <span>-</span>c <span>"import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['tunnels'][0]['public_url'])"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The generated link will be your access point to Spark UI.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I guess a good reason for me to start reading PEP8, is that I am yet to find a way to indent cells in Colab. But I think I would rather spend hours trying to figure out a way around that 10min read. This is the way.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/technology/twitter-hackers-interview.html"> New York Times story on the recent Twitter hack</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>Mr. O’Connor said other hackers had informed him that Kirk got access to the Twitter credentials when he found a way into Twitter’s internal Slack messaging channel and saw them posted there, along with a service that gave him access to the company’s servers.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s too soon after this incident to put too much faith in the reporting, but let’s assume it’s accurate. A collective cry of “<em>Posting credentials to a Slack channel? How could engineers at Twitter be so stupid?</em>” rose up from the internet. It’s a natural reaction, but it’s not a constructive one.</p>



<p>I don’t personally know any engineers at Twitter, but I have confidence that they have excellent engineers over there, including excellent security folks. So, how do we explain this seemingly obvious security lapse?</p>



<p>The problem is that we on the outside can’t, because we don’t have enough information. This type of lapse is a classic example of a <em>workaround</em>. People in a system use workarounds (they do things the “<em>wrong</em>” way) when there are obstacles to doing things the “right” way.</p>



<p>There are countless possibilities for why people employ workarounds. Maybe some system that’s required for doing it the “right” way is down for some reason, or maybe it simply takes too long or is too hard to do things the “right” way. Combine that with production pressures, and a workaround is born.</p>



<p>I’m willing to bet that there are people in your organization that use workarounds. You probably use some yourself. Identifying those workarounds teaches us something about how the system works, and how people have to do things the “wrong” way to actually get their work done.</p>



<p>Some workarounds, like the Twitter example, are dangerous. But simply observing “they shouldn’t have done that” does nothing to address the problems in the system that motivated the workaround in the first place.</p>



<p>When you see a workaround, don’t ask “how could they be so stupid to do things the obviously wrong way?” Instead, ask “what are the properties of our system that contributed to the development of this workaround?” Because, unless you gain a deeper understanding of your system, the problems that motivated the workaround aren’t going to go away.</p>

</figure>


<p>Yesterday I saw this tweet of Chris Campbell passing by in my timeline:</p>



<p>Aah, the memories. Quake III Arena, one of my favourite first-person shooter games.</p>

<p>Years ago, I spent (and lost) so much time playing this fast-paced game with friends and foes, and now it is brought into the world of containers and Kubernetes with <strong><a href="https://github.com/criticalstack/quake-kube" target="_blank">QuakeKube</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/CapitalOneTech" target="_blank">Capital One Tech</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>QuakeKube is a Kubernetes-ified version of</em> <a href="https://github.com/inolen/quakejs" target="_blank"><em>QuakeJS</em></a> <em>that runs a dedicated</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_III_Arena" target="_blank"><em>Quake 3</em></a> <em>server in a Kubernetes Deployment, and then allow clients to connect via QuakeJS in the browser.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, I couldn’t wait to give it a try, especially after reading the documentation, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Container images are being cross-compiled with</em> <a href="https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/" target="_blank"><em>Docker Buildx</em></a> <em>so it can run on hardware with different architectures and operating systems. Currently, it is building for <code>linux/amd64</code> and <code>linux/arm64</code>.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>ARM64 support!</strong> Great, it means I can run it on one of my Raspberry Pis!</p>

<h2 id="let-s-get-fragging">Let’s get fragging!</h2>

<p>Most of the work is already done by others, so with the proper tools and projects, it will take you only a few minutes to get everything up and running.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<ul>
<li>a Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu 20.04, which supports arm64<br></li>
<li><code>k3sup</code>, a light-weight utility to get from zero to KUBECONFIG with k3s on any local or remote VM.<br></li>
<li><code>arkade</code>, a simple Golang CLI with strongly-typed flags to install charts and apps to your cluster in one command.<br></li>
<li><code>kubectl</code><br></li>
<li>a DigitalOcean account and an API Token</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>First, install <code>k3s</code> on your Raspberry Pi running a arm64 OS like Ubuntu 20.04</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ k3sup install --ip <span>192</span>.168.0.52 --user ubuntu --k3s-extra-args <span>'--no-deploy servicelb --no-deploy traefik'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After the installation of k3s on the Raspberry Pi, k3sup also downloads the required kubeconfig file in your current working directory.<br>
Make sure to configure <code>kubectl</code> to use this config file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ export KUBECONFIG<span>=</span><span>$(</span>pwd<span>)</span>/kubeconfig</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, install the inlets-operator with <code>arkade</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ arkade install inlets-operator --provider digitalocean --token-file ~/do-api-token</code></pre></div>
<p>The inlets-operator will create an inlets exit-node on DigitalOcean, giving the LoadBalancer services in the private k3s cluster a public IP address.</p>

<p>As clients connect to the server via QuakeJS in the browser with websockets, the OSS version of inlets will do just fine. If you want to have better support for TLS etc, I can highly recommend having a look at inlets PRO version.</p>

<p>Finally, take the example yaml file from the QuakeKube GitHub repository and make the appropriate changes. The service should be updated to a LoadBalancer instead of type NodePort, and of course you can change the configuration to tweak the game preferences to your own needs.</p>

<p>Example of a QuakeKube yaml file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">apiVersion: apps/v1

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      
        <time datetime="2020-08-12">2020-08-12</time>
      <p>Let's write some Elixir.</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    if a &lt; 0 do
      bar(a, -1)
    else
      bar(a, 1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    IO.inspect(a * b)
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Not very useful, but that's good enough for our purpose.</p>
<p>I like Elixir, but I think most of the time it just looks like functional Ruby. I want to make this code look like Elixir.</p>
<p>First, this code is lacking every Elixir developer's best friend: <code>|&gt;</code>. Let's add some <code>|&gt;</code>s.</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    if a &lt; 0 do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    (a * b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Meh. It's definitely better, but I mean, that's only 3 <code>|&gt;</code>s. I want more <code>|&gt;</code>s.</p>
<p>We have an <code>if</code> in there, so maybe we can do something with it?</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    (a &lt; 0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    (a * b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>We sure can! That's one more <code>|&gt;</code>. Can we do better than this?</p>
<p>Well... <code>&gt;</code> and <code>*</code> are <code>Kernel</code> functions, so maybe...</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>This is great, can we keep going?</p>
<p>The Elixir docs say <code>defmodule</code> is just a macro. Does that mean I can just <code>|&gt;</code> into <code>defmodule</code>?</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule do
  def foo(a) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Yes you can!</p>
<p><code>def</code> and <code>defp</code> are macros too right?</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule do
  a |&gt; foo() |&gt; def do
    a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  a |&gt; bar(b) |&gt; defp do
    a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>So many pipes! 😍</p>
<p>We're getting somewhere, but something still doesn't feel right. This module really isn't doing much, so maybe it should not be that long? Also, I think we need more <code>:</code>. Atoms are very Elixir-y, so let's do more of that:</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule(do: (
  a |&gt; foo() |&gt; def(do: a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if(do: a |&gt; bar(-1), else: a |&gt; bar(1)))

  a |&gt; bar(b) |&gt; defp(do: a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect())
))
</code></pre>
<p>We're <code>:do</code>ing great!</p>
<p>You know what's also very Elixir-y? Lists. Lists and tuples.</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule([{:do, (
  a
  |&gt; foo()
  |&gt; def([{:do, a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if([{:do, a |&gt; bar(-1)}, {:else, a |&gt; bar(1)}])}])

  a |&gt; bar(b) |&gt; defp([{:do, a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()}])
)}])
</code></pre>
<p>Who's going to say this looks like Ruby now? ⚗️</p>

<h3>
The dubiousness of digitized signature services
</h3>
</div><div>
<div id="post-body-8553362812323687543">
<div><p>Notice I referred to "digitized" instead of digital, this is a very important distinction. These services essentially offer ways to transport handwritten scribbles into digital processes. They can be anything from attaching a Microsoft paint scribble or a scan of one written on a piece of paper, to custom font generation that makes&nbsp; your signature look like you are a former president of the united states. </p><p>I wont mention any such services by name but if you've purchased a house or engaged in any sort of contract paperwork activity (leases..etc) you have likely encountered these services. Last I checked, one of these companies is worth north of $40B, no doubt reflecting the size of the market for such services.</p><p>First, what is the purpose of any signature? as the name suggests, it is primarily to ascribe provenance to something, be it an abstract thing such as a legal agreement expressed in writing or a physical object such as a painting. We also use the notion of signature to refer to a manifestation that serves as a tell-tale sign of some fact (or the truthfulness thereof) without necessarily observing the actual manifestation of the fact itself.</p><p>What is the purpose of signing a paper then? Well, it is suppose to first, attest to the fact that the entity whose identity is associated with the document is consenting to whatever it is that the paper implies. Second, your scribbles are supposed to be unique, such that someone could not forge them and fool others into accepting an agreement that the identified entity is in fact not a party to.</p><p>Hand written signatures even in the days of king Henry were more of an intellectual pretense than an effective mechanism for genuine projection of trust. That they have persisted into the 21st century is more than distressing. </p><p>We now have even the democratic franchise of voting citizens tethered to matching variations of such scribbles. My handwritten signature varies based on what I had for breakfast, so the idea that anyone would want to judge the authenticity of any document based on it would be hilarious if it weren't such a serious matter.</p><p>The entire edifice of affixing handwritten scribbles (or their digital imitations) to documents is quite mindless if the aim of signatures as described above is to be achieved.</p><p>Obviously the need for entities to affirmatively agree to conditions and to have that recorded in a way that is tamper-proof and indisputable has not gone away. However, given the purpose of signatures, it is clear that scribbles on paper or their digitized cousins are certainly not an answer. At best one can consider these services as ceremonial, in as far as they facilitate the continuation of the pre-digital processes that demand handwritten signatures.</p><p>What then is the solution to signatures in the digital era? The answer is simple and well understood (hard to believe perhaps), PKI certificates. Given that Certisfy is about leveraging PKI for trust on the internet, this is a self-serving answer but it is also a true answer.</p><p>A digital signature (not a digitized one) of a document, along with the certificate whose private key was used to generate such a signature is all that is needed to achieve the intended goal of handwritten signatures. </p><p>From a purely technical requirement perspective, you would need to add no more than two new entries to your data model to support this, a field to store the cryptographic signature and a field to store the cryptographic certificate-chain that can verify that signature. If a dispute were to emerge a century from now, you wouldn't need to hire medieval forensic experts to authenticate the document, you would simply run the signature and document through the appropriate cryptographic verification function to authenticate it.</p><p>There are of course legitimate arguments to make against PKI (some favor blockchain contracts..etc), but when the alternative is handwritten scribbles, such arguments diminish towards meaninglessness.</p></div>

			<p><span>O</span>n May 29, 1810, Katherine Fritsch, a sister in the Moravian Church, boarded a coach in Lititz, Pennsylvania, along with a group of her friends and began the 75-mile trek to Philadelphia. Fritsch noted in her diary the one city site she most wished to see: Peale’s Museum. On the grounds of the museum, whose two buildings sat on State House Square, with rows of trees and manicured lawns, Fritsch passed through a menagerie that included a large cage with a live eagle sitting “right majestically on his perch—above his head a placard with this petition on it: feed me daily for 100 years.”</p><figure data-alt="Dugatkin_BREAKER-1"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17940_1221132d8390ea66832cf2eabd8eb668.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>THE MET OF ITS TIME:</strong> Charles Willson Peale painted this self-portrait to celebrate his pioneering museum. Its goal, he wrote his friend Thomas Jefferson, was to collect subjects in nature and “enlighten the minds of my countrymen.”</span><span>Charles Willson Peale; <i>The Artist in His Museum</i>, 1822; Oil on canvas; Courtesy of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia.&nbsp;Gift of Mrs. Sarah Harrison (The Joseph Harrison, Jr. Collection), 1878.1.2</span></figcaption></figure><p>From the yard, Fritsch went into the Peale Museum proper, through a door with “Whoso would learn Wisdom, let him enter here!” posted above. Fritsch walked past a turnstile that rang chimes to announce visitors. She walked up the stairs and into the Quadruped Room, which included a moose, llama, bear, bison, prong-horned antelope, hyena, and a jackal. She explored the Marine Room, overflowing with fish, amphibians, lizards, sponges, and corals. In the Long Room, glass cases were filled with hundreds of birds set against backdrops matching their natural environments; she saw insect cases in which the specimens could be rotated under a microscope. Fritsch didn’t get to see the museum’s mammoth skeleton, but noted in her diary that “all our talk was of how delightful had been our visit to the museum.”<br></p><p>Fritsch was not the only one who felt that way. From the time Peale’s Museum had opened its doors in 1786, annual attendance had averaged more than 10,000 people. Born both of science and art, it was the first true museum in the fledgling United States and the first must-see attraction not only for Philadelphians but for visitors from around the U.S. and the world. The museum’s creator, Charles Willson Peale, saw the museum as a national good. The “very sinews of government are made strong by a diffused knowledge of this science,” he wrote. The museum’s success made Peale a proud man for many years. It embodied the age of Enlightenment in the new world. After a visit, the French philosopher Comte de Volney proclaimed the museum housed “nothing but truth and reason.” But national funding for truth and reason foundered on the shore of politics. And then the circus came to town.</p><p><span>P</span>eale was born in Maryland in 1741. When he was 9, his father, a schoolteacher, died, leaving the family in poverty. Peale was apprenticed to a saddler at age 13, but spent almost as much time tinkering with mechanical devices of all sorts as he did saddling. His other interest lay in paint brushes and sketching pads. Ambitious as could be, Peale became the Colony’s most famous portrait painter. In 1771, Peale met Martha Washington and convinced her that Colonel Washington should sit for him—the first of 25 portraits, miniatures, mezzotints, or sculptures he would do of the soon-to-be general. Peale also painted portraits of Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and Alexander Hamilton. He named most of his 17 children after famous painters, including Rembrandt, Rubens, and Titian.</p><p>A true autodidact, Peale saw himself as a naturalist and scientist. And any self-respecting deist of the Enlightenment should have a museum. Fortunately, Peale knew all the right people. Robert Patterson, professor of mathematics at the University of the State of Pennsylvania, gave Peale his first specimen for the museum, “a curious fish called the paddle fish caught in the Allegheny River,” Peale wrote. Ben Franklin sent his friend the body of an angora cat that Madame Helvétius had given him when he departed Paris, and Washington sent the body of a just-deceased golden pheasant from the aviary of Louis XVI that the general had received as a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette. Other specimens soon came flooding in.</p><blockquote><p>Peale wrote that society raised roadblocks to women, which didn’t allow them to pursue science.</p> </blockquote><p>In a letter to Jefferson, Peale explained that his goal for the museum was to bring together “a variety of interesting subjects of Nature … collected in one view as would enlighten the minds of my countrymen, and, demonstrate the importance of diffusing a knowledge of the wonderful and various beauties of Nature, more powerful to humanize the mind, promote harmony, and aid virtue than any … yet imagined.”<br></p><p>Peale, a former member of the Philadelphia Militia, was a true-blooded patriot. He created an effigy of a double-faced model of Benedict Arnold in a carriage, dressed in a red coat and holding a letter to Beelzebub with the devil standing behind him shaking a purse full of money. When it came to his museum, he had no intent of curating the sort of European hall that catered only to “particular classes of society only, or open at such turns or at such portions of time, as effectually to debar the mass of society, from participating in the improvement, and the pleasure resulting from a careful visitation,” he wrote. His museum would be open to all—“the unwise as well as the learned.”</p><p>Peale held progressive views on women and children, and because he knew that a family-friendly venue would attract more visitors, he reached out to bring women and children into his museum. Women were not only encouraged to visit the museum, Peale wanted them to contribute to the enterprise, sending in samples and sharing ideas. Society, he believed, raised roadblocks to women “which allow no time for them to devote in the arduous pursuits of science,” but, he was quick to point out, “when females have devoted themselves to these pursuits they have given every demonstration of the intensity and depth of their intellectual powers.” He wanted to tap into those powers to better the museum and the plight of women.</p><figure data-alt="Dugatkin_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17932_bbc90218e55a81732f0f78c16cbf2b6f.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>TOM THUMB’S BLUES:</strong> Charles Stratton (right) was a child when P.T. Barnum (left) first hired him to perform in his museum. Barnum publicized Stratton as “General Tom Thumb,” a character who became a major attraction for the circus impresario for decades.</span><span>Wikimedia</span></figcaption></figure><p>Reverend Manasseh Cutler, a respected naturalist of the day, who had gained fame for his bravery as a chaplain during the Revolution, was an early visitor to Peale’s Museum in 1787 and was struck by the exhibits “arranged in a most romantic and amusing manner.” He describes two dioramas—a mound with trees and an artificial pond, each the result of Peale having spent many a morning “dressing the museum in moss.” The pond was stocked with fish, geese, ducks, cranes, and herons, “all having the appearance of life, for their skins were admirably preserved.” On the beach around the pond Cutler was dazzled by an assortment of “shells of different kinds, turtles, frogs, toads, lizards, water snakes, etc.” Cutler’s diary ends: “Mr. Peale’s animals reminded me of Noah’s Ark, into which was received every kind of beast and creeping thing in which there was life. But I can hardly conceive that even Noah could have boasted of a better collection.”<br></p><p>From the outset, the museum was meant to be a collaborative effort. Jefferson, Hamilton, James Madison, Gouverneur Morris, famed astronomer David Rittenhouse, and naturalists Benjamin Smith Barton and William Barton, sat on the museum’s board of directors. But this museum was not to be some highfalutin society club. Peale turned more often to his fellow citizens than to his board of directors to contribute what they could, be it specimen or knowledge. Each year, he would publish dozens of newspaper advertisements that included not just a call for specimens, but lists of new specimens received of late, information about new exhibits, changes to museum hours of operation, and perhaps strangest to our eyes, praise or admonitions of the way the public was responding to activities at the museum.</p><p>A few years after it opened, in a series of parades, young boys (and older men) moved all the exhibits to the museum’s new home in the American Philosophical Society’s Philosophical Hall. Peale and his family moved their own home to the basement of the museum, so as to better manage the ever-growing enterprise. Soon, the museum outgrew even Philosophical Hall and moved to the State House (what we now call Independence Hall), above the rooms where the Declaration of Independence were signed, and below where a soon to be rather famous bell rang each day.</p><p><span>I</span>n 1801, Peale and a team undertook the first major paleontological excavation in the U.S. Near Newburgh, New York they dug up, and then painstakingly reconstructed, the complete skeleton of a mammoth (technically, it was a mastodon, but that distinction did not yet exist). It was quite the sight and caught the fancy of locals. “Every farmer with his wife and children, for twenty miles round in every direction flocked to see the operation,” wrote Peale’s son Rembrandt. The <i>Mercantile Advertiser</i> soon ran tantalizing headlines like “Bones of a Mammoth or some other Wonderful Animal,” titillating readers with tales of “a monster so vastly disproportionate to every creature; as to induce a momentary suspension of every animal faculty but admiration and wonder.”</p><blockquote><p>Ben Franklin sent his friend the body of an angora cat and George Washington sent a golden pheasant.</p> </blockquote><p>In <i>Skeleton of the Mammoth</i>, a broadside that Peale posted across Philadelphia in 1802, he informed readers that though “numerous have been the attempts of scientific characters of all nations to procure a satisfactory collection of bones,” he and his museum had at last done just that. Peale even had one of the museum employees distribute the broadside throughout the city while on horseback …</p></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can build this.</p>

  <p>— <cite>every developer at least once</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowledge is hard to manage, as mind is hard to materialize and visualize.</p>

<p>Bi-directional networked tools like <code>roam-research</code> and <code>obsidian</code> are on the trend for a while now. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph">The idea behind them</a> is not brand new, yet the much evolved web-based tech makes them possible.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-want-to-build">what I want to build</h2>

<p>I record my building of <code>fiber-note</code> in this series of dev posts, what I want to build is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tag-based bi-directional networked note-taking</li>
  <li>web-based real-time experience
    <ul>
      <li>constantly auto-saving</li>
      <li>real-time reactive interface
        <ul>
          <li>updating components other than the editor (related notes, navigation, tags network, calendar, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a highly-customized editor
    <ul>
      <li>enforce a custom schema to control the layout of the documents
        <ul>
          <li>say everything is a list item, there may be only text and tags in a paragraph, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>handle meta-data like tags, assigning unique ids for the block</li>
      <li>complex UI like inline drop-down menu</li>
      <li>…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>visualize data as a network and a calendar</li>
  <li>open-sourced and self-hosted</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="code--demo">code &amp; demo</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/namiwang/fiber-note" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://namiwang.github.io/assets/images/fiber-note.gif" width="480" alt="fiber note screenshot">
</a></p>

<p>I placed the source <a href="https://github.com/namiwang/fiber-note">here</a>, which could be hosted by yourself. There’s even a configured deploy-to-heroku button for one-click hosting.</p>

<p>I also put up a public demo running at <a href="https://fiber-note-demo.herokuapp.com/session/new">fiber-note-demo.herokuapp.com</a> (password is <code>password</code>).</p>

<h2 id="naming-the-project">naming the project</h2>

<p>I always use rails as my first choice for web projects, and the first code name for this project is <code>roam-on-rails</code>, which is a bad joke since I’ve already got a project called <a href="https://github.com/ruby-on-rust/ruby-on-rust">ruby on rust</a>.</p>

<p>I’m bad at this, so I just picked the word <code>fiber</code> as a synonym for <code>network</code> from the thesaurus.</p>



<h2 id="a-prototype-on-paper">a prototype on paper</h2>

<p><a href="https://namiwang.github.io/assets/images/fiber-note-series/fiber-note-diagram.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://namiwang.github.io/assets/images/fiber-note-series/fiber-note-diagram.png" alt="fiber note data structure">
</a></p>

<h2 id="a-data-structure-in-mind">a data structure in mind</h2>

<p>The whole database is structured as a directed graph. The basic unit is a <code>block</code>, a node in the graph, representing a paragraph, bearing data like its content and optional tags.</p>

<p>Every block-node may have one parent. Thus a note, spawning from the root (a parent-free block-node), forms a tree and the whole database forms a forest.</p>

<p>There’re some edge cases to consider</p>

<ul>
  <li>have to avoid cycles in the graph</li>
  <li>a tag may points to the same note</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-data-structure-on-disk">a data structure on disk</h2>

<p>Apparently we need to maintain a graph, yet I didn’t choose a graph-oriented database like <code>neo4j</code>. Using good old SQL to simulate one is good enough for now.</p>

<p>There’re both plugins to do graph on database level (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/announcing-age-a-multi-model-graph-database-extension-for-postgresql-2050/">AGE</a> for postgresql), and rails level (like <a href="https://github.com/jackc/edge">edge</a>). For the initial implementation, I chose to hand-written everything from the grounded up for faster iteration because I was constantly changing things.</p>



<p>This is gonna be a front-end-heavy project, I have to choose an editor as one of the first steps.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>restrict the doc to a special set of content types
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. allow list, list item, and inline tags; disallow individual paragraphs or images</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>render existing data into the editor</li>
  <li>inspect and manipulate input from the user
    <ul>
      <li>enforce input rules like properly wrapping/indenting list items</li>
      <li>assign unique ids to created blocks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>implement drop-down menu to auto-complete tags</li>
  <li>send updated content to the server</li>
  <li>features we may need in the future
    <ul>
      <li>copy-and-paste, drag-and-drop, image, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

</table>

<p>I tried a few options. At the end I settled with <a href="https://prosemirror.net/">prose-mirror</a> to build fiber-note due to thorough guides and references, up-to-date maintaining, and <a href="https://discuss.prosemirror.net/">a friendly forum</a>.</p>

<h2 id="trix">trix</h2>

<p>As a rails user, my first thought are <code>actiontext</code> and <a href="https://trix-editor.org/">trix</a>. Trix is perfect for adding out-of-box rich-text editing to a normal rails app, like rails, it just works.</p>

<p>It’s just hard to tweak for more custom features.</p>

<ul>
  <li>it completely intertwined with rails’ components like <code>actionview</code> (rendering) and <code>activestorage</code> (image uploading), it’s hard to mutate the saved content without hacking into hidden methods.</li>
  <li>it saves content as raw HTML fragment, which is bad because
    <ul>
      <li>unique content have multiple legit representations</li>
      <li>it’s slow to parse and manipulate the content (say tags detection, image processing, table mutation, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>it doesn’t come with detailed docs/specs about the format of generated HTML docs, which is not reliable when you system relies on processing the content on-the-fly.</li>
  <li>minimal events not enough to compose complex logic around the user’s operation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quill">quill</h2>

<p><a href="https://quilljs.com/">quill</a> is another competitive  candidate, regarding elaborated docs, data format specs, themes, and typescript support.</p>

<p>It’s easy to integrate the library, tweak some configurations, and apply different themes. You can add markdown syntax support in like 10 minutes.</p>

<p>It’s not easy to limit what kind of content is allowed in the document, or what would happen if a special formatted text is pasted.</p>

<p>It’s hard to pragmatically control the mutation of the data to manually implement functions like “create another list item with the same indent when <em>return</em> is pressed and current cursor on the end of a list item, including the end of an inline span of a list item”.</p>

<p>It’s not impossible, yet it will get over-complicated if you need many mutations like this.</p>

<h2 id="prose-mirror">prose-mirror</h2>

<p><code>prose-mirror</code> has the most complicated structure.  You have to import <strong>at least ten packages</strong> to build a simple demo, each managing a single aspect of the editor (model, view, schema definitions, keymaps, etc.).</p>

<p>There’s a starter kit kind of package (<code>prosemirror-example-setup</code>) which makes the journey a little bit easier. I’d recommend that kit to users who demand only basic features, while for complex functions you’ll have to compose each part and piece them together for better control. It’s like how advanced users almost never want the pre-set default preferences or <code>rails scaffold</code>.</p>

<p>Verbosity and redundancy means total control and vice versa, it just have to be like this. You posses the ability to custom the schema, listen to each key press, oversee every transaction of the model, and to arrange how to create (also parse, and wrap, and truncate during drag-n-drop, etc.) different kind of element.</p>

<p>You’ll spend a lot of time jumping between the <a href="https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/">guides</a>, the <a href="https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/">references for individual packages</a>, and even the source code. I can promise you that the guide will be a great read about the designing of a complicated modular system.</p>



<p>Thanks for reading. In the next post, I’ll discuss how I built and tweaked the editor.</p>

<h4>On HackerNews</h4>



<p>There are several interesting takeaways from the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20081488#20088463">HackerNews thread</a> for this article series. Do check it out.</p>



<p>Web apps are the staple of consumers and enterprises. Among the many existing protocols that are used to move and make sense of bits, HTTP has an overwhelming mind share. As you encounter and learn the nuances of web application development, most of you might pay very little  attention to the operating system that finally runs your applications. The separation of Dev and Ops only made this worse. But with the DevOps culture becoming common place and developers becoming responsible for running their apps in the cloud, it is a clear advantage to better understand backend operating system nitty-gritty. You don’t really have to bother with Linux and how your backend will scale if you are deploying your backend as a system for personal use or for use by a few concurrent users. If you are trying to deploy for thousands or tens of thousands of concurrent users, however, having a good understanding of how the operating system figures out in your whole stack will be incredibly useful. </p>



<p>The constraints we are up against in the web services we write are very similar to those in other applications that are required to make a web service or application work. Be those load balancers or the database servers. All these classes of applications have similar challenges in high-performance environments. Understanding these fundamental constraints and how to work around them will in general make you appreciate what performance and scalability of your web applications or services are up against.</p>



<p>I am writing this series in response to the questions I get asked by young developers who want to become well–informed system architects. Without diving down into the basics of what makes Linux applications tick and the different ways of structuring Linux or Unix network applications, it is not possible to gain a through and clear understanding of Linux application performance. While there are many types of Linux applications, what I want to explore here are Linux networking–oriented applications as opposed to say, a desktop application like a browser or a text editor. This is because the audience for this series are web services/application developers and architects who want to understand how Linux or Unix applications work and how to structure these services for high performance. </p>



<p>Linux is <em>the</em> server operating system and more often than not, your applications probably run on Linux finally. Although I say Linux, most of the time you can safely assume I also include other Unix–like operating systems in general. However, I haven’t extensively tested the accompanying code on other Unix–like systems. So, if you are interested in FreeBSD or OpenBSD, your mileage may vary. Where I attempt anything Linux-specific, I’ve done my best to point it out.</p>



<p>While you can certainly use this knowledge to choose the best possible structure for a new network application you want to write from scratch, you might not be firing up your favorite text editor and writing a web server in C or C++ to solve the problem of having to deliver the next business app in your organization. That might be a guaranteed way to get yourself fired. Having said that, knowing these application structures will help you tremendously in choosing one among a few existing applications, if you know how they are structured. After understanding this article series, you will be able to appreciate process–based vs. thread–based vs. event–based systems. You will get to understand and appreciate why Nginx performs better than Apache httpd or why a Tornado based Python application might be able to serve more concurrent users compared to a Django based Python application.</p>



<h3>ZeroHTTPd: A learning tool</h3>



<p><a href="https://github.com/shuveb/zerohttpd">ZeroHTTPd</a> is a web server I wrote from scratch in C as a teaching tool. It has no external dependencies, including for Redis access. We roll our own Redis routines–read more below.</p>



<p>While we could talk a whole lot of theory, there is nothing like writing code, running it, benchmarking it to compare each of server architectures we evolve. This should cement your understanding like no other method. To this end, we will develop a simple web server called ZeroHTTPd using process–based, thread–based and event–based models. We will benchmark our each of these servers and see how they perform relative to one another. ZeroHTTPd is a simple–as–possible HTTP server written from scratch in pure C with no external library dependencies. It is implemented in a single C file. For event-based servers, I include <a href="https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/">uthash</a>, an excellent hash table implementation, which is comes in a single header file. Otherwise, there are no dependencies and this is to keep things simple.</p>



<p>I’ve heavily commented the code to aid understanding. ZeroHTTPd is also a bare minimal web development framework apart from being a simple web server written in a couple of hundred lines of C. It doesn’t do a lot. But, it can server static files and  very simple “dynamic” pages. Having said this, ZeroHTTPd is well-suited for you to understand how to architect your Linux applications for high-performance. At the end of the day, most web services wait around for requests, look into what that request is and process them. This is exactly what we will be doing with ZeroHTTPd as well. It is a learning tool, not something you’ll use in production. It is also not going to win awards for error handling, security best practices (oh yes, I’ve used <code>strcpy</code>) or for clever tricks and shortcuts of the C language, of which there are several. But, it’ll hopefully serve its purpose well (pun unintended).</p>

<h4>The Guestbook App</h4>



<p>Modern web applications hardly serve just static files. They have complex interactions with various databases, caches, etc. To that end, we build a simple web app named “Guestbook” that lets guests lovingly leave their name and remarks. Guestbook also lists remarks previously left by various guests as well. There is also a visitor counter towards the bottom of the page.</p>



<div data-carousel-extra="{&quot;blog_id&quot;:1,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/unixism.net\/2019\/04\/linux-applications-performance-introduction\/&quot;}"><figure><img data-attachment-id="63" data-permalink="https://unixism.net/2019/04/linux-applications-performance-introduction/zerohttpd_guestbook/" data-orig-file="https://unixism.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ZeroHTTPd_Guestbook.png" data-orig-size="913,1250" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="ZeroHTTPd_Guestbook" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://unixism.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ZeroHTTPd_Guestbook.png" data-large-file="https://unixism.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ZeroHTTPd_Guestbook.png" src="https://unixism.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ZeroHTTPd_Guestbook.png" alt="" data-lazy-src="https://unixism.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ZeroHTTPd_Guestbook.png?is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>The ZeroHTTPd “Guestbook” web app</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>We store the visitor counter and the guest book entries in Redis. To talk to Redis, we do not depend on an external library. We have our own custom C routines to talk to Redis. I’m not big fan of rolling out your own stuff when you can use something that is already available and well tested. But the goal of ZeroHTTPd is to teach Linux performance and accessing external services while in the middle of serving an HTTP request has a huge implications as far as performance goes. We need to be in full control of the way we talk to Redis in each of the server architectures we are building. While in one architecture we use blocking calls, in others we use event-based routines. Using an external Redis client library won’t allow us this control. Also, we will be implementing our own Redis client only to the extent we will use Redis (Getting, setting and incrementing a key. Getting and appending to an array). Moreover, the Redis protocol is super elegant and simple. Something to even learn about deliberately. The very fact that you can implement a super-fast protocol that does its job in about 100 lines of codes goes to say a lot about how well thought out the protocol is. </p>



<p>The following figure illustrates the steps we follow in order to get the HTML ready to serve when a client (browser) requests the <code>/guestbook</code>URL.</p>



<div data-carousel-extra="{&quot;blog_id&quot;:1,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/unixism.net\/2019\/04\/linux-applications-performance-introduction\/&quot;}"><figure><img data-attachment-id="81" data-permalink="https://unixism.net/2019/04/linux-applications-performance-introduction/guestbook-flow/" data-orig-file="https://unixism.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Guestbook-Flow.png" data-orig-size="944,88" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Guestbook Flow" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://unixism.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Guestbook-Flow.png" data-large-file="https://unixism.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Guestbook-Flow.png" src="https://unixism.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Guestbook-Flow.png" alt="" data-lazy-src="https://unixism.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Guestbook-Flow.png?is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Guestbook app flow</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>When a Guestbook page needs to be served, there is one file-system call to read the template into memory and three network-related calls to Redis. The template file has most of the HTML content that makes up the Guestbook page you see in the screenshot above. It also has special placeholders where the dynamic part of the content which comes from Redis like guest remarks and the visitor counter go. We fetch these from Redis, replace these for the placeholders in the template file and finally, the fully formed content is written out to the client. The third call to Redis could have been avoided since Redis returns the new value of any incremented key. However, for our purposes, as we move our server to asynchronous, event-based architectures, having a server that is busy blocking on a bunch of network calls is a good way to learn about things. So, we discard the return value that Redis returns when we increment the visitor count and read it back in a separate call.</p>



<h3>ZeroHTTPd Server Architectures</h3>



<p>We will build ZeroHTTPd, retaining the same functionality, using 7 different architectures:</p>



<ul><li>Iterative</li><li>Forking (one child process per request)</li><li>Pre-forked server (pre-forked processes)</li><li>Threaded (one thread per request)</li><li>Pre-threaded (threads pre-created)</li><li><code>poll()</code>-based </li><li><code>epoll</code> based</li></ul>



<p> We shall also measure the performance of each architecture loading them each with 10,000 HTTP requests. However, as we move on to comparisons with architectures that can handle a lot more concurrency, we will switch to testing with 30,000 requests. We test 3 times and consider the average.</p>



<h3>Testing Methodology</h3>



<div data-carousel-extra="{&quot;blog_id&quot;:1,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/unixism.net\/2019\/04\/linux-applications-performance-introduction\/&quot;}"><figure><img data-attachment-id="83" data-permalink="https://unixism.net/2019/04/linux-applications-performance-introduction/zerohttpd-testing-2/" data-orig-file="https://unixism.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ZeroHTTPd-Testing-1.png" data-orig-size="614,198" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="ZeroHTTPd Testing" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://unixism.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ZeroHTTPd-Testing-1.png" data-large-file="https://unixism.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ZeroHTTPd-Testing-1.png" src="https://unixism.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ZeroHTTPd-Testing-1.png" alt="" data-lazy-src="https://unixism.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ZeroHTTPd-Testing-1.png?is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>The ZeroHTTPd load testing setup</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It is important that these tests not be run with all components on the same machine. If that is done, the operating system will have the extra overhead of scheduling between all those components, as they vie for CPU. Measuring operating system overhead with each of the chosen server architectures is one of the most important aims of this exercise. Adding more variables will be detrimental to the process. Hence, a setup described in the illustration above will work best.</p>

<p>Google acquired YouTube for US$1.6 billion back in 2006. We estimate YouTube to be worth up to US$170 billion in 2020, delivering Google a +100x return in under 15 years.

<h2><a name="1"></a>5 Key Questions to Answer</h2>
<p>To reach a valuation for YouTube, we must firstly answer 5 questions about the business:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Industry</strong>: What industry does it compete in?</li>
<li><strong>Customer</strong>: Who are its customers and how does it deliver them value?</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong>: What is its revenue model and key drivers?</li>
<li><strong>Costs</strong>: What are its major costs and how are they managed?</li>
<li><strong>Growth</strong>: What is the growth thesis?</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. What industry does YouTube compete in?</h3>
<p>YouTube is the world’s largest online video service and competes for user viewership in order to compete for digital advertising spend from businesses. YouTube’s parent is Google/ Alphabet and operates globally except China where Google is banned.</p>
<p>Global ad spend (ex China) is over half a trillion dollars annually, of which half is spent on digital (web and mobile). The lion’s share of this is dominated by Google and Facebook which capture over 80% of digital ad spend.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/vwq10xzbe6iz/4kzjexfgsxFPhJOyyo2jS0/9b06d17b7cc5d7e0a6b080ec5beb7bf2/globaladshare.png" alt="globaladshare"></p>
<p>Splitting up Google and Facebook’s major ad platforms we reveal YouTube is the 5th largest digital ad platform with 6% share, behind Google Search, Facebook, Google Display and Instagram.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/vwq10xzbe6iz/2EbkvWiatOFXQYBVoqNlE5/03b1f3088e0b11f783116028d2682985/globaladfbyoutube.png" alt="globaladbyproduct"></p>
<p>Future growth of the digital ad market is any oracle’s guess. But if we assume digital remains a dominant advertising medium industry, then digital spend could reach over half a trillion by 2030 (assumes 7% annual growth).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When looking at the industry a company operates in, focus on how the company generates revenue and compare against competitors and alternative mediums. Research industry statistics and competitor annual reports to get a rough estimate of how large the current industry is.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. Who are YouTube’s customers and how do they deliver them value?</h3>
<p>YouTube is an online video platform that allows content creators (individuals and businesses) to publish videos for users to watch. YouTube sells ads to businesses placed within video content and shares the revenue with publishers.</p>
<p>YouTube delivers value to 3 key stakeholders:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creators</strong>: monetize their video content on the platform with the widest reach. Allows creators to focus on producing quality content and outsource hosting and marketing costs to YouTube</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong>: free, targeted and relevant video content and entertainment (for better or worse)</li>
<li><strong>Advertisers</strong>: brand impressions and targeted reach across a global audience</li>
</ul>
<p>YouTube ultimately competes for global viewership and monetizes this by selling ads to businesses. YouTube has over 2 billion monthly active users and is the second largest social media platform in the world. The chart below compares the monthly active users across major ad supported social media platforms and video platforms:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/vwq10xzbe6iz/yQISXiQ5Gh5jgiQWcYKLu/61903f1edd297535079c73c0d7b17d22/mausocial.png" alt="mausocial"></p>
<p>Whilst each player competes for viewership, their target audience and monetization models differ:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and Twitter  sell ads placed in a user’s social media feed of images, video, news, articles</li>
<li>Netflix sells subscription services to users for its original and purchased content</li>
<li>TikTok is early in its monetization strategy</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>When understanding how a company generates revenue, ask yourself: Who is the customer and why would they pay for the offering? For technology platform companies, understand the ecosystem of stakeholders and the benefit each of them receive from using the platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>3. What is YouTube’s revenue model and key drivers?</h3>
<p>YouTube has two primary revenue streams:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ad sales</strong> (90% revenue): YouTube sells targeted ads within video content across its 2 billion monthly active users. It shares ad revenue with content publishers via a 45/55 split in favour of publishers; and</li>
<li><strong>Subscription</strong> (10% revenue): YouTube premium offers an ad free video experience and music service offered at ~$10 per month. There are currently 20 million premium subscribers representing ~1% of YouTube’s total monthly active user base</li>
</ul>
<p>YouTube’s key revenue driver is its ability to monetize its monthly active user base. We can assess its performance vs peers by comparing the average annual ad spend generated by each provider divided by its monthly active user base.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/vwq10xzbe6iz/5SzsrFRvxXSiFttWKHFSxm/596bb1ecbda955f39031a46059e20178/arputitle.png" alt="arpu"></p>
<p>Facebook currently generates 2x higher ad revenue per active user than YouTube across both Facebook and Instagram platforms. This could be explained by Facebook’s greater variety of ad formats and granular audience targeting (interests, age, behaviour, lookalike audience) and being further along its journey of ad monetization.</p>
<p>The biggest driver of revenue for YouTube will likely be its ability to drive higher ad spend to its already large audience via product innovation (e.g. new ad formats, improved targeting) rather than growing its audience. YouTube is also earlier in its monetization strategy and has also invested significant resources to clean up the quality of content published.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key to understanding any revenue model is to identify the key revenue drivers: 1) volume (e.g. customers, users, businesses), 2) pricing (ARPU, new products, upsell) and 3) churn (% customers leaving each month, non-renewals). Try and understand the narrative of how the company can influence these drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>4. What are YouTube’s biggest cost drivers?</h3>
<p>YouTube’s major costs can be separated across 3 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue</strong>: variable costs associated with delivery of services and revenue. Includes ad share revenue paid to creators and data-centre operation and hosting costs;</li>
<li><strong>Operating Costs</strong>: largely staff and support related costs to drive platform and product development (R&amp;D), revenue growth and creator support (Sales &amp; Marketing), content moderation, finance, admin (General &amp; Admin); and</li>
<li><strong>Capex &amp; Acquisitions</strong>: investments in data-centre infrastructure, acquisitions of businesses and supporting tech. These are cash outflows not captured in the income statement</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/vwq10xzbe6iz/7yjEplwqk3bj6K9lfULGQm/2fa7a97f21a0ff6821ead4e0fb0a5918/opextitle.png" alt="youtubeopex"></p>
<p><strong>Cost of Revenue</strong>
YouTube’s largest cost base is the revenue it shares with content publishers. It splits ad and subscription revenue attached to content viewership in the ratio 45/ 55% in the favour of publishers.</p>
<p>YouTube’s other major variable costs are the delivery and data-centre operation costs for the 500 hours of video content that gets uploaded every minute. These costs largely include depreciation charges following major upfront capex investments in data-centres. We estimate 7% in line with Alphabet’s overall depreciation charge as % of revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Operating Costs</strong>
Alphabet does not publicly disclose YouTube’s other operating expenses so we will need to estimate.</p>
<p>YouTube’s major fixed costs are its operating costs which are largely staff related and associated with sales and marketing, supporting creators, research &amp; development (software and product roles), content moderation (outsourced contractors), finance, admin and support.</p>
<p>We can estimate YouTube’s opex margins by comparing against peers. Netflix has a total opex/ revenue of 20% and Facebook at ~35-45%. We can estimate that YouTube may currently operate within the range at 35% opex/ revenue. We can assume given scale benefits that this will lower over time in line with Netflix at 20% opex as % of revenue.</p>
<p>This analysis highlights that YouTube’s profitability is lower than other social media platforms and Google’s other ad businesses. This is largely due to YouTube’s reliance on ad sharing with content publishers.</p>
<p><strong>Capex &amp; Acquisitions</strong>
Alphabet does not separate YouTube’s cashflow financials so we must estimate capex figures.</p>
<p>In our methodology, depreciation is already accounted for in the operating expenses hence we must estimate the incremental net capital expenditure (e.g. capex less depreciation) in order to estimate the total cash outflows associated with investment in infrastructure.</p>
<p>We will adopt the Godfather of Valuation’s (Aswath Damodaran) approach of using the <a href="https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2928207&amp;seqNum=5">sales to capital ratio</a> to estimate the required net capex to support revenue growth. This is calculated as the net change in revenue divided by the net capex of each year.</p>
<p>Alphabet has an average sales to capital ratio of 1.9x (annual change in revenue divided by change in invested capital (debt + equity less cash)). This implies that for every $100 of incremental revenue Alphabet generates each year it reinvests $50 as capital to support growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When estimating costs, identify the major drivers across cost of revenue, operating costs and capex costs. Go through annual financial reports to identify the major line items and review notes to understand what is included and not included and understand the main drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>5. What is the growth thesis for YouTube?</h3>
<p>Based on our above analysis and understanding we can base our growth thesis for YouTube on two key drivers: ad monetization and stable user growth.</p>
<p><strong>Ad Monetization</strong>
YouTube is early in its monetization strategy and has largely relied on ad revenue from high quality in-video ad formats driven by impressions. It has begun to experiment with new formats including direct response display ads within homepage recommendation feeds and direct text search ads. These new formats support greater ability to sell more ads to its user base.</p>
<p>We can estimate that YouTube over the next 10 years will increase its ad monetization from $8 ARPU to $23 ARPU in line with Facebook currently.</p>

<p>Most programmers I know started programming out of sheer curiosity and joy. Joy is what keeps one motivated to keep up with the changing landscape of technology. It’s what keeps one happy. That is why I am recommending these 10 best books for programmers, books I really enjoyed reading. These are the books that I keep picking up and coming back to or have fond memories of. These are also the books that I hardly see recommended elsewhere, except for a few classics that are certainly worth repeating. And now I would like to share these books with you.</p>

<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/36ALozx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Pragmatic Programmer<br></a><sub>Your Journey to Mastery, 20th Anniversary Edition</sub></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="230" height="300" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-pragmatic-programmer-230x300.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>I would recommend any programmer to read this book. It contains a lot of wisdom, tips, and advice. Most of it is pretty basic but therein lies the beauty. The first edition released in 1999 and was getting pretty dated. Despite it being old it was still highly recommended. To my surprise they released a new edition 20 years later, all up-to-date! Now you’ve got no excuses left to not read this book. A wonderful book that you surely will be referring back to over and over again, I know I do.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.learninpublic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Coding Career Handbook<br></a><sub>Guides, Principles, Strategies, and Tactics – from Code Newbie to Senior Dev</sub></h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-coding-career-handbook-196x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-coding-career-handbook-196x300.jpg 196w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-coding-career-handbook.jpg 311w" sizes="(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px"></figure></div>



<p>Similar to the The Pragmatic Programmer, I consider this book a must-read. It focuses on the bigger picture and your career, not just about writing code. This book is the reason I started this blog in the first place! A great book for any ambitious programmer and want to take your career to the next level.</p>




</div></div>



<div><div>
<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/36ulPQI">Apprenticeship Patterns<br></a><sub>Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman</sub></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="229" height="300" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apprenticeship-patterns-229x300.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apprenticeship-patterns-229x300.jpeg 229w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apprenticeship-patterns.jpeg 260w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px"></figure></div>



<p>If you’re new to programming, making the same mistakes as the programmers that have gone before you can be costly and detrimental for your career. Let this book guide you on avoiding these same mistakes. This book is similar to the ones mentioned above and makes for a nice addition. It’s split up into smaller sections that can be read in any order you’d like, this makes it a fun and easy read.</p>




</div></div>



<div><div>
<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/3prQVAU">Beginning C++ Through Game Programming</a></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="243" height="300" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/beginning-c-through-game-programming-243x300.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/beginning-c-through-game-programming-243x300.jpg 243w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/beginning-c-through-game-programming.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px"></figure></div>



<p>This is the book that taught me how code and was the first book I read on the subject of programming. It made learning new programming languages that much easier. Ever since I read this book it seems I’ve always been one step ahead of the herd. This book is about learning the fundamentals of programming and C++ and less about games. It merely uses games as an example to reinforce programming concepts. This book was a lot of fun to read and because it uses games as a theme it keeps one motivated.</p>




</div></div>



<div><div>
<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/35sQDSE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Programming Game AI by Example</a></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="201" height="300" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/programming-game-ai-by-example-201x300.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/programming-game-ai-by-example-201x300.jpg 201w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/programming-game-ai-by-example.jpg 335w" sizes="(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px"></figure></div>



<p>To be honest I have not read this book in it’s entirety yet as I currently lack the time to do so. But I am really excited about this one and can’t wait to read it in combination with learning a new programming language: Rust. This book makes use of C++ but I’d figure these languages are similar enough as to implement the same ideas in Rust. I’ve put this book on this list because of the pure excitement it makes me feel. I would recommend to at least peruse this book to see if it resonates with you.</p>

<p>This is a book I got recommended, I read it, I loved it. I recommended it to a friend, and he loved it. And now I recommend it to you! It’s a really fun read and I could hardly put it down. This book really is written like a novel and packed with great lessons. Go read it! There is also a part two of sorts: The Unicorn Project. I hear it contains much of the same lessons, only told with a different story. I have yet to read it but will certainly do so in the near future.</p>

<p>I adore this book. It’s a book I keep coming back to over and over. It’s about programming patterns with a game theme once again. Note that the patterns here are not only for games! Some of them are game specific but most of them aren’t. It’s a fun read with beautiful hand drawn diagrams. Bob Nystrom clearly has put a lot of love in his book. You can read the web version for free <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
 		
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about corporate knowledge management systems recently.</p>



<p>If we think about a company as an organism, then a knowledge management system is essentially the (collective) brain that keeps that organism alive and running. A corporate knowledge management system should contain every single bit of codifiable information within the company resulting in a library of all projects, processes and procedures.</p>



<p>In an ideal state, it is the single source of truth that helps to inform every individual in the firm about what everyone else is up to. Information should be easy to add (input) as well as easy to search and find (output) resulting in quick knowledge transfer between different employees.</p>



<p>In reality, however, this hardly ever is the case. As anyone who has ever worked at a larger company can attest to, company knowledge bases always end up being a huge mess. </p>



<p>What starts with a neatly organized Confluence wiki, over time morphs into a multi-headed monster consisting of millions of notes and documents that live across Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, Asana and half a dozen different wiki tools. Most docs will be outdated, some will contradict others and the one you are really looking for only shows up on page 14 of your search results.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/monster-4.png"></p><p>It seems like things usually start to fall apart once a company surpasses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar number</a> of 150 employees. This is probably when people start to realize that all the different documents of <em>explicit knowledge</em> they were amassing over the years have been held together with <em>implicit knowledge</em>. </p>



<p>It’s easy to find – and understand – the right documents when you know every other person in the company, but once you’re past that point, you need a system to organize all the data so that people can make sense of it.</p>



<p>The idea behind tools like Notion is to solve this problem by using just one tool for all your different knowledge documents. Instead of Google Docs AND Asana AND Trello AND Airtable, you just do everything in Notion. This reduces complexity because you don’t have to switch and search across different apps. At the same time, Notion forces you to think about a system that makes information easy to find with its folder-like structure and links between different databases.</p>



<p>I’ve never used Notion with more than half a dozen people myself, but from what I’ve heard from people at larger companies, Notion knowledge bases also don’t scale very well beyond a certain number of users. Once too many people start contributing to it, things become bloated and unnavigable.</p>



<p>A friend at Stripe recently suggested – half-jokingly – that we should hire a librarian to organize all our internal data and documentation. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea. Perhaps every company should hire a Chief Notion Officer once it hits 100 employees?!</p>



<p>An alternative approach to Notion is a knowledge management system that can live across different tools and without active manual curation because it’s based on really powerful search. The folder structure of your Google Drive, for example, doesn’t <em>really</em> matter because looking up documents via search is faster and more convenient. Meta search tools like <a href="https://usefyi.com/">FYI</a> are supposed to offer the same but across different productivity tools.</p>



<p>But again I’m skeptical that this really works beyond a certain amount of users (and thus documents). I remember even Google’s internal search engine doing only a mediocre job of surfacing the most relevant documents (and even if it did you weren’t sure if there wasn’t a better or more up-to-date version of it).</p>



<p>I’m sure we’ll get there eventually, but until then we probably need a mix of automated search and manual human help – which is where Slack comes in. I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1097940802737704960">always thought</a> Slack plus Notion plus <a href="https://www.atspoke.com/">Spoke</a> would make a really powerful product (and I’m surprised Slack hasn’t made any major acquisitions in this space).</p>



<p>If you think about it, Slack is basically a search engine powered by humans: Most Slack messages are just questions. <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">It’s 911 for when everything else fails</a>. So if Slack had access to your entire knowledge base, it could answer at least the most commonly asked questions automatically. The rest would still get answered manually by the channel participants. Or your Chief Notion Officer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Hey team,</p>

<p>This is the continuation (and end) of the <em>Language(s) of Science</em> series that we started <a href="https://languagetools.io/forum/t/3191" target="_blank">here</a>. It's a long one, so let's dive right into it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/b6P7x4S/Part-II.png"></p><h3>English is the language of science</h3>
<p>Today, English is the dominant language of science. There are many factors - political, economic, social, or regulatory - that help explain this phenomenon. The geopolitical dominance of the British Empire and then of the United States in the last few centuries gave the language a head-start, and a momentum. Rich English-speaking countries are some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_scientific_and_technical_journal_articles" target="_blank">most prolific</a> in terms of scientific output. The quasi-totality of the <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php?type=j" target="_blank">most influential scientific journals</a> are English-language, and an <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-five-companies-control-more-than-half-of-academic-publishing" target="_blank">oligopolistic academic publishing sector</a> reinforces a monolingual scientific communication. English might be the <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/most-popular-languages-in-the-world.html" target="_blank">most widely spoken language</a> in the world, at more than 1 billion people. The "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_or_perish" target="_blank">publish or perish</a>" culture, where funding and tenure are conditional on publication performance above all else, and the incentive systems that result from this lead scientists to write in the language that will increase the likelihood of the article getting published, reaching a large readership, and garnering citations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Intentionally or not, the whole system seems to be clamouring for English to be <em>the</em> language in which science is done.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h3>The two sides of the mirror</h3>
<p>The existence of a <em>lingua franca</em> in science has undeniable advantages. It removes all linguistic barriers – except one – to communicating and accessing scientific developments the world over. It underpins the internationalisation of universities, which broadens the education and career prospects of students and professors worldwide. It further standardizes the production of knowledge, which facilitates organization of and access to knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The factors listed above, be they implicit or explicit, could be described as high-level characteristics of the global system we inhabit, only tenuously related to science. However, as desirable as the resulting advantages are, their corollaries are no less hypothetical, if much less researched.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h3>Large scale effects...</h3>
<p>A bird-eye look at the dominance of English yields some striking insights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the scientific field, and the data one looks at, <a href="https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/leap.1089" target="_blank">up to 97% of scholarly publication</a> can be in English, with hard sciences being more monolingual than humanities. Even in countries with a large scientific output, articles are written in English-only, and <a href="https://www.researchtrends.com/issue-31-november-2012/the-language-of-future-scientific-communication/" target="_blank">increasingly so</a>. Journals that used to be plurilingual are increasingly <a href="https://blog.scielo.org/en/2016/05/10/the-adoption-of-english-among-scielo-brazil-journals-has-been-increasing/" target="_blank">becoming English-only</a>. Non-English-language journals are further hidden from view by their <a href="https://blog.scielo.org/en/2015/08/02/motion-to-repudiate-mr-jeffrey-bealls-classist-attack-on-scielo/" target="_blank">exclusion from leading journal indexes</a>. Scientific terminology often remains confined to English, making other languages potentially <a href="http://lcn.pascalobservatory.org/sites/default/files/joe_lo_bianco_-_language_place_and_learning_-_august_2007.pdf" target="_blank">inadequate for doing science</a>. The assumption that <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/english-language-science-can-cause-problems-180961623/" target="_blank">all important information is in English</a> biases understanding of science (the flu virus H5N1, which could have been a major pandemic, famously <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/430955a" target="_blank">went unnoticed for months</a> because it was first reported in Chinese, not in English).&nbsp;</p>

<p>At a time where science is suffering from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis" target="_blank">replication crisis</a> and a crisis of trust, it is desirable to facilitate discussion around each and every publication, and few languages have more speakers than English. But then again, a monolingual research produced for an exclusive (if heterogeneous) readership provides for little diversity in terms of perspective, and the perverse outcomes of an English-only science weaken the local nature of research communities and remove research cultures from the very contexts that nurtured them.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h3>...and their individual underpinnings</h3>
<p>English is so <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2018/03/13/domination-english-language-journal-publishing-hurting-scholarship-many-countries" target="_blank">deeply ingrained</a> in the metrics of science that it is more a requirement than a choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the costs of translation services are prohibitively high for most scientists, few of them can afford to produce two versions of their paper, so they often choose to write in English only. This includes humanities: researchers who are interested in fundamentally local topics (the Quechua language, or Bantu traditions, or Spanish history) are increasingly compelled to publish their work in English. Those scientists who can afford producing their papers both in English and their local language need to contend with bans on dual publication enforced by most journals, which forbid papers to be republished elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This situation is also profoundly unfair, because <a href="http://www.teljournal.org/article_66109_85c526124faf5bde548ad8bf65cf9eb3.pdf" target="_blank">proficiency in English is not evenly distributed and is dependent on socioeconomic status</a>: an English-only science provides a massive advantage to those who have English as their first language, or who have been able to access high-quality education in English.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And this disadvantage has a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/08/english-universal-language-science-research/400919/" target="_blank">compound effect</a>. Those with a poorer level of English are less likely to choose to study science, are more likely to lag behind, take longer to process their English-language material, incur more costs and take longer to produce research, are refused publication because of language mistakes, are more likely to face prejudice because of their poorer writing, are less likely to have good metrics and get funding, can even get snubbed in favor of their Anglophone collaborators in media. The list goes on. The effect is that less people do science, and a large majority of scientists work in a language they're less confident in, while those who choose to work in a language other than English have trouble making themselves visible.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Potential solutions</h3>
<p>An English-first science <a href="http://eprints.rclis.org/23682/1/Current-socio-published-non-Sage-format.pdf" target="_blank">impedes the development of national and regional research communities and cultures</a>, limits both the quantity and quality of research, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/english-language-science-can-cause-problems-180961623/" target="_blank">allows loss of knowledge</a>, and reduces science's diversity. While the final balance is unclear, it is undeniable that global research does not only stand to gain from a <em>lingua franca</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the criticisms presented here, the dominance of English in science is unlikely to be imperilled in the foreseeable future, because too many feedback loops within the systems that science exists in buttress this supremacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, some mechanisms push back against this, directly or indirectly. Open-access journals, which are becoming increasingly commonplace, have <a href="https://www.openaccess.nl/en/what-is-open-access/pros-and-cons" target="_blank">many advantages</a> over traditional journals and these qualities indirectly make the existence of non-English journals more viable. Machine translation, while still being inadequate for translating complex academic language, is constantly improving and lowering translation costs. Some of the largest journal indexes have started accepting non-English-language journals, and non-English indexes (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SciELO" target="_blank">SciELO</a>) are gaining ground, which in turn fuels their advocacy for a more diverse science.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But further efforts, big and small, are required. While there has not been enough discussion to identify what these could be, existing literature seems to converge on some ideas. National policies that <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2000933" target="_blank">financially support scientists to learn English, translate their work, and publish it</a> could strengthen national, and global, research. Dual publishing bans, which benefit journals at the expense of the community at large, need to be regulated away. Anglophone journals should make efforts to welcome multilingual research, and the metrics that scientists are evaluated against need to decouple themselves from English. The negative effects of an English-first science need to be more thoroughly researched. Finally, the <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-10-english-lingua-franca-science.html" target="_blank">individual experiences</a> of those who have had to abandon science, who struggle against a system geared against them, experiences that are deeply human, harrowing, and relatable, need to become a focus of popular science writing, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/27/peru-student-roxana-quispe-collantes-thesis-inca-language-quechua" target="_blank">achievements</a> need to be celebrated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To quote <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/does-english-have-to-be-the-dominant-language-of-science/" target="_blank">another article</a>: "<em>The language we use when we speak science is as important as any other part in a methods section and should be deliberate and fair.</em>"</p>

November 22, 2020 | https://blog.gchinis.com/posts/serverless-specification-with-tla/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.gchinis.com/posts/serverless-specification-with-tla/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this guide, I want to demonstrate how to use <em>TLA+</em> to specify a simple serverless system.</p>
<p>AWS defines serverless as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A serverless architecture is a way to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You design your system as a collection of small runtime entities, often connected to queues to exchange messages.</p>
<p>AWS offers services like Lambda and SQS to easily provision such systems.
With managed services, less development effort is required to have something up and running.
Additionally, they make it easier to build scalable and resilient solutions.</p>
<p>This comes at a price since the increased asynchronicity makes it harder to reason about the behaviour of the system as a whole and because we need to take into account in our design the failure modes of those external services.
There is more information in the ThoughtWorks Radar about <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/de/radar/techniques/serverless-architecture">Serverless architecture</a> and <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/aws-lambda">AWS Lambda</a>.</p>
<p>Services like SQS and Lambdas describe what you get.
For example, SQS provides by default <strong>at-least-once delivery</strong>, and <strong>no message ordering</strong> guarantees.</p>
<p>As with any other piece of software, cloud services fail from time to time, delivering even less than what they document.
Since we lack visibility in those systems, they are managed by the cloud provider after all, harmful failures can go unnoticed.</p>
<p>As an example:
How do you know that all the messages you published in the queue got delivered, without instrumenting the consumer?</p>
<p>On the one hand, taking advantage of services offered by your cloud provider reduces the development effort.
On the other hand, failures are insidious, we don’t know if things are going well or not.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I attempt to demonstrate how to use <em>TLA+</em> and <em>PlusCal</em> to explore some of this failure modes.</p>
<p>Describing <em>TLA+</em> and <em>PlusCal</em> in detail would take more that a blog post, and it is not my goal.
My goal is twofold: to show how to specify concurrent systems and nondeterministic behaviour with <em>TLA+</em>, and to warn about the dangers of building overly asynchronous systems, since us humans are very bad at reasoning how they can fail.</p>
<p>For those excited to learn more about <em>TLA+</em> and <em>PlusCal</em>.
I’ve added some resources in the end.</p>
<h2 id="short-introduction-in-tla-and-pluscal">Short introduction in TLA+ and PlusCal</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>TLA+ is a high-level language for modeling programs and systems–especially concurrent and distributed ones.</p>
<p>Leslie Lamport</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TLA+ is well suited to model concurrent systems to make sure they meet your requirements.</p>
<p>We are going to write a <em>specification</em>.
Our <em>specification</em> is going to consist of <em>steps</em>.
Each step it atomic and is going to update the state of the system.
For every step, <em>TLA+</em> computes all possible next steps, but not all transitions are legal.
For example, in a user management system, the step to delete a user is only available after at least one user is in the system.</p>
<p>A sequence of steps is called a <em>behaviour</em>.
You use behaviours to express powerful <em>liveness</em> conditions that your system should meet.
For example, whether a database will eventually be updated even in the face of failures.
It is a very powerful tool to be able to express properties on behaviours, because you can validate whether different execution paths eventually lead to the same outcome.</p>
<p>We are going to write the specification in <em>PlusCal</em>, a language that translates to <em>TLA+</em> but has flow control structures that would be more familiar to people with programming background.</p>
<p><em>TLC</em> is a powerful model checker that will validate the specification or find counter-examples when our <strong>invariants</strong> fail.</p>
<h2 id="specifying-a-simple-system">Specifying a simple system</h2>
<p>Let’s specify a <strong>producer</strong> that pushes data over a <strong>queue</strong> in a <strong>consumer</strong> who stores them in a <strong>store</strong>.
For AWS users, think of a Lambda sending data to another Lambda via a queue.
The second Lambda stores them in S3.</p>
<p>I intentionally did not add any business logic to the example, because I want to focus on the drawbacks that arise by using this architectural style, and the increased asynchronicity it brings.</p>
<h3 id="global-state">Global state</h3>

<pre><code data-lang="text">variables
    queue = {},
    store = {};</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>That’s how we define the global state of our system.
In our specification, we are going to model both the <em>queue</em>, and the <em>store</em> as <strong>Sets</strong> of unordered values.
The reason I chose to model the <em>queue</em> with the set data structure is because I am looking to model a service which does not guarantee ordering of messages.</p>
<h3 id="the-producer">The producer</h3>

            queue := queue \union {m};
        end with;
        goto Publish
end process;</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>We specify a producer that makes only one action which is to <em>Publish</em>.
All the actions under a label (like <em>Publish</em>) are executed atomically.
So in one step, the producer picks a message from the <em>Messages</em> set and adds it in the <em>queue</em> set.
At the end of the step, the line <code>goto Publish</code> ensures that the publisher is allowed to publish again.</p>
<p>Notice how the construct <code>with m \in Messages do</code>.
Allows us to model that we don’t know which message is going to be picked.
<em>TLA+</em> will make sure to verify our model for all possible picks.</p>

            either \* read
                queue := queue \ {m};
            or \* read but not delete
                skip;
            end either;
            store := store \union {m};        
        end with; 
        goto Consume
end process;</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>The consumer also has only one action which is to <em>Consume</em>.
The step is disabled until there is at least a message in the queue, that’s what Line 4 does.</p>
<p>Line 5 picks a message from the queue. Not necessarily the first one, remember it is an unordered set.</p>
<p>Lines 6-10 are a conditional.
Either the consumer is going to remove the message from the queue (Line 7), or not.
Remember, that SQS guarantees at-least-once delivery.
By leaving the message in the queue, it is going to be consumed again in the future.</p>
<p><em>TLC</em> will validate that our invariants hold in either case.</p>

end define</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>QueueInvariant</em> does some basic sanity check ensuring that our queue contains <em>Messages</em> and only <em>Messages</em>.
It guards against publishing in queue something that is not of type <em>Message</em>.
It may seem trivial but is a nice example how an <em>invariant</em> can look like.<br>
You can specify when defining the model this <em>invariant</em> should hold in every step of our model.</p>
<p><em>Liveness</em> describes a property over a whole behaviour (not a single step) of the algorithm.
It says: <code>Eventually, always the store is going to be equal to the Messages</code>.
The operator <code>&lt;&gt;[]</code> means “eventually always”.
That is a very powerful operator to describe that your algorithms does the right thing in the end.</p>
<h3 id="all-together">All together</h3>

<p>As you can see it is only about 40 lines of code.</p>
<h3 id="execution">Execution</h3>
<p>Let’s specify the simplest model for the above specification:</p>
<pre><code>Messages  = {m1} # Only one message
Producers = {p1} # Only one producer
Consumers = {c1} # Only one consumer

QueueInvariant   # Invariance that should hold for every step
Liveness         # Invariance that should hold eventually for every execution
</code></pre><p>In simple terms, one producer is going to be running in a loop.
Every time it runs, it is going to be publishing the same message in the queue.</p>
<p>One consumer also running in a loop, but only when there are available messages.
Every time it runs, it is going to be reading the message in the queue (potentially removing it from the queue) and adding it in the store.</p>
<p>The model checker tells us that our invariants are satisfied in every possible execution.</p>
<p>Success!</p>
<h2 id="progressing-thought-time">Progressing thought time</h2>
<p>Let’s extend our simple example.
Let’s say that as time goes by, the producer is sending us new revisions of the data.
For example, the producer is sending us the current “view count” for a video, over time it publishes new messages containing the latest “view count”.
In the store, we are only interested in storing only the latest “view count”.
Thus, when we receive an update, we should override any older data, if present.
We are still going to limit our system to send updates for only one video.</p>
<p>We now have to model a system that evolves thought time, to do that we are going to introduce a new process that models a clock.</p>

In the 1960s, that somewhere was Bell Labs, and the operating system they were building was Unix. They were building more than just an operating system though. They were building a way to work with computers that had never existed before. To find out more, I reached out to this guy.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>I’m Brian Kernighan, and at the moment, I teach computer science at Princeton University.</span></p><p><strong>Adam:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>He’s the K in K&amp;R, the famous book about C that still tops most recommended book lists. He was part of this computer science research group at Bell Labs for 30 years. He’s going to share the story of the creation of Unix, and hopefully, I’m going to try to figure out some of their secrets to being so impactful. Along the way, we’re going to have to learn about the Unix philosophy and printing patent applications, but we’re also going to have to learn about 10-kilo chocolate bars and fake demos to the CIA, and of course, British satirical magazines.</span></p><p><strong>Adam:</strong></p><p><span>The story of Unix is a story about Bell Labs, so let’s start at the beginning when Brian is a grad student and he gets an internship to work there for the summer.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>Bell Labs is a very big building, a sequence of connected buildings, and probably 3,000 people working over these long multi-story buildings. The thing that I remember most clearly about the first day, and I think it was the first day of the first internship, so call it the summer of 1967, and I got an office, and if I recall correctly, I had an office to myself. So this is something that’s unheard of in the modern era.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>But I had an office to myself, and I was sitting there in my office at probably 11:00 or something like that in my first morning, I wondered, “What the heck do I do? I have no idea what’s going on.” And this older gentleman came past my office and he said, “Hi, I’m Dick… Let’s go to lunch.” I thought, “Well, okay.” I went off to lunch with Dick…, whose name I hadn’t caught. We had a good lunch, he was an interesting kind of curmudgeonly, but intriguing guy. Then after lunch, he went off somewhere else.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>I snuck past my office to his office on the same corridor to see who the heck he was because everybody had name tags on the doors. It turns out it was Dick Hamming, the inventor of error-correcting codes.</span></p><p><strong>Adam:</strong></p><p><span>Dick Hamming is aka Richard Hamming. His Wikipedia page is huge. He worked on the Manhattan project programming computers to calculate the equations needed to develop nuclear weapons. One year after this lunch with Brian, he would win the Turing Award, the so-called Nobel Prize of Computing for his work on error-correcting codes. Hamming is also famous for this talk he gave on the secret to having impact in your professional life.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>The talk was called You and Your Research, and it was basically a retrospective on his career, thinking whether there were general lessons that would help other people in some way to have a better career. He was very, very interesting, and I think a good example of somebody with clearly lots of talent, but not a super genius type, who made the most of what he had. Who in every way, amplified so that he compounded his effect on the world. The other thing that’s maybe is appropriate for today, he used to say that he would reserve Friday afternoons for thinking great thoughts.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>He would sit in his office, he would put his feet on the desk, and he would think great thoughts, whatever that might be. It was usually introspection on himself or on where was the field going, or what might happen in the future? What might you do to take advantage of that or deal with it in some way or other? This is Friday morning when we’re talking, and I don’t get that luxury on Friday afternoons very often, but it’s a useful way to think of it. You say, “I’m going to stop and do it regularly to take stock of what’s going on, and in some way, think about, ‘What could I be doing that in some way would be better, that would be more useful for me or my family or the world or whatever?'”</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>He did that quite religiously, you went in after lunch on Friday, you’d find him sitting in his office thinking great thoughts. So he’s fun.</span></p><p><strong>Adam:</strong></p><p><span>I love this advice, it presupposes that if I just had my Fridays free, and I wrote thinking great thoughts on my calendar, I would upgrade thoughts. I mean, maybe that’s the case, I’ll give it a try. There’s one concept though that Hamming is most famous for, and that is about how you choose what to work on.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>The way he told it to me and probably lots of others was that he used to eat with some group of people like chemists, I think the specific thing was, and he would eat at their table at lunchtime, big cafeteria setting. He would sit down with chemists and talk to them and he would ask them what they were working on, and whether what they’re working on could possibly lead to a Nobel Prize. The answer was often no, not a chance, and that was the point where he’d say, “Well, then why are you working on it? Because if it couldn’t at least potentially lead to a Nobel Prize, it isn’t important. Why are you wasting your time on something that isn’t important?”</span></p><p><strong>Adam:</strong></p><p><span>Whether intentionally or not, Brian followed this advice. When he returned to Princeton to work on his thesis, he was working on graph partitioning, which we now know is in some sense, equivalent to the traveling salesman problem. You have to find an optimum route that the salesman would travel from city to city minimizing travel distance. To complete his thesis, Brian had to work on the computers of Princeton at the time. Computers today are a lot different than they were in 1967 and ’68 at Princeton. At the time, computers were all about Fortran and punch cards.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>Fortran was designed in a card environment very definitely, and I assume the cards came before Fortran, but in my mind, they’re very strongly linked. And so yes, it was basically one statement per line, which was, therefore, one physical card. And so, when you wrote a program, you had to punch it on these punch cards, and then make sure you kept them in order and things like that and then you handed them to somebody who operated a very big, expensive machine. And a while later, back would come to your results, very often where it’s just something like there was a syntax error somewhere, and you had to find the cards that were wrong, replace them with new cards that were right and repeat the process, but with a very, very long latency that could be often measured in hours or sometimes even days.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>It’s not exactly like an instant compilation. And Fortran itself is a kind of clunky language as well in part reflecting those early days in computing, and partly just the fact that we didn’t understand a lot, and the computers themselves were not particularly sophisticated. Then finally, Fortran was intended for scientific computing. It was not intended for, let’s say, general-purpose system programming or anything like that. All of those things meant that although the program was a lot of fun, it’s not the same as it became five or 10 years later, and it has continued to evolve.</span></p><p><strong>Adam:</strong></p><p><span>I had to watch a couple of YouTube videos to get a sense of this punch card world. A punch card is like an index card, but it’s wider because it has 80 columns. And each of these columns corresponds to a single character. You punch holes in that column to indicate what letters should go there, and so each punch card represents one line of Fortran code. People build the programs this way, punching these cards, putting them into big boxes in order that they would carry around, then you take someplace to give them to a computer operator who would give them to the computer that would read all this in and run the program.</span></p><p><strong>Adam:</strong></p><p><span>So if you had a 1,000-line program, you would have 1,000 cards. There were no screens, no interactive output. You gave your cards to the computer operator and waited for your printout that was the result of your program. Computers were expensive and giant, so they wanted to maximize the throughput. Your program might be doing expensive mathematical calculations, but you could also just be doing word processing. One card might say, “In bold, print my thesis,” and the next would say, “Print, by Brian Kernighan,” and so on. It’s like a verbose way of using a typewriter, except the advantage is you could change the cards around and have it reprinted.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>T…</span></p></div></div>

November 22, 2020 | https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/israeli-queues | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/israeli-queues">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A queue is a data structure that holds up elements for a brief period of time until a peripheral processing system is ready to process them. The most common implementation of a queue is a FIFO queue - First In First Out - that evicts the element that was inserted the first i.e. it evicts the one that has spent the most time in the queue. There are other variations of Queues one of which is called Priority Queue.</p>
<p>In Priority Queue, every element is associated with a priority, usually provided by the user during enqueueing; This associated priority is used during eviction where the element with the highest priority is evicted first during dequeuing.</p>
<p>In this essay, we take a detailed look into a variation of Priority Queue, fondly called Israeli Queues, where the priority of the element is defined by the affinity of it with one of its "friends" in the queue. Israeli Queues were first introduced in the paper <a href="https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/2152975/632939.pdf">Polling with batch service</a> by Boxma, O. J., Wal, van der, J., &amp; Yechiali, U in the year 2007.</p>

<p>Queues in Israel are usually unorganized, due to which people tend to find their friends, who are already waiting, and instead of adhering to the usual protocol of joining at the back end, they cut through and directly join their friends. Israeli Queues mimic this behavior and hence get this <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15326340802427497">punny name</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99894937-fddc4380-2cac-11eb-8a73-a4dc5c490d2b.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99894937-fddc4380-2cac-11eb-8a73-a4dc5c490d2b.png"></p>
<p>Israeli Queues are a variation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue">Priority Queues</a> where instead of associating priority with the element to be enqueued, the priority is implicitly derived using the "friend" element and it joins right at the back end of the group that the friend belongs to. The function signature of the enqueue operation is as shown below, while other operations like <code>dequeue</code> and <code>peek</code> remains fairly similar.</p>
<pre><code>

<span><span>void</span> <span>enqueue</span><span>(israeli_queue * q, element * e, element * f)</span></span>;
</code></pre>
<h2>How could this help?</h2>
<p>Every Data Structures is designed to solve a niche use case efficiently and Israeli Queues are no different as they prove to be super-efficient where one could batch and process similar elements or where the <em>set-up</em> cost for a task is high.</p>
<p>Consider a system where a queue is used to hold up heterogeneous tasks and there is a single machine taking care of processing. Now if some of these tasks are similar and have a high <em>set-up or preparation cost</em>, for example downloading large metafiles, or spinning up a parallel infrastructure, or even setting up persistent connections with device farms, queuing them closer and processing them sequentially or in batch helps in reducing redundant processing and computation by promoting reuse.</p>
<h2>Issue of starvation</h2>
<p>By enqueuing elements in between Israeli Queues reduces redundant processing, but by doing that it makes itself vulnerable to the classical case of starvation. Elements stuck at the rear end of the list could potentially starve for longer durations if elements having "friends" in the queue keep coming in at high frequency.</p>
<p>The original implementation of Israeli Queues suggests batch processing where instead of processing tasks one at a time, it processes a batch (a group of friends) in one go. This proves to be super-handy when the time required to processes a single task is much lower than the set-up cost for it.</p>
<h2>Implementation Guidelines</h2>
<p>The best way to implement Israeli Queues is by using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list">Doubly Linked List</a> with a bunch of pointers pointing to the head and tail of groups within it. Insertion to an existing group happens at the tail of it while if the element has no friend element, then it goes at the tail end of the list and forms its own group.</p>
<p>A constraint that could be added during implementation is that the friend element should always be the leader (head) element of the group. Details of the implementation could be tweaked so long the core concept remains unaltered.</p>

<p>Israeli Queues were the outcome of a problem statement dealing with Polling Systems. Polling System usually contains <code>N</code> queues <code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code>, ..., <code>Qn</code> where the processing unit visits each queue in cyclic order processing one element at a time i.e. <code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code>, ..., <code>Qn</code>, <code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code>, ..., <code>Qn</code>, etc.</p>
<p>When the server attends a queue instead of processing just one element from it, it processes the entire batch present in the queue utilizing the setup-cost efficiently assuming that time to process an element from a queue is much lesser than the set-up cost.</p>

November 22, 2020 | https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I have mentioned that applications duplicate operating system's functionality.
How severe issue is it and what kind of consequences there are?</p>
<p><a href="https://gottcode.org/kapow/">Kapow punch clock</a> tracks hours and constructs reports.
Its author has done well in maintaining complexity.
The whole program is only 4171 lines (+594 lines of copyright headers),
with total 146kB of source code.
This post presents a program for Plan 9 that serves the same purpose.
Finally lets do some comparison.</p>
<p><img alt="kapow screenshot" src="https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/kapow.png"></p>
<p>The source code presented is attached: <a href="https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/task.zip">task.zip</a></p>
<h2>task entries</h2>
<p>The clock has this kind of a nice directory -tab.
I have seen this tool being used.
The tabs were used to track customer_project_day instead of projects.
The dialog looks like a file browser.</p>
<p>The 'task' program treats each task as a file.
For instance here's the '0.kapow.task'.</p>
<pre><code>Punch clock port experiment
</code><code>start: Sat Nov 21 11:00:06 GMT 2020</code></pre>
<p>This is a running task.
When I'm done, I append in the stop: -line.</p>
<p>The time stamps aren't using Finnish abbreviations for weekdays or months
and it is bit inconvenient for me.
Though they are slightly more convenient than unix timestamps
because I can type the hour there if I forget to mark it.</p>
<p>The system benefits from not needing a locale to parse dates.
If you don't like english dates, you can use ISO-8601 timestamps,
those should work as well and look like this:</p>
<pre><code>2020-11-21T20:16:49+00:00</code></pre>
<h2>task/start and task/stop</h2>
<p>To start a task you write a timestamp into a file and mark it to start the task.
Although it'd be easy to do it manually,
I add few convenience scripts so you don't lose an entry
just because you write &gt; instead of &gt;&gt;.
Here's task/start and task/stop.
They are used to mark a task completed or start a task.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>rfork e
</code><code>for (taskname in $*) { echo start: `{date} &gt;&gt; $taskname }
</code><code>
</code><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>rfork e
</code><code>for (taskname in $*) { echo stop: `{date} &gt;&gt; $taskname }</code></pre>
<p>You can consider these are up to you to configure,
they're for your convenience.</p>
<h2>task/span</h2>
<p>Next you need a tool to know task status. Here's the 'task/span':</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>if (~ $#* 1) {
</code><code>  if (test -f $1) {
</code><code>    rfork e
</code><code>    taskname=$1
</code><code>    start=`{sed -n 's/^start: (.*)$/\1/p' &lt;$taskname | xargs seconds}
</code><code>    stop=`{sed -n 's/^stop: (.*)$/\1/p' &lt;$taskname | xargs seconds}
</code><code>    if (~ $stop '') stop=`{date | xargs seconds}
</code><code>
</code><code>    dt=`{echo print $stop(1) - $start(1) | bc}
</code><code>    s=`{echo print $dt % 60 | bc}
</code><code>    m=`{echo print $dt / 60 % 60 | bc}
</code><code>    h=`{echo print $dt / 3600 | bc}
</code><code>    echo span: $h hours $m minutes $s seconds
</code><code>    }
</code><code>  if not { echo not a file: $1&gt;[1=2]; exit usage }
</code><code>  }
</code><code>if not { echo usage: $0 taskfile &gt;[1=2]; exit usage }</code></pre>
<p>It presents how many hours, minutes, seconds have been spent in the task.
If the task is still running, it uses the current time as range.</p>
<h2>task/report</h2>
<p>The 'task/report' sorts the tasks and builds a report out of them.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>rfork e
</code><code>tasks=`{for (t in $*) {
</code><code>  p=`{sed -n 's/^start: (.*)$/\1/p' $t | xargs seconds}
</code><code>  echo $p $t } | sort -n | awk '{ print $2 }'}
</code><code>
</code><code>for(taskname in $tasks) {
</code><code>  span=`{task/span $taskname | awk '{ print $2,$3,$4,$5 }'}
</code><code>  start=`{sed -n 's/^start: (.*)$/(\1)/p' $taskname}
</code><code>  stop=`{sed -n 's/^stop: (.*)$/(\1)/p' $taskname}
</code><code>  if (~ $stop '') { echo $span $start '*' }
</code><code>  if not { echo $span $start }
</code><code>  sed '/^start:|^stop:/d' $taskname | sed 's/^/  /g'
</code><code>  }
</code><code>
</code><code>total=0
</code><code>for(taskname in $tasks) {
</code><code>  d=`{task/span $taskname | awk '{ print $2,$4 }'}
</code><code>  total=`{echo print $total + ($d(1) '*' 60) + $d(2) | bc}
</code><code>}
</code><code>echo total: `{echo print $total / 60 | bc} hours `{echo print $total % 60 | bc} minutes</code></pre>
<p>When a task is ongoing, this utility shows a star on it's entry.
This script could be customized for different uses.
Right now it's a plaintext report.</p>
<h2>display</h2>
<p>Some people like to have a display that tracks what is going on.
The 'task/track' -script executes a command periodically every minute
and the window where it runs is cleaned every time it repeats.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>task/report `{rc -c $"*} &gt;/dev/text
</code><code>while (sleep 60) task/report `{rc -c $"*} &gt; /dev/text</code></pre>
<p>It again is merely a convenience.
All of this functionality composes with rest of what the system has to offer.
For instance if you want to see all tasks in some directory:</p>
<pre><code>while (sleep 1) {
</code><code>    echo -n &gt;/dev/text
</code><code>    for (x in *.task) {
</code><code>        echo -n $x: ' '
</code><code>        task/span $x }}</code></pre>
<p>Also here's a cool thing,
if you want completed task list to appear when you log into your terminal,
you can add this into the rio start script:</p>
<pre><code>window -r 2338 15 2853 345 task/track 'echo *.task'</code></pre>
<p>Ok, we're done now. Here's how the finished program looks like:</p>
<p><img alt="task screenshot" src="https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/task.png"></p>
<h2>tally</h2>
<p>The whole program suite is 48 lines and 1.5kB.</p>
<pre><code>cpu% wc bin/rc/task/*
</code><code> 21     119     703 bin/rc/task/report
</code><code> 18     100     578 bin/rc/task/span
</code><code>  3      11      73 bin/rc/task/start
</code><code>  3      11      72 bin/rc/task/stop
</code><code>  3      15     100 bin/rc/task/track
</code><code> 48     256    1526 total</code></pre>
<p>This is about 85 times less than kapow punch clock.</p>
<h2>apples and oranges?</h2>
<p>It may seem the comparison is unfair.
Are the programs equivalent in functionality?
The answer is no.
The 'task' implements much less functionality than the kapow punch clock.
It's barely considered bunch of scripts.
However the tasks are merely files and you edit them with existing tools,
this thing introduces very little to learn.
The manual is 1kB and I think I made it verbose.
Yet despite that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're able to search from your tasks.</li>
<li>Exporting/Importing of tasks is easy because they are files
and to use the program you have to know where they are.</li>
<li>Tasks can be interleaved with other contents on the system.</li>
<li>Tasks archive properly given your other files archive properly.</li>
<li>You can attach and receive tasks in the mail.</li>
<li>The status of the tasklist can be securely live-displayed
on a remote info board and shared with collaborators.</li>
<li>There are lots of customization options.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do wonder what the take-away from here is.
Despite this all, kapow punch clock, it's fine software.
I don't mind that it's been written.</p>
<h2>experiences</h2>
<p>I did this to try off this 'rc' and try to write a manual page.
I'm surprised how usable the 'troff' is once you don't assume it should be something familiar.
The 'rc' is equally incredible by having an actual structure that you can rely on.
Plan 9 is such an incredibly good operating system,
I constantly find things that surprise in a good way.</p>

<![CDATA[Having Fun with Signal Handlers]]>

Score 44 | Comments 14 (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25175911">thread link</a>) | @edward
<br/>
November 22, 2020 | https://www.giovannimascellani.eu/having-fun-with-signal-handlers.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.giovannimascellani.eu/having-fun-with-signal-handlers.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>As every C and C++ programmer knows far too well, if you dereference a
pointer that points outside of the space mapped on your process'
memory, you get a segmentation fault and your programs crashes. As far
as the language itself is concerned, you don't have a second chance
and you cannot know in advance whether that dereferencing operation is
going to set a bomb off or not. In technical terms, you are invoking
<em>undefined behaviour</em>, and you should never do that: you are
responsible for knowing in advance if your pointers are valid, and if
they are not you keep the pieces.</p>
<p>However, turns out that most actual operating system give you a second
chance, although with a lot of fine print attached. So I tried to
implement a function that tries to dereference a pointer: if it can,
it gives you the value; if it can't, it tells you it couldn't. Again,
I stress this should never happen in a real program, except possibly
for debugging (or for having fun).</p>
<p>The prototype is</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>word_t peek(word_t *addr, int *success);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The function is basically equivalent to <code>return *addr</code>, except that if
<code>addr</code> is not mapped it doesn't crash, and if <code>success</code> is not NULL it
is set to <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> to indicate that <code>addr</code> was not mapped or
mapped. If <code>addr</code> was not mapped the return value is meaningless.</p>
<p>I won't explain it in detail to leave you some fun. Basically the idea
is to install a handler for <code>SIGSEGV</code>: if the address is invalid, the
handler is called, which basically fixes everything by advancing a
little bit the instruction pointer, in order to skip the faulting
instruction. The dereferencing instruction is written as hardcoded
Assembly bytes, so that I know exactly how many bytes I need to skip.</p>
<p>Of course this is very architecture-dependent: I wrote the <code>i386</code> and
<code>amd64</code> variants (no <code>x32</code>). And I don't guarantee there are no bugs
or subtelties!</p>
<p>Another solution would have been to just parse <code>/proc/self/maps</code>
before dereferencing and check whether the pointer is in a mapped
area, but it would have suffered of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use">TOCTTOU</a>
problem: another thread might have changed the mappings between the
time when <code>/proc/self/maps</code> was parsed and when the pointer was
dereferenced (also, parsing that file can take a relatively long
amount of time). Another less architecture-dependent but still not
pure-C approach would have been to establish a <code>setjmp</code> before
attempting the dereference and <code>longjmp</code>-ing back from the signal
handler (but again you would need to use different <code>setjmp</code> contexts
in different threads to exclude race conditions).</p>
<p>Have fun! (and again, don't try this in real programs)</p>

<h2 id="integer-underflow"><a href="#integer-underflow">Integer Underflow</a></h2>
<p>
Let us talk a little bit about integer underflow and undefined behaviour
in C before we discuss the puzzle I want to share in this post.
</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i--)
        printf(".");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>

<p>
This code invokes undefined behaviour. The value in variable
<code>i</code> decrements to <code>INT_MIN</code> after
<code>|INT_MIN| + 1</code> iterations. In the next iteration, there is a
negative overflow which is undefined for signed integers in C. On many
implementations though, <code>INT_MIN - 1</code> wraps around to
<code>INT_MAX</code>. Since <code>INT_MAX</code> is not less than
<code>6</code>, the loop terminates. With such implementations, this
code prints <code>|INT_MIN| + 1</code> dots. With 32-bit integers,
that amounts to 2147483649 dots. Here is one such example output:
</p>

<pre><samp>$ <kbd>gcc -std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic foo.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out | wc -c</kbd>
2147483649</samp>
</pre>

<p>
It is worth noting that the above behaviour is only one of the many
possible ones. The code invokes undefined behaviour and the ISO standard
imposes no requirements on a specific implementation of the compiler
regarding what the behaviour of such code should be. For example, an
implementation could also exploit the undefined behaviour to turn the
loop into an infinite loop. In fact, GCC does optimize it to an infinite
loop if we compile the code with the <code>-O2</code> option.
</p>

<pre><samp><kbd># This never terminates!</kbd>
$ <kbd>gcc -O2 -std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic foo.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out</kbd>
</samp></pre>


<h2 id="puzzle"><a href="#puzzle">Puzzle</a></h2>
<p>
Let us take a look at the puzzle now.
</p>

<div>
<p>
Add or modify exactly one operator in the following code such that it
prints exactly 6 dots.
</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i--)
    printf(".");</code>
</pre></div>

<p>
An obvious solution is to change <code>i--</code> to <code>i++</code>.
</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)
    printf(".");</code>
</pre>

<p>
There are a few more solutions to this puzzle. One of the solutions is
very interesting. We will discuss the interesting solution in detail
below.
</p>


<h2 id="solutions"><a href="#solutions">Solutions</a></h2>
<p>
<em><strong>Update on 02 Oct 2011:</strong> The puzzle has been solved
in the <a href="https://susam.in/blog/loopy-c-puzzle/comments/">comments</a> section. We will discuss the
solutions now. If you want to think about the problem before you see the
solutions, this is a good time to pause and think about it. There are
spoilers ahead.</em>
</p>

<p>
Here is a list of some solutions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; ++i)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; -i &lt; 6; i--)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i + 6; i--)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i ^= 6; i--)</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The last solution involving the bitwise XOR operation is not immediately
obvious. A little analysis is required to understand why it works. 
</p>


<h2 id="generalization"><a href="#generalization">Generalization</a></h2>
<p>
Let us generalize the puzzle by replacing \( 6 \) in the loop with an
arbitrary positive integer \( n. \) The loop in the last solution now
becomes:
</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i ^= n; i--)
    printf(".");</code>
</pre>

<p>
If we denote the value of the variable <code>i</code> set by the
execution of <code>i ^= n</code> after \( k \) dots are printed as
\( f(k), \) then

\[
  f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
      n                       &amp; \text{if } n = 0, \\
      n \oplus (f(k - 1) - 1) &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 1
    \end{cases}
\]

where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer, \( n \) is a positive integer,
and the symbol \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on two
nonnegative integers.

Note that \( f(0) \) represents the value of <code>i</code> set by the
execution of <code>i ^= n</code> when no dots have been printed yet.
</p>

<p>
If we can show that \( n \) is the least value of \( k \) for which \(
f(k) = 0, \) it would prove that the loop terminates after printing
\( n \) dots.
</p>

<p>
We will see in the next section that for odd values of \( n, \)

\[
f(k) =
\begin{cases}
n &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is even}, \\
1 &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is odd}.
\end{cases}
\]

Therefore there is no value of \( k \) for which \( f(k) = 0 \) when \(
n \) is odd. As a result, the loop never terminates when \( n \) is odd.
</p>

<p>
We will then see that for even values of \( n \) and
\( 0 \leq k \leq n, \)

\[
f(k) = 0 \iff k = n.
\]

Therefore the loop terminates after printing \( n \) dots when \( n \)
is even.
</p>


<h2 id="lemmas"><a href="#lemmas">Lemmas</a></h2>
<p>
We will first prove a few lemmas about some interesting properties of
the bitwise XOR operation. We will then use it to prove the claims made
in the previous section.
</p>

<!-- Lemma 1 -->
<p>
<strong>Lemma 1.</strong>
<em>
For an odd positive integer \( n, \)

\[
n \oplus (n - 1) = 1
\]

where the symbol \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on two
nonnegative integers.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
Let the binary representation of \( n \) be \( b_m \dots b_1 b_0 \)
where \( m \) is a nonnegative integer and \( b_m \) represents the most
significant nonzero bit of \( n. \) Since \( n \) is an odd number,
\( b_0 = 1. \)

Thus \( n \) may be written as

\[ b_m \dots b_1 1. \]

As a result \( n - 1 \) may be written as

\[ b_m \dots b_1 0. \]

The bitwise XOR of both binary representations is \( 1. \)
</p>

<!-- Lemma 2 -->
<p>
<strong>Lemma 2.</strong>
<em>
For a nonnegative integer \( n, \)

\[
n \oplus 1 =
  \begin{cases}
    n + 1 &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is even}, \\
    n - 1 &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is odd}.
  \end{cases}
\]

where the symbol \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on two
nonnegative integers.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
Let the binary representation of \( n \) be \( b_m \dots b_1 b_0 \)
where \( m \) is a nonnegative integer and \( b_m \) represents the most
significant nonzero bit of \( n. \)
</p>
<p>
If \( n \) is even, \( b_0 = 0. \) In this case, \( n \) may be written
as \( b_m \dots b_1 0. \) Thus \( n \oplus 1 \) may be written as \( b_m
\dots b_1 1. \) Therefore \( n \oplus 1 = n + 1. \)
</p>

<p>
If \( n \) is odd, \( b_0 = 1. \) In this case, \( n \) may be written
as \( b_m \dots b_1 1. \) Thus \( n \oplus 1 \) may be written as \( b_m
\dots b_1 0. \) Therefore \( n \oplus 1 = n - 1. \)
</p>

<p>
Note that for odd \( n, \) lemma 1 can also be derived as a corollary of
lemma 2 in this manner:

\[
k \oplus (k - 1)
= k \oplus (k \oplus 1)
= (k \oplus k) \oplus 1
= 0 \oplus 1
= 1.
\]
</p>


<!-- Lemma 3 -->
<p>
<strong>Lemma 3.</strong>
<em>
If \( x \) is an even nonnegative integer and \( y \) is an odd positive
integer, then \( x \oplus y \) is odd, where the symbol \( \oplus \)
denotes bitwise XOR operation on two nonnegative integers.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
Let the binary representation of \( x \) be \( b_{xm_x} \dots b_{x1}
b_{x0} \) and that of \( y \) be \( b_{ym_y} \dots b_{y1} b_{y0} \)
where \( m_x \) and \( m_y \) are nonnegative integers and \( b_{xm_x}
\) and \( b_{xm_y} \) represent the most significant nonzero bits of \(
x \) and \( y, \) respectively.
</p>

<p>
Since \( x \) is even, \( b_{x0} = 0. \) Since \( y \) is odd,
\( b_{y0} = 1. \)
</p>

<p>
Let \( z = x \oplus y \) with a binary representation of \( b_{zm_z}
\dots b_{z1} b_{z0} \) where \( m_{zm_z} \) is a nonnegative integer and
\( b_{zm_z} \) is the most significant nonzero bit of \( z. \)
</p>

<p>
We get \( b_{z0} = b_{x0} \oplus b_{y0} = 0 \oplus 1 = 1. \) Therefore
\( z \) is odd.
</p>


<h2 id="theorems"><a href="#theorems">Theorems</a></h2>

<!-- Theorem 1 -->
<p>
<strong>Theorem 1.</strong>
<em>
Let \( \oplus \) denote bitwise XOR operation on two nonnegative
integers and

\[
  f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
      n                        &amp; \text{if } n = 0, \\
      n \oplus (f(n - 1) - 1)  &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 1.
    \end{cases}
\]

where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer and \( n \) is an odd positive
integer. Then

\[
  f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
      n &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is even}, \\
      1 &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is odd}.
    \end{cases}
\]
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
This is a proof by mathematical induction. We have \( f(0) = n \) by
definition. Therefore the base case holds good.
</p>

<p>
Let us assume that \( f(k) = n \) for any even \( k \) (induction
hypothesis). Let \( k' = k + 1 \) and \( k'' = k + 2. \)
</p>

<p>
If \( k \) is even, we get

\begin{align*}
f(k')  &amp; = n \oplus (f(k) - 1)  &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
       &amp; = n \oplus (n - 1)     &amp;&amp; \text{(by induction hypothesis)} \\
       &amp; = 1                    &amp;&amp; \text{(by lemma 1)},\\
f(k'') &amp; = n \oplus (f(k') - 1) &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
       &amp; = n \oplus (1 - 1)     &amp;&amp; \text{(since \( f(k') = 1\))} \\
       &amp; = n \oplus 0 \\
       &amp; = n.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
Since \( f(k'') = n \) and \( k'' \) is the next even number after
\( k, \) the induction step is complete. The induction step shows that
for every even \( k, \) \( f(k) = n \) holds good. It also shows that as
a result of \( f(k) = n \) for every even \( k, \) we get \( f(k') = 1
\) for every odd \( k'. \)
</p>

<!-- Theorem 2 -->
<p>
<strong>Theorem 2.</strong>
<em>
Let \( \oplus \) denote bitwise XOR operation on two nonnegative
integers and

\[
  f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
      n                        &amp; \text{if } n = 0, \\
      n \oplus (f(n - 1) - 1)  &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 1.
    \end{cases}
\]

where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer, \( n \) is an even positive
integer, and \( 0 \leq k \leq n. \) Then

\[
  f(k) = 0 \iff k = n.
\]
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
We will first show by the principle of mathematical induction that for
even \( k, \) \( f(k) = n - k. \) We have \( f(0) = n \) by definition,
so the base case holds good. Now let us assume that \( f(k) = n - k \)
holds good for any even \( k \) where \( 0 \leq k \leq n \) (induction
hypothesis).
</p><p>
Since \( n \) is even (by definition) and \( k \) is even (by induction
hypothesis), \( f(k) = n - k \) is even. As a result, \( f(k) - 1 \) is
odd. By lemma 3, we conclude that \( f(k + 1) = n \oplus (f(k) - 1) \)
is odd.
</p>

<p>
Now we perform the induction step as follows:

\begin{align*}
f(k + 2) &amp; = n \oplus (f(k + 1) - 1)
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
         &amp; = n \oplus (f(k + 1) \oplus 1)
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by lemma 2 for odd \( n \))} \\
         &amp; = n \oplus ((n \oplus (f(k) - 1)) \oplus 1)
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
         &amp; = (n \oplus n ) \oplus ((f(k) - 1) \oplus 1)
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by associativity of XOR)} \\
         &amp; = 0 \oplus ((f(k) - 1) \oplus 1) \\
         &amp; = (f(k) - 1) \oplus 1 \\
         &amp; = (f(k) - 1) - 1
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(from lemma 2 for odd \( n \))} \\
         &amp; = f(k) - 2 \\
         &amp; = n - k - 2
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by induction hypothesis).}
\end{align*}

This completes the induction step and proves that \( f(k) = n - k \)
for even \( k \) where \( 0 \leq k \leq n. \)
</p>

<p>
We have shown above that \( f(k) \) is even for every even \( k \) where
\( 0 \leq k \leq n \) which results in \( …</p></div></div>

<p>I thought I was being resourceful, but I think it came from a place of fear. I wasn’t confident in my skills and would collect anything that might help compensate for that. I don’t think it did.</p>
<p>I don’t remember a single time when was able to solve a problem at work by digging into my collection of resources.</p>
<p>What did help was building things and getting more practice under my belt. Every time I solved a new problem, it gave me a mental model to approach a category of similar problems. (See also: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching">pattern matching</a>)</p>
<p>The more I practiced, the better I got at pattern matching. And more importantly, I grew more confident in my ability to solve new problems that I haven’t come across yet.</p>
<p>Now with a few years under my belt, I’ve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuZeff2y32M">declared bankruptcy</a> on my reading list and open tabs.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>Say you're about to build a new project. You're an expert in a few languages, and you have a sense of the ecosystem in general. How do you choose the language you build with? I wanted to share my decision framework with you. </p><p>Some requirements can eliminate entire categories of choices. Let’s use that to our advantage: start by narrowing down your choices. For example:</p><p><strong>Do you need extreme efficiency?</strong> This would mean your code may need to be compiled and that you can’t have run-time garbage collection. Well, that narrows down your choices quite a bit. </p><p><strong>Do you need math-level proofs that your code works as expected?</strong> This would mean you need an <em>extremely</em> strong type system. Bam, narrows choices down quite a bit </p><p><strong>Do you need concurrency?</strong> There are only a few VMs and a few languages that are known to be <em>excellent</em> for concurrency. Depending on what you need, this will narrow your choices down to a few families.</p><p><strong>Do you work in a larger environment?</strong> If you are building something, and your entire company is on one stack, there’s so much power to the existing ecosystem that this effectively narrows down your choice to the language of your environment.<sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Is your problem in a domain where the ecosystem in one language is strongest?</strong> If you’re in machine learning, the ecosystem in python is so powerful that it almost guarantees to narrow down your choice to that language.</p><p><strong>Is your problem a small script that needs to run everywhere?</strong> This narrows your choices down to the languages that are available by default on Linux</p><p>Now, there’s a leverage point here: constraints narrow down your choices in a significant way. If you add a constraint you didn’t need, you risk sacrificing a large set of options. For example, many think their system needs to scale from the get-go. This is rarely the case and kills some of the choices that contributed to the success of the biggest companies today <sup>2</sup></p><p>So pick your constraints carefully. Once you do though, you’ll be pleasantly surprised with how much clarity they give you: your choices will have gone through a significant filter.</p><p>The next filter is effectiveness. Choose the language that maximizes your output on a time scale you care about.</p><p>At this stage, there is often a tradeoff between what you’re comfortable with and what you need to discover. Say you’re comfortable in assembly, but don’t know any other languages. What should you do?</p><p>Well, for some very small problems, it <em>does</em> make sense to just write them in assembly. If they’re urgent, you have no other choice. But for any significant work, you’ll outstrip the productivity of assembly within a few days of ramp-up. </p><p>The same kind of spectrum exists in higher-level languages, but the differences take longer to show up. If you’re comfortable with Java, for example, you can get a lot done pretty quickly. But within <em>some</em> period, the productivity benefits pale in comparison to more powerful languages.</p><p>Making this choice is a bit of an art, but it works like this. You want to think about a time-frame that you’d like to optimize and pick the language that optimizes for effectiveness within that timeframe. </p><p>If you’re in a hurry, you have no choice but to use what you’re comfortable with, no matter how limiting. There are two ways to avoid the dilemma. You can either play with different languages before you start your project, so you have a wider array of comfortable choices to pick from, or give yourself a few months to ramp up and select the language that’s most effective for your problem.</p><p>With that, the question comes, <em>what time frame</em> should you optimize for? This is in itself an art. For startups, I would say about 8-12 months. Planning further than that is over-optimization. For larger companies, I’d think 2-5 years.</p><p>Now you’ve gone through two filters. Say you narrowed down to just a few choices, but you aren’t sure which one to take. How should you break the tie? </p><p>I’d say fun. There are so many schleps in a startup that programming should be as fun as possible. Once. I narrowed down. I’d choose the language I’m most excited about.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Sean Grove, Daniel Woelfel, Joe Averbukh, Alex Reichert for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div></div>]]>

What seems like productive reading time in the morning reverted back to mindless commutes between work and home. I can relate and in november, this is my attempt to get back to my reading habits every single day.</p>

<p>Back in my previous article <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-07-20-articles-of-july/">Want to improve? You have got to read</a>, I’ve wrriten how improvement and personal development happens when you put in the time to read and learn. If personal development is important for you, prioritize time to read.</p>

<p>For all developers whom are looking for direct alternatives to google’s tools. it is interesting to see the extent of inconvenience this community of non-googlers would go just not to use google. Privacy definitely has its importance; all the more paramount when its used in your disfavour.</p>

<p>The more time you spent building your product, your own furniture, or even your software will create this irrational love for it. Some call it the ikea effect where furnitures build by your own hands seems to have more worth than it actually has - an addition of sentimental worth.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s often effort that ultimately creates long-term satisfaction,” wrote Dan Ariely wrote in his book&nbsp;The Upside of Irrationality, after co-authoring the Ikea effect paper. “Greater labor leads to greater love.”</p>

</ul>

<p>While it is not entirely true, there are some good pointers to take away from this article. Coincidentally, I agree with point 2,4,6,8,10. A good design makes a product understandable. The design is supposed to make the product self explanatory. The classical example is how a 3 year old was able to understand how to use an iphone without any manual or explanation. That is a ton of genius packed into one small device.</p>

</ul>

<p>It is interesting how things that we take for granted are actually a solution to challenging problems that were faced by the previous generations. While it is a story back into history, here is a quote from John E. Warnock, the cofounder of Adobe.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“What industries badly need is a universal way to communicate documents across a wide variety of machine configurations, operating systems and communication networks. These documents should be viewable on any display and should be printable on any modern printers. If this problem can be solved, then the fundamental way people work will change.”  — John E. Warnock, the cofounder of Adobe</p>

While Apple is talking about saving the earth by producing less electronic waste, I would hope to see how they are backing up their attempts with statistics. Beyond that, I just think its ridiculous to say that and charging new charging brick and new charging wires at such an exorbitant price. One always wonder what would Steve Jobs do.</li>

<p>Rather than to fight the slow fight to convince others to drive less and thus have less cars on the road, how about a radical alternative?</p>

<p>Give them an pleasant alternative, escooters. This can help to cover short distance travels, it also help us to see how the government can chart the way for a societal change in lifestyle. A step forward for countries to reduce in carbon footprint is to create bicycle lanes to encourage more bicycle as preferred mode of transport.</p>

<p>Give them space and time to work, free from distractions. Work from home’s top distractions are actually the consistent messages that keeps coming in while being physically around your coworkers.</p>

<p>Work from home allows you the socially acceptable approach to mute your employees so you can focus on the tasks before you. While WFH heightens the room for productivity, people are feeling more lonely than before.</p>

<p>The disconnection with their coworkers can also affect their productivity as their mental wellness can be affected with prolong isolation. Companies however feels that it is personal employee responsibility to get themselves connected. Essentially, while it is true to a large extent, companies can play its part to setup itself up for success; not by luck but by design. This includes digital engagements, interactive digital townhall, more frequent get togethers once in a while to bring people together.</p>

<p>Using null might be interesting if you care about property existence. If it is undefined, you wouldnt know if the variable foo might be undefined or if the object doesn’t have a property foo.

<p>The secret to serving static video content is to use CDNs.<br>
<a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CDN.html">This</a> is a simple description of what is a CDN. This might be my an interesting topic to delve deeper to explore the science behind this magic.</p>

<p>Some of the CDNs includes Limelight, Level 3, Akamai, CloudFront, and CloudFlare. For Netflix, they created their own CDN call <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/">Open Connect</a>. This is definitely another tool to explore.</p>

<p>Here’s an overview of how Netflix uses the client to determine the *best CDN to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>The API signals that the content this person is trying to watch is on, say, 10 different CDN servers.</li>
<li>The client intelligence picks the CDN that it calculates to be best*</li>
<li>The client intelligence continually probes to find the best way of receiving content</li>

A short glimpse into what pet vs cattle systems are. The definitions based on the post has accurately described them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pets</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Servers or server pairs that are treated as indispensable or unique systems that can never be down. Typically they are manually built, managed, and “hand fed”. Examples include mainframes, solitary servers, HA loadbalancers/firewalls (active/active or active/passive), database systems designed as master/slave (active/passive), and so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cattle</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arrays of more than two servers, that are built using automated tools, and are designed for failure, where no one, two, or even three servers are irreplaceable. Typically, during failure events no human intervention is required as the array exhibits attributes of “routing around failures” by restarting failed servers or replicating data through strategies like triple replication or erasure coding. Examples include web server arrays, multi-master datastores such as Cassandra clusters, multiple racks of gear put together in clusters, and just about anything that is load-balanced and multi-master.\</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They can go down whenever, however. But they are always creating new server applications to ensure that the service is online.</p>
<br>

<br>
<h2>TLDR;</h2>

<p>Reading has this compounding effect with tangible effects budding months or even years of consistent practice. In technology, while it is easy to just chase the work and code, one of the most fundamental habits of x10 engineers is the habit of reading and immersing themselves in tech talks and discussions. May us all engineers develop this habit and make the world a better place; one piece of code at a time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You've validated your micro-SaaS idea and are ready to start building the product.</p><p>The obvious next questions are</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Which features should the product include in its first version?</li><li>How long should you take to build it?</li></ol><p>Through this post, I provide you with a framework to identify your initial product features, how to decide what to include or exclude from the first versions, and continue building upon it.</p><p>Before jumping into MLP, let's first understand what MVP&nbsp;is and why it's not enough in today's times.</p><h2>What is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ericries" target="_blank">Eric Ries</a> popularized the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank">minimum viable product</a> in his book <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/" target="_blank">The Lean Startup</a> as that version of a new product that is just usable enough by early customers who can then provide feedback to the team. This feedback should help the team generate validated learnings and guide them on future product development and features.</p><h4>When MVP still works</h4><p>MVP is not dead though. It still works, given the right kind of problem statements.</p><p>Suppose you're building something that simply doesn't exist in the world, and it's something that people really want and have no alternative to getting it except from you.</p><p>At this time, people will accept a textbook MVP, simply because they have no frame of reference to compare it with. Or better yet, because they have no alternative to replace your MVP with.</p><h4>Why MVP&nbsp;is not enough in 2021</h4><p>Over the past few years as smartphone penetration boomed, products matured, product design and user experience matured, people's expectations have increased.</p><p>No longer does a quickly thrown together prototype cut it. People expect a minimum level of good UX and ease-of-use, else they'll leave your app before even giving it a proper try.</p><p>In fact, in 2021 great UX might be one strong reason people pick your product over incumbents. That's what happened with <a href="https://transistor.fm/" target="_blank">Transistor.fm</a>, who made podcast hosting simple and easy.</p><p>People expect good aesthetics that make a first impression, simply because that's what they have become used to from the plethora of beautiful and well-designed apps out there in the world.</p><p>People expect products to be fully functional as advertised. Buggy products are not acceptable, and in fact people might quickly take to Twitter or social media to let others know that a product is unreliable.</p><p>The MVP mindset intensely focuses on building the bare minimum, and that often leaves users frustrated and drives them to seek alternative solutions. Stiffer competition means that people WILL compare your product to alternatives in the market, it's inevitable. And unless you provide something unique and valuable that nobody else does, people are likely to leave.</p><p>All these reasons and more make MVP&nbsp;a dated concept, especially in the context of SaaS products. But above all, I think the MVP mindset makes product builders think too heavily about the "minimum" and often so at the cost of "viable".</p><p>That's a common pitfall and to avoid that, I propose the MLP framework.</p><h2>What is a Minimum Loveable Product (MLP)?</h2><p>A great new concept that I've fallen in love with and personally follow in every product I build is MLP, or Minimum Loveable Product.</p><p>The term MLP was first coined by Brian de Haaff, the co-founder of Aha!, in his book <a href="https://www.aha.io/lovability" target="_blank">Lovability</a>.</p><p>Its definition is an extension of what Eric Ries already introduced to the world with MVP. With MLP though, you are trying to build the minimum "loveable" product, with a focus on no matter how small or feature-stripped the first version of your product is, it is sufficient to deliver a delightful experience to your user.</p><h4>Minimum Viable Product and the burnt pizza analogy</h4><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiaona/" target="_blank">Jiaona Zhang</a>, who is currently VP&nbsp;of Product at Webflow (this blog is built using Webflow) introduced the <a href="https://firstround.com/review/dont-serve-burnt-pizza-and-other-lessons-in-building-minimum-lovable-products/" target="_blank">burnt pizza analogy</a> to her students at Stanford.</p><p>“<em>Say you’re trying to test whether people like pizza. If you serve them burnt pizza, you’re not getting feedback on whether they like pizza. You only know that they don’t like burnt pizza. Similarly, when you’re only relying on the MVP, the fastest and cheapest functional prototype, you risk not actually testing your product, but rather a poor or flawed version of it.</em>"</p><p>A great practical example of Minimum Loveable Product is the Apple iPad. All the tablets that came before Apple's tablet were MVPs.</p><h2>MLP vs MVP</h2><p>If you're new to all these terminologies, I understand that it can be confusing. Bear with me, you'll wrap your head around it soon enough.</p><p>Build an MLP when you are solving a problem that's already understood by people, and an MVP when people don't easily understand a problem.</p><p>Build an MLP when you can clearly define and understand a market and you are trying to stand out from the existing tools. Build an MVP when you're trying to gauge if there even exists a market to serve.</p><p>An&nbsp;MLP can be built when you know exactly what customers want. An MVP is when you don't know what customers want, and therefore you want to throw things at the wall as quickly as possible and see what sticks.</p><p>An MLP is necessary if you are building in a market where several large and well-known alternatives already exist. An MVP is the right approach for a new market with barely any alternatives, or those solutions are not yet known by the masses.</p><p>While building an MLP, you make a dedicated effort to succeed with that idea. With MVP, you are trying to determine quickly whether the idea can succeed or whether it will fail.</p><p>Building an&nbsp;MVP means you're ready for failure and also ready to pivot quickly as you learn more about the market. Which means you should make tech and architecture decisions that help you move fast above anything else. Scalability or good architecture design is a concern to pay attention to while building an MLP.</p><p>Finally, the end goal of an MLP is that the customers who use it find it sufficient in functionality and experience to be able to "love" it. With an MLP, you're building just enough that a customer with (hopefully) a real pain point would "tolerate" and continue using your product while you validate your assumptions.</p><h2>Minimum Marketable Product, Minimum Remarkable Product, Minimum Launchable Product</h2><p>The what?</p><p>I know, I know. I came across these terms for the first time today while researching to write this post. And I went through the literature so that I can tell you to safely ignore it.</p><p>If you understand and embody the concept of MLP, you don't need to think about any other frameworks or terminologies that you may discover while researching on Google.</p><h2>How to build an MLP for your Micro SaaS idea</h2><p>Alright, let's put aside theory and dive right in.</p><p>Here are the steps you should loosely follow to building an MLP.</p><h4>1. Understand the #1 problem you're trying to solve</h4><p>What's the #1 reason someone would want to use your Micro SaaS product over existing alternatives?</p><p>Is it that existing options have poor UX?&nbsp;Great, create a well designed and easy-to-use product. You'd be surprised to know how often people switch to an easier to use tool, simply because they are fed up of the poor UX that they encounter repeatedly.</p><p>Is it that existing alternatives are very expensive?&nbsp;Carve out a minimum set of features that people are paying a lot of money for and charge 1/10th for your v1 product. This might not work for very large customers, but vast majority of customers who are small or mid-sized are always looking for affordable alternatives.</p><p>It might not just be raw quantum of pricing, but certain companies targeting Enterprise customers have very complicated pricing slabs and tiers that are designed to give their sales person more room. In such a case, coming out with a competitor product which has a simple, easy-to-understand pricing is how you attract customers.</p><p>Are existing alternatives lacking certain features that leaves a subset of users very dissatisfied?&nbsp;Great, your MLP should specifically address that problem by building functionality that attracts these dissatisfied users. Side note - This is perhaps one of the best ways to go about building a new product.</p><p>In all cases, it involves understanding the problem you are solving and the exact reason why someone would use your product.</p><h4>2. Design a simple product that solves the top customer needs satisfactorily</h4><p>Once you have identified the #1 reason, it's time to decide on a feature set for your product that solves your customer's top pain points satisfactorily.</p><p><strong>Let's take an example</strong> - People want to add a feedback tracking tool inside their product, so that they can collect user feedback automatically. However, the existing solutions don't allow them to embed the feedback tracker within their tool.</p><p>That's your entry point into providing value that customers seek, but are not getting as of today.</p><p>Having understood the #1 problem, you also have to understand other requirements that fall under the "minimum" set of things you need to do to build a "loveable" product.</p><p>These could be:</p><ul role="list"><li>existing solutions are all well designed and aesthetically pleasing =&gt;&nbsp;your minimum loveable product needs to be well designed too</li><li>existing solutions are affordably priced with a easy to understand pricing structure =&gt; your MLP also needs a simple pricing structure that's affordable</li></ul><p>In general, you want to analyze your competitors and understand </p><ol start="" role="list"><li>What they are doing well</li><li>What users value from among those things</li></ol><p>In your MLP, you need to cover the intersection of (what they are doing well) x (what users value from among those).</p><h4>3. Set a short timeline for building your MLP</h4><p>No matter what you build, building in isolation for too long is dangerous. The main reason for that is - you get to know too late whether your assumptions about what the user really values are on point or off course.</p><p><strong>"But Preetam, you just told me to build a Minimum Loveable Product. And now you're saying I got to build it quickly?"</strong></p><p>Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.</p><p>Short timeframe depends on what you are building, and the size of your team.</p><p>For example - with SuperLemon (WhatsApp plugin for Shopify), Sankalp and I built a MLP in 2 weeks time.</p><p>How?</p><p>We identified precisely the way we could do better - …</p></div></div>

<h2>C++ Vector</h2>
<p>A <b>vector</b> is a sequence container implementing array that can change in size. Unlike array, the size of a vector changes automatically when elements are appended or deleted. </p>
<p>Vector stores elements in contiguous memory location which enables direct access of any elements using <span>operator []</span>. To support shrink and expand functionality at runtime, vector container may allocate some extra storage. Hence, compared to array, vector requires more memory and in return it manage memory dynamically and efficiently.</p>

</p><hr>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25174048">Hacker News discussion.</a></p>
<hr>
<p>This week's post is about Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module. You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binning">Statistical data binning</a> with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>.</li>
<li>Adding new data to a sorted list with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module is to allow you to efficiently search and
update sorted lists. To this end, it provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> implementation, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>.</li>
<li>An "insert" -- as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort">insertion sort</a> -- implementation, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binning">statistical data binning</a>, you have data that you want to group into "bins". E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>You have data on different fruits and want to group "lemon" and "orange" into
"citrus".</li>
<li>You have data on students' grades and want to group scores between 80 and 90
into "B", scores between 90 and 100 into "A", etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, a straightforward approach is to write a function that computes the bin.
E.g., binning fruits:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def bin_fruit(fruit):
    if fruit in ["lemon", "orange"]:
        return "citrus"
    elif fruit in ["apple", "pear"]:
        return "malinae"


import random

data = random.choices(
    ["lemon", "orange", "apple", "pear"], k=10
)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['lemon',
 'lemon',
 'apple',
 'apple',
 'apple',
 'lemon',
 'apple',
 'apple',
 'lemon',
 'pear']
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_fruit(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['citrus',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'malinae',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae']
</code></pre>
<p>E.g., turning test scores into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States">letter grades</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def bin_score(score):
    if 90 &lt;= score &lt;= 100:
        return "A"
    elif 80 &lt;= score &lt; 90:
        return "B"
    elif 70 &lt;= score &lt; 80:
        return "C"
    elif 60 &lt;= score &lt; 70:
        return "D"
    elif score &lt; 60:
        return "F"


import random

data = [random.randint(50, 100) for _ in range(10)]
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[78, 87, 93, 78, 53, 92, 64, 70, 75, 60]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_score(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['C', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'F', 'A', 'D', 'C', 'C', 'D']
</code></pre>
<p>For a dataset of <var>n</var> records and <var>m</var> bins, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time
complexity</a> of this approach tends to be</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">O</a>(<var>m</var><var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because binning one record takes O(<var>m</var>) time -- O(<var>m</var>)
if-statements are checked -- and <var>n</var> records need to be binned.</p>
<p>If the number of bins <var>m</var> is constant, then the overall time
complexity is simply O(<var>n</var>).</p>
<p>But what if the number of bins <var>m</var> is large enough that the
straightforward approach is too slow?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable">discrete data</a>, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionaries</a>. E.g., binning
fruits:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>bins = {
    "lemon": "citrus",
    "orange": "citrus",
    "apple": "malinae",
    "pear": "malinae",
}

def bin_fruit(fruit):
    return bins[fruit]


import random

data = random.choices(
    ["lemon", "orange", "apple", "pear"], k=10
)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['lemon',
 'pear',
 'lemon',
 'lemon',
 'apple',
 'orange',
 'apple',
 'orange',
 'pear',
 'apple']
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_fruit(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['citrus',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'malinae']
</code></pre>
<p>Binning one record this way takes O(1) time -- regardless of the number of
bins <var>m</var> -- because <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionaries</a> are implemented using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash tables</a>. And creating the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionary</a> take O(<var>m</var>) time --
one entry for each bin. Thus, the overall time complexity, for <var>n</var>
records and <var>m</var> bins, is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>m</var> + <var>n</var>).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>And, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable">continuous data</a>, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>. E.g., turning
test scores into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States">letter grades</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>score_bins = [60, 70, 80, 90]
score_letters = ["F", "D", "C", "B", "A"]

import bisect


def bin_score(score):
    i = bisect.bisect(score_bins, score)
    return score_letters[i]


import random

data = [random.randint(50, 100) for _ in range(10)]
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[60, 100, 88, 98, 55, 52, 52, 94, 71, 85]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_score(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['D', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'A', 'C', 'B']
</code></pre>
<p>Binning one record this way takes O(logÂ&nbsp;<var>m</var>) time, because
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a> uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> to navigate <code>score_bins</code>. And
creating <code>score_bins</code> takes O(<var>m</var>) time. Thus, the overall time
complexity, for <var>n</var> records and <var>m</var> bins, is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>m</var> + <var>n</var> log <var>m</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NOTE: If you are able to use 3rd-party libraries, such as <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> or
<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, then look at these functions: <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.digitize.html">numpy.digitize</a>,
<a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.searchsorted.html#numpy.searchsorted">numpy.searchsorted</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.searchsorted.html">pandas.Series.searchsorted</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.qcut.html#pandas.qcut">pandas.qcut</a>,
<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.cut.html">pandas.cut</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In this scenario, you have a sorted list of data and you want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_statistic">order statistics</a> (e.g. compute the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median">median</a>).</li>
<li>Add new data.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you can imagine having a temperature sensor that regularly reports
the temperature. You want to regularly report the median temperature, as well
as be able to incorporate new temperature data as it arrives.</p>
<p>To me, a straightforward approach is to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types">list.append</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.median">statistics.median</a>. E.g., monitoring temperatures:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def add_new_measurement(data, temperature):
    data.append(temperature)


def median(data):
    return statistics.median(data)


import random
import statistics

data = [random.randint(93, 100) for _ in range(10)]
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[98, 94, 97, 94, 94, 98, 98, 94, 94, 95]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>94.5
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>add_new_measurement(data, 97)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[98, 94, 97, 94, 94, 98, 98, 94, 94, 95, 97]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>95
</code></pre>
<p>For a dataset of <var>n</var> records, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of this approach
tends to be</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computing median:</strong> O(<var>n</var>) or O(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>) --
depending on how the median is computed.</li>
<li><strong>Adding new data:</strong> O(1).</li>
</ul>
<p>So if the workload requires frequently adding new data and infrequently
computing the median, this approach works well.</p>
<p>But what if the workload is inverted? For example, if temperature measurements
are received every couple of minutes, but the median must be computed every
couple of seconds.</p>
<p>In that scenario, I think we would be better suited by speeding up computing
the median, even at the expense of slowing down adding new data.</p>
<p>Computing order statistics can be done in O(1) time if the data is already
sorted. So a straightforward way to handle this workload would be to sort the
data after appending and use the fact that the data is sorted to efficiently
compute the median:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def add_new_measurement(data, temperature):
    data.append(temperature)
    data.sort()


def median(data):
    n = len(data)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (data[(n // 2) - 1] + data[n // 2]) / 2
    else:
        return data[n // 2]


import random

data = sorted(random.randint(93, 100) for _ in range(10))
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[93, 94, 94, 96, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 100]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>96.5
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>add_new_measurement(data, 97)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[93, 94, 94, 96, 96, 97, 97, 98, 99, 100, 100]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>97
</code></pre>
<p>For a dataset of <var>n</var> records, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of this approach
tends to be</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computing median:</strong> O(1).</li>
<li><strong>Adding new data:</strong> O(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>).</li>
</ul>
<p>But I think that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> for adding new data can further be
improved by using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a>, which runs in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's Python code that does that:</p>
<pre><code>import bisect


def add_new_measurement(data, temperature):
    bisect.insort(data, temperature)
</code></pre>
<p>Doing this changes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of adding new data from</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this week's post you learned how to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module for
statistical data binning and adding new data to sorted lists.</p>
<p>For further reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algorithms that process input piece-by-piece -- like the temperature sensor
scenario -- are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm">online algorithms</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a> can be used to implement an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort">Insertion sort</a>. Insertion
sort is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm">online algorithm</a> and -- along with Python's built-in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort">timsort</a> -- is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_sort">adaptive sorting algorithm</a> because it takes
advantage of data that is partially sorted.</li>
</ul>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module provides "left"- and "right"-variants of
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort_left">bisect.insort_left</a>,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort_right">bisect.insort_right</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect_left">bisect.bisect_left</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect_right">bisect.bisect_right</a>.</p>
<p>Read the documentation and figure out what the difference between the "left"-
and "right"-variants is.</p>
