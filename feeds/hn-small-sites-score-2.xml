<p><img src="https://johtela.github.io/vscode-modaledit/docs/images/pooh.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="403">
Providing full Vim emulation was not originally a goal of ModalEdit. The idea of
the extension is to provide an engine that allows the user to <a href="https://johtela.github.io/vscode-modaledit/docs/README.html#configuration">map any key
combination to any command provided by VS Code</a>.
However, most users equate modal editing with Vim and are familiar with its
default keybindings. Vim users really love the powerful key sequences that
combine editing operations with cursor motions or text ranges.</p>
<p>ModalEdit has also evolved by taking inspiration from Vim. Many capabilities
were added with the motive to enable some Vim feature that was previously not
possible to implement. With version 2.0 ModalEdit's functionality is now
extensive enough to build a semi-complete Vim emulation. So, here we go...</p>
<p>Adding Vim keybindings as optional presets serves two purposes: it lowers the
barrier to entry for Vim users who don't want to spend the time defining
bindings from ground up. Secondly, Vim presets serve as an example to show
how you can build sophisticated command sequences using the machinery provided
by ModalEdit.</p>
<p><img src="https://johtela.github.io/vscode-modaledit/docs/images/import-preset.png" alt="importing presets" width="553" height="94">
If you are not interested on how the Vim keybindings are implemented and just
want to use them, you can skip this discussion. Just import the presets by
pressing <key>Ctrl</key>+<key>Shift</key>+<key>P</key> and running command
<strong>ModalEdit: Import preset keybindings</strong>. You will be presented a choice to
import either Vim bindings or any presets that you have created yourself. If
you are planning to customize the bindings, or create Vim-style commands from
scratch, this document gives you pointers how to go about with that.</p>
<h2 id="game-plan">Game Plan</h2>
<p>We start with basic motion commands which are mostly straightforward to
implement. Motions have two modes of operation: normal mode (moving cursor), and
visual mode (extending selection). We make sure all motions work correctly in
both modes. This allows us to reuse these keybindings when implementing more
advanced operations. Our goal is to avoid repetition by building complex
sequences from primitive commands.</p>
<p>In Vim, there are multiple key sequences for a same operation. For example,
you can convert a paragraph upper case by typing
<key>g</key><key>U</key><key>i</key><key>p</key>. You can perform the same
operation using visual mode by typing <key>v</key><key>i</key><key>p</key><key>U</key>.
The trick we use is to convert key sequences that operate on character, word,
line, paragraph, etc. to analagous key sequences that use visual mode. We can
implement all the editing commands just to work on active selection and reuse
these commands with the other key combinations. Consequently, command definition
becomes a string mapping problem. Since we can use JavaScript to expressions to
do string manipulation, these mappings are easy to formulate.</p>

<p>Cursor can be advanced in a file with with enter and space. These are not
technically motion commands but included for compatibility.</p>

<p>Move cursor up/down/left/right.</p>

<pre><code>        "h": "cursorLeft",
        "j": "cursorDown",
        "k": "cursorUp",
        "l": "cursorRight",
</code></pre>
<p>Move to first/last character on line. These work also in visual mode.</p>

<pre><code>        "0": {
            "command": "cursorMove",
            "args": "{ to: 'wrappedLineStart', select: __selecting }"
        },
        "$": {
            "command": "cursorMove",
            "args": "{ to: 'wrappedLineEnd', select: __selecting }"
        },
</code></pre>
<p>Move to first/last non-blank character on line. Also these ones use the
<code>__selecting</code> flag to check whether we are in visual mode.</p>

<pre><code>        "^": {
            "command": "cursorMove",
            "args": "{ to: 'wrappedLineFirstNonWhitespaceCharacter', select: __selecting }"
        },
        "g": {
            "_": {
                "command": "cursorMove",
                "args": "{ to: 'wrappedLineLastNonWhitespaceCharacter', select: __selecting }"
            },
</code></pre>
<p>Moving to the beginning of file is defined as a conditional command to make
it work in visual mode.</p>

<pre><code>            "g": {
                "condition": "__selecting",
                "true": "cursorTopSelect",
                "false": "cursorTop"
            },
</code></pre>
<h2 id="other-commands-starting-with-key-g-key">Other Commands Starting with <key>g</key></h2>
<p>Commands starting with <key>g</key> key are bit inconsistent in Vim. Some of
them are basic motion commands, such as <key>g</key><key>_</key> and
<key>g</key><key>g</key>, some are editing commands like <key>g</key><key>J</key>
and <key>g</key><key>U</key>, and some switch between tabs 🤷‍♂️. Since we have to
define all bindings with the same prefix in same place, we take a detour and add
these commands before continuing with rest of the motion commands.</p>
<div>

</div><p>Joining lines without space is done by deleting a character after the join
command.</p>

<pre><code>            "J": [
                "editor.action.joinLines",
                "deleteRight"
            ],
</code></pre>
<p>The lower/uppercase transition works with any motion, but since we have not
defined all of them yet, we explain the command structure
<a href="#editing-with-motions">later in the document</a>.
The structure we use here is exactly the same as with <key>d</key> command, for
example.</p>

                }
            },

<p><key>g</key><key>t</key> and <key>g</key><key>T</key> switch to next/previous
tab.</p>

<pre><code>            "t": "workbench.action.nextEditor",
            "T": "workbench.action.previousEditor"
        },
</code></pre>
<h2 id="rest-of-the-motion-commands">Rest of the Motion Commands</h2>
<p>Now we can complete the list of basic motion commands. This one movest the
cursor at the end of the file and selects the range, if visual mode is on.</p>

<pre><code>        "G": {
            "condition": "__selecting",
            "true": "cursorBottomSelect",
            "false": "cursorBottom"
        },
</code></pre>
<p>The logic of separating words is bit different in VS Code and Vim, so we will
not try to imitate Vim behavior here. These keys are mapped to the most similar
motion available. The <key>W</key> and <key>B</key> commands skip separator
characters, and move to the start of the next/previous alphanumeric word.</p>

<pre><code>        "w": "cursorWordStartRight",
        "e": "cursorWordEndRight",
        "b": "cursorWordStartLeft",
        "W": {
            "command": "cursorWordStartRight",
            "repeat": "__char.match(/\\W/)"
        },
        "B": {
            "command": "cursorWordStartLeft",
            "repeat": "__char.match(/\\W/)"
        },
</code></pre>
<p>Moving cursor to the top, middle, and bottom of the screen is mapped to
<key>H</key> (high), <key>M</key> (middle), and <key>L</key> (low) keys. These
mappings also work in visual mode.</p>

<pre><code>        "H": {
            "command": "cursorMove",
            "args": "{ to: 'viewPortTop', select: __selecting }"
        },
        "M": {
            "command": "cursorMove",
            "args": "{ to: 'viewPortCenter', select: __selecting }"
        },
        "L": {
            "command": "cursorMove",
            "args": "{ to: 'viewPortBottom', select: __selecting }"
        },
</code></pre>
<p>Move to matching bracket command is somewhat challenging to implement
consistently in VS Code. This is due to the problem that there are no commands
that do exactly what Vim's motions do. In normal mode we call the
<code>jumpToBracket</code> command which works if the cursor is on top of a bracket, but
does not allow for the selection to be extended. In visual mode we use the
<code>smartSelect.expand</code> command instead to extend the selection to whatever
syntactic scope is above the current selection. In many cases, it is more useful
motion than jumping to a matching bracket, but using it means that we are
diverging from Vim's …</p></div></div>

          <div>
            

<p>Hey everyone, <br>

Today is a big day for NeuralCam. We have three announcements to make: some news about NeuralCam as a company, a major update for our NightMode app and a brand new <strong>Smart Camera app.</strong>
</p><br>
<h3>
NeuralCam - building Smart Camera Apps
</h3>
<div><p>Let’s start by talking a bit about cameras and AI. </p><p>

At NeuralCam, we think that one of the biggest leaps in technology over the past years has been the advances Deep Learning brought in the area of Computer Vision. It gives computers the ability to see - to understand patterns, images and video similarly to how people do.
 </p></div>



<p>Ultimately, we think this technology will give birth to a new category of cameras - <b>Smart Cameras</b> - that will have a profound impact on every activity that involves capturing and processing images.
</p>

<p>We see this change similar to the transformation from classic cellular phones to the modern smartphone we witnessed 10 years ago. We believe that martphones themselves seem to be the ideal smart camera platform: they have high quality cameras and enough processing power to run modern AI algorithms on-device.
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/smartcameras.png">
</p>

<p>So, we can all have our own personal smart cameras in our pockets, all that’s needed is the right ML software. This ML software is what we call Smart Camera Apps, and these are the type of apps we’re building at NeuralCam.
</p>

<p>Whenever we see a visual task we might say “there’s a Smart Cam App for that”. We’ve been doing a lot of research and prototyping and we’re more and more confident that smart camera apps will play a key role in every industry, from Education through Healthcare to Entertainment, and we can’t wait to contribute something in each of these areas.

</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/smartapps.png">
</p>

<p>However, the first category that is naturally most likely to change is almost analogous to the camera itself: photography and videography. Thus, this is what we’ve decided to start with, building AI powered Photo &amp; Video apps over the next few years. 
</p>

<p>Our first smart photo app we’ve launched is the NeuralCam NightMode app, which brought Night Mode to all iPhones and all iPhone camera lenses. But, NeuralCam is more than the Night Mode app. We think of NeuralCam as a range of smart camera apps in different categories for various use cases. 
</p>



<p>So, one of the things we did is update our brand to reflect this change. This is the first thing we’d like to show you today, a fresh NeuralCam: 
</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/nclogo.png"></p>

<p>And this is the new NeuralCam NightMode:</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/NightModeLogo.png">
<br>
</p>
<p>Ok, so that’s the story of NeuralCam - the company. The second thing we want to show you is an update to our NightMode app. 

</p>

<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">NeuralCam NightMode</h3>

<p>We <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/neuralcam" target="_blank">launched</a> our first smart camera app, NeuralCam NightMode, about a year ago, last August. It brought NightMode to the iPhone and the response from the users and critics <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/30/iphone-camera-app-for-night-shots/" target="_blank">was amazing.</a>
</p>

<p>We’ve been <a href="https://petapixel.com/2019/08/28/neuralcam-night-photo-app-brings-ai-powered-low-light-mode-to-iphones/" target="_blank">covered</a> <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/10/25/iphone-11-pro-camera-review-features-with-night-mode-app/" target="_blank">in many</a> <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/08/30/iphone-11-release-date-soon-specs-camera-night-mode/" target="_blank">major</a> <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apple/2019/08/29/this-app-uses-ai-to-add-a-pixel-style-night-photography-mode-to-your-iphone/" target="_blank">press</a> <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/neuralcam-iphone-app-uses-ai-to-capture-bright-images-at-night-26588672/" target="_blank">publications</a>, got lots of love letters from users, and been recognized as the best NightMode app out there. 
</p>
<p>While Apple has launched a built-in night mode on the iPhone 11 in the meantime, NeuralCam continues to be the NightMode solution for devices or iPhone cameras without a native NightMode - like the newly launched iPhone SE or even the UltraWide &amp; Selfie cameras on the iPhone 11 Pro. </p>
<p>Since its launch, people have used NeuralCam NightMode to take more than 10M low light photos. 
</p>

<div><p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/10M.png"></p></div>

<p>Now, with a major update, we have made our NightMode app even better: we've made some major improvements to our algorithm so that it supports higher resolutions on older devices too; we’ve updated the UI to be in-line with the new NeuralCam brand and we’ve officially added iPad support.</p><p>This is how the update NeuralCam NightMode app looks like on an iPad:</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/nmupdate.png">
<br>
</p>

<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">NeuralCam Live</h3>

<p>The popularity of video calls has exploded lately. In the current global context, most of us use video calls a lot for both getting our job done or to keep in touch with loved ones. For something used as often, we really need to have the best possible tools. 

</p>

<p>Looking at the things out there, we realized that there’s a weak link in all this video call experience, and it’s the webcams. </p><p>We’ve got laptop webcams (quite bad), dedicated webcams (a bit better) or apps that let you use your iPhone as a webcam (best quality). However, these products really only differ from one another in the resolution of the video they provide. 
</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/webcams.png">
<br>

<p> The problem with webcams is that they’re mostly the same as they were 10 years ago, they do the same thing only slightly better. In the meantime, this cool new technology called Deep Learning came along which could add a whole new dimension to webcams and possibly change the whole video call experience - but nobody uses it. 

</p>

<p>
It turns out that one of the main reasons for Deep Learning not being used with webcams is that no webcam has the processing power required to run the required ML algorithms. Except there is one device which, when converted to a webcam, could do all this: the iPhone in our pocket.
</p>

<p>It’s got one of the best cameras in the smartphone industry and with its fast processors and dedicated machine learning hardware, it is capable of running even video processing machine learning algorithms in real-time. It just needs the right SmartCam App software to do all this. 
  </p><p>We've built this software - we call it NeuralCam Live and it turns the iPhone into the <strong>world’s smartest webcam.</strong>
  </p>

<p>
	Ok, so how are we going to do that?
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">Technology</h3>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/tech.png">
<br>
</p>

<p>First, we need the software that connects the iPhone to the laptop and makes it appear just like a regular webcam when connected through a USB cable. 
</p>

<p>This software has two modules: the first one is an iOS app that provides the webcam functionality, while the second one is a plugin that’s installed on the laptop to make the iOS app appear as a webcam. Once you install both of these components, all you have to do is select the NeuralCam Live Camera in Zoom, Google Meet or your video call platform of choice.
</p>

<p>So, that was quite easy, now comes the fun part. </p><p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/engine.png">
<br>
</p>

<p> The second component we need is the machine learning software to make our smart webcam... well, smart. We call it the <b>LiveEngine</b> </p>

<p>Machine learning, as a generic technology, can help us in two ways when it comes to webcams: we can use it to recognize things in the video feed or generate new video content, improved in some way. </p><p>We’ve developed multiple machine learning modules, some proprietary, some built on top of existing CoreML models and we’ve grouped them in three different machine learning frameworks that cover both video generation and analysis: the Style Framework, the Enhance Framework and the Gesture Framework. Let’s take a quick look at each of these. 
</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/f_style.png">
<br>
</p>


<p>The <b>Style Framework</b> is a deep learning-based machine learning framework that edits video similarly to a professional colorist. 
</p>
<p>Its Neural Nets were trained on images edited by hand by professionals in a range of different editing styles. The results are quite amazing, generating pro-looking videosf, very close in terms of style to the professionally edited frames it was trained on and it does all this in real-time at 30fps locally, on the user’s iPhone.
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/f_enhance.png">
<br>
</p>

<p>The <b>Enhance Framework</b> contains our set of machine learning models that can enhance a video in a bunch of different ways. </p>

<p>Our real-time video denoising and brightening models in this category achieve levels of quality and performance that are much better than traditional algorithms and make features such as video low light enhancement or face smoothing possible.
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/f_recognition.png">
<br>
</p>

<p>The <b>Recognition Framework</b> is the part of our LiveEngine that is meant to make our smart camera apps understand what they “see”. </p>

<p>It uses a combination of machine learning models provided by the iPhone SDK and adds a number of proprietary elements to detect faces, user gestures or other different patterns in the live video feed. In the app, we can use this type of technology to blur unwanted gestures or guide you to set up an ideal environment for a call.
</p>

<p>Together, all these elements form what we call the LiveEngine - the ever-evolving software module that makes NeuralCam Live a smart webcam.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/NCFeats.png">
<br>
</p>

<p>Now, let’s take a look at the actual product. </p>
<p>The iPhone app exposes all of the functionality of the smart iPhone webcam in a simple layout, most of the features can be accessed by just tapping a button on the screen. It also shows a nice preview of the current video feed. 
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/smartwebcam.png">
<br>
</p>


<p>So, using all this technology, what more can a smart webcam do compared to a traditional webcam? 
</p>

<p>In terms of the outcome they provide to the user, we’ve realized that most of the AI features we’ve built fit nicely in two categories: making you look better and helping you avoid embarrassing mistakes.
</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at these features one-by-one: 
</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/fiq.png">
<br>
</p>

<h4>Face &amp; Image Quality Meter
</h4>



<p>The Face &amp; Image Quality Meter detects the amount of face lighting, type of face position and background and displays an overall Face Image Quality score. 
</p>

<p>It helps you set up an optimal video-call environment and helps you avoid making typical mistakes, such as sitting with your back towards a bright window or in an unfavorable low angle.
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/styles.png">
  <br>
  </p>

<h4>Pro Video Styling</h4>

<p>
  
  Using the Style Framework, NeuralCam Live edits the video feed like a professional colorist would, in a range of different styles. The end-result is a more impactful look, allowing you to choose the style that best fits your mood, the type of call or the environment you're in.

</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/lowlight.png">
  <br>
  </p>

<h4>
  
  Low-light Mode
</h4>

<p>It wouldn't be a NeuralCam product without a Night Mode, right? </p>
<p>NeuralCam Live’s Low Light Mode brightens up your video with a similar (though a lot more lightweight) technique used in our Night Mode photo app. It allows you to look good in video calls even in low light settings, a gentle light from your monitor is usually enough to provide a nice video feed. 
</p>

<p>
  
  And just in case you need to light up things even more, you can use the face-following Ring Light …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

		</div><p>It's Sweden's storied worker protections and climate-conscious citizens welcoming Amazon's ruthless drive for low prices. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Stockholm is preparing for a tug-of-war with one of the world’s most powerful companies — which just announced its entry into the Swedish market — and hopes that its arrival will mean the country of 10 million will be able to change Amazon, instead of being changed by it.</p>
<p>Amazon's plans — dubbed “<a href="https://www.ehandel.se/har-ar-amazon-se-det-blir-en-helsvensk-lansering" target="_blank">Project Dancing Queen</a>,” after the hit song by Swedish pop group Abba — don't have a lot of detail, but analysts believe its Swedish store will go live in the fall, in time for November’s Black Friday online shopping bonanza.</p>
<p>“Amazon has been supporting Swedish customers and selling partners across our different European stores for many years, but the next step is to bring a full retail offering to Sweden and we are making those plans now,” said Alex Ootes, Amazon’s vice president for EU expansion, in a statement.</p>
<p>Amazon’s turbo-capitalism corporate culture goes against the grain of Sweden and the rest of the Nordic countries, which pride themselves in their strong labor unions and sustainability.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Swedish e-commerce is still like regular retail without shopping malls” <em>— Jonas Arnberg, CEO of market-research firm HUI</em></p></blockquote>
<p>But the country also has an affluent, internet-savvy market ripe for Alexa, Kindles, Prime and the thousands of items on Amazon's online store, the company believes. Around 68 percent of Swedes shopped online in 2018, and they spent an average of €200 per online transaction. In total, the Nordic countries spent over €22 billion online in 2018, according to a <a href="https://www.postnord.fi/siteassets/raportit/verkkokauppa-pohjoismaissa/ecommerce-in-the-nordics-2019.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> by PostNord, the country’s postal service.</p>
<p>There's not a lot of competition in online marketplaces, and nobody can match Amazon’s massive cornucopia of goods.</p>
<p>“Swedish e-commerce is still like regular retail without shopping malls,” said Jonas Arnberg, the CEO of HUI, a market research company.</p>
<p>Amazon will change that, and force local players to adopt e-commerce faster than they would have otherwise.</p>
<p>“It’s a perfect storm in e-commerce now. The COVID-19 impact took us two to three years forward in digitalization. With Amazon’s entry it is going to go even further,” said Kristoffer Väliharju, the CEO of CDON, a Nordic online marketplace. Väliharju is optimistic about CDON’s chances of taking on the tech giant, but said companies without a strong e-commerce game will likely take a big hit.</p>
<p>Initially, Swedish and Nordic clients will be mainly served from German warehouses — known as fulfillment centers in Amazon-speak — with trucks driving up to Sweden through Denmark, and a fulfillment center operated by local partner Kuehne + Nagel in the Swedish town of Eskilstuna, near Stockholm.</p>
<p>Analysts believe local warehouses are inevitable if Amazon is to offer one of its most unique selling points: quick delivery.</p>
<h3>When in Stockholm</h3>
<p>Establishing a local operation will be a major challenge for the company. American Amazon’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/22/how-amazon-is-fighting-back-against-workers-efforts-to-unionize.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-union stance</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working culture</a> is the antithesis of pro-union Sweden. (Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven's political career is rooted in union activism dating from his time as a welder.)</p>
<p>The Swedish labor market is regulated by collective agreements between companies and unions, giving workers plenty of power over corporate decisions. Approximately 70 percent of Swedish workers belong to a union.</p>
<p>“If Amazon wants to succeed in Sweden, they need to work very closely with unions,” said Arne Andersson, an e-commerce expert at PostNord.</p>
<p>Amazon has not yet contacted Handels, the union representing warehouse workers, its political coordinator Emelie Wärn told POLITICO.</p>

<p>“Amazon is welcome to Sweden, but they have to sign a collective agreement. We will work very hard to get them to do that,” Wärn said.</p>
<p>“The fact that international companies takes interest in the Swedish market place is a positive thing. As an employer in Sweden you are obliged to follow Swedish labor legislation, which includes regulations regarding collective bargaining,” said Eva Nordmark, Sweden’s minister of employment, adding that approximately 90 percent of the employees in Sweden are covered by collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p>The minimum wage for a card-carrying Swedish warehouse worker is 142.50 Swedish krona (€13.85) per hour before tax, according to Handels. In contrast, Amazon’s Polish warehouse workers who serve the German market <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-amazon-employees-rage/">earn</a> 20 zlotys (around €4.50). Amazon said its workers in Germany earn a base pay of €11.10 an hour.</p>
<p>But the union is confident it will be able to negotiate with the tech goliath. Handels has done similar deals with Japanese fashion chain Uniqlo, Wärn said as an example.</p>
<p>But Uniqlo is not Amazon, and Handels' confidence might be misplaced, according to Markus Varsikko, a retail consultant at Dash Retail, which helps businesses use Amazon's marketplace.</p>
<p>“Amazon is a realist. If they can operate in Germany, they can operate in Sweden. It is an American company with American culture and thinking, and it is far from what we are used to here,” Varsikko said, arguing that Sweden's companies and workers might have to adapt — not the tech giant.</p>
<h3>Handels and Greta</h3>
<p>Amazon might also have to polish its sustainability credentials to appease Swedish consumers.</p>
<p>“What makes the Swedish market unique is that there is a great focus on companies to do good, be transparent and sustainable. For many Swedes, this is even more important than a wide range and low price,” said Niclas Eriksson, the CEO of electronics retailer Elgiganten. And thanks to local activist Greta Thunberg, consumers are <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/cancel-your-amazon-prime-subscription-save-the-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">becoming increasingly aware</a> of the carbon footprint of services like next-day delivery.</p>
<blockquote><p>European consumer groups have slammed Amazon for selling dangerous and illegal products such as toxic toys and exploding power banks on its platform.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plus Amazon's insistence on lower prices might not be its winning ticket.</p>
<p>The foray into the Swedish market by another e-commerce company, Wish, may serve as a cautionary tale. The American online marketplace, which mostly sells cheap items from China, tried and failed to take over the market a few years ago. The company first wooed consumers with dirt-cheap products such as electronics and clothes, only for Swedes to be disappointed by the quality of the products and frustrated by not being able to return products to sellers.</p>
<p>"[Wish] was cheap, it was a great marketplace, but it was also crap,” said PostNord’s Andersson. Wish did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Amazon's had troubles with quality control too. European consumer groups have <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/online-marketplaces-rife-with-unsafe-and-illegal-items-study-shows/">slammed</a> the company for selling dangerous and illegal products such as toxic toys and exploding power banks on its platform. The European Commission also put pressure on online platforms to control scammers and price gouging during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>CDON’s Väliharju said Swedish customers are very quality-conscious, and aware of their rights as consumers. Consumer groups and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/how-big-brands-chanel-canon-louis-vuitton-nike-are-taking-on-big-tech-silicon-valley-at-last/">brands</a> have criticized Amazon and others for not holding sufficient information about their sellers, especially for products that come from outside the European Union that could be dangerous or counterfeit.</p>
<p>“Amazon absolutely could be well met by Swedish consumers in the beginning,” said Arnberg, the CEO of HUI, citing Amazon’s promise of low prices, a big range of products and fast delivery.</p>
<p>“But in the long run they will have to adjust to Sweden."</p>

		Regardless of the outcome, the election will not stop the rise of hypernationalism, crisis cults and other signs of an empire's terminal decline. 	</p><div>
		
<p><strong>By Chris Hedges </strong>/ Original to Scheerpost</p>



<p>The terminal decline of the United States will not be solved by elections. The political rot and depravity will continue to eat away at the soul of the nation, spawning what anthropologists call crisis cults — movements led by demagogues that prey on an unbearable psychological and financial distress. These crisis cults, already well established among followers of the Christian Right and Donald Trump, peddle magical thinking and an infantilism that promises — in exchange for all autonomy — prosperity, a return to a mythical past, order and security. The dark yearnings among the white working class for vengeance and moral renewal through violence, the unchecked greed and corruption of the corporate oligarchs and billionaires who manage our failed democracy, which has already instituted wholesale government surveillance and revoked most civil liberties, are part of the twisted pathologies that infect all civilizations sputtering towards oblivion. I witnessed the deaths of other nations during the collapse of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe and later in the former Yugoslavia. I have smelled this stench before.</p>



<p>The removal of Trump from office will only exacerbate the lust for racist violence he incites and the intoxicating elixir of white nationalism. The ruling elites, who first built a mafia economy and then built a mafia state, will continue under Biden, as they did under Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, to wantonly pillage and loot. The militarized police will not stop their lethal rampages in poor neighborhoods. The endless wars will not end. The bloated military budget will not be reduced. The world’s largest prison population will remain a stain upon the country. The manufacturing jobs shipped overseas will not return and the social inequality will grow. The for-profit health care system will gouge the public and price millions more out of the health care system. The language of hate and bigotry will be normalized as the primary form of communication. Internal enemies, including Muslims, immigrants and dissidents, will be defamed and attacked. The hypermasculinity that compensates for feelings of impotence will intensify. It will direct its venom towards women and all who fail to conform to rigid male stereotypes, especially artists, LGBTQ people and intellectuals. Lies, conspiracy theories, trivia and fake news — what Hannah Arendt called “nihilistic relativism” — will still dominate the airwaves and social media, mocking verifiable fact and truth. The ecocide, which presages the extinction of the human species and most other life forms, will barrel unabated towards its apocalyptic conclusion.</p>



<p>“We run heedlessly into the abyss after putting something in front of us to stop us seeing it,” Pascal wrote.</p>

<hr>



<p>The worse it gets — and it will get worse as the pandemic hits us in wave after deadly wave with an estimated <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/06/health/us-coronavirus-thursday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">300,000 Americans dead by December</a> and possibly 400,000 by January — the more desperate the nation will become. Tens of millions of people will be thrown into destitution, evicted from their homes and abandoned. Social collapse, as Peter Drucker observed in Weimar Germany in the 1930s, brings with it a loss of faith in ruling institutions and ruling ideologies. With no apparent answers or solutions to mounting chaos and catastrophe — and Biden and the Democratic Party have already precluded the kind of New Deal programs and assault on oligarchic power that saved us during the Great Depression — demagogues and charlatans need only denounce all institutions, all politicians, and all political and social conventions while conjuring up hosts of phantom enemies. Drucker saw that Nazism succeeded not because people believed in its fantastic promises, but in spite of them. Nazi absurdities, he pointed out, had been “witnessed by a hostile press, a hostile radio, a hostile cinema, a hostile church, and a hostile government which untiringly pointed out the Nazi lies, the Nazi inconsistency, the unattainability of their promises, and the dangers and folly of their course.” Nobody, he noted, “would have been a Nazi if rational belief in the Nazi promises had been a prerequisite.” The poet, playwright and socialist revolutionary Ernst Toller, who was forced into exile and stripped of his citizenship when the Nazis took power in 1933, wrote much the same in his autobiography: “The people are tired of reason, tired of thought and reflection. They ask, what has reason done in the last few years, what good have insights and knowledge done us.” After Toller committed suicide in 1939, W.H. Auden in his poem “In Memory of Ernst Toller” wrote:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are lived by powers we pretend to understand:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They arrange our loves; it is they who direct at the end<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enemy bullet, the sickness, or even our hand.</p>



<p>The poor, the vulnerable, those who are not white or not Christian, those who are undocumented or who do not mindlessly repeat the cant of a perverted Christian nationalism, will be offered up in a crisis to the god of death, a familiar form of human sacrifice that plagues sick societies. Once these enemies are purged from the nation, we are promised, America will recover its lost glory, except that once one enemy is obliterated another takes its place. Crisis cults require a steady escalation of conflict. This is what made the war in the former Yugoslavia inevitable. Once one stage of conflict reaches a crescendo it loses its efficacy. It must be replaced by ever more brutal and deadly confrontations. The intoxication and addiction to greater and greater levels of violence to purge the society of evil led to genocide in Germany and the former Yugoslavia. We are not immune. It is what Ernst Jünger called a “feast of death.”</p>



<p>These crisis cults are, as Drucker understood, irrational and schizophrenic. They have no coherent ideology. They turn morality upside down. They appeal exclusively to emotions. Burlesque and celebrity culture become politics. Depravity becomes morality. Atrocities and murder become heroism. Crime and fraud become justice. Greed and nepotism become civic virtues. What these cults stand for today, they condemn tomorrow. At the height of the reign of terror on May 6, 1794 during the French Revolution, Maximilien Robespierre announced that the Committee for Public Safety now recognized the existence of God. The French revolutionaries, fanatical atheists who had desecrated churches and confiscated church property, murdered hundreds of priests and forced another 30,000 into exile, instantly reversed themselves to send to the guillotine those who disparaged religion. In the end, exhausted by the moral confusion and internal contradictions, these crisis cults yearn for self-annihilation.</p>



<p>The French sociologist <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Emile-Durkheim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">Emile Durkheim</a> in his classic book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Suicide-Penguin-Classics-Emile-Durkheim-ebook/dp/B002RI9XE2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">On Suicide</a>” found that when social bonds are shattered, when a population no longer feels it has a place or meaning in a society, personal and collective acts of self-destruction proliferate. Societies are held together by a web of social bonds that give individuals a sense of being part of a collective and engaged in a project larger than the self. This collective expresses itself through rituals, such as elections and democratic participation or an appeal to patriotism, and shared national beliefs. The bonds provide meaning, a sense of purpose, status and dignity. They offer psychological protection from impending mortality and the meaninglessness that comes with being isolated and alone. The breaking of these bonds plunges individuals into deep psychological distress. Durkheim called this state of hopelessness and despair anomie, which he defined as “ruleless-ness.”</p>



<p>Ruleless-ness means the norms that govern a society and create a sense of organic solidarity no longer function. The belief, for example, that if we work hard, obey the law and get a good education we can achieve stable employment, social status and mobility along with financial security becomes a lie. The old rules, imperfect and often untrue for poor people of color, nevertheless were not a complete fiction in the United States. They offered some Americans — especially those from the white working and middle class — modest social and economic advancement. The disintegration of these bonds has unleashed a widespread malaise Durkheim would have recognized. The self-destructive pathologies that plague the United States — opioid addiction, gambling, suicide, sexual sadism, hate groups and mass shootings — are products of this anomie. So is our political dysfunction. My book, “<a href="http://freshstore.truthdig.com/america-the-farewell-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">America: The Farewell Tour</a>,” is an examination of these pathologies and the widespread anomie that defines American society.</p>



<p>The economic structures, even before the pandemic, were reconfigured to mock faith in a meritocracy and the belief that hard work leads to a productive and valued role in society. American <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+economic+productivity&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-1-ab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">productivity</a>, as The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/magazine/americans-jobs-poverty-homeless.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">pointed out</a>, has increased 77 percent since 1973 but hourly pay has grown only 12 percent. If the federal minimum wage was attached to productivity, the newspaper wrote, it would be more than $20 an hour now, not $7.25. Some 41.7 million workers, a third of the workforce, earn less than $12 an hour, and most of them do not have access to employer-sponsored health insurance. A decade after the 2008 financial meltdown, the Times wrote, the average middle class family’s net worth is more than $40,000 below what it was in 2007. The net worth of black families is down 40 percent, and for Latino families the figure has dropped 46 percent. Some four million evictions are filed each year. One in four tenant households spends <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Harvard_JCHS_Americas_Rental_Housing_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">about half its pretax income</a> …</p></div></div>

<p>Many prominent figures have attempted to answer the question of what, if anything, makes life meaningful, although they typically have not put it in these terms. Consider, for example, Aristotle on the human function, Aquinas on the beatific vision, and Kant on the highest good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what does it mean to live a meaningful life? This question has been posed by philosophers since ancient times. In his book On the Happiness of Man (c. 450 BCE), Plato asks whether there is any way we can be happy without achieving certain goals or desires. And in his dialogue Phaedo (c. 380 BCE) Socrates asks whether the pursuit of pleasure is always desirable; he concludes that it isn’t, and that happiness lies elsewhere. In the early modern period, William Godwin’s essay What Is Art? (1793) provides a classic formulation of this problem. More recently, existentialist thinkers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus have explored this issue through their writings about existence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, most contemporary philosophers do not address the question directly. Why is it that so few people seem to find life meaningful? To answer this question, I will focus on two main issues: (1) what makes something meaningful; and (2) how can we know what is important in our lives? My aim here is not to provide a comprehensive account of the nature of meaning. Rather, my goal is simply to identify those aspects of life that make us feel alive and happy.</p>



<p>Meaning in life can be thought of as the goal-directed behavior that we engage in as a result of making conscious choices. This concept has been debated by many philosophers, especially those in the existentialist tradition. However, the general idea is fairly intuitive: we all have a sense that our choices matter and that we can affect the world around us. Indeed, this idea is so intuitive that it is practically a tautology. So, what exactly is it about conscious choice that makes life meaningful?</p>



<p>One aspect of meaning in life is its ethical component. This follows from the fact that morality provides us with reasons for action. These reasons can be either moral or amoral, but either way they are the foundations upon which our actions and choices rest. There are three components to these reasons: facts, values, and obligation.</p>



<p>Our lives are governed by facts, and this is what gives rise to the distinction between the objective and subjective. For instance, it is a fact that it is currently Monday. This fact is objective since it is independent of human opinion; in other words, it would remain true whether or not anyone believed it to be true. It is also a fact that I am currently typing on my keyboard. However, facts can be divided into two categories: brute facts and institutional facts. Institutional facts are grounded in brute facts, but they also depend upon human agreement or consent for their veracity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, the fact that it is illegal to drive on the sidewalk is an institutional fact; this is made true by human agreement, but it would not be true unless people agreed or consented to this rule. By contrast, the fact that I have five fingers on my right hand is a brute fact; it is true whether or not humans believe it to be true. The distinction between brute facts and institutional facts is an important one, because many of our facts are institutional in nature. It is for this reason that we can question the meaning of our lives.</p>



<p>The meaning of life can be seen as a function of the facts that govern it. Some facts give meaning to our lives by giving it a purpose or goal; these facts are value-laden, and as such, they provide reasons for action. For instance, I might value health because I want to live a long and happy life. Other facts give meaning to our lives by imposing obligations upon us; for instance, I have a duty to pay my taxes because it is the law.</p>



<p>Meaning arises from the relationship between facts and values. Consider an example: many people value wealth, but the acquisition of wealth does not in itself give life meaning. Rather, it is the value that one places on wealth that imbues it with meaning. This value could be the result of an objective fact; for instance, one might acquire wealth in order to give to those who are poorer than themselves. In this case, acquiring wealth would be the means to an end, and that end would be the satisfaction of helping others. By contrast, one might acquire wealth without any intention of helping others; in this case, the value that one places on wealth would be the result of a subjective fact. It is important to note that this subjective fact need not be an opinion or a matter of preference; it could just as easily be something that one “just feels.”</p>



<p>Whatever the source, values provide reasons for action. These reasons are given validity by our choices and decisions. We can make choices and decisions based on facts alone, but this would not give meaning to our lives; it is the incorporation of values that gives meaning to our lives. In this way, we make meaning out of the world around us. Without values, life would be nothing more than a series of random and disconnected events. With values, life becomes a journey with a purpose.</p>



<p>In short, the meaning of life is found in the relationships between facts and values. If you wish to find your own meaning in life, then you must first determine what makes up your values. Then, you must determine how those facts relate to each other and ultimately to yourself. Once you have done so, you will know what it is that makes up your sense of self and thus what it is that defines your worth as a person.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <div>  <div> <p>In this post, we’re going to talk about zkSNARKs, which are a particular brand of Zero Knowledge Proof that’s becoming increasingly important in the blockchain space.</p> <p>We’ll cover how they’re used and what they’re useful for, and we’ll take a look at a basic zkSNARK in a SNARK-building language called Circom.</p>  <p>We assume that you’re encountered prime fields before, and remember their basic properties. If you can calculate \(4 \cdot 5 \equiv 6\) in \(\mathbb{F}_7\), you’re good to go.</p>  <p>A <em>zero knowledge protocol</em> is a protocol that allows you to prove that you know some specific mathematical fact, without revealing any information about the fact itself. The proof generated in a zero knowledge protocol is called a <em>zero knowledge proof</em>.</p> <p>Some examples of “mathematical facts” that we can create zero knowledge proofs for include things like:</p> <ul> <li>Knowledge of a three-coloring of a graph (i.e. I know a three-coloring of this publicly-known graph, and I’ll prove that I know it without showing you the coloring)</li> <li>Knowledge of the discrete logarithm of some residue modulo \(p\) (i.e. given public generator \(g\), public modulus \(p\), and some residue \(y\), I know \(x\) such that \(g^x \equiv y\) modulo \(p\))</li> <li>Knowledge of a private key corresponding to a publicly-known public key</li> </ul> <p>The idea of a zero knowledge protocol might seem paradoxical at first glance: how can I prove I know something without showing you the thing that I know? However, it turns out that we actually use zero knowledge protocols all the time! For example, familiar tools like digital signatures are actually zero knowledge proofs. By signing a message, I prove that I know the private key that corresponds to a widely-known public key, but I don’t give away any information about the private key itself. In fact, public-key encryption only works because it is a zero knowledge protocol; if signatures revealed information about your private key, then malicious actors would be able to impersonate you by analyzing your signatures and recovering your private key.</p> <p>Slightly more formally, suppose that you’ve computed \(f(\cdot) = y\) for some publicly known function \(f\) and some secret input \(\cdot\). A zero-knowledge protocol for the function \(f\) would allow you to prove to others that you know a secret input to \(f\) that results in \(y\), without revealing this secret input \(\cdot\).</p> <p>For more on ZKPs, check out <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/11/27/zero-knowledge-proofs-illustrated-primer/">this post</a>.</p>  <p>Like we mentioned above, ZKPs are protocols that allow you to prove knowledge of a specific mathematical fact: discrete log, knowledge of private key, knowledge of three-coloring, etc. However, it’s important to note that early ZKPs only allowed you to prove one kind of mathematical fact at the time. That is, cryptographers developed one protocol which you could use to prove knowledge of discrete log, another protocol which you could use to prove knowledge of three-coloring, and another protocol for digital signatures. But what if we want to generate zero knowledge proofs for arbitrary mathematical functions? For example - what if I want a zero knowledge protocol that would allow me to prove that I know the pre-image of a SHA256 hash output? It would be intractable if, for every use case, I had to go to a cryptographer and ask them to custom-write me a new protocol.</p> <p>zkSNARKs solve this problem. A zkSNARK is a gadget that can be used to generate a ZKP for any mathematical function. Basically, you feed the “code” of a function \(f\) into a zkSNARK, and the SNARK creates a protocol that allows you to generate zero-knowledge proofs for \(f\).</p> <p>As an example, say we have a fake “hash” function \(h(x) = x^3 - x + 7\) that we’d like to generate zero knowledge proofs for. First, we can use a zkSNARK to generate a ZKP for \(h\). Then, we can use this generated ZKP to prove claims like “I know a value \(\cdot\) such that \(h(\cdot) = 67\)” - <em>without revealing \(\cdot\)</em>. zkSNARKs also guarantee that this process is “succinct” and “non-interactive”: we can create this proof in linear time, and others can verify it in constant time, without needing to ask additional questions of us (the prover). Together, these properties form a zkSNARK: a <em>Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge</em>.</p> <p>These properties makes SNARKs useful for blockchain applications, where users can create proofs locally, and then upload short proofs for constant-time verification inside a smart contract, where computation is expensive.</p>  <p>A central mechanic in Dark Forest is that the cryptographic “fog of war.” The fog of war ensures that you don’t automatically know where all players, planets, and other points of interests are in the universe; you have to spend computational resources to discover them. This mechanic is secured by zkSNARKs.</p> <p>In a universe with a fog of war, the locations of all players are private and hidden from each other. This means that players don’t upload the coordinates of their planets to the Ethereum blockchain, which can be publicly inspected. Instead, each player uploads the hash of their location to the blockchain. This ensures that players stay “committed” to a specific location, but also that the location can’t be determined from inspection of the Ethereum data layer.</p> <p>Without zkSNARKs, there’s an obvious attack vector - if a player uploads a random string of bytes that doesn’t correspond to a real and valid location, and the integrity of the game is broken. To prevent this, Dark Forest requires players to submit zkSNARKs with every move to ensure that players are indeed submitting hashes corresponding to valid coordinates that they have knowledge of.</p> <p>When players make moves, they’re also required to submit ZK proofs that their moves are “valid” - you can’t move too far or too fast. Without zkSNARKs, a malicious player could make illegal “teleport” moves by claiming that the hash they are moving from is next to the hash they’re moving to, even if the two locations are actually on opposite sides of the universe. Once again, requiring ZK proofs keeps players honest. To use a chess analogy, the required ZK proofs basically tell the contract, “I’m moving my knight; I’m not going to tell you where I moved my knight from, or where I moved it to, but this proof proves that it did in fact move in a legal L-shape.”</p> <p>We’ll dive deeper into the Dark Forest construction and SNARKs in a future blog post!</p>  <p>Like we mentioned above, SNARKs are gadgets which take in a function and output a ZKP for said function. So how do we “feed” a function to a SNARK?</p> <p>SNARKs functions are written as circuits in the Circom language. Here’s an example circuit for our “fake” hash function, \(h(x) = x^3 - x + 7\).</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// file: circuit.circom</span>

<span>template</span> <span>BadHash</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>signal</span> <span>private</span> <span>input</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
    <span>signal</span> <span>x_squared</span><span>;</span>
    <span>signal</span> <span>x_cubed</span><span>;</span>
    <span>signal</span> <span>output</span> <span>out</span><span>;</span>

    <span>x_squared</span> <span>&lt;==</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
    <span>x_cubed</span> <span>&lt;==</span> <span>x_squared</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
    <span>out</span> <span>&lt;==</span> <span>x_cubed</span> <span>-</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>7</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>component</span> <span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>BadHash</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Our zkSNARK takes in this circuit, chews it up, and spits out a <em>proving key</em> and a <em>verifying key</em>. The proving key allows a prover who is computing <code>BadHash(x) = out</code> to generate a proof that they do indeed know the pre-image of <code>out</code>. The verifying key allows anyone to inspect that proof, along with <code>out</code>, and conclude that the prover did honestly carry out the computation with a known secret input.</p> <p>Concretely, suppose that the prover computes <code>BadHash(4) = 67</code>. The prover publishes their proof, along with <code>out = 67</code>, to the verifier; however, they do not publish the secret input <code>x = 4</code>. The verifier of this proof knows the source code of the <code>BadHash</code> circuit, and also receives <code>out = 67</code> and a proof from the prover. The verifier can then inspect the proof to verify that the prover did indeed compute some valid x, x_squared, and x_cubed to arrive at <code>out</code>. However, the verifier won’t know the specific values that the prover used (<code>x = 4</code>, <code>x_squared = 16</code>, <code>x_cubed = 64</code>) - just that these values were computed correctly.</p> <p>There are two things which make SNARK circuits different from normal “functions” that we’re used to.</p> <p>First, you’ll notice that BadHash only uses three operations: multiplication, addition, and subtraction. At the base level, SNARK constraints are limited to only these operations. There are ways to do operations like division and modulo, but they all ultimately involve breaking operations down into sums and products. The fact that we’re limited to these operations is part of what makes SNARK programming thorny.</p> <p>The second challenge is that each signal in a SNARK is an element of a prime field, and all operations happen inside that prime field. The most obvious implication of this is that there is no native notion of decimals, fractions, negative numbers, or numbers bigger than 77 digits. If you want one of these, you have to make them out of positive integers smaller than <code>p</code>. Another implication is that our operators “wrap around”: the result of <code>3 - 5</code> is <code>p - 2</code>, which is a 77 digit number. The prime is large enough (254) that most of the time this doesn’t matter, but occasionally it can cause subtle correctness bugs.</p> <p>To actually make proofs, we use a library called <a href="https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs">SnarkJS</a>, built by Jordi Baylina and Iden3. <code>SnarkJS</code> uses your circuit to generate proving and verification code in JavaScript and Solidity, as well as protocol paramters and proving and verification keys. This is out of the scope of this post, but you can find a tutorial on it <a href="https://github.com/iden3/circom/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md">here</a>.</p> <p>In the next posts, we’ll talk about the execution model of SNARKs, including the difference between calculation and constraint, and how to do operations like division and modulo.</p> </div> </div>  </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Vue-next (Vue 3) has been out for a while. It is now under release candidate stage which means there won't be big changes on the open APIs. Good to see that Vue has already been stabilized and ready to waltz into our projects.</p><p>I have to say that Vue 2 is already amazing enough. But with Vue 3's new features, it's likely to upgrade our projects to an upper level. I guess the most thrilling feature in Vue 3 would be the composition APIs. Evan You himself mentioned that the composition APIs are inspired by the React hooks. Even though the two APIs hooks and compositions are a lot alike, but from the code base they are completely different. Let's not discuss which is better or promising because I don't really think either framework outraces another.</p><p>In all, it's so happy to see that Vue can also do what React does. Let's have a close look at the new features.</p><p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p><h2 id="1-vite"><a href="#1-vite">1.

(For example, data formatting / calculation etc).</p><p>Let's see how Vue 3 doc explains why <code>filters</code> is removed:</p><blockquote><p>While this seems like a convenience, it requires a custom syntax that breaks the assumption of expressions inside of curly braces being "just JavaScript," which has both learning and implementation costs.</p></blockquote><p>I believe it's nothing bad for development without the <code>filters</code>, even though it may cost you extra time on migrating to Vue 3. In my projects, the appearance of <code>filters</code> is pretty a rare case since I could replace such functionality with a <code>method</code> or <code>computed</code> easily.

August 11, 2020 | https://materialize.io/why-use-a-materialized-view/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://materialize.io/why-use-a-materialized-view/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TL;DR: </strong>Querying materialized views, unlike querying tables or logical views, can reduce query costs by maintaining results in memory that are only updated when necessary. To learn more, check out the rest of the post!</p>
<h2><b>The Cost of Querying</b></h2>
<p>Each time you query a database you incur some cost. Your database will parse, validate, plan, optimize, and execute your query, using up wall clock time, CPU time, memory, opportunity cost, and, potentially, actual dollars. As you grow your application, you will likely wonder how you can reduce these costs.</p>
<p>To dig into this, let’s look at an example. Imagine you work at a company that sells widgets. Each time a widget is sold, you record some purchase information in a <code>purchase</code> table that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-300x117.jpg" data-src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-300x117.jpg" alt="" width="454" height="177" data-srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-300x117.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-1024x401.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-768x301.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-1536x601.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-2048x802.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-300x117.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-1024x401.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-768x301.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-1536x601.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-2048x802.jpg 2048w"></p>
<p>With this data, you can answer questions that are critical to your business: what’s our best selling widget? Which widgets need to be shipped today? And, the evergreen question: how much money have we made?</p>
<p>Each of these questions can be answered by querying the <code>purchase</code> table directly. For example, you could calculate your total revenue with the following query:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-300x71.jpg" data-src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-300x71.jpg" alt="" width="453" height="107" data-srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-300x71.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-1024x242.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-768x182.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-1536x363.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-2048x484.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-300x71.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-1024x242.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-768x182.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-1536x363.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-2048x484.jpg 2048w"></p>
<p>When this query is run, your database will scan each row of the <code>purchase</code> table to aggregate the values in the <code>amount</code> column. Your database will have spent <code>X</code> resources to return your result. (As mentioned before, <code>X</code> is comprised of wall clock time, CPU time, memory, opportunity cost, and dollars.)</p>
<p>The good news is you’re happy to pay <code>X</code> because this information is important and valuable to your business. <strong>The bad news is that you will pay <code>X</code> each time</strong> <strong>your query is run</strong>. Because queries against tables and views do not reference previous results, they are forced to completely recalculate their results each time.<b></b></p>
<p>You might be wondering: is this a big deal? If your query is exploratory, ad hoc, or infrequent, it’s probably not. But what if you suddenly needed to calculate total revenue once an hour instead of once a day? Or once a second?</p>

<p>Suddenly, even a small <code>X</code> starts to feel expensive. As your queries are run more frequently, process more data, or perform more complex computation, these costs may even feel prohibitive. So, what can you do instead?</p>
<h2><b>Materialized Views</b></h2>
<p>Unlike queries that calculate their results from tables and views, queries that read from materialized views do not recalculate their results each time. To understand why, let’s create a materialized view together.</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-300x63.jpg" data-src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-300x63.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="102" data-srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-300x63.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-1024x215.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-768x161.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-1536x323.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-2048x430.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-300x63.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-1024x215.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-768x161.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-1536x323.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-2048x430.jpg 2048w"></p>
<p>When this statement is executed, your database will run your query once to calculate the result. Then, it will physically store that result in a newly created database object — in our case an object named <code>total_revenue</code>. Now when you query <code>total_revenue</code>, your database will return the results stored in <code>total_revenue</code> without performing any additional computation.</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-300x104.jpg" data-src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-300x104.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="208" data-srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-300x104.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-1024x355.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-768x267.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-1536x533.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-2048x711.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-300x104.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-1024x355.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-768x267.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-1536x533.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-2048x711.jpg 2048w"></p>
<p>This means that unlike querying a view directly, you only pay the cost of your query once when creating a materialized view.* Future queries will pay some constant cost <code>1</code> to read from <code>total_revenue</code>, instead of <code>X</code>.</p>
<p>This seems like a perfect solution for our problem, so what’s the catch? Why don’t we use materialized views for everything?</p>
<h2><b>Two Catches*</b></h2>
<p>The first catch is that you pay for materialized views with memory. While materialized views physically storing prior results reduces your query cost from <code>X</code> to <code>1</code>, it also requires memory that was not required to simply query a table or a logical view.</p>
<p>The second, trickier catch surfaces when a new purchase is added to the <code>purchase</code> table. To illustrate, let’s walk through this scenario together.</p>

<p>Noticing that we have a new sale in our <code>purchase</code> table, we query our materialized view for our updated total revenue. But, we get back our old value. What gives?</p>

<p>When we created our materialized view, our database ran our query once to store the results in <code>total_revenue</code>. However, since the query was run&nbsp;<em>before</em> the newest purchase was added to the <code>purchase</code> table, the result calculated and stored in <code>total_revenue</code> does not take this new purchase into account. To update the result to include new purchases, you will have to&nbsp;<strong>refresh</strong> the materialized view. Generally, there are two mechanisms for refreshing materialized views: complete refreshes or incremental refreshes.</p>
<p>Complete refreshes rerun the query underlying a materialized view to completely recalculate and replace the stored results. Just like queries against tables and views, every complete refresh will cost <code>X</code>. To complicate matters, you will have to decide <em>when</em> to perform a refresh: when someone queries the view? Once an hour? Once a week? You will want to choose a cadence that does not force the database to do unnecessary work. For example, you don’t want to pay <code>X</code> recompute <code>total_revenue</code> if there are no new purchases. In real world systems, users will have to choose a refresh schedule that maintains a careful balance between data freshness requirements and acceptable query costs.</p>
<p>By contrast, incremental refreshes keep materialized views up to date by only performing work only on data that has changed. To return to our example, instead of rescanning each row of the <code>purchase</code> table to calculate the sum, an incrementally maintained materialized view would only do the following work:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-300x143.jpg" data-src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-300x143.jpg" alt="" width="449" height="214" data-srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-300x143.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-1024x487.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-768x365.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-1536x730.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-2048x973.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-300x143.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-1024x487.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-768x365.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-1536x730.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-2048x973.jpg 2048w"></p>
<p>This means that instead of paying <code>X</code> to refresh the view, your database will only pay a fraction of <code>X</code> proportional to the size of the changed data. And, because this refresh mechanism is triggered by changes in the underlying data, you can be certain that your database is refreshing your view no more than necessary. In our example, <code>total_revenue</code> will only be updated when a row in the <code>purchase</code> table is inserted, updated, or deleted.</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p>Creating and maintaining a materialized view can reduce the query costs paid for expensive or frequently run queries. However, the potential cost reduction of a materialized view greatly depends on its underlying refresh mechanism. Only incremental refreshes can reduce the per-refresh cost of maintaining a materialized view while also ensuring that views are updated no more than necessary.</p>
<p>While incremental refreshes are available in a handful of databases, they often come with a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/DWHSG/basicmv.htm#GUID-505C24CF-5D56-4820-88AA-2221410950E7">long list of restrictions</a>. At the moment, Materialize is the only system that supports incremental maintained materialized views without restriction.

I started noticing the performance bottlenecks started when I tried to run Wordpress on it, where a single page load of a newly installed Wordpress blog takes about <strong>10 seconds!</strong> Nevertheless, all that was unsurprising given the measly single-core 700MHz processor on each node.</p><p>At that point in time, I've graduated from university then and secured a job as a Data Scientist + Full-Stack Engineer at a startup and I thought to myself:</p><blockquote>What better a time to build myself a new cluster?</blockquote><h2 id="kraken">Kraken</h2><p>The second cluster was named <em>Kraken</em>.</p><blockquote>The <strong>kraken</strong> (/ˈkrɑːkən/)[1] is a legendary cephalopod-like sea monster of gigantic size in Scandinavian folklore. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken">Wikipedia</a>)</blockquote><p>The Kraken is basically a much bigger and monstrous octopus, hence the name, symbolizing an evolution of the first cluster. It was built out of 7 Raspberry Pi 3Bs powered by a single USB charger. </p><p>With my first pay check, I had initially intended to <em>finally</em> build a cluster of 8 nodes but once again I was unable to realize this <em>cursed</em> idea. The maximum number of ports on a consumer-grade network switch was 8, enough for 7 nodes and a cable to the router. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

Raspberry Pi 3Bs run on the <em>armv7</em> &nbsp;CPU architecture, which happens to be the current lowest common denominator among Arm processors today. </p><p>Latest Arm processors (<em>arm64</em>) are backward-compatible with all code written and compiled on <em>armv7</em>. In contrast, <em>arm64 </em>processors are not backward-compatible with <em>armv6</em> processors (Raspberry Pi 1 and 2), so they are essentially in the process of being phased out from the community.</p><p>Secondly, this cluster would be perfect for most but the most bandwidth demanding applications, from hosting your own blog, file sync service, media library managers, link-shorteners, note-taking applications and so on. The only time it would not perform as intended is when your application demands heavy sustained writes, such as when encoding videos, given the USB 2.0 bus bottlenecks in the Raspberry Pi 3, which is resolved only in Raspberry Pi 4.</p><p>All in all, building a Raspberry Pi 3 cluster is, in my opinion, the most cost-effective way of learning Docker and clustering in general, and will remain so in the foreseeable future. So if you are just getting into Docker, I'd highly recommend this build.</p><h2 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h2><p>In my next post in this series, I shall introduce the <em>Leviathan</em> cluster which I have built specifically for high I/O applications, capable of real-time video transcoding and streaming of HEVC -&gt; h264 videos.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I love the book Rich Dad Poor Dad. It was my fav growing up. Since then, I've founded several startups, was employee #3 at a $65m VC firm in SF, and realized that there is a similar phenomenon to what Robert Kiyosaki is talking about in Rich Dad Poor Dad currently occurring in Silicon Valley.</p><p>‍</p><p>Let's tastefully call this phenomenon: <strong>Rich Founder Poor Founder.</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>The point of entrepreneurship is freedom. Yes it’s to build cool shit and innovate and all that, but at the end of the day the sort of person who becomes an entrepreneur is usually doing it because they want freedom to control their day and work on the things they care about.</p><p>‍</p><p>A lot of people go out and start their first business and try to make it a venture backed startup. That’s the wrong move. That’s like going to the gym and trying to bench 250 lbs on day one. It’s not that you can’t build up to that, it’s just not the right move today. I think the right move is to start a business that can make you $100k+ per year in profit. It doesn’t matter if it can’t scale past that, it’s about building that foundation to give you the freedom to try new things. Fail at those new things and it doesn’t matter as you have that financial foundation. It could be something as simple as a consulting or a services business, or a digital product like a course, newsletter or subscription podcast. Anything that is high margin, simple and enabled by the internet.</p><p>‍</p><p>VC’s may shit on lifestyle businesses but at the end of the day they collect a 2% yearly management fee regardless of their success and typically have a great lifestyle (once their fund size is above $100m AUM).</p><p>‍</p><p>Ask yourself what’s an easier path to wealth and freedom?</p><p>‍</p><p>‍<strong>Path 1: Venture backed startup</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>90% chance of $0.</p><p>‍</p><p>Small personal income until scale, IPO or liquidity event.</p><p>‍</p><p>Massive dilution. Most founders end up owning 5%-20%. $500m market cap = $25m-$100m for founder(s).</p><p>‍</p><p>OR</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Path 2: Lifestyle business</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>50% - 75% chance of success.</p><p>‍</p><p>Pay yourself whatever you want out of profits over time.</p><p>‍</p><p>If you can bootstrap your way to $300k/yr in profit and invest half of that ($150k/yr) at 10%/yr for 20 years = $9.6m + $150k/yr salary to enjoy your life with your family and friends. After 20 years, you can choose to sell that business or automate it and let it ride but with $9.6m invested in a conservative portfolio paying out 5% annually = $480k/year in interest or $40k/mo for you to live off without ever touching the principal nor sacrificing quality of life.</p></div><div><p>‍</p><p><strong>The definition of rich</strong> is having passive income that’s greater than your burn. I’m pretty sure we can all comfortably live off $40k/mo without ever having to leave the house.</p><p>‍</p><p>But wait this isn’t a fair analysis as venture backed startups typically reach scale or a liquidity event in 10 years and you did 20 years for the lifestyle business. Fair, I’m sure after 10 years most of us can comfortably live off $20k ish/mo without ever having to work or touch the principal investment.</p><p>‍</p><p>Most entrepreneurs start with one goal in mind: freedom. If you value freedom, you should have one goal for your first company, and that’s to build a lifestyle business that can produce $100k+/yr of personal income. It can be boring and it doesn’t have to scale. It sets yourself up for the foreseeable future and then you can afford to take big swings. Forget startups. Forget venture capital. Build something that gets you in the game and makes you a living first.‍</p><p>‍</p><p>I think VCs may underestimate the extent to which mainstream entrepreneurship is a key input to outliers and moonshots. So many successful billionaire founders had a “never worry about rent again” moment via an exit in a much more boring business before swinging for a home run.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Elon Musk</strong> — before sending rockets into space and revolutionizing the auto-industry, Elon Musk was broke building Zip2 (online city guides for newspapers) before he netted $22m on the sale. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/19/how-elon-musk-founded-zip2-with-his-brother-kimbal.html">Source</a></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Patrick &amp; John Collison</strong> — built Auctimatic: auction management software for small Ebay sellers, and sold it for $5m before going on to found Stripe, valued at $36b. <a href="https://www.startupgrind.com/blog/the-collison-brothers-and-story-behind-the-founding-of-stripe/">Source</a></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Mark Cuban</strong> — Before building and selling<a href="http://broadcast.com/"> Broadcast.com</a> for $5.7b and buying the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban built a services business called MicroSolutions and sold it for $6m. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban">Source</a></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Mike Bloomberg</strong> — now worth $60b, Mike Bloomberg had a nice “never think about rent again” exit at 39 when Salomon was acquired by Phibro in 1981; he received $10 million. Bloomberg said “The Salomon Brothers did me the two greatest favours in my life. They hired me and they fired me.” <a href="https://twitter.com/NeckarValue/status/1277633665099595776">Source</a></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Daniel Ek</strong> — Spotify isn’t Ek’s first success. Daniel Ek became a self-made millionaire at age 23, before even putting a single thought into Spotify. At 23, Daniel Ek “retired” after he sold his online marketing company Advertigo to Swedish digital marketing firm TradeDoubler in a deal worth $1.25 million.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Alex Tew</strong> — started the <a href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/">Million Dollar Homepage</a> to raise money for his university education. He sold 1 million pixels on a 1000 x 1000 pixel grid on his website for $1 per pixel. He ended up making $1,037,100 USD before founding the billion dollar meditation app, <a href="https://www.calm.com/">Calm</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Austin Allred</strong> — co-authored the growth hacking textbook <em>Secret Sauce</em>, which became a best-seller and provided him the personal seed money to build Lambda School, valued over $150m.</p><p>‍</p><p>And countless others: Ev Williams (Blogger), Pincus (freeloader, support.com, tribe), Travis Kalanick (Red Swoosh), Stewart Butterfield (Flickr), Jason Fried &amp; DHH (37 Signals services business) etc.</p><p>‍</p><p>All of these entrepreneurs built more of a lifestyle business or had a smaller liquidity event before they built a rocket (figuratively and literally for Elon). There is no greater security than knowing that no matter what risks you take, you have a business or enough cash in the bank to pay for your livelihood.</p><p>‍</p><p>If you start by building a lifestyle business it will force you to build a product or offer a service that customers actually want. It forces you to create a monetization plan and it forces you to build a real business. By starting a lifestyle business it forces you to create something you’re passionate about and build an actual business that will actually help attract VC if that’s the path you choose to go down.</p><p>‍</p><p>Renowned value investor and Warren Buffett mentor, Ben Graham, once said: “In the short-run, the stock market is a voting machine. But in the long-run, it is a weighing machine.” AKA in the short term the market may value hype and narrative, but in the long term it always values real traction, revenue, earnings and margins.</p><p>‍</p><p>We’re seeing this play out in the venture market today. In the last few years you may have heard startups raising at eyebrow lifting valuations and hiring large masses of employees. But behind the curtain their P&amp;L is fucked! They have little to fuck all for revenue and huge expenses.</p><p>‍</p><p>Founders often get attached to valuations and forget that when they sell the business, the weighing machine is the only thing that matters. The buyer has to have a way to pay themselves back, either via earnings, a future sale or strategic synergies.</p><p>‍</p><p>Your venture valuation is irrelevant. Venture valuations aren’t backed by fundamentals and their funds have been compared to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHUQ7QxS-e4">ponzi scheme</a>. Build a lifestyle business where results, traction, revenue, margins and earnings are the things that matter because at the end of the day, the numbers have to work with the weighing machine.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you’re bootstrapping, you can still take advantage of venture capital by using all the VC subsidized software available on the market.</p><p>‍</p><p>The internet is the greatest leveler of access to entrepreneurship society has ever seen. There is far too much focus on raising venture capital and creating 100–1000x outcomes and not nearly enough on leveraging the internet to empower entrepreneurs to build profitable and sustainable software-enabled lifestyle businesses.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>TL;DR </strong>'Rich Founder' is someone who creates a sustainable 'lifestyle business' with a high probability of success. 'Poor Founder' is someone who thinks they need to raise venture capital, a fancy office, big staff and a bunch of resources to succeed. Rich Founder has a probability of success and enjoys his/her life. Poor Founder is miserable and might as well go to a Casino and put it all down on Red 5.</p><p>‍</p><p>Here's a <a href="https://community.gradschool.co/">free community</a> and <a href="https://www.gradschool.co/">resource hub</a> to help more people become 'Rich Founders'.</p><p>‍</p><p>-James Skylor - Founder, GradSchool</p></div></div>]]>

<h3>Safety and efficacy</h3>
<p>After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic Russian researchers extracted a fragment of genetic material from novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2, which codes information about the structure of the spike S-protein, which forms the virus’ “crown” and is responsible for connection with human cells. They inserted it into a familiar adenovirus vector for delivery into a human cell creating the world’s first COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>In order to ensure lasting immunity Russian scientists came up with a breakthrough idea to use two different types of adenovirus vectors (rAd26 and rAd5) for the first and second vaccination, boosting the effect of the vaccine.</p>
<p>The use of human adenoviruses as vectors is safe because these viruses, which cause the common cold, are not novel and have been around for thousands of years.</p> </div>

				<p><em> Caroline Rodewig and Garrett McGrath are members of FlightAware's Flight Tracking Wing. As lead for the Predictive Technology Crew, Caroline works to expand the scope and quality of our predictive applications. Garrett is the lead for the Aviation Platform Crew and responsible for the performance, reliability and observability of multi-machine Hyperfeed. </em></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="monitoringhyperfeedthehistoryandchallengesofadistributedsystem">Monitoring Hyperfeed: The History and Challenges of a Distributed System</h2>
<p>The Aviation Platform crew (for an explanation of crews and wings,<a href="https://flightaware.engineering/crews-wings-and-alliances-part-1-the-principles-of-how-we-work/" target="_see this blog post"> see this blog post</a>) revolves around the performance and reliability of Hyperfeed<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. Hyperfeed is FlightAware’s core flight tracking engine. Its output powers the company’s most salient offerings: the <a href="https://flightaware.com/live/flight/ABW140" target="_blank"> flight pages</a> on the website, <a href="https://flightaware.com/commercial/firehose/" target="_blank">Firehose</a>, <a href="https://flightaware.com/commercial/flightxml/">FlightXML</a>, and <a href="https://flightaware.com/commercial/premium/">flight alerts</a>. So if Hyperfeed stops working, so does much of FlightAware. Given the impact of a Hyperfeed outage, we need to know immediately if something goes—or might go—wrong so that we can act swiftly and precisely to remedy the situation. For maintaining the requisite accuracy and timeliness of Hyperfeed’s output, we rely heavily on monitoring<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. To that end, we have recently begun adopting Prometheus, a time-series metrics database, and Grafana, a powerful visualization platform. The introduction of these tools marks a significant upgrade and improvement to Hyperfeed’s current monitoring stack. It is hoped that by sharing our experience and the reasons for adoption that we can help inform the decision-making of others in an analogous situation.</p>
<p>Before discussing Prometheus and the many enhancements it brings to our monitoring of Hyperfeed, it helps to provide some context by examining what we currently use and how it has evolved over time. In its current form, Hyperfeed is a distributed system composed of a constellation of more than a dozen components and sub-systems spread across multiple machines for performance and fault-tolerance. Its sub-systems include a number of other well-known services: Postgres, Zookeeper, Kafka, and RabbitMQ. It wasn’t always like this, though. When I started working on Hyperfeed in 2016, it was not distributed; its components all ran on a single machine (this is not strictly true as it also used a Postgres database running on a separate server). Naturally, monitoring at that time was relatively less complex: it had markedly less surface area to cover. We were able to do the job effectively with a combination of custom, in-house tools and a heavy dose of Zabbix.</p>
<p>Our custom monitoring tools mostly consisted of some scripts that followed Hyperfeed’s output and its logging statements looking for problems, e.g., the output has stopped completely, the output is out of date, or an excess number of tracebacks happened. These tools were specific to Hyperfeed and did not generalize well to other software. Zabbix, on the other hand, has been FlightAware’s primary monitoring and alerting framework. It is used throughout the company and not specific to any piece of software. When applied to Hyperfeed, Zabbix monitored some key characteristics of the server running the application such as CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. Moreover, the aforementioned custom tools fed their data into Zabbix so that they could be used for alerting an engineer if something went haywire. On top of that, Zabbix gave us a basic web interface for viewing the data it collected in a graphical format. Back when Hyperfeed fit snugly on a single server, this sort of monitoring served us well: Zabbix was a one-stop shop for all things monitoring. But as the demands placed on Hyperfeed grew, so did its operational complexity.</p>
<p>Eventually, a single-machine architecture was not enough to handle the increased volume of Hyperfeed’s input, which was precipitated by FlightAware acquiring <a href="https://flightaware.com/commercial/aireon/" target="_blank">new data sources</a>, and expanding its <a href="https://flightaware.com/adsb/" target="_blank">existing data sources</a>. In order to accommodate this change in scale, it was necessary to distribute Hyperfeed across multiple machines. When this happened, we continued using (and still do use) custom tools and Zabbix for monitoring. Our custom tools, though, and the data we send to Zabbix necessarily expanded, too. Although distributing Hyperfeed across multiple machines was necessary and improved the performance and reliability of the system, it also brought with it new challenges and difficulties, particularly in terms of monitoring<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Given their origin, our custom tools were not designed with a distributed setting in mind. As such, they lacked the ability to easily aggregate data across multiple machines and were somewhat cumbersome to operate as Hyperfeed’s architecture progressed. In addition, Zabbix started creaking and revealing some rough edges as we placed more demands on it. A core issue was that Zabbix does really well at monitoring particular machines but not as well at system or application level monitoring, especially in a context where services can move around from machine to machine as failures occur or as an intentional part of the design. In a distributed setting, it also imposes non-trivial operational burdens, e.g., when adding new monitoring points or spreading the collection load across machines. Moreover, Zabbix combines all monitoring functions into a single monolith rather than the current best practice of loosely coupling monitoring tasks like collecting data, long-term storage, querying data, alerting with deduplication and aggregation, and visualization/dashboarding (for further details on monitoring system best practices, see the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/monitoring/" target="_blank">Google SRE workbook’s monitoring chapter</a>).</p>
<p>As Hyperfeed moved to a distributed architecture, a change driven by business demands and an increased volume of flight tracking data, it became clear that our monitoring tools, while mostly satisfactory in alerting us when something failed in the system, neglected to provide us with many of the other benefits that monitoring can offer. In particular, we were weak in whitebox monitoring and visualization<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>.Whitebox monitoring is especially important for analyzing long-term trends, comparing experimental groups, and in guiding capacity planning and other engineering decision making. Some information can only come from the vantage point provided by whitebox monitoring. For visualization we had Zabbix, but its capabilities there are fairly limited and inflexible. Given all of this, we started looking for a new solution to fill in the gaps in our monitoring approach, something designed for dynamic, distributed systems. We chose Prometheus and Grafana. This combo of tools addresses the shortcomings of our current approach, and also brings with it a number of additional virtues.</p>
<h2 id="upgradingmonitoringwithprometheusandgrafana">Upgrading Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana</h2>
<h3 id="prometheustimeseriesmetrics">Prometheus: Time-Series Metrics</h3>
<p>In an idealized monitoring practice, every event or state of a system is recorded so that it is available if needed: no detail is left out. Unfortunately, this only works in a hypothetical, theoretical scenario since it is impossible to store, process, and work with the quantity of data generated continuously by modern systems. Instead of capturing everything, one must grapple with what to monitor: how to turn the endless torrent of events in a system into something comprehensible, manageable, and actionable. To this end, Prometheus provides time-series metrics, which track aggregations of events in a system over some period of time, where an event refers to anything that might occur and can be quantified or measured. Some example events include a function getting called, CPU usage going up, a web request being made, a client connecting to a service or a cache hit happens.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> Fundamentally, the monitoring offered by Prometheus periodically takes a snapshot of some of the events in a system, typically measuring how often or how quickly each event occurred. The value of a snapshot at any given point is often of less interest than its relative value: how the frequency of an event changes over time provides the actionable insight and value of metrics-based monitoring. To make this more concrete, in the case of flight tracking some example time-series metrics of interest might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Departures per second</li>
<li>Arrivals per day</li>
<li>Cancellations per minute</li>
<li>Diversions per hour</li>
<li>Flight plans created per second</li>
<li>Input messages processed per second</li>
<li>Output messages generated per second</li>
<li>99th percentile of the time taken to process an ADS-B position over the last 6 months</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in order to keep the amount of data captured manageable, the contents of the input messages that trigger each of these events get aggregated away. With metrics, the rate of departures, for example, are measured throughout the system, but any single departure cannot be investigated. As succinctly summarized by <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitoring-101-collecting-data/" target="_blank">Datadog</a>, metrics provide “the big, broad-stroke measures that can help you quickly answer the most pressing questions about a system’s internal health and performance.“ Metrics can also capture resource utilization, like CPU, memory, or disk, and metadata like code revisions and configuration values. Time-series metrics, despite necessarily omitting a lot of detail, are still quite versatile, yielding practicable monitoring data for critical activities throughout a system.</p>
<h3 id="dataandoperationalmodel">Data and Operational Model</h3>
<p>One of Prometheus’ main selling points is that it provides a powerful and conceptually straightforward data model for extracting metrics from a system of interest and tracking their rate of change over time. Each time-series metric tracked by Prometheus includes the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metric name: a string indicating what the metric is for, e.g., <code>hyperfeed_departures_total</code>.</li>
<li>Help documentation: a string describing what the metric is for or where it comes from.</li>
<li>Metric type: four types are provided, but two of them provide the atomic building blocks of the others. The fundamental types are counters, which can only go up or reset, and gauges, which can be set to any value.</li>
<li>Labels: key-value pairs attaching additional dimensions to the metric. Labels …</li></ul></section></div></article></div></div>

<p>Sixty years ago this week — on August 12, 1960 — Dr. Seuss published what would become his biggest-selling book of all time. Written as the result of a $50 bet between Seuss and his friend and publisher at Random House, Bennett Cerf, the book, by some estimates, has sold north of 200 million copies.*</p>



<p>The book? <em>Green Eggs and Ham.</em></p>



<p>When I discuss <em>Becoming Dr. Seuss </em>with audiences, Seuss fans tell me they have warm memories of this one; it’s the book that taught them how to read, or it’s the first book they received as a gift — or, as grown-ups, it’s a book they can still quote and recite word-for-word. And it <em>is </em>a great book–but it’s an important one, too, both in the Seuss library and in the overall oeuvre of children’s literature. There’s a lot going on between its colorful orange boards, the result of sweat, inspiration, and no small amount of luck. But to truly appreciate how smart, and how important <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> is, we need to go back a few years before its 1960 publication to get some background and some context. </p>

<p>Let’s start, then, by checking in with this May 1954 issue of LIFE magazine (that’s comedic actress Kaye Ballard on the cover, by the way, who was burning up Broadway in the musical <em>The Golden Apple</em> and would later make an appearance on <em>The Muppet Show</em>) which features an article by Pulitzer Prize winning novelist John Hersey titled, “Why Do Students Bog Down on the First ‘R’?” The cover text teases the article as  “Why Can’t My Child Read?” but the gist is the same: namely, Hersey was discouraged by the low rates of childhood literacy in the United States, and placed the blame for children’s lack of interest in reading squarely on the shoulders of the ponderous <em>Dick and Jane </em>standard reading primers on which several generations of children had been raised. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="6313" data-permalink="https://brianjayjones.com/efarm2txsaeescx/" data-orig-file="https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg" data-orig-size="594,473" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="efarm2txsaeescx" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=500" src="https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=594" alt="" width="282" height="224" srcset="https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=282 282w, https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=564 564w, https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px"><figcaption>John Hersey</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The real problem, as Hersey saw it, was that Dick and Jane were<em> terrible</em>. The text — with its now-easily lampooned, “Look, Jane, look. See the ball?” syntax — was bad enough, but Hersey thought the artwork was even worse–“insipid illustrations depicting the slicked-up lives of other children,” he railed. No one, he concluded, was interested in reading about Dick and Jane and their lives of quiet desperation. At the very least, suggested Hersey, couldn’t they get Dr. Seuss to illustrate the otherwise turgid text?</p>



<p>They never would get Dr. Seuss to illustrate Dick and Jane; instead, Seuss was approached by William Spaulding, an editor of children’s books at Random House rival Houghton Mifflin, who had read Hersey’s article and begged Dr. Seuss to “write me a story that first graders can’t put down.”</p>



<p>But there was a catch. Putting aside all their other problems, Dick and Jane were at least living their dull lives inside an actual reading primer, operating under a strict educator-approved vocabulary list of about 300 unique words at the first grade reading level. For his book, then, Dr. Seuss would have to play by those same rules, using only the words on the sanctioned reading list. Seuss told Spaulding he’d take the list home and “play with it.”</p>



<p>He played with it for nearly a year. It was, he said later, an “impossible and ridiculous task…I was forbidden to use any words beyond the list. I almost threw the job up.” Eventually, he decided to read through the list one last time, vowing that “if I find two words that rhyme and make sense to me, that’s the title.” Unfortunately,<em> tall </em>and <em>ball</em> were a bust.</p>

<p><em>Cat </em>and <em>hat</em>, however, were not.</p>



<p>After another year of work, Dr. Seuss published <em>The Cat in the Hat</em> in the Spring of 1957.** For <em>Cat</em>, Seuss had used 236 unique words from the word list. (His total word count, with repeated words, is about 1,600.) It was Seuss’ first real blockbuster of a book — the one that permitted him to finally devote himself full-time to writing and drawing books for children. But more importantly, <em>Cat in the Hat </em>is a bestseller with a pedagogy; with its reliance on the officially-sanctioned word list, it’s a book teachers approved of, one parents loved, and one kids actually wanted to read. In 1957, that was a game changer.</p>

<p>Inspired by the huge success of the Cat, Random House created a new imprint called Beginner Books, aimed squarely at beginning readers and which continued to lean on the educator-approved word list. Dr. Seuss was brought in as the imprint’s president and editor–a seat from which he would not only recruit and work with other writers and artists on children’s books (one of the most popular of which was P.D. Eastman’s <em>Go, Dog. Go!</em>) but would also regularly produce his own books under the new logo, featuring the Cat himself.</p>



<p>Among the first books Dr. Seuss produced for the Beginner Books imprint was <em>One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish</em>, completed in 1959. <em>One Fish</em> was an experiment for Seuss, as he was deliberately using an even more restrictive word list of short words, and placing the accompanying drawings as close to the text as he possibly could, like so:</p>

<p>It would be the prototype for a new line of books Seuss was already informally calling “Beginner Beginner Books,” aimed at very early readers with limited vocabularies. Soon, there would be a new imprint at Random House, overseen by Seuss, and formally designated with the moniker Bright &amp; Early Books. The Bright &amp; Early Books relied on an approved vocabulary list of only 182 simple words—a little more than half as large as the already restrictive list adhered to by Beginner Books.</p>

<p>Still with me? In 1959, Random House publisher Bennett Cerf approached Dr. Seuss and gleefully pointed out that the new Bright &amp; Early imprint relied on a tight list of 182 words. Then he laid down a playful and very specific challenge: <em>could Dr. Seuss write a book using only 50 of those words?</em> </p>



<p>Cerf bet Dr. Seuss $50 that he couldn’t. </p>



<p>Challenge accepted.</p>



<p>Seuss, who who had agonized and struggled with a broader and less restrictive word list as he worked on <em>The Cat in the Hat, </em>nevertheless rose to the occasion. But it’s probably no coincidence that the resulting book was all about convincing someone to do something they didn’t really want to do.</p>

<p><em>Green Eggs and Ham </em>would be its own kind of misery, requiring Seuss to create complicated charts, checklists, and multiple word counts as he struggled to keep track of the words he was using. He also imposed on himself a requirement to stick with one-syllable words, though he would make an exception for “anywhere,” which was made up of two short words that young readers would know.</p>



<p>Rhyming, too, could be tough with a fifty word restriction. “The agony is terrific at times, and the attribution is horrible,” he said. “If you’re doing it in quatrains and get to the end of four lines and can’t make it work, then it’s like unraveling a sock. You take some of your best stuff and throw it away.”</p>



<p>Dr. Seuss delivered <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> to Cerf at Random House in 1960. He was glad to be done with it, and somewhat nervous about how it would be received.</p>



<p>We all know how it turned out. “The good doctor has scored another triumph,” exclaimed the <em>New York Times</em>, while one reviewer wrote presciently of <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em>: “A vocabulary of only fifty words, but they will long be remembered.”</p>

<p>For the rest of his life, Dr. Seuss would find himself at book signings and dinners in his honor where he would be served plates filled with green eggs and ham. “Deplorable stuff,” he said later, “The worst was on a yacht in six-foot seas.”</p>



<p>Generations of readers would look for hidden meanings and metaphors in its text—but for Dr. Seuss, <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> was only ever about one thing: “Cerf bet me fifty bucks I couldn’t write a book using only 50 words,” he said later. “I did it to show I could.”</p>



<p>Oh, and Seuss also said later that Bennett Cerf never paid him his fifty dollars. </p>



<p>Regardless, Happy 60th Birthday to <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em>. Thank you, thank you, Sam I Am (and Dr. Seuss!)</p>

<p>* Publishers can be persnickety about releasing sales figures on the record. Total sales for <em>Green Eggs </em>are reported as anywhere from 8 million to 15 million to 200 million.</p>



<p>* * In a trade-off deal, Random House–Dr. Seuss’s normal publisher–permitted Houghton Mifflin to publish the textbook version of <em>Cat in the Hat </em>for schools, while Random House retained the trade rights. As it turned out, few schools bought the textbook version. Random House would make a mint off the Cat; Houghton — where the idea had originated in the first place! — not so much. Random House would eventually acquire the textbook rights back from its rival, and promptly shelve them, preferring to issue only the trade edition.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://reeve.blog/blog/principles/">recently argued</a> that 80% of a product manager’s job is to discover the right product to build and drive organizational alignment. At the same time, ‘product discovery’ is often the most nebulous part of the job. So how&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;great product managers do this? While product discovery will never be easy, I’ll outline a simple yet effective framework that I use.</p>



<p>There are many great books about product discovery. They also tend to be complicated and tricky to reference day-to-day. So over time, I’ve tried to simplify this, and I’ve distilled it down into what I call the “Five P’s.” In my experience, all five have to be defined and considered when deciding what to build:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Purpose:</strong> What is the mission of your company or product?</li><li><strong>Problem: </strong>What is the customer or user problem we’re solving?</li><li><strong>Pattern:</strong> How many people are impacted by this problem?</li><li><strong>Prose: </strong>What is the narrative for how solving this problem benefits the customer and our business?</li><li><strong>Priority: </strong>How important is this solving this problem vs. other problems on which we could focus?</li></ul>







<p>Your purpose is why your company or product exists, reflected as a mission and strategy. Without this, you’re flying blind. There’s no use in identifying the auto industry’s most common problems if your mission is to create the world’s leading crypto bank:</p>



<ol><li>A <strong>mission</strong> statement is what you’re trying to accomplish. E.g., <em>Plant a billion trees on each continent to offset the world’s carbon emissions. </em>A mission statement should be concise, opinionated, inspiring, and action-oriented (i.e., begin with a verb.)</li><li>A <strong>strategy</strong> is how you’re going to achieve your mission. E.g., <em>Identify suitable land, build irrigation systems, procure seeds and fertilizer, sow seeds by helicopter.</em></li><li><strong>Vision</strong> and mission are easily confused. Think of vision as defining what the world will look like when you’ve achieved your mission.<em> </em>E.g., <em>we’ve offset the world’s carbon emissions by 30%, providing cleaner air to billions of people.</em></li></ol>



<p>Investing time in defining a purpose may seem abstract. Still, it’s critical: Having a clear and compelling mission and strategy inspires a product team and points discovery efforts in the right direction. For product “tracks” within larger companies, the track’s purpose should contribute to the company’s purpose. Boz (VP at Facebook) wrote a great article on mission and strategy <a href="https://boz.com/articles/strategy-tactics">here</a>.</p>







<p>The core part of effective product management is identifying pain within the context of your mission and strategy. What problems do your target customers have? Why do people like or not like your product? Are your customers asking for something?</p>



<p>Problems can surface qualitatively or quantitatively:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Qualitative:</strong> This might include user experience research, a customer call series, feature requests from users, input from your team or stakeholders, competitor research, or your own product judgment. To paraphrase <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ablue/">Allen Blue</a>, look for places where your target customers are already “duct-taping” things together.</li><li><strong>Quantitative:</strong> What you’ve identified through studying trends in your metrics. Product managers should study their metrics daily to understand how the product is performing and identify problems and opportunities.</li></ul>



<p>Customers will often tell you the solution, not the problem. They’re trying to be helpful. But well-intentioned customers usually don’t know what’s possible, nor what will work best for your product. Asking the right questions can help identify the problem:</p>



<ul><li>If you get X, what will it help you do?</li><li>What happens if you don’t get X?</li><li>If you don’t get X, how will you achieve Y?</li></ul>



<p>Be careful in situations where there’s a “layer” between you and the user. Suppose the person you’re talking with is an intermediary (e.g., the buyer or someone who administers the product within a company): In this scenario, they may not understand the experience from the end user’s perspective. Be mindful of who is answering your questions.</p>



<p>Finally, while many formal research functions support the discovery process (product marketing, user research, etc.), a deep understanding of the customer can’t be delegated to another function. Great product managers have strong opinions and intuition; this comes from being exposed to raw feedback, e.g., attending customer calls, studying metrics, and talking to users.</p>







<p>Most of the time, product managers are looking for systemic issues that impact a large percentage of your target customers. We can define ‘systemic’ in different ways: The number of customers with a problem, the value of the customers who have the problem (e.g., how much they spend with you), or whether they are uniquely significant (e.g., a prominent “brand name”).</p>



<p>There are going to be situations where solving an isolated problem is the right call. You might choose to build something purely because a critical customer is asking for it. You might prioritize something for a small but essential cohort of users (e.g., power users or promoters). These are fine, but they should be the exception, not the norm.</p>







<p>The word ‘prose’ underscores the importance of looking beyond a singular metric. Don’t get me wrong, moving metrics is crucial, and I spend a lot of time doing just that, but they aren’t exhaustive. Too often, I see product teams focusing on tuning a singular metric without considering the entire ecosystem or whether something is the right long-term investment as part of a broader mission and strategy. </p>



<p>Even worse, product teams may shy away from building a great product because they can’t predict the quantitative impact of building it. <strong>In practice, you often won’t be able to accurately predict the metric impact of shipping a brand new product or making a step-function change.</strong> </p>



<p>Persuasive prose forces product teams to consider both the quantitative and qualitative effects of building something <em>and</em> how it ties to a broader mission and strategy. It underscores the value of having a clear and compelling narrative for understanding:</p>



<ol><li>What the problem is.</li><li>Why the problem should be solved.</li><li>How the problem will be solved.</li><li>The qualitative and quantitative impact of solving the problem.</li><li>How solving the problem contributes to a broader mission and strategy.</li></ol>



<p><strong>I’ll touch on the two main tools I use when working with ‘prose’:</strong></p>



<p><strong>The first you’re probably familiar with, which is the hypothetical external press release, </strong><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/11/working_backwards.html"><strong>popularized by Amazon</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The press release explains what the product is, why it exists, and the features and benefits. It’s a compelling articulation of the value that the product delivers to the customer and the market. If it isn’t compelling, you may either not be solving the right problem, or not have the right product to solve it.</p>



<p><strong>But I’m guessing you haven’t heard of the second application of ‘prose’:</strong> The concept is similar, but it’s an <em>internal</em><strong><em> </em></strong>press release. Imagine you’re summarizing the “why,” “what,” and “how” to your CEO. Articulate the problem you’re solving, how it ties to broader mission and strategy, how you’re going to solve it, and the impact that solving it will have on your business. This internal press release will narrate what you’re doing, why you’re doing it, and support it with qualitative and quantitative data. And yes, for any significant decision, you should share it! This exercise identifies incongruencies in your logic, and it will also help communicate the value of doing something.</p>







<p>Prioritization is conceptually simple. In practice, it’s harder and often imprecise, a mixture of art and science. Usually, it’s about the cost versus benefit.</p>



<ul><li><strong>First, we want to understand the impact of solving a problem:</strong> How much will it move a given metric? How many customers have asked for this? Will this increase retention? Will it unlock a portion of the market?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Second, we need to have a sense of how much solving it will cost:</strong> How many engineering weeks are required to build the solution? What are the support and marketing costs?</li></ul>



<p>There are many prioritization frameworks, including <a href="https://medium.com/@nimay/inside-product-introduction-to-feature-priority-using-ice-impact-confidence-ease-and-gist-5180434e5b15">ICE</a>, <a href="https://roadmunk.com/guides/product-prioritization-techniques-product-managers/">RICE, and many others</a>. Still, I’ve found that they often miss the need for product teams to balance multiple distinct success metrics and “themes” of work. I’ve had success with a slightly augmented version of ICE that I’ve eloquently named <strong>MICE</strong> (Metric, Impact, Confidence, Ease.)</p>



<ul><li><strong>Metric: </strong>What is the importance of the metric that this feature will move? E.g., do we care more about improving activation, or more about retention?</li><li><strong>Impact: </strong>What is the impact of solving this problem based on the pattern you’ve identified?</li><li><strong>Confidence: </strong>What is our confidence in this impact?</li><li><strong>Ease: </strong>How easy is this problem to solve? (An inverse of cost, higher is cheaper.)</li><li>Multiply M*I*C*E, and sort from highest to lowest.</li></ul>



<p>A prioritization framework will give you a way of loosely sorting what you <em>could</em> work on, but it’s a supplement for judgment, not a replacement. “Because the framework said so” isn’t a valid reason for prioritizing something. Prioritization is always a balancing act between data, intuition, and stakeholder alignment.</p>



<p>Always remember that teams are comprised of people, and people are better when they aren’t stretched thin across multiple contexts. Set a theme for the quarter (e.g., we’re going to nail this particular customer type or user persona), and focus on making material progress within that theme, instead of trying to solve a dozen problems for a dozen different customer segments. Great focus yields great results.</p>







<p>Someday, I’ll write a longer piece about driving organizational alignment (which is just a fancy way of saying “getting people to agree that this is the right thing to build”). Still, it’s so important that this article wouldn’t be complete without touching on it.</p>



<p>Organizational alignment has to start early, and often. The mechanics are incredibly variable, but there are a few unavoidable pieces:</p>



<ul><li><strong>1-1 conversations: </strong>Asking a group of 10 people, “what do you think about this?” isn’t how you create alignment and understanding. In my …</li></ul></div></article></main></div></div></div>

<p>For my open source RTL projects, I’ve so far only used 2 Verilog simulators: 
<a href="http://iverilog.icarus.com/">Icarus Verilog</a> and <a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>.</p>

<p>Icarus Verilog is a traditional event-driven simulator with support for most of the behavioral Verilog constructs that
can be found in complex Verilog testbenches: delays, <code>repeat</code> statements, etc. If you can look past its simulation
speed (it’s <em>very</em> slow), it does the job pretty well, and allows one to stay within a pure Verilog environment just
like you would with commercial tools such as VCS, Modelsim etc.</p>

<p>Verilator is a completely different beast: it’s a cycle based simulator that, with some exceptions, only takes
in synthesizable RTL, removes all notions of time or delays, and simulates from one cycle to the next. Cycle
based simulators are much faster than event driven ones, and Verilator is one of the best in class that
routinely beats commercial simulators. Verilator compiles your Verilog design into a bunch of C++ files and
then into a linkable library. All you need to do is write a C++ wrapper (which can be very small) that
calls the library for each simulation step, and you’re on your way. ZipCPU has <a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">a very good Verilator
tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Verilator can be 500x faster than Icarus Verilog. When the simulation time of my projects gets too
long, I usually switch from Icarus to Verilator.</p>

<p>Icarus and Verilator aren’t the only open source Verilog simulators, but they are the most popular by far. And
for good reason: Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HDL_simulators#Free_and_open-source_simulators">lists</a> a number
of alternatives, but one constant between them is the lack of support for modern Verilog features. I’ve
never seen anybody use them…</p>



<p>Yosys is the star of the open source synthesis world. It initially rose to prominence with the release of 
<a href="http://www.clifford.at/">Claire Wolff</a>’s <a href="http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/">Project IceStorm</a>, 
where it’s the synthesis component of an end-to-end open source RTL to bitstream flow for Lattice ICE40 FPGAs.</p>

<p>But Yosys is much more than that.</p>

<p>It’s a Swiss army knife of digital logic manipulation that takes in a digital design through one of its so-called frontends 
(Verilog, blif, json, ilang, even VHDL and SystemVerilog for the commercial version), provides tons of different passes that transform 
the digital logic one way or the other (e.g. flatten a hierarchy, remove redundant logic, map generic gates to 
specific technology gates, check formal equivalence), and a bunch of backends that write the final design in 
some desired format (Verilog, Spice, json, SMT2, etc.)</p>

<p>If you have a blob of synthesizable digital logic and you need to perform some kind of transformation, chances are that Yosys
already supports it.</p>

<p>Yosys’ commands are relatively well documented, but, unfortunately, the documentation snapshots on 
<a href="http://www.clifford.at/yosys/documentation.html">the official Yosys website</a> are often woefully behind.</p>

<p>To get the latest and greatest list of commands, it’s best to just compile Yosys and use the <code>help</code> function
from the command line of the tool.</p>

<p><em>The amount of information can be overwhelming (there are a large amount of commands that I don’t quite understand
myself), but, luckily, it’s not necessary to understand most of the commands: in many cases, it’s sufficient to use
ready-made recipes to go from RTL to a synthesized gate-level netlist.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/tree/master/backends/cxxrtl">CXXRTL</a> is a new Yosys backend. It writes out 
the digital logic inside Yosys as a set of C++ classes, one for each remaining module, after performing whichever 
transformation pass you want to apply.</p>

<p>In combination with <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/backends/cxxrtl/cxxrtl.h"><code>cxxrtl.h</code></a>,
a single C++ include file with template classes that implement variable width bitvector arithmetic, the C++ classes become a 
simulation model of the digital design.</p>

<p>Just like with Verilator, the simulation model is cycle-based. And just like Verilator, you need to provide a thin
C++ wrapper that calls these classes to perform a step-by-step simulation.</p>



<p>Going from Verilog to running a simulation is straightforward.</p>

<p>CXXRTL is very new and moving fast. This blog post had to be updated multiple times due to new features being added.</p>

<p>For an up-to-date state of features, it’s best to bring up the CXXRTL manual from within Yosys:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; yosys
...
yosys&gt; help write_cxxrtl

    write_cxxrtl [options] [filename]

Write C++ code that simulates the design. The generated code requires a driver
that instantiates the design, toggles its clock, and interacts with its ports.

The following driver may be used as an example for a design with a single clock
driving rising edge triggered flip-flops:

    #include "top.cc"
...
</code></pre></div></div>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Flexible Black-boxing of Submodules</p>

    <p>This makes it possible to replace any module inside the design hierarchy
  with a behavior model that’s written in C++.</p>

    <p>This can be useful for a variety of reasons during the development process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>VCD Waveform Generation</p>

    <p>A simulator isn’t worth much when it doesn’t support dumping debug waveforms.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/backends/cxxrtl/cxxrtl_vcd.h">VCD waveform writer</a> 
  is only around 200 lines of C++ code and serves as a great example for those who want to write similar 
  tools, such as support for different waveform dump file formats.</p>

    <p>An example is provided below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Design introspection</p>

    <p>Design introspection allows the testbench itself to go through the whole design 
  <em>at run time</em> and discover and interact with all objects that contain a value or state.</p>

    <p>The VCD waveform generation uses this feature to come up with all the storage elements
  (signals, memories) that need to be dumped, but introspection opens up all kinds of other 
  possibilities that are discussed further below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implementation Simplicity</p>

    <p>One of the most attractive points of CXXRTL is the simplicity of the implementation.</p>

    <p>The Yosys backend CXXRTL is small. The generated code is understandable (to a point). The execution 
  model is straightforward. It uses a single bit vector data representation and C++ templates to 
  implement Yosys digital logic primitives.</p>

    <p>It may not have the performance of Verilator (which has seen more than 20 years of
  performance optimizations), but if you had to implement some new feature, like 
  adding support for a new waveform format, it’d be trivial compared to adding that
  to Verilator.</p>

    <p>When writing this blog post, I often needed to dive into the code to clarify some details,
  and other than the complexity that’s inherent to C++ templates, I found the whole
  experience relatively painless.</p>

    <p>I consider this a major plus for an open source project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>C API</p>

    <p>For those who can’t use C++ for the testbench wrapper, there is a C API that allows pure
  C to do almost anything you can do with the default C++ interface.</p>

    <p>The simulation model itself still needs to be compiled with C++, but this is useful
  to integrate and link the simulation model into language such a Python (which
  uses C to call foreign libraries).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Automatically benefits from Yosys front-end improvements</p>

    <p>Whenever a new front-end feature gets added to Yosys, CXXRTL benefits from that
  as well.</p>

    <p>SystemVerilog is a good example of this: while the pure open source version of Yosys only
  covers to small subset of SystemVerilog language features,

    <p>Similarly, the <a href="https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl-yosys-plugin">ghdl-yosys-plugin</a> project has
  been working towards adding Yosys VHDL support.</p>

    <p>Since all these front-ends compile to the same intermediate data representation that
  is used by CXXRTL, this improved simulation feature support to automatic!</p>

    <p>Once the Yosys gHDL integration stabilize, CXXRTL will be the only open source simulator
  with mixed Verilog/VHDL language support!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simulation Speed</p>

    <p>CXXRTL is orders of magnitude faster than Icarus Verilog.</p>

    <p>But see below…</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Simulation Speed</p>

    <p>My current benchmark is a small VexRiscv CPU running a C program that toggles 3 LEDs.</p>

    <p>In the fastest settings, CXXRTL is about 8x slower than single-threaded Verilator.</p>

    <p>You can find my benchmarking results <a href="https://github.com/tomverbeure/cxxrtl_eval/blob/master/README.md">here</a>.</p>

    <p>One should not rely on just one benchmark, and others have reported simulation speed
  differences that aren’t as large. Verilog coding style differences, or the type of
  logic could play a major role here.</p></li></ul></div></article></div></div></div>

These forward estimates (often referred to as consensus estimates) are released by sell-side research analyst who try to follow and model these companies. Investors look at these number relative to the company's enterprise value (EV) to see how "cheap" or "expensive" a company is relative to it's future revenue, whether it's the next-twelve-months or several years in the future.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.publiccomps.com/content/images/2020/08/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.publiccomps.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.publiccomps.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image-1.png 1000w, https://blog.publiccomps.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/image-1.png 1600w, https://blog.publiccomps.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/08/image-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>EV Multiples from the <a href="https://www.publiccomps.com/tickers?items=ZM+%28Zoom+Video%29%2CCOUP+%28Coupa+Software%29%2CDDOG+%28Datadog%29%2COKTA+%28Okta%29%2CCRWD+%28Crowdstrike%29%2CTWLO+%28Twilio%29%2CAYX+%28Alteryx%29%2CSHOP+%28Shopify%29">Public Comps Dashboard</a> for select companies (August 2020)</figcaption></figure><p>It's an open-secret that these estimates are often lower than actual revenue numbers. These researchers are incentivized to be conservative because overestimating revenue looks worse than underestimating revenue. Even when companies beat their analyst estimated earnings, the stock can plunge because the buy-side (hedge funds) predicted an even higher revenue. This begs the question, how much lower are estimates compared the actuals?</p><h2 id="revenue-beat-analysis">Revenue Beat Analysis</h2><p>I analyzed 282 earnings for 100 B2B SaaS companies using data from Public Comps between 2016 &amp; 2020.

alt=""></figure><p>Earnings for high-growth companies <strong>beat analyst estimates by 7% on average </strong>(median 5.7%).<strong> </strong>This is a huge discrepancy on a quarterly basis, and across a year can sum up to &gt; 20% difference. The conservative nature of these estimates downplay the quality and consistency of growth, and will make growth companies look more expansive relative to future revenue when using them.</p><p>Knowing these estimates are consistently off for growth companies, you might ask are there better ways to estimate forward revenue than these expensive analyst estimates?</p><p>While working in VC, I heard of a concept called <em>growth persistence </em>from <a href="https://www.scalevp.com/blog/predictable-growth-decay-in-saas-companies">Scale Venture Partner's blog</a>:</p><blockquote>As a rule of thumb, therefore, <strong>next year's growth rate is likely to be 85% of what this year's was</strong></blockquote><p>For example, if you have a company that grew 50% this year, we can expect it to grow &nbsp;42.5% the next year.</p><p>I often used this concept to estimate forward revenue when I didn't have access to analyst estimates. To generate a <em>growth persistence estimate</em>, I took the growth rate of the corresponding quarter from the previous year , multiplied it by 0.85, and solved for the implied revenue. With the Public Comps data, I can analyze the effectiveness of the growth persistence estimate.</p><p>The median <em>growth persistence</em> (revenue growth / last year revenue growth) in our data is consistent with this rule (85.4%). I then experimented with how accurate the growth persistence estimates were compared to the actual revenue. </p><figure><img

The mean beat was reduced to 1.7% and 4.5% respectively, <strong>while the median actual revenue beats were both &lt; 1%.</strong> It's incredible how much more accurate using this simple rule is over consensus estimates. This rule requires only two data points (previous revenue growth &amp; previous revenue) that you get almost a year before the earnings, while sell-side analyst have months of research up until the earnings release.</p><p>While using analyst estimates is a common practice, it is known that these estimates are conservative, and especially so for high-growth companies. Even simple calculations like the growth persistence estimates have outperformed them. While they are useful data-points for understanding an investment, the buyers &amp; sellers of these assets are often predicting revenue earnings at higher values, and incorporating other <a href="https://blog.publiccomps.com/top-5-saas-metrics/">key SaaS metrics</a> in their decisions.</p><p>When looking at the expensive EV/forward revenue multiples for growth companies, remember it's a little cheaper than meets the eye.</p><p>If you have any questions, feedback, or concerns, feel free to shoot me an email!</p><p>Howard Chen, Public Comps Team</p><p>howard@publiccomps.com</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Chowybear">https://twitter.com/Chowybear</a></p><p><em><em>Like t</em>his analysis<em>? </em>S<em>ubscribe to the </em></em><a href="https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ulp4knn6f9h86d97tq/25h2hohoqn5p8q/aHR0cHM6Ly9wdWJsaWNjb21wcy5jay5wYWdlLzY4YjQ2NWQwYzk="><em><em>newsletter here</em></em></a><em><em> where we send out investment memos, market maps and analysis on the broader SaaS market.</em></em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: The author owns stock directly in AYX, CRWD, TEAM, TWLO, AMZN, FB, DDOG, ESTC, and ZM.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm a happy user of <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> both on my private
computers and on my work laptop. I even managed to get through four years of
university with my setup, and only had to bring a Windows machine on some rare
occasions, even though some professors are openly hostile towards a Linux setup.
(It doesn't run Microsoft Project and the real Excel, after all…)</p>
<p>Recently, I got interested in the BSDs, especially in
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> and in <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>.
Even though OpenBSD with its minimalistic appeal is better suited to my taste,
I'm currently looking at FreeBSD for a couple of reasons. First, I have to
maintain a storage server (a FreeBSD box using ZFS) at work. Second, I've also
built up a storage server at home. FreeBSD gives me the things I need mostly out
of the box: ZFS with redundancy on really cheap hardware. And third, I just like
to learn new things.</p>

<p>However, when it comes to learning new things in my spare time, I'd rather spend
my time on something that will be useful in the long run. I use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">Lindy
Effect</a> as a guide: Technologies
like Kubernetes, the latest JavaScript framework, or Web Assembly have only been
around for a couple of years, and it's possible that those will undergo major
changes or vanish alltogether as fast as they came. Older technologies <em>that are
still around nowadays</em>, on the other hand, can be expected to be around for many
more years. Examples are the C programming language, various Unix shells, and ‒
FreeBSD. (I also make exceptions to this rule now and then. For example, I
learned Go and Rust in the summers of 2018 and 2019, respectively. Go, which had
its 1.0 release earlier than Rust, proofed to be the more stable choice.)</p>
<p>FreeBSD is now more than 25 years old. Its roots, however, go back to AT&amp;T's
original Unix from the 1970s. (All the code has been replaced or rewritten
since.) Being old is not enough, of course; a technology is only worthwhile
learning if it is still alive. Even though FreeBSD is rarely on the front page
of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, it is still widely used.
<a href="https://papers.freebsd.org/2019/fosdem/looney-netflix_and_freebsd/">Netflix</a>
streams videos through FreeBSD systems, and the operating system of the
PlayStation 4, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4_system_software">Orbis
OS</a>, is based on
FreeBSD.</p>
<p>FreeBSD is not only likely to stay around for a long time, it probably also
won't undergo fundmental changes very soon or very often. One example is the
startup system of FreeBSD, which is still based on <code>init</code> and <code>rc</code> scripts.
Ubuntu, on the other side, switched from SysVinit to Upstart in 2006, and again
from Upstart to systemd in 2015. That is one init system to learn for a lifetime
(FreeBSD) vs. three in less than a decade (Ubuntu).</p>
<p>Documentation is another advantage of FreeBSD. Having a system that rarely
introduces breaking changes makes it easier and more worthwile to provide good
documentation. The FreeBSD team not only provides good <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi">manual
pages</a>, but also a well curated
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/">FAQs</a>, a
<a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/">Wiki</a>, and the very useful
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/">Handbook</a>.
FreeBSD material has such a long shelf life so that it is even worthwhile to
print books about that operating system. I'm reading <a href="https://nostarch.com/absfreebsd3">Absolute
FreeBSD</a> now (from front to back, that is).
Michael Warren Lucas, the author of this book, has written <a href="https://www.tiltedwindmillpress.com/product-category/tech/">even more
books</a> on FreeBSD
(and OpenBSD), which are not only useful and of high-quality, but also
well-written and fun to read.</p>
<p>As I started to work with FreeBSD, I suddenly realized what the term
«distribution» is probably supposed to mean: Not just a bunch of software
cobbled together with more or less frequent upgrades, but an entire operating
system that not only provides working software, but also the means to build that
very software on a standard installation. (Such a system is technically
described as <em>self hosting</em>.) A kernel can be compiled and installed with a
single command. Thanks to the ports tree, the packages can be compiled easily
and in a consistent way. I haven't tried <em>all</em> Linux distributions, of course,
but quality standards that high are certainly not the rule in the GNU/Linux
world. (Debian and Arch, the Linux distributions I use the most and know the
best, are still absolutely great operating systems.)</p>

<p>It's safe to say that FreeBSD is a good choice for servers in a Unix
environment. But does it also work well on a desktop computer? And is it even an
option for the kind of desktop I like to run: not GNOE, KDE, or Xfce, but a
minimalistic setup based on <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a>, which probably
isn't used by many. Since dwm can only be configured by modifying the <code>config.h</code>
file, I won't be able to use the version from the ports tree. I use my desktop
computer mainly for work (programming, reading, writing, researching information
on the internet) and some entertainment mostly provided through the web browser
(reading, videos).</p>
<p>I generally use mid-range commodity hardware with on-board graphics, so hardware
compatibility should not be an issue. My desktop computer is a small-form Dell
OptiPlex 7040 from 2016 with an Intel Core i5 CPU. I replaced the original 128
TB SSD with a 500 GB model last year, and upgraded the original 8 GB of memory
with a ridiculous amount of 24 GB. (Some RAM bars just happened to lay around
here…) The computer has a WiFi card, of course, but since my router is just next
to my desk, I rather use a stable ethernet connection.</p>
<p>I already tried out OpenBSD once on that computer, and didn't have any issues
getting it to run. So FreeBSD having access to the same code base under the BSD
license is likely to suppport this hardware as well. Let's just try it out!</p>

<p>FreeBSD supports multiple versions at any given point in time. At the time of
this writing, 12.1 and 11.4 are the current versions intended for production.
Let's pick the most recent version 12.1. The <a href="https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/amd64/amd64/ISO-IMAGES/12.1/">download
page</a>
for the <code>amd64</code> architecture offers various options. The compressed
<code>mini-memstick</code> archive weighs the least and provides everything that is needed
for an installation on a computer with internet connection. I download it to my
laptop running Arch Linux, and then verify the checksum:</p>
<pre><code>$ wget https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/amd64/amd64\
/ISO-IMAGES/12.1/FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img.xz
$ wget https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/amd64/amd64/\
ISO-IMAGES/12.1/CHECKSUM.SHA512-FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64
$ sha512sum -c CHECKSUM.SHA512-FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64 --ignore-missing
FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img.xz: OK
</code></pre>
<p>The archive (389 MBs) needs to be unpacked and is then copied to a USB dongle
(<code>/dev/sda</code>):</p>
<pre><code>$ unxz FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img.xz
# dd if=FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img of=/dev/sda bs=1M
$ sync
</code></pre>

<p>The BIOS is setup to use UEFI rather than legacy boot. I plug in the USB dongle
and start the FreeBSD installer. These are the settings I use during setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keymap: Swiss-German (<code>ch.kdb</code>)</li>
<li>Hostname: <code>optiplex</code> (I'm not very imaginative when it comes to naming
  things.)</li>
<li>Components: just <code>lib32</code>, <code>ports</code>, and <code>src</code></li>
<li>Network: interface <code>em0</code> with DHCP and IPv4</li>
<li>Mirror: Main Site</li>
<li>Partitioning: Auto (UFS, I'm going to learn about ZFS later) on the entire
  disk <code>ada0</code> using GPT and the following partitions (device, space, type,
  label, mount point):<ul>
<li><code>ada0p1</code>: 200 MB <code>efi</code> boot (no mount point)</li>
<li><code>ada0p2</code>: 24 GB <code>freebsd-swap</code> swap0 (no mount point, size of physical memory)</li>
<li><code>ada0p3</code>: 16 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> root <code>/</code></li>
<li><code>ada0p4</code>: 4 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> temp <code>/tmp</code></li>
<li><code>ada0p5</code>: 4 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> var <code>/var</code></li>
<li><code>ada0p6</code>: 32 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> usr <code>/usr</code></li>
<li><code>ada0p7</code>: 386 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> home <code>/home</code> (remainder of the space)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Root password: I won't tell you, but a strong one!</li>
<li>CMOS clock: UTC</li>
<li>Time Zone: Europe/Switzerland (<code>CEST</code>)</li>
<li>Services: <code>sshd</code>, <code>moused</code>, <code>ntpd</code>, <code>powerd</code>, and <code>dumpdev</code></li>
<li>Security Hardening Options: everything</li>
<li>User: <code>patrick</code> with additional group <code>wheel</code> (to become root), the <code>tcsh</code>
  shell, a strong password, and, otherwise, suggested settings</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be argued if the chosen partition sizes are reasonable. However, it is
always a good idea to use separate <code>/tmp</code> and <code>/var</code> partitions to make sure
that no process can fill up the entire disk. (Using a separate <code>/usr</code> partition
is an issue on Linux nowadays, since the widely used init system systemd
requires access to <code>/usr</code>. On FreeBSD, it is still possible to do so without any
issues.)</p>
<p>Make sure to use <code>efi</code> as the type for the boot partition, not <code>freebsd-boot</code> as
suggested in <em>Absolute FreeBSD</em> (3rd Edition on page 36).</p>

<p>After the installation, I choose to shutdown the system. I unplug my USB dongle
as soon as the screen turns black.</p>
<p>Before the first boot, I have to change my boot options in the BIOS so that the
computer boots from the SSD on which FreeBSD was just installed.</p>
<p>The system boots and even shows my mouse on the terminal! The network is up and
running. However, there is a message warning me that the leapsecond file is
expired. The
<a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/leapseconds-file-expired.56645/post-322290">solution</a> suggested in the FreeBSD Forum</p>
<pre><code># service ntpd onefetch
</code></pre>
<p>fails with a certificate verification error. A <a href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=230017">bug
report</a> suggest to
install the package <code>ca_root_nss</code>:</p>
<pre><code># pkg install ca_root_nss
</code></pre>
<p>Which not only installs the package management software, but also solves the
issue above: The warning concerning the leapsecond file doesn't appear after the
next boot. Now that the basic system is up and running, let's tackle the GUI!</p>

<p>Since <em>Absolute FreeBSD</em> doesn't cover graphical user interfaces, I have to
resort to the handbook. In <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/x-install.html">Chapter
5.3</a> it says that the
easiest way to setup the X Window System is to install the <code>xorg</code> package. Since
I prefer a minimalistic setup, I opt for the <code>x11/xorg-minimal</code> package instead:</p>
<pre><code># pkg install x11/xorg-minimal
</code></pre>
<p>This package depends on Python 3.7, Perl 5, and Wayland, among others, and
weighs roughly 1 GB, which is not exactly minimalistic in my opinion. On the
other hand, it is notable that the base setup works without Perl or Python.
(Which <em>is</em> minimalistic.)</p>
<h2>Compiling <code>dwm</code></h2>
<p>Since I like to keep my <code>dwm</code> version up to date, I fetch the sources using
<code>git</code>, which first needs to be installed:</p>
<pre><code># pkg install git
# git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm
</code></pre>
<p>A first naive compilation attempt fails:</p>
<pre><code># cd dwm
# make
drw.c:5:10: fatal error: 'X11/Xlib.h' file not found
#include &lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>config.mk</code> file expects the header …</p></div></div>

<p>Imagine a race between two people. They are moving at the same exact speed. The only difference is that one of them got a 10-second headstart. That person has the advantage of being ahead the entire race, even though they are doing the exact same thing, moving at the exact same speed. They are always winning while the other person is always losing. Now imagine that race is not a simple sprint or even a marathon, but a race as long as life. This illustrates the unthinkable advantage of getting ahead. It is no harder for the person with the headstart to maintain their lead than it is for the person losing the entire way to maintain the distance they trail behind. In fact, it may in some cases be easier to stay ahead.</p>



<p>Another way to help illustrate this point is to look at the difference between savings and debt. Imagine two people both earn the same breakeven income to cover their same costs of living. The only difference is that one person starts with a little bit of savings and the other person starts with a little bit of debt. This small initial difference in their wealth will not only remain over time — it will actually grow much larger. The first person’s savings work for them, earning them interest over time. The second person’s debt works against them, charging them interest over time. Keep in mind, they are both earning the same income to cover the same costs of living the entire time. In this case, it is significantly easier for the person with the headstart to maintain their advantage than it is for the other person to maintain the amount by which they trail behind. Even if they both do the exact same thing over the long haul, the advantage granted by the initial headstart only increases over time.</p>



<p>This phenomenon applies in a number of other areas as well. Instead of thinking of it as the difference in a competition between two people, one can also think of it as the difference between two possible versions of oneself.</p>



<p>For example, one can lose the weight they want to lose in a relatively short period of time and then maintain a lower weight for years with no more effort than they would have needed to maintain their old heavier weight over time. All else equal, that person can enjoy the benefit of being in better shape for the rest of their life all because they put in some extra work for a short time to get down to their target weight just once.</p>



<p>This is the value of catching up and getting ahead. An early advantage can offer a lead for life. By putting in the short-term work in various areas to catch up and then get ahead, one can stay ahead in all of these areas without any more long-term effort in each, and often with less. This allows them to move on to catching up and getting ahead in other areas. The virtuous cycle continues.</p>



<p>Humans seem hardwired to always be behind. In school, kids do not do all of their assignments a week before they are due. They do them all the night before they are due. Most people tend to focus on not getting too far behind rather than on catching up and getting ahead. They fail to realize that it would often take the same or less effort to maintain a lead as it does the deficit. </p>



<p>Catching up and getting ahead is not necessarily easy, but once it is done, it is just as easy to stay ahead as it would have been to stay where one started. Catching up and getting ahead of wherever one is at the moment takes less time than that over which the benefits of doing so may be enjoyed. Get some leads in life. It is no harder and often easier to stay ahead than it is to stay behind. Why keep losing when you could just as easily keep winning? Catch up. Get ahead.</p>

<![CDATA[YouTube flagged me so I built a Telegram bot to proxy their videos]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR;</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I use ad blockers. YouTube flagged my account and devices. I can only watch
around 1 in 4 videos. So I wrote a Telegram bot that receives YouTube URLs and
replies back with the video.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>I use adblockers to have a semi-decent experience on the Internet. I mainly use
UBlock Origin plus some DNS ones. One nice feature of UBlock Origin is that it
does block ads from YouTube videos. On my phone I uninstalled the YouTube app
and watch videos mostly through Firefox.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, their algorithms detected that I do not watch their ads so all my
accounts and devices seem flagged. I’m not completely banned, but I can’t see
more than half of the videos.</p>

<p>Before you come tell me I am inmoral for not watching the ads that many creators
need to make a living, let me point some things out:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most of the content I follow I already support via Patreon (I spend around 80
USD bucks a month supporting those people)</li>
<li>Even being a supporter, most of the content gets published exclusively to
YouTube.</li>
<li>A lot of the videos I can’t watch do not even have ads</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I’m not complaining about being flagged. Best case scenario, I come up
with away to workaround their restrictions by building tools which is what I
enjoy doing anyways… worst case scenario, I can’t never ever watch YouTube;
I can live with that.</p>

<p>This is what it looks like when I try to watch a video:</p>

<p><img src="https://cristian.io/you-shall-no-tube.jpg" alt="you shall no tube"></p>

<p>And for videos that I can watch, the comment section displays:</p>

<pre><code>Restricted Mode has hidden comments for this video.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="my-solution-for-now-at-least">My solution (for now at least)</h2>

<p>I noticed that what seems to be blocked are the devices/accounts that I have
used, but the videos are accessible and even downloadable from other other
locations (even from the same network). So this is my plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run a Telegram bot that receives YouTube urls</li>
<li>The bot downloads the video (using <code>youtube-dl</code>)</li>
<li>Then the bot replies back with the video attached as a file</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cristian.io/youtube-bot.png" alt="bot shot"></p>

<p><strong>Source code:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/casidiablo/youtube-telegram-bot">https://github.com/casidiablo/youtube-telegram-bot</a></p>



<ul>
<li>It’s likely that I will hit file size limits of Telegram. To upload big videos
I might need to split them using <code>ffmpeg</code></li>
<li>I could make it so that the bot subscribes to the channels I follow and
automatically send me those videos.</li>
<li>The code itself of this bot was adapted from another bot I run that, given a
YouTube URL, downloads the video, encodes it in MP3 and publishes it to a
private Podcast feed. I use it to listen to stuff where video is just a
distraction (conferences, speeches, etc.)</li>
<li>I also run another bot that feeds my Plex server with non-YouTube videos
procured from… from nice people out there.</li>
</ul>

Try to picture Abraham Lincoln delivering the Gettysburg address or MLK Jr. giving his “I have a dream” speech... with a slideshow. It’s absurd.</p><p>All business before 1987 was conducted without PowerPoint. No horrendous charts, crappy colors, uneven shapes and poorly aligned text boxes…it existed! And people still succeeded at conveying messages!&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Ask senior colleagues what they did before PPT and they will tell you they actually had to PREPARE for presentations and condense their messages down, rather than create 150 slides for a deck that wouldn’t ever see the light of day again.</p><p>Preparation starts well before the presentation itself. Here are some quick tips:</p><p>1. <strong>Research your audience.</strong> Understand who will be in the room and how the room is physically set up. You don’t want to be caught off guard by someone you didn’t expect to show up, or in a room that was <em>supposed to have</em> a functioning projector but doesn’t. -</p><p>2. <strong>Begin with the end in mind.</strong> If your audience only walks away with ONE message, what would you want it to be? Tie everything you present into that. If it helps, think about a little airplane flying around the room with a banner attached to the tail - what would the banner say that you want everyone to remember?</p><p>3. <strong>Be thoughtful about your use of slides.</strong> People can read, so putting a bunch of text on a slide isn't helpful. Slides should add something to the presentation that an e-mail or hand-out cannot like video, audio, GIFS, etc.</p></div></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1585656241287_39527"><div>

GE pays training companies big bucks to work with aspiring executives on developing skills like executive presence, negotiations, finance, and many others.</p><p>One of the most influential sessions I attended was taught by Rob Brown, a world-renowned networking and public speaking expert. He taught us a very simple lesson: to be an effective business executive you must train yourself to speak clearly, simply, and concisely. It's not easy. It takes practice.</p><p>I'll never forget his mantra, which didn't make sense to many of us when he first said it:</p><p><strong>'Why use a policeman in an automobile when a cop in a car will do?'&nbsp;</strong>In other words, why use fancy and excessive words when a much simpler message will work?&nbsp;</p><p>Many of us immediately thought, 'No shit, Rob... GE paid you how much money to tell us not to use fluffy language when we speak?'</p><p>But the idea goes far beyond that. As you can tell from the 'policeman and automobile' line, you have options. Cop in a car is the simplest. A uniformed officer in blue from Montgomery county perched atop his leather seat inside a pearl white cruiser is another. </p><p>Forcing yourself to 'cut the crap' and get to the heart of an idea does many important things:</p><p>1. It forces you to think clearly about the presentation, project, or challenge you are working on and find helpful, simple solutions.</p><p>2. It reduces the risk of miscommunication among colleagues, ESPECIALLY for those who are working remote or are working in a non-native language.</p><p>3. It is actually more impressive, not less, to avoid using buzzwords and corporate jargon.</p><p>Using excessive vocabulary and lengthy sentences does nothing but waste people's valuable time in a meeting that's already running 5 minutes over.</p><p>Here's a challenge: Force yourself not to use the words or phrases 'perspective, at the end of the day, standpoint, synergy, capture, boil the ocean, bandwidth, etc...' for an entire day.&nbsp;</p><p>Encourage your teammates to stop you when you do and make you start over again. See how it goes. I bet it's much more difficult than you thought.</p></div></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1585656241287_53309"><div>

Imagine if dinner was carted into this room, and four people got half the food. The night would end in violence," Anand Giridharadas told <em>IDEAS</em> host Nahlah Ayed at a public event hosted by <a href="https://www.samaracanada.com/" target="_blank">the Samara Centre for Democracy</a>.</p>  <p>"But somehow you scale it up to the level of the society &nbsp;— millions and millions of people — and you make it money instead of food, and people are like,&nbsp;'Yeah I guess that's okay,'" Giridharadas added.</p>  <p>The journalist and author has been investigating how global elites in the U.S. have been "changing the world" and dominating the news with their efforts. In his book&nbsp;<em>Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World</em>, Giridharadas lays out how the the rich and powerful have been fighting for equality and injustice, branding themselves as socially engaged agents of change and pouring millions — if not trillions — of tax-avoided dollars into social causes.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But, he warns, in all of this good, their role in causing the problems they later seek to solve is obscured.</p>  <p>"If all these people on the top are doing all this nice stuff, but year by year they are increasing their concentration of wealth and power, their monopolies are getting more monopolistic, their tech companies are becoming more abusive of privacy and democracy —&nbsp;not less —&nbsp;if their influence over politics is increasing, not decreasing, then what is all this do-gooding doing?"&nbsp;</p>  <h2>'If only' solutions</h2>  <p>The New York University professor argues that the conventional wisdom out there to solve the world's problems stems from an "if only" approach, suggesting maybe there needs to be more than just one Mark Zuckerberg to fix this.</p>  <p>"If only we had an effective altruism movement, so that when you give money away you could be guided to give it more rationally. If you give it to this NGO, it will have more impact than if you give it to that one. If only Chinese billionaires could be persuaded to donate philanthropically at the same percentage that American billionaires do," he explained.</p>  <p>"If only, if only, if only."</p>  <p>This "if only" solution got Giridharadas thinking about an equal and opposite possibility.</p>  <p>"Maybe all this extraordinary elite helping in our time is how we maintain a system — an architecture of extraordinary elite hoarding," he told Ayed.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>'While you don't have individually the power to dethrone a Mark Zuckerberg, what you do have the power to do ... is to start joining things. Click less, join more,' says Anand Giridharadas.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>He suggests real change involves the loss of power for global elites. Why should the decisions be left to permitting the rich to decide what's important — a hospital wing, a legal aid centre, a new well in the village? These are decisions that should involve everyone, including elected representatives and governments, Giridharadas argues.</p>  <p>When the rich and powerful not only get involved in change but get into the front row of social change, "they change 'change,'" said the former McKinsey analyst.</p>  <p>"They change what kinds of change are acceptable. They change the discourse we have about change."</p>  <h2>Make democracy</h2>  <p>If the institutions that are set up aren't to be trusted, Giridharadas proposes it's time to build better institutions — this time, from the bottom up.</p>  <p>He sees a possibility to make democracy better by organizing the world differently.</p>  <p>"While you don't have individually the power to dethrone a Mark Zuckerberg, what you do have the power to do — today, tomorrow and the next day — is to start joining things," he told Ayed.</p>  <p>Giridharadas calls on people to join organizations, membership lists and movements that work toward building cross-racial, cross-class coalitions of people — with a goal to create a future that benefits most people.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"If we build movements to that effect, I think we can end this age of capital. I think we can usher in the age of reform and I think we can resume the idea of democracy as the place we go to change the world."</p>  <hr>  <p><em>* This episode was produced by Philip Coulter.</em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>Because air flow can’t (easily) be seen, newcomers are tempted to use mental models informed by the visible world to speculate on how it behaves. Unfortunately, this intuition often falls short.</p>
<h2 id="intuition-vs-reality">
  Intuition vs. Reality
  <a href="#intuition-vs-reality">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Depicted below is how one would expect air to move around a sphere, with the flow behaving like individual particles that bounce off of the surface. This is known as a “bullet model”.
<img src="https://www.worksaero.com/img/BASICS_1/BM.png" alt="Flow_Wrong"></p>
<p>However, even with this basic flow, intuition is unreliable, as the bullet model is incorrect. The object does act as an obstacle, but fluids flow <em>around</em> things, and not at them. The fluid flows around the body because, in a sense, it has ‘advance warning’ that something is coming, so it reacts early and gets out of the way. Below is a more accurate depiction of the flow.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.worksaero.com/img/BASICS_1/RF.png" alt="Flow_Right"></p>
<p>This distinction may seem obvious, but consider that even the father of modern mathematics and physics, Isaac Newton, incorrectly based his theories of aerodynamics on the bullet model.</p>
<p>Correcting this misconception is an important first step in calibrating an instinct for aerodynamics.</p>

<p>The distinction between streamlined &amp; bluff bodies becomes significant when assessing the drag force acting upon each shape. If the streamlined body is used as baseline, the size of the arrows signifies the relative drag force acting on each one:</p>

<p>Where does a car fall on the streamlined/bluff spectrum?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.worksaero.com/img/BASICS_1/CAR_3.png" alt="Car_CFD"></p>
<p>The automobile has exhibited bluff characteristics for much of its existence. In the past, the customer requirements (aesthetics, interior &amp; cargo room, styling, powertrain packaging..etc) were not in line with the design direction needed to minimize drag. However, with evermore stringent regulations mandating higher fuel efficiency, many features of the streamlined body are now adopted by conventional automobiles.</p>

<p>As a result of the increased attention to aerodynamics, modern road cars have impressively low drag coefficients compared to their counterparts from even just two decades ago.</p>

<blockquote>
  The drag coefficient quantifies the amount of resistance a given shape feels, with lower being better.
</blockquote>

<p>Going forward, auto manufacturers are experimenting with novel methods to incorporate even more features of the streamlined body into the automobile form. For example, the Mercedes Concept IAA has a deployable rear tail extension to further taper it’s trailing edge. This results in a flow field remarkably similar to that of the ideal streamlined shape.</p>

  Concluding Thoughts

</h2>
<p>In review, the same general flow pattern of divergence followed by convergence exists around all objects. However, there is a distinction between streamlined and bluff objects, classifications that fall on two opposite ends of the spectrum. Most real world geometries lie somewhere on that gradient, borrowing features from both.</p>
<p>This article speaks to <em>how</em> the flow generally behaves. <a href="https://www.worksaero.com/docs/fundamentals/energy/">Continue to Part II</a>, where the discussion turns to the mechanisms by which a fluid can accumulate and deploy energy, which begins to answer the <em>why</em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-url="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/3-classic-books-for-tech-leads-or-those-aspiring-to-be" data-title="3 Classic Books for Tech Leads (or those aspiring to be)"><p>Books are the best resource for sharing knowledge in a not-assisted way. They go deep into a topic, or more briefly over a bunch of them. Although, as a Software Engineer, I learned a lot from blog posts, tweets, and conference talks, it was books that prepared me for the <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/tech-lead-everything-software-engineers-need-to-know-to-become-a-great-technology-leader">Tech Lead role</a>.</p>
<p>For this article, I created a list of 3 classic books I consider essential for whose transitioning — or desires to transition — to a leadership position in technology.</p>
<p>Books can teach us many things. It’s familiar to us to feel like there’re too many things to learn and too little time to absorb it. We tend to get anxious and overloaded with the content easily. Relax.</p>
<p>Take your time on reading, and take your time practicing it. Theory and practice converge at some point, and you realize you’ve been a leader for quite some time.</p>
<p>It’s been quite a while since their publication. So, you may notice some old stories during your reading. However, I think they are classic, and as any other book in this category, they aged very well.</p>

<p>Start receiving <strong>hand-picked content<br></strong><span>with high quality from <strong>experienced engineering leaders</strong> in your email regularly!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sourcelevel.io/software-engineering-newsletter">Subscribe to our weekly Newsletter</a></p>

<p>That said, let’s go to the list.</p>
<h2>1. Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams</h2>
<p>The book was first published in 1987. The authors, Tom DeMarco and Timothy R. Lister talk about managing people through lots of stories. The stories may sound outdated and unlikely to happen nowadays, but their essence is still valid.</p>
<p>Many things stated by the two authors are kind of obvious, like<em> how expensive the turnover is, that we should include the team in the hiring process and that methodologies are restrictive</em>.</p>
<p>It’s a fantastic opportunity to recapitulate those topics; <strong>some were written more than 30 years ago</strong>.</p>
<p>Peopleware was the first book that I recall to mention the need for a sociological view, not only a technical one over projects and teams. As such, Tom and Timothy’s theories are still valid.</p>
<p>Among the theories, I how they state the importance of peer view (or <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/everything-about-code-review-from-peer-review-to-automated-code-review">Code Review</a>, in our case), and that knowledge workers, like software engineers, are continuously working their soft and hard skills.</p>
<p>The theories go through the traps of <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/how-tech-leads-and-team-leads-can-measure-teams-productivity">software engineering productivity</a>, how office influences how we work, the impact of quality in our work, and much more.</p>
<h2>2. Driving technical change: Why People on Your Team Don’t Act on Good Ideas, and How to Convince Them They Should</h2>
<p>If you’re new on persuasion and influence, the Driving Technical Change book is an excellent start. It’s full of anecdotes that surface how to gain skeptics buy-in for your ideas. It was published in 2010 and written by Terrence Ryan.</p>
<p>The content works pretty well for <em>an introductory approach on how to expose your ideas, find allies, and, most importantly, check whether your proposals are plausible</em>.</p>
<p>The book also lists some <strong>categories of skepticism, which was very valuable to me</strong>. I could better understand how the team responded to my inclinations and how I responded to others. This awareness is an excellent start for those wanting to manage large teams.</p>
<p>I confess the book is not very practical, and that may be a disadvantage against it. However, it was very relevant when I read it for the first time, and I strongly suggest you read this short (~200 pages) book even though it won’t answer all your questions or tell you exactly what to do.</p>
<h2>3. The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering</h2>
<p>If you thought Peopleware was old because it was published in the late 80s, well, my next recommendation is 15 years earlier.</p>
<p>The Mythical Man-Month by Fred Brooks was<strong> first published in 1975 (almost 50 years ago!)</strong> and covers <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/software-engineering-newsletter">software engineering and management topics</a>.</p>
<p>The author creates the concept of man-month. It’s the unit for the amount of work of a person in a month. Then, he defends that adding more people to a late project makes it later. It’s known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law">Brook’s law</a>.</p>
<p>It relates to the latest and hottest discussions in the agile world about “coordination costs”: <strong>when you increase the number of people in a group, organizing work gets harder</strong>. Thus, it requires more meetings and management efforts to align everybody, which delays the software development even more.</p>
<p>It’s an inspiring book, a classic one, which, in a certain way, is still modern and worth the reading.</p>

<li><b>Capable</b>: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set</li>
<li><b>Simple</b>: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users</li>
<li><b>Data Focused</b>: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm </li>
<li><b>Modular</b>: Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like</li>
<li><b>Fast</b>: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel</li>
<li><b>Productive</b>: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn't fun</li>
</ul>
<p>Bevy has a number of features that I think set it apart from other engines:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bevy ECS</b>: A custom Entity Component System with unrivaled usability and blisteringly-fast performance</li>
<li><b>Render Graphs</b>: Easily build your own multi-threaded render pipelines using Render Graph nodes</li>
<li><b>Bevy UI</b>: A custom ECS-driven UI framework built specifically for Bevy</li>
<li><b>Productive Compile Times</b>: Expect changes to compile in ~0.8-3.0 seconds with the "fast compiles" config</li>
</ul>
<p>It also has many features most people expect from a modern, general purpose engine:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cross Platform</b>: Windows, MacOS, and Linux (with planned support for mobile and web)</li>
<li><b>3D</b>: Lights, meshes, textures, MSAA, and GLTF loading</li>
<li><b>Sprites</b>: Render individual images as sprites, render from sprite sheets, and dynamically generate new sprite sheets</li>
<li><b>Assets</b>: An extensible, event driven asset system that loads assets asynchronously in background threads</li>
<li><b>Scenes</b>: Save ECS Worlds to human-readable scene files and load scene files into ECS Worlds</li>
<li><b>Plugins</b>: All engine and app features are implemented as modular plugins</li>
<li><b>Sound</b>: Load audio files as assets and play them from within systems</li>
<li><b>Multiple Render Backends</b>: Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal (with more on the way thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs">wgpu</a>)</li>
<li><b>Data Driven Shaders</b>: Easily bind ECS components directly to shader uniforms</li>
<li><b>Hot Asset Reloading</b>: Automatically reload changes to assets at runtime without recompiles or restarts</li>
<li><b>Events</b>: Efficiently consume and produce Events from within ECS systems</li>
<li><b>Properties</b>: Dynamically get and set component fields using a string version of their names</li>
<li><b>Hierarchical Transforms</b>: Create parent-child relationships between entities that propagate Transforms down the hierarchy </li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, Bevy is still in the very early stages. I consider it to be in the "prototyping" phase: features are missing, APIs will change, and documentation is sparse. <span>I don't yet recommend using Bevy in serious projects unless you are willing to deal with gaps and instability</span>.</p>
<p>Hopefully at this point you are either (1) jazzed about Bevy or (2) not reading anymore. If you want to dive in right now, <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction/">The Bevy Book</a> is the best place to get started. You can also keep reading to find out what the current state of Bevy is and where we'd like to take it.</p>
<p><strong>Quick note to the reader</strong>: in this article you will find text formatted like this: <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_render/latest/bevy_render/texture/struct.Texture.html"><code>Texture</code>
</a></p>
<p>This formatting indicates that the text is a Rust type that links to API documentation. I encourage you to click on anything that seems interesting to you!</p>
<h2 id="bevy-apps">Bevy Apps</h2>
<p>First, lets see what a Bevy App actually looks like. The simplest App looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Thats it! This App pulls in no features and literally does nothing. Running the program would just immediately terminate. We can make it a little more interesting by doing this:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_default_plugins</span><span>()
        .</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/trait.AddDefaultPlugins.html#method.add_default_plugins"><code>add_default_plugins()</code>
</a> adds all of the features you probably expect from a game engine: a 2D / 3D renderer, asset loading, a UI system, windows, input, etc</p>
<p>You can also register the default <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_app/latest/bevy_app/trait.Plugin.html"><code>Plugins</code>
</a> manually like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>CorePlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>InputPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>WindowPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>RenderPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>UiPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        </span><span>/* more plugins here ... omitted for brevity */
        </span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>And of course you can also create your own plugins. In fact, all engine and game logic is built using plugins. Hopefully now you understand what we mean by modular: you are free to add/remove plugins based on your project's unique needs. However I expect that most people will stick to <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/trait.AddDefaultPlugins.html#method.add_default_plugins"><code>add_default_plugins()</code>
</a> for simplicity, at least initially. </p>
<h2 id="bevy-ecs">Bevy ECS</h2>
<p>All Bevy engine and game logic is built on top of a custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">Entity Component System</a> (or ECS for short). Entity Component Systems are a software paradigm that involves breaking data up into Components. Entities are unique ids assigned to groups of Components. For example, one entity might might have a <code>Position</code> and <code>Velocity</code> component, whereas another entity might have a <code>Position</code> and <code>UI</code> component. Systems are logic that runs on a specific set of component types. You might have a <code>movement</code> system that runs on all entities with a <code>Position</code> and <code>Velocity</code> component.</p>
<p>The ECS pattern encourages clean, decoupled designs by forcing you to break up your app data and logic into its core components.</p>
<p>Unlike other Rust ECS implementations, which require complex lifetimes, traits, builder patterns, or macros, Bevy ECS uses normal Rust datatypes for all of these concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Components</b>: normal Rust structs</li>
<li><b>Systems</b>: normal Rust functions</li>
<li><b>Entities</b>: a type containing a unique integer</li>
</ul>
<p>There are already plenty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rW7ALyHaas">great introductions</a> to the ECS paradigm, so I'll leave "getting up to speed on ECS" as an exercise for the reader and skip right to what makes Bevy's ECS so special:</p>
<h3 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics</h3>
<p>I'm going to make a wild (and unverifiable) claim here: Bevy ECS is the most ergonomic ECS <em>in existence</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

</span><span>struct </span><span>Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>f32</span><span>);
</span><span>struct </span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>f32</span><span>);

</span><span>// this system spawns entities with the Position and Velocity components
</span><span>fn </span><span>setup</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span> Commands</span><span>) {</span><span>
    commands
        </span><span>.</span><span>spawn</span><span>((</span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>),</span><span> Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>),))
        .</span><span>spawn</span><span>((</span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>),</span><span> Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>2.0</span><span>),));
}

</span><span>// this system runs on each entity with a Position and Velocity component
</span><span>fn </span><span>movement</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>position</span><span>: </span><span>Mut</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Position</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>velocity</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>) {</span><span>
    position</span><span>.</span><span>0 </span><span>+=</span><span> velocity</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>;
}

</span><span>// the app entry point. hopefully you recognize it from the examples above!
</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_startup_system</span><span>(</span><span>setup</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_system</span><span>(</span><span>movement</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>That is a complete self-contained Bevy app with automatic parallel system scheduling and global change detection. In my opinion, you <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/specs/blob/master/examples/basic.rs">won't</a> find <a href="https://github.com/TomGillen/legion">any</a> ECS <a href="https://github.com/leudz/shipyard/blob/master/bunny_demo/src/systems.rs">with</a> better <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/tree/master/ECSSamples/Assets/HelloCube">clarity</a> or ergonomics. Building games (and engines) involves writing a large number of systems, so I heavily invested in making ECS code easy to write <em>and</em> easy to read.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>One of the reasons the ECS paradigm is so popular is that it has the potential to make game logic <em>super</em> fast, primarily for these two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Iteration Speed</b>: Components are packed tightly together to optimize for cache-locality, which makes iterating over them blazing fast</li>
<li><b>Parallelism</b>: Systems declare read/write dependencies, which enables automatic and efficient lock-free parallel scheduling</li>
</ol>
<p>Bevy ECS does both of these things about as well as it can. According to the popular <code>ecs_bench</code> benchmark, Bevy ECS is the fastest Rust ECS by a pretty wide margin:</p>
<h4 id="system-iteration-in-nanoseconds-less-is-better">System Iteration (in nanoseconds, less is better)</h4>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/ecs_iter.svg" alt="ecs iter performance graph"></p>
<h4 id="world-setup-in-nanoseconds-less-is-better">World Setup (in nanoseconds, less is better)</h4>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/ecs_build.svg" alt="ecs iter performance graph"></p>
<p>Note that <code>ecs_bench</code> is a single threaded benchmark, so it doesn't illustrate the multi-threading capabilities of these framework. And as always, please be aware that <code>ecs_bench</code> is a micro benchmark and it doesn't illustrate the performance of a complex game. There is a lot of nuance in the ECS performance space and each of the ECS implementations above will perform differently under different workloads. </p>
<p>I have pushed my version of <code>ecs_bench</code> <a href="https://github.com/cart/ecs_bench">here</a> if anyone wants to double-check my methodology. For some reasonable amount of time I will post updates here if anyone reports a problem or my results are not (on average) reproducible.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<p>Now you might be thinking "Ok @cart, so Bevy ECS has great performance and ergonomics, but <em>surely</em> this means you had to compromise on features!"</p>
<p>... <strong>NOPE</strong> Bevy has you covered:</p>

August 11, 2020 | https://parabola.io/blog/why-parabola | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://parabola.io/blog/why-parabola">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Today we’re announcing that <a href="http://parabola.io/">Parabola</a> has raised an $8m Series A led by Matrix Partners, bringing our total raised to just over $10m. Ilya Sukhar from Matrix is joining our board, and we're grateful for participation from Thrive Capital, Elad Gil, AngelPad, Merus Capital, Abstract Ventures, and individual investors.</p><p>We’re also announcing our Shopify integration and focus on helping ecommerce companies (including companies that are newly doing business online) navigate unprecedented times. But before we talk about what that means, let’s start with how we got here.</p><h3>Unequal access to technology</h3><blockquote>“The future is already here, it just isn’t evenly distributed yet.” — William Gibson</blockquote><p>I've always had a productive and positive relationship with technology. Due in large part to luck and circumstance, I learned how to code when I was young and was able to express my creativity through customizing and creating things in the digital world. But most of my friends, relatives, and peers didn’t have the same experience.</p><p>Today, there are two very different kinds of computer users: those who manually operate a computer via much drudgery and those who program computers to do work for them. Most of the benefits have accrued to those who can program a computer.</p><p>We were promised that the Digital Revolution would free us from this manual drudgery so we could unleash our innate creativity and curiosity. However, instead of being empowered, for many the forward march of technology has been a loss of agency. But all hope is not lost — we just need to more evenly distribute the future.</p><h3>Repetitive, manual work</h3><p>Through a journey that took me out of the world of engineering and into the worlds of both finance and ecommerce, I discovered entire industries built around analytical and creative people stuck doing repetitive, manual work in spreadsheets.</p><p>From the marketing analyst compiling yesterday's attribution metrics to the operations team manually refunding returned orders, manual processes were holding these businesses together.</p><p>It wasn’t that they didn’t want new technology. The real problem was that new technology wasn’t being built for the way they work.</p><h3>Parabola</h3><p>It turns out I was far from the only person who cared about this problem. I'm privileged to be joined by a phenomenal team of likeminded people who are similarly driven to help more evenly distribute the future.</p><p>At Parabola, we come to work every day armed with the belief that everyone has the ability to be amazingly analytical, curious, and creative. Unfortunately (even tragically), most people have never been given the tools and encouragement to unleash their ingenuity.</p><p>But what if they were? Every great marketer could try their idea without waiting for engineering resources. Every operations person could solve a problem once and then automate it for the future. Everyone with an interesting insight could build something to test it. In short, the world would have a lot less mundane work and a lot more cool stuff.</p><p>We're building a drag-and-drop productivity tool that lets everyone translate what they want to do into instructions for a computer to do it for them. With a library of customizable, prebuilt steps, you can use Parabola to automate your previously repetitive, manual data tasks with an easy, step-by-step approach. We also have a library of ready-to-use recipes imbued with the subject matter expertise of industry experts to make it even easier to get started and know you're doing things the right way.</p><figure id="w-node-6ab50f968817-9c9ca267"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d9bdcad630fbe7a7468a9d8/5f326dd74ee81a7834df3635_step-by-step.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>We’re just getting started</h3><p>With tens of thousands of users across many thousands of companies, we’ve seen people build incredible things with Parabola. We treasure every story we hear of users building flows in Parabola to take over their manual tasks, freeing up time for more strategic/creative work and achieving huge career growth in the process.</p><p>With the new money, we’re particularly focused on making Parabola easier to use without compromising on its power. With our new Shopify integration, we’re increasingly delivering on that promise for our ecommerce users who are scrambling to shift offline processes online and rapidly scale their operations to meet demand in a time of COVID. But we believe all knowledge workers can benefit immensely from the version of Parabola we’re building towards.</p><p>If you’re excited about this being the last day you do that same manual process in Excel, then welcome to the future. Our support team is ready to help you get set up today at <a href="http://parabola.io/">parabola.io</a>.</p><p>If you’re excited about helping us deliver this ambitious mission, we’ll need a lot more help so we’d love to hear from you. We’re currently hiring across a variety of roles for people with extreme product passion who are looking for a place they can be rewarded for doing the best work they’ve ever done.

    <p><a href="https://github.com/rmpr/atbswp">atbswp</a>: Automate The Boring Stuff With Python (yes like the book) is a multi platform, open source clone of tinytask, and for those who don’t know it, 
the core feature of the software is to allow the users to record their mouse and keyboard actions and reproduce them identically as many times as they want.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0jjSgX5FYk"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/L0jjSgX5FYk/0.jpg" alt="atbswp quick demo"></a></p>


<p>The rest of this post discusses what atbswp is, why it was built, and miscellaneous things related to the project.</p>


<p>atbswp is the result of frustration with tinytask which is not available natively on Unix like systems. With tinytask being discontinued now, the position shifted from multiplatform, 
FOSS clone, to only alternative. The most important thing about atbswp is avoiding feature creep, the software is pretty simple as it and we want to keep it that way.</p>


<p>Many features of tinytask are already present in the current pre-alpha version of atbswp, the one that have not been yet replicated are compile to an executable for the host platform 
and set a replay speed, which are on the roadmap and will be the main focus for the next development. Behind the scenes, atbswp uses a Python file so the power users can always modify
it to their taste.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>You may have heard of the “bus factor.” The strategy and processes designed to cover for the sudden loss of a teammate. The story goes: you want more than one person in your business to have domain knowledge because they might get hit by a bus! Your business would lose all that experience and expertise in one tragic accident. The premise in isolation sounds ridiculous, but mitigating the “bus factor” is serious business.</p><p>Everything gets a lot easier if you select the right software and framework, primarily if you use Ruby on Rails. Rails itself is a full-stack framework that has a best practice for every piece of a web application. If you are committed to doing things “the Rails way,” you cut the total cost of ownership by A LOT. “Staying on the Rails” makes any new developer productive almost immediately (and will keep them “out of the weeds”). Sticking to the standards evangelized by the community and adding proper documentation (possibly in the form of useful tests) makes onboarding a breeze, which creates more productive developers, which makes hiring more accessible, which reduces your “bus factor.” <br></p><p>The only guaranteed way to save money is to spend it on reducing your “bus factor”. By investing in making the code of your application more straightforward and easier to understand, you make it easier to add developers and reduce the future occurrence of bugs. You’ll make working on your code more enjoyable (reducing the likelihood your developers will want to leave), and possibly most importantly: reduce the barriers (time/money) to building new features. If you haven’t been keeping an eye on this, and find yourself in a position to hire someone, then these tasks will be their first job <strong>every time you hire</strong>.<br></p><p>Thankfully, I have no personal experience with a colleague getting hit by a bus, but I know a few that have been hired by Netflix. Remember to look both ways before crossing a street and never underestimate the amount of money the FAANGs have to poach your talent. It is effortless to lose good talent. When (not if) your developer leaves to make $500k+ a year in the valley, you’ll be in a much better position with a lower bus factor to quickly fill the gap and keep moving forward.</p><p>‍</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>After months of work, I am ecstatic to finally announce <strong>Bevy Engine</strong>!</p>
<p>Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine and app framework built in Rust. It is <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">free and open-source</a> forever!</p>
<p>It has the following design goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Capable</b>: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set</li>
<li><b>Simple</b>: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users</li>
<li><b>Data Focused</b>: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm </li>
<li><b>Modular</b>: Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like</li>
<li><b>Fast</b>: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel</li>
<li><b>Productive</b>: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn't fun</li>
</ul>
<p>Bevy has a number of features that I think set it apart from other engines:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bevy ECS</b>: A custom Entity Component System with unrivaled usability and blisteringly-fast performance</li>
<li><b>Render Graphs</b>: Easily build your own multi-threaded render pipelines using Render Graph nodes</li>
<li><b>Bevy UI</b>: A custom ECS-driven UI framework built specifically for Bevy</li>
<li><b>Productive Compile Times</b>: Expect changes to compile in ~0.8-3.0 seconds with the "fast compiles" config</li>
</ul>
<p>It also has many features most people expect from a modern, general purpose engine:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cross Platform</b>: Windows, MacOS, and Linux (with planned support for mobile and web)</li>
<li><b>3D</b>: Lights, meshes, textures, MSAA, and GLTF loading</li>
<li><b>Sprites</b>: Render individual images as sprites, render from sprite sheets, and dynamically generate new sprite sheets</li>
<li><b>Assets</b>: An extensible, event driven asset system that loads assets asynchronously in background threads</li>
<li><b>Scenes</b>: Save ECS Worlds to human-readable scene files and load scene files into ECS Worlds</li>
<li><b>Plugins</b>: All engine and app features are implemented as modular plugins</li>
<li><b>Sound</b>: Load audio files as assets and play them from within systems</li>
<li><b>Multiple Render Backends</b>: Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal (with more on the way thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs">wgpu</a>)</li>
<li><b>Data Driven Shaders</b>: Easily bind ECS components directly to shader uniforms</li>
<li><b>Hot Asset Reloading</b>: Automatically reload changes to assets at runtime without recompiles or restarts</li>
<li><b>Events</b>: Efficiently consume and produce Events from within ECS systems</li>
<li><b>Properties</b>: Dynamically get and set component fields using a string version of their names</li>
<li><b>Hierarchical Transforms</b>: Create parent-child relationships between entities that propagate Transforms down the hierarchy </li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, Bevy is still in the very early stages. I consider it to be in the "prototyping" phase: features are missing, APIs will change, and documentation is sparse. <span>I don't yet recommend using Bevy in serious projects unless you are willing to deal with gaps and instability</span>.</p>
<p>Hopefully at this point you are either (1) jazzed about Bevy or (2) not reading anymore. If you want to dive in right now, <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction/">The Bevy Book</a> is the best place to get started. You can also keep reading to find out what the current state of Bevy is and where we'd like to take it.</p>
<p><strong>Quick note to the reader</strong>: in this article you will find text formatted like this: <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_render/latest/bevy_render/texture/struct.Texture.html"><code>Texture</code>
</a></p>
<p>This formatting indicates that the text is a Rust type that links to API documentation. I encourage you to click on anything that seems interesting to you!</p>
<h2 id="bevy-apps">Bevy Apps</h2>
<p>First, lets see what a Bevy App actually looks like. The simplest App looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Thats it! This App pulls in no features and literally does nothing. Running the program would just immediately terminate. We can make it a little more interesting by doing this:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_default_plugins</span><span>()
        .</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/trait.AddDefaultPlugins.html#method.add_default_plugins"><code>add_default_plugins()</code>
</a> adds all of the features you probably expect from a game engine: a 2D / 3D renderer, asset loading, a UI system, windows, input, etc</p>
<p>You can also register the default <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_app/latest/bevy_app/trait.Plugin.html"><code>Plugins</code>
</a> manually like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>CorePlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>InputPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>WindowPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>RenderPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>UiPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        </span><span>/* more plugins here ... omitted for brevity */
        </span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>And of course you can also create your own plugins. In fact, all engine and game logic is built using plugins. Hopefully now you understand what we mean by modular: you are free to add/remove plugins based on your project's unique needs. However I expect that most people will stick to <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/trait.AddDefaultPlugins.html#method.add_default_plugins"><code>add_default_plugins()</code>
</a> for simplicity, at least initially. </p>
<h2 id="bevy-ecs">Bevy ECS</h2>
<p>All Bevy engine and game logic is built on top of a custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">Entity Component System</a> (or ECS for short). Entity Component Systems are a software paradigm that involves breaking data up into Components. Entities are unique ids assigned to groups of Components. For example, one entity might might have a <code>Position</code> and <code>Velocity</code> component, whereas another entity might have a <code>Position</code> and <code>UI</code> component. Systems are logic that runs on a specific set of component types. You might have a <code>movement</code> system that runs on all entities with a <code>Position</code> and <code>Velocity</code> component.</p>
<p>The ECS pattern encourages clean, decoupled designs by forcing you to break up your app data and logic into its core components.</p>
<p>Unlike other Rust ECS implementations, which require complex lifetimes, traits, builder patterns, or macros, Bevy ECS uses normal Rust datatypes for all of these concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Components</b>: normal Rust structs</li>
<li><b>Systems</b>: normal Rust functions</li>
<li><b>Entities</b>: a type containing a unique integer</li>
</ul>
<p>There are already plenty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rW7ALyHaas">great introductions</a> to the ECS paradigm, so I'll leave "getting up to speed on ECS" as an exercise for the reader and skip right to what makes Bevy's ECS so special:</p>
<h3 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics</h3>
<p>I'm going to make a wild (and unverifiable) claim here: Bevy ECS is the most ergonomic ECS <em>in existence</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

</span><span>struct </span><span>Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>f32</span><span>);
</span><span>struct </span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>f32</span><span>);

</span><span>// this system spawns entities with the Position and Velocity components
</span><span>fn </span><span>setup</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span> Commands</span><span>) {</span><span>
    commands
        </span><span>.</span><span>spawn</span><span>((</span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>),</span><span> Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>),))
        .</span><span>spawn</span><span>((</span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>),</span><span> Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>2.0</span><span>),));
}

</span><span>// this system runs on each entity with a Position and Velocity component
</span><span>fn </span><span>movement</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>position</span><span>: </span><span>Mut</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Position</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>velocity</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>) {</span><span>
    position</span><span>.</span><span>0 </span><span>+=</span><span> velocity</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>;
}

</span><span>// the app entry point. hopefully you recognize it from the examples above!
</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_startup_system</span><span>(</span><span>setup</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_system</span><span>(</span><span>movement</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>That is a complete self-contained Bevy app with automatic parallel system scheduling and global change detection. In my opinion, you <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/specs/blob/master/examples/basic.rs">won't</a> find <a href="https://github.com/TomGillen/legion">any</a> ECS <a href="https://github.com/leudz/shipyard/blob/master/bunny_demo/src/systems.rs">with</a> better <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/tree/master/ECSSamples/Assets/HelloCube">clarity</a> or ergonomics. Building games (and engines) involves writing a large number of systems, so I heavily invested in making ECS code easy to write <em>and</em> easy to read.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>One of the reasons the ECS paradigm is so popular is that it has the potential to make game logic <em>super</em> fast, primarily for these two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Iteration Speed</b>: Components are packed tightly together to optimize for cache-locality, which makes iterating over them blazing fast</li>
<li><b>Parallelism</b>: Systems declare read/write dependencies, which enables automatic and efficient lock-free parallel scheduling</li>
</ol>
<p>Bevy ECS does both of these things about as well as it can. According to the popular <code>ecs_bench</code> benchmark, Bevy ECS is the fastest Rust ECS by a pretty wide margin:</p>
<h4 id="system-iteration-in-nanoseconds-less-is-better">System Iteration (in nanoseconds, less is better)</h4>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/ecs_iter.svg" alt="ecs iter performance graph"></p>
<h4 id="world-setup-in-nanoseconds-less-is-better">World Setup (in nanoseconds, less is better)</h4>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/ecs_build.svg" alt="ecs iter performance graph"></p>
<p>Note that <code>ecs_bench</code> is a single threaded benchmark, so it doesn't illustrate the multi-threading capabilities of these framework. And as always, please be aware that <code>ecs_bench</code> is a micro benchmark and it doesn't illustrate the performance of a complex game. There is a lot of nuance in the ECS performance space and each of the ECS implementations above will perform differently under different workloads. </p>
<p>I have pushed my version of <code>ecs_bench</code> <a href="https://github.com/cart/ecs_bench">here</a> if anyone wants to double-check my methodology. For some reasonable amount of time I will post updates here if anyone reports a problem or my results are not (on average) reproducible.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<p>Now you might be thinking "Ok @cart, so Bevy ECS has great performance and ergonomics, but <em>surely</em> this means you had to compromise on features!"</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_70_858"><div><p>Data Science and storytelling are inseparable. And the bridge between the two is data.</p><p>I had talked about storytelling in my article about <a href="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/data-science/business-analyst-data-scientist-ecosystem/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Analyst/Data Scientist learnings</a> but thought it would be better to elaborate more about the storytelling part.</p><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>Imagine you are a data science executive in an organization. You would be responsible for building machine learning models and analyzing data using statistical techniques to achieve business goals. There will come a time when you will have to present your work to the stakeholders of your project. In a corporate setup, a project has a mix of technical and business stakeholders. Explaining everything to this mixed audience can get tricky. For example –</p><ul><li>How do you explain the complex model building process to a non-technical stakeholder?</li><li>Is it possible to translate model parameters to business actionables and recommendations?</li><li>Is there some way to address this gap?</li></ul><h2>Storytelling to the rescue!</h2><p>Not sure how? Let me explain!</p><p>Data science and machine learning are technical in nature. In other words, it involves complex mathematical computations and methodologies, alongside its implementation in R or python. Hence, intuitively, machine learning models may not be interpretable by a person who does not have a relevant background. Such people might not be able to understand model complexity, computation time, and other model parameters. They may be driven by business goals. They might be more inquisitive about how the model impacts the company’s top-line. Or how well it reflects in numbers on a corporate level.</p><p>In all such situations, there arises a need for a data scientist to assume the role of a storyteller. A data scientist has to make sure that the complex mathematical model yields a fruitful takeaway for every stakeholder involved in the project. They should understand it irrespective of their background in machine learning. Hence, the art of storytelling becomes paramount. Storytelling for data science professionals has the following advantages –&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Helps the stakeholders better understand the value addition of the model</li><li>Increases retention: humans are trained to remember stories better</li><li>Creates a series of logically connected business points leading to the ultimate outcome</li><li>Invokes participation, generates interest</li></ol><p>I will be honest, I have experienced similar situations. Situations where I had to present a solution to a set of stakeholders with varying levels of expertise in machine learning and data science algorithms. After experimenting with different storytelling formats, I would like to tell you about the one which I prefer the most.</p><h2>How can I improve my storytelling skills?</h2><p>I like to call my method of storytelling the “<strong>What-Why-How</strong>” format.</p><p>To understand the framework better, consider the following scenario –&nbsp;</p><p>John was working on a project to predict employee attrition in the organization for over a month. Today is D-day. He is in the meeting room with all the stakeholders involved in the project. After exchanging pleasantries, he starts the presentation.&nbsp;</p><p>“<em>Good afternoon everyone. The data provided to us exhibit non-linear behavior. Hence, we have created a machine learning model called Support Vector Machines with an RBF kernel in python. After doing a grid search for hyperparameters, we were able to estimate that the model performs best with C=1 and gamma = 0.1. The accuracy of the model is 95%</em>”</p><p>There is a silence for 5 seconds. Moreover, some of the stakeholders look confused.&nbsp;</p><p>But, as a data scientist, achieving 95% accuracy should have made everyone happy.&nbsp;</p><h3>What went wrong?</h3><p>Well, John did not realize that the meeting does not have only technical stakeholders. There are stakeholders from the finance and human resources department of the organization as well. He needed to translate his model into a language that the finance and human resources stakeholders could understand.</p><h3>The “What-Why-How” framework</h3><p>The <strong>What-Why-How framework</strong> helps you break down the business problem into 3 parts.</p><ul><li>What was the business problem?</li><li>Why did we want to address that business problem?</li><li>How did we solve the problem (followed by its impact and recommendations)</li></ul><p>Once we are able to translate the project in the above framework, we facilitate –</p><ul><li>A better understanding of the business problem</li><li>Its impact</li><li>Efficacy of the suggested solution</li></ul><p>Consequently, there is an actionable takeaway for every stakeholder that they can implement. (Each machine learning model should always be followed by a set of recommendations for the stakeholders)</p><p>For better understanding, let us try and break the attrition problem into the <strong>What-Why-How framework</strong>.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>What is the problem?</strong></td><td><strong>Why to address it?</strong></td><td><strong>How can we solve it?</strong></td></tr><tr><td>High employee attrition rate in the organisation</td><td><br>1: High investment for the organisation to hire a new employee<br>2: Leads to lowering of employee moral</td><td>1: Machine learning models to estimate what factors contribute the most to attrition<br>2: Helps the human resource department to make informed data decision based on employee feedback</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Some of the insights that John could have presented to the stakeholders are –</p><ul><li>Employees that have stayed in the organization for more than 2 years are less likely to leave</li><li>High average overtime leads to high attrition</li><li>Employees who left did not receive any promotion in the last 2 years</li></ul><p>When the model presents such insights to the human resource stakeholders, they will have a set of actionable insights based on which they can take subsequent actions. Hence, rather than telling them that the model accuracy was 95% with a given set of hyperparameters, John could have told them how the model will impact the organization as a whole. This would have resonated with the stakeholders. They would have related to it better.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>In the present scenario, where the technology advancements have made the model building process quick and easy, it has become essential for a data science professional to upskill themselves with the trend. What machines have not been able to do till now, is to make stories out of the data. To create a series of logically connected events to engage with the stakeholders. There is a need to cohesively bind business acumen the data science skills. Hence, every data science professional or an enthusiast should focus on building stories out of the data, not just models.</p><p>I would like to end this article by saying – Do not just be a data scientist, be a storyteller.</p><p>This brings us to the end of this article. Until next time, keep learning!</p></div></div></div>]]>

    </span></p>
<p>Hello dear readers,</p>
<p>Today’s article is about some experiments I’ve been doing with Tekton CI/CD + Prometheus.</p>
<p>Continuous Integration and Deployment is becoming more and more a hot topic - everyone wants a 100% automated, flawless, fast, code integration, and deployments. </p>
<p><strong>But how can a team or a company achieve that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Usually</strong> is a step-by-step process and not a ready-to-install solution (if there’s one though, please tell me !! ;) ).</p>
<p>For that reason, metrics will help you to keep track of your CI/CD improvements and to understand what needs to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Luckily, if you are using <strong>Tekton</strong>, there are some very useful metrics by default.</p>
<p>Honestly, I couldn’t find enough documentation on the metrics exposed by Tekton. However, after a few experiments, I came up with a list of what (in my opinion) are the most valuable metrics.</p>
<p>The demo I’ve prepared uses Prometheus as a backend to collect and display metrics, but note that others backends (such as StackDriver/Cloud Monitoring) are supported too. </p>
<h3>Tekton CI/CD: Useful Indicators</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>metric</th>
<th>description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>tekton_go_*</code></td>
<td>These metrics are all about the GO status: memory used, allocated, GC, and more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>tekton_running_{taskruns or pipelineruns}_count</code></td>
<td>How many taskruns or pipelineruns are in status “running”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>tekton_pipelinerun_count</code></td>
<td>Simple PipelineRuns counter</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>tekton_taskrun_count</code></td>
<td>Simple TaskRuns counter</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>tekton_{taskruns or pipelineruns}_duration_seconds_count</code></td>
<td>This is basically another counter and is incremented by 1 on every observe</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>tekton_{taskruns or pipelineruns}_duration_seconds_sum</code></td>
<td>This is basically another counter and is incremented by the value of the observation</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Some useful PromQL expressions for Tekton:</h3>
<h4>PipelineRun duration</h4>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>tekton_pipelinerun_duration_seconds_sum{pipelinerun="app-ci-run-bzl48"} / tekton_pipelinerun_duration_seconds_count{pipelinerun="app-ci-run-bzl48"}</code></pre></div>
<h4>PipelineRun duration trend</h4>
<p><em>If pipelines start to show and increasing trend in duration this value will increase as well.</em></p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>rate(tekton_pipelinerun_duration_seconds_sum{pipelinerun="xxx"}[5m]) / rate(tekton_pipelinerun_duration_seconds_count{pipelinerun="xxx"}[5m])</code></pre></div>
<h4>Check PipelineRuns failures</h4>
<p><em>If more than 15% of the PipelineRuns are failing this rule will apply</em></p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>tekton_pipelinerun_count{status="failed"} * 100 / ignoring(status) tekton_pipelinerun_count{status="success"} &gt; 15</code></pre></div>
<h4>Check TaskRuns failures</h4>
<p><em>If more than 15% of the TaskRuns are failing this rule will apply</em></p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>tekton_taskrun_count{status="failed"} * 100 / ignoring(status) tekton_taskrun_count{status="success"} &gt; 15</code></pre></div>
<h4>Monitor the Tekton Controller</h4>
<p>The 2 metrics below are more likely to expose issues related to K8s rather than Tekton:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>tekton_workqueue_adds_total -&gt; 
It’s the number of required actions per unit time. 
A high value could indicate problems in the cluster of some of the nodes.

------

tekton_workqueue_depth -&gt; 
It’s the number of actions waiting in the queue to be performed. 
It should remain in low values.</code></pre></div>
<p>These are very basic examples, and there’s other cool stuff that you can do with these indicators. You could, for example, monitor how many pods/resources have been allocated into a project, how much time users are wasting in retries, how many seconds are wasted on latency, pods latency, Workqueues and so on!</p>
<p>Measuring pipelines is, in my opinion, something that every company who wants to move towards a data-driven mindset should do.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;How to setup Tekton to use Prometheus</h3>
<p>As stated before, Tekton comes with Prometheus as default backend. The user just needs to ensure that metrics are enabled on the Tekton configuration.</p>
<p>Inside the namespace where the Tekton Pipeline Controller is installed, there is a configmap called “observability” or “tekton…-observability”. Inside that configmap, there’s the configuration that will then be used by Knative/Tekton Controller to expose metrics.</p>
<p>The observability configuration is explained here:
<a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/edc453934a183d44fde739dc24d6ca6b25cdeb6b/config/config-observability.yaml">https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/edc453934a183d44fde739dc24d6ca6b25cdeb6b/config/config-observability.yaml</a></p>
<p>Once Tekton is configured, the only bit missing is the related Service Monitor to allow the Prometheus Operator to scrape the exposed metrics!</p>
<p>The service monitor configuration should look like:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  annotations:
    meta.helm.sh/release-name: prometheus-operator-1595779515-custom-sm

      app.kubernetes.io/component: controller

    path: /metrics
    interval: 15s</code></pre></div>
<p>That’s all from me, hope you enjoyed today’s article :)</p>

<p>By <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ryanbed">Ryan Bednar</a></strong> (CEO of <a href="https://www.rankscience.com/">RankScience</a>)</p>
<p><span>Last week on July 29, 2020, the CEOs of the most powerful tech companies in the world—including Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple—were called in to testify in front of the House Antitrust Subcommittee. The event was widely considered to be mostly political theater, a performance act for Congress to look like they’re hard on Big Tech. But the tech titans took it seriously, knowing the one thing that actually determines whether antitrust legislation moves forward: how each company fares in the court of public opinion. The company taking the most heat from both Democrats and Republicans was, without a doubt, Google. They’re also the company that’s most likely to be regulated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The antitrust case against Google is the most straightforward of any of the big tech companies. Google started out as an almost benevolent index of the world wide web, showing users ten blue, unbiased links for whatever users were searching for. But over the years, Google has steadily favored showing their own products above organic search results, even when their own products arguably aren’t as good. Rand Fishkin </span><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/google-in-2020-from-everyones-search-engine-to-everyones-competitor/"><span>says that</span></a><span> in 2020, Google has gone “from everyone’s search engine to everyone’s competitor.”</span></p>
<p><span>As the founder of an SEO company, </span><a href="https://www.rankscience.com/"><span>RankScience</span></a><span>, and as someone who’s been working in growth and digital marketing for more than a decade, I’ve had a front-row seat to watch Google devour screen real estate to feature its own products. From my point of view, Google is squeezing businesses more than ever and the game is increasingly rigged in Google’s favor. Small and local businesses have almost no chance at succeeding with SEO because they don’t have the budget or resources for it. To make things worse, so much screen real estate is now taken up by Google’s own products, small businesses have no choice but to pay Google for search traffic. Even if users are searching directly for a business’s name, Google controls the appearance and experience of interacting with that business.</span></p>
<p><span>Local restaurants, for example, are forced to use Google’s partner ChowNow in order to have convenient “Order Pickup” or “Order Delivery” buttons in search results for their own name, which charges an added hefty fee to the restaurant for each order, hurting their already thin margins. During the global pandemic, this is an incredibly predatory shakedown. No small business should be forced to use Google’s preferred ordering mechanism, and pay a tax to Google, simply to allow a customer to search for their business. </span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7745-582x1024.png" alt="google chownow local businesses" width="582" height="1024" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7745-582x1024.png 582w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7745-171x300.png 171w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7745-768x1351.png 768w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7745-600x1055.png 600w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7745.png 821w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px"></p>

<p dir="ltr">Ben Thompson of Stratechery wrote a great post summarizing the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/tech-and-antitrust/">antitrust issues each tech behemoth has</a>, yet highlights his issues with Google’s position: “Google’s anticompetitive behavior is relatively clear…the company consistently favors its own properties in search results, particularly ‘above-the-fold’…that is, results that are not actually search results but which seek to answer the user’s query directly.” A few examples:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-10.23.49-AM.png" alt="ben thompson stratechery google antitrust regulation issues" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-10.23.49-AM.png 419w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-10.23.49-AM-300x179.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px"></p>
<p><span>Take a look below at how Google-owned YouTube results take up the vast majority of the screen on a simple video search. Other competing video products like Vimeo or Twitch don’t get the same visual treatment or preference in search results. You can barely see the first organic search result for this query:</span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-929x1024.png" alt="google YouTube video search results" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-929x1024.png 929w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-272x300.png 272w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-768x847.png 768w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-600x662.png 600w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM.png 956w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px"></p>

<p><span>The problem gets even worse when we’re talking about more lucrative search categories, like flight search or finding a hotel. On the flight search example below (which also includes a Covid-19 travel warning), Google Ads and Google’s own Flights product take up the entire screen, any organic search results pushed below the fold. When searching for “hotels near cape may, nj” the actual organic search results were almost two pages below the fold. How many users do you think scroll that far, instead of clicking on Google’s products?</span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/google-flight-search-seo.png" alt="google flight search seo antitrust" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/google-flight-search-seo.png 443w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/google-flight-search-seo-260x300.png 260w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px"> </p>
<p><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/google-hotel-search.png" alt="google hotel search" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/google-hotel-search.png 255w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/google-hotel-search-149x300.png 149w" sizes="(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px"></p>
<p><span>Yelp, TripAdvisor, and other companies have been complaining about unfair treatment by Google </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/technology/yelp-google-european-union-antitrust.html"><span>for years</span></a><span>, but left unfettered, Google is only going to continue to expand their own products into more search categories over time. The list of companies with grievances against Google is growing. The landscape for businesses to compete in search is increasingly competitive, and the companies who succeed in search over the long-run are using advanced tactics like SEO A/B testing and NLP content optimization, which the average business can’t afford.</span></p>
<p><span>On a recent episode of the </span><a href="https://www.allinpodcast.co/"><span>All-In Podcast</span></a><span>, Jason Calacanis, Chamath Palihapitiya, and esteemed guests engage in a rigorous and detailed debate about Big Tech antitrust and censorship (I recommend </span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Ewtt593ZsFT5QXJSB97wR?si=Ej5Bx4UMRwqrU4ruSog06w"><span>giving it a listen</span></a><span> if you haven’t, as it covers the strongest arguments both for and against Big Tech regulation). Chamath says what I think most people don’t want to admit:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><b>The internet is now a pervasive and critical part of human infrastructure. As such, there needs to be people that regulate and manage the internet</b><span>—the same way that the FAA manages and regulates planes, and wind turbines, etc.… Let’s take aviation [for example], it’s impossible for you to go into your garage and build a plane that takes people from point A to point B. Take agriculture [for example], it’s impossible for you to build up a farm and supply it to Safeway, without any checks and balances.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are very specific kinds of businesses and business models that should be overseen. The first and most important thing is a body [that] oversees the collection of user data and privacy and identification. The second one is essentially something that tears the fig leaf off of internet companies and says, you know what, you are the equivalent of a publisher and a platform, some weird hybrid that we didn’t think could exist when we wrote these rules, so we’re now going to adapt these rules. If you think about it, nobody is happy with the internet publishers today. The left thinks that it skews right, the right thinks it skews left—everybody is confused. Nobody gets what they want and somebody has to step in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You go to a movie and it tells you who can go to the movie or not. You buy an album and it tells you whether there’s explicit lyrics or not. Before you turn on the TV, there’s some rating agency that tells you whether your kid should be watching with you. My point is: what is the equivalent version here? We all need to think about what it is, but for there to be nothing is crazy.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Google search is fundamentally the gateway to the internet for the majority of people and an arbiter of truth in our digital age. Google has a </span><a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/"><span>dominant market monopoly position</span></a><span>, a treasure trove of sensitive information on hundreds of millions of users. It’s incentivized to return value to shareholders and extract more value from search over time, which is at odds with doing right by businesses and citizens. Their business model doesn’t require them to act in the long-term interest of businesses and citizens, and because they have a monopoly on a utility that’s become essential to our day-to-day lives, the only solution is for the government to enforce guidelines on fair behavior within search.</span></p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> We recently raised 1,5M euros from LocalGlobe, Seedcamp, Kima &amp; Tiny.vc. This funding will allow us to focus on building a community of early adopters &amp; contributors around our open search engine <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch">MeiliSearch</a>.</p><p>We are still at the very beginning of our open source adventure and we are thrilled to see that more and more people believe in this project. This is our first fundraise and it means the world for the Meili team 🎉</p><h3 id="meili-got-funded-">Meili got funded!</h3><p>Meili SAS (the company) was created in November of 2018 with the idea of building an alternative to existing search engine APIs like Algolia. After some successes and failures as a team and company, we decided to raise some money to keep focus on building MeiliSearch and its ecosystem.</p><p>We believe that an exceptionalsearch experience on websites and applications should be the norm, not an exclusive feature. Thus we are building the most straightforward technology for developers to offer state-of-the-art search to their users, scaling from the tiniest of operations all the way up to enterprise.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.meilisearch.com/content/images/2020/08/david-armstrong-srpE-a5W418-unsplash.jpg"></figure><h2 id="how-we-got-there">How we got there</h2><p>MeiliSearch has been open source since the <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/open-source-or-not/">earliest days</a> of its development. As developers, we made our project accessible on GitHub from day one but without the idea of being an "open source company". First and foremost we set out to make a simpler alternative to Algolia for smaller businesses who needed something more developer-friendly and affordable.</p><p>After describing our project to many developers, we quickly realize that one of the main differences from Algolia was that MeiliSearch is open source. Still we weren't using open source as a force.</p><p>In late 2019, after some substantial discussion within the team, we decided to <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/to-open-source-and-beyond/">fully commit to orienting the business around open source</a>. We could not quietly bootstrap anymore since we decided to build a community around our project to get feedback and contributions from external developers. </p><p>We wrote our <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/meilisearch-beta-release/">Beta release blog post</a> for MeiliSearch in November of 2019. Since then we have been working hard at making MeiliSearch the new obvious choice for developers when it comes to building a search box.</p><p>Charlotte, who joined us in August of 2019, did an incredible job of directing the writing and making of our <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/">documentation</a> while Clémentine, who joined us one month later, took charge of developing the <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides">SDKs and integrations</a> to ease the use of MeiliSearch.</p><h2 id="fundraise">Fundraise</h2><p>In late 2019 we began to meet with investors because we knew we wouldn't be able to develop the business without help from industry veterans.</p><div><p>The first key meeting that we had was with <a href="https://twitter.com/ale6_">Alexis from Kima</a> who helped us make our pitch understandable to VCs. Alexis was presented to us as <code>THE investor who understand tech</code> in Paris. Not only did he understood what we wanted to build, he also did an amazing job at introing us to relevant funds regarding our stage &amp; business 😁 </p><p> Then from meeting to meeting we met the different persons we are now working with: <a href="https://twitter.com/mishmashkautsan?lang=en">Mish</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/knightwebb/?originalSubdomain=uk">Louis</a> from <a href="https://localglobe.vc/">LocalGlobe</a> as lead investor, <a href="https://twitter.com/siahouchangnia?lang=en">Sia</a> from <a href="https://seedcamp.com/">SeedCamp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ale6_">Alexis</a> from <a href="https://www.kimaventures.com/">Kima</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/pmoe?lang=en">Philipp</a> from <a href="https://www.tiny.vc/">Tiny.vc</a>.</p></div><p>The deal we made with the VCs is that we develop the community and the usage around MeiliSearch while we better understand the use-cases of our search engine. From there we will be able to generate revenue. <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/meilisearch-open-business-plan-v0-1/">Our business plan is publicly available</a> as a iteratively developed document.</p><h2 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h2><h3 id="core-features">Core features</h3><p>We made an <a href="https://github.com/orgs/meilisearch/projects/2">open roadmap on GitHub</a>, and we will publish more roadmap communications in the coming weeks to get better feedback on what developers need in a search engine API.</p><p>There are some features that we know we need to build in order to be competitive as a search engine backend (basic analytics and authorization system 🚧) that are already planned. We are also discussing with developers &amp; companies to gain more insight on features that should be game-changers in the enterprise search industry!</p><h3 id="integrations-documentation">Integrations &amp; Documentation</h3><p>All of this work around MeiliSearch would not make any sense if MeiliSearch is not used. To ease the integration of MeiliSearch we are building different <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides">SDKs</a> in different languages and improving our <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/">documentation</a> every week. </p><p>We want anyone to be able to integrate MeiliSearch in any common programming environment in less than 5 minutes. Today, with our most mature front- and back-end libraries you should be able to setup a proof-of-concept in less than an hour. We are hard at work shaving off those remaining 55 minutes to get where we want to be.</p><h3 id="open-source-values">Open source &amp; values</h3><p>As we learn to build a commercial open source software company, we are thriving for transparency on everything we do. To raise awareness around open source sustainability, Erlend is publishing a podcast called <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/value-in-open-1-posthog/">Value in Open</a>. We already have our first episode released, and the second one should follow shortly 😁</p><figure><img src="https://blog.meilisearch.com/content/images/2020/08/kelly-sikkema-XX2WTbLr3r8-unsplash-1.jpg"></figure><p><br>We are delighted and excited about the future of MeiliSearch 😁 if you want to reach us for anything, <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/resources/contact.html">please feel free to do so</a>!</p>

<p>Dramatic title, I know, but lately I've had a few people ask me what extensions I use, and through sharing my list I've learnt of even better ones, so what better way to amplify these positive effects than to leverage the internet? 😛</p><p>Without further ado, let's jump into it.</p><h3 id="privacy-badger-ublock-origin"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp">Privacy Badger</a> + <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">UBlock Origin</a></h3><p>Let's block all the ads! Sites look cleaner, load waayy faster, and pry less. These are the first extensions I install on <em>any</em> browser. </p><h3 id="nano-defender"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nano-defender/ggolfgbegefeeoocgjbmkembbncoadlb?hl=en">Nano Defender</a></h3><p>Let's block all the anti-adblockers! Many sites these days will try to get you to turn off your adblocker, but once you set up <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nano-defender/ggolfgbegefeeoocgjbmkembbncoadlb?hl=en">Nano Defender</a>, you'll no longer have to deal with that. Note: To use alongside Ublock Origin, I had to go through a <a href="https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/#extra-installation-steps-for-ublock-origin">few extra steps</a> first.</p><h3 id="hover-unpaywall-bypass-paywalls"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hover-bypass-paywalls-sub/ajbennpkmbahpfdalicgaogjbfhngeok/related">Hover</a> + <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unpaywall/iplffkdpngmdjhlpjmppncnlhomiipha?hl=en">Unpaywall</a>/ ByPass Paywalls</h3><p>Let's block all the login/paywalls! Are you starting to see a pattern here? 😛 The web can be full of thrash sometimes. With <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hover-bypass-paywalls-sub/ajbennpkmbahpfdalicgaogjbfhngeok">Hover</a> &amp; <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unpaywall/iplffkdpngmdjhlpjmppncnlhomiipha?hl=en">Unpaywall</a>, I can say goodbye to Medium and journal paywalls. If you're a fan of open source and have an extra minute to spend, check out this <a href="https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome">extension</a> instead.</p><h3 id="shut-up"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shut-up-comment-blocker/oklfoejikkmejobodofaimigojomlfim?hl=en">Shut Up</a></h3><p>Sometimes when I'm consuming content, I'll be tempted to see what others are saying about it. That's... not always good. Let these xkcd comics illustrate my point:</p><figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/youtube.png" alt="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/youtube.png"></figure><figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/listen_to_yourself.png" alt="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/listen_to_yourself.png"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.maskys.com/content/images/2020/08/image.png"></figure><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shut-up-comment-blocker/oklfoejikkmejobodofaimigojomlfim?hl=en">Shut Up</a> disables comments everywhere. When I trust a platform's audience enough to read the unfiltered outputs from their brains, I enable comments for just that site. Sometimes I turn it back off immediately 💀</p><h3 id="reader-mode"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reader-mode/llimhhconnjiflfimocjggfjdlmlhblm?hl=en">Reader Mode</a></h3><p>Occasionally, even after all these purges, the content on a site will still be ridiculously hard to read- sometimes because they used a funky font and set the size to 8px, or sometimes because there are a million other article suggestions, plus three sidebars, plus an obnoxious navigation header that never goes away. In cases like these, I just use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reader-mode/llimhhconnjiflfimocjggfjdlmlhblm?hl=en">Reader Mode</a>.</p><h3 id="grammarly"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en">Grammarly</a></h3><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en">Grammarly</a> effortlessly corrects any pesky spelling and grammatical mistakes I make.</p><h3 id="video-speed-controller"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en">Video Speed Controller</a></h3><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en">Video Speed Controller</a> allows you to control the playback speed on any site. Set the default pace to 1.10x and you'll go through videos 10% faster without even noticing. Or if you're on other end of the spectrum like me, and Youtube's 2x doesn't match your pace, set it to 2.5x+ to get through lengthy monologues as fast as possible 😼</p><h3 id="the-great-suspender"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg?hl=en">The Great Suspender</a></h3><p>Makes Chrome use less resources by suspending tabs you're not using. Computers run much more smoothly when this is enabled, especially if you're a compulsive tab opener.</p><h3 id="tab-snooze"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-snooze/pdiebiamhaleloakpcgmpnenggpjbcbm?hl=en">Tab Snooze</a></h3><p>Ran into an interesting rabbit hole or website that you'd really like to check out, but don't have the time right now? Use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-snooze/pdiebiamhaleloakpcgmpnenggpjbcbm?hl=en">Tab Snooze</a>, and it'll magically reopen the tabs later.</p><h3 id="google-keep-notion-web-clipper"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-keep-chrome-extens/lpcaedmchfhocbbapmcbpinfpgnhiddi?hl=en">Google Keep</a>/ <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notion-web-clipper/knheggckgoiihginacbkhaalnibhilkk?hl=en">Notion Web Clipper</a></h3><p>I used to use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-keep-chrome-extens/lpcaedmchfhocbbapmcbpinfpgnhiddi?hl=en">Google Keep</a> heavily before, to save snippets and links and to add my own notes to the stuff I read online, but I've started moving towards <a href="https://blog.maskys.com/my-best-chrome-extensions/notion.so">Notion</a> these days, as it's a lot more organized. An important feature both have is that they're cross-platform, which means I can type out a fresh thought on my phone and flesh out the concept on my PC later.</p><h3 id="news-feed-eradicator-for-facebook"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en">News Feed Eradicator for Facebook</a></h3><p>I rarely use FB these days, and that's in large part thanks to this extension. I can just pop in to share something interesting or to tell people NOT to message me on Messenger, without being sucked in by the infinite feed.</p><h3 id="minimal-twitter"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimal-twitter/pobhoodpcipjmedfenaigbeloiidbflp?hl=en">Minimal Twitter</a></h3><p>I do use Twitter, and this completely cleans up the interface.

<p>Fred is on your team. He takes 5 times longer to build a feature than anyone else. When asked what’s the hold up, Fred responds that he’s tweaking a class definition or adding some out of scope automation instead of just building the dang thing that the ticket says to build. Fred drives the team nuts, and he often gets called a gold plater, or unproductive, or slow. </p>



<p>But in my experience, Fred isn’t slow at all. He’s just as productive as everyone else, but he’s solving different problems than the ones he was asked to solve.</p>



<p><strong>Fred is more interested in providing value to other developers than to users.</strong> </p>



<p>Your team probably pushes back on that. Fred’s feedback (if he gets any at all, which is a topic for another post) is that he needs to work on his velocity and get through his tickets faster. In other words, you’re telling him to stop doing the thing that he loves. He can’t just change his interest, so the best case scenario is that he’ll push hard for a few months on the boring stuff until he burns out and quits, or falls back into his old habits.</p>



<p>Maybe Fred doesn’t need to change. Maybe he’s just <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/331248">in the wrong seat</a>. What if the team leaned into what gets Fred excited? If he doesn’t care about providing value to users, but loves providing value to his fellow developers, then could that be his full time job? His responsibilities could include:</p>



<ul><li>Automating anything that can possibly be automated</li><li>Making local environments run faster and smoother</li><li>Refactoring and managing tech debt</li><li>Quick and thorough code review</li><li>Streamlining the deploy process</li><li>Writing missing automated tests</li></ul>



<p>Doesn’t it seem powerful, to have a person on your team completely dedicated to helping other developers be as productive as they can be? Imagine reaching out to Fred the second you had code ready for review, or when a build fails and you aren’t sure why, or when your can’t figure out why your debugger stopped debugging, or when you notice that some function over here basically does the same thing as some other function over there. </p>



<p>He loves that stuff, and he’s probably really good at it, because as they say, “being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ points”. So maybe try letting him do it?</p>

August 11, 2020 | http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>WebAssembly (wasm) allows code written in languages other than JavaScript to run on browsers. If you haven’t been paying attention, all the major browsers support wasm and <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=wasm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">globally more than 90% of users</a> have browsers that can run wasm.</p>
<p>Since Rust compiles to wasm, is it possible to build SPAs (Single Page Applications) purely in Rust and without writing a single line of JavaScript? The short answer is YES! Read on to learn more or visit the <a href="https://rustmart-yew.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo site</a> if you can’t contain your excitement!</p>
<p>We’ll be building a simple ecommerce site called “RustMart” that will have 2 pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>HomePage - list all the products that the customer can add to cart</li>
<li>ProductDetailPage - show the product details when a product card is clicked</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application/rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I’m using this example as it tests the minimal set of capabilities required to build modern SPAs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate between multiple pages without page reload</li>
<li>Make network requests without page reload</li>
<li>Ability to reuse UI components across multiple pages</li>
<li>Update components in different layers of the UI hierarchy</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Setup"><a href="#Setup" title="Setup"></a>Setup</h2><p>Follow this <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> to install Rust if you haven’t done so already.</p>
<p>Install these Rust tools:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo install wasm-pack          # Compile Rust to Wasm and generate JS interop code
$ cargo install cargo-make         # Task runner
$ cargo install simple-http-server # Simple server to serve assets</code></pre>
<p>Create a new project:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo new --lib rustmart &amp;&amp; cd rustmart</code></pre>
<p>We’ll be using the <a href="https://yew.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Yew</code></a> library to build UI components. Let’s add this and wasm dependencies to <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

[dependencies]
yew = "0.17"
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"</code></pre>
<p>Create a new file named <code>Makefile.toml</code> and add this:</p>
<pre><code>[tasks.build]
command = "wasm-pack"
args = ["build", "--dev", "--target", "web", "--out-name", "wasm", "--out-dir", "./static"]
watch = { ignore_pattern = "static/*" }

[tasks.serve]
command = "simple-http-server"
args = ["-i", "./static/", "-p", "3000", "--nocache", "--try-file", "./static/index.html"]</code></pre>
<p>Start the build task:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo make build</code></pre>
<p>If you’re new to Rust, I’ve written some <a href="http://www.sheshbabu.com/tags/Rust-Beginners/">guides for beginners</a> which will help you follow this post better.</p>
<h2 id="Hello-World"><a href="#Hello-World" title="Hello World"></a>Hello World</h2><p>Let’s start with a simple “hello world” example:</p>
<p>Create <code>static/index.html</code> and add this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>html</span> <span>lang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>en<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>

    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>title</span><span>&gt;</span></span>RustMart<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>title</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>module<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>

<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Add this to <code>src/lib.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>

<p>Lot of things going on but you can see that we’re creating a new component named “Hello” that renders <code>&lt;span&gt;Hello World!&lt;/span&gt;</code> into the DOM. We’ll learn more about Yew components later.</p>
<p>Start the serve task in a new terminal and load <code>http://localhost:3000</code> in your browser</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo make serve</code></pre>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application/image-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It works!! It’s only “hello world” but this is fully written in Rust.</p>
<p>Let’s learn about components and other SPA concepts before proceeding further.</p>
<h2 id="Thinking-in-Components"><a href="#Thinking-in-Components" title="Thinking in Components"></a>Thinking in Components</h2><p>Building UIs by composing components and passing data in a unidirectional way is a paradigm shift in the frontend world. It’s a huge improvement in the way we reason about UI and it’s very hard to go back to imperative DOM manipulation once you get used to this.</p>
<p>A <code>Component</code> in libraries like React, Vue, Yew, Flutter etc have these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to be composed into bigger components</li>
<li><code>Props</code> - Pass data and callbacks from that component to its child components.</li>
<li><code>State</code> - Manipulate state local to that component.</li>
<li><code>AppState</code> - Manipulate global state.</li>
<li>Listen to lifecycle events like “Instantiated”, “Mounted in DOM” etc</li>
<li>Perform side effects like fetching remote data, manipulating localstorage etc</li>
</ul>
<p>A component gets updated (re-rendered) when one of the following happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parent component is re-rendered</li>
<li><code>Props</code> changes</li>
<li><code>State</code> changes</li>
<li><code>AppState</code> changes</li>
</ul>
<p>So, instead of imperatively updating the UI when user interaction, network requests etc happen, we update the data (Props, State, AppState) and the UI is updated based on this data. This what someone means when they say “UI is a function of state”.</p>
<p>The exact details differ across different libraries but this should give you a general idea. If you’re new to this, this way of thinking might take sometime to “click” and get used to.</p>
<h2 id="HomePage"><a href="#HomePage" title="HomePage"></a>HomePage</h2><p>Let’s build the HomePage first. We’ll be building the HomePage as a monolithic component and later decompose it into smaller reusable components.</p>
<p>Let’s create the following files:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>use</span> yew<span>:</span><span>:</span>prelude<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>*</span><span>;</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> Home <span>{</span><span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> Component <span>for</span> Home <span>{</span>
    <span>type</span> Message <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        Self <span>{</span><span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>fn</span> <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> _<span>:</span> Self<span>:</span><span>:</span>Message<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> ShouldRender <span>{</span>
        <span>true</span>
    <span>}</span>

        <span>html!</span> <span>{</span> <span>&lt;</span>span<span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>"Home Sweet Home!"</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>span<span>&gt;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>mod</span> home<span>;</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>use</span> home<span>:</span><span>:</span>Home<span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Let’s update the <code>src/lib.rs</code> to import the HomePage component:</p>
<pre><code>  // src/lib.rs
<span>+ mod pages;</span>

<span>+ use pages::Home;</span>
  use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
  use yew::prelude::*;

<span>- struct Hello {}</span>

<span>- impl Component for Hello {</span>
<span>-     type Message = ();</span>
<span>-     type Properties = ();</span>

<span>-     fn create(_: Self::Properties, _: ComponentLink&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Self {</span>
<span>-         Self {}</span>
<span>-     }</span>

<span>-     fn update(&amp;mut self, _: Self::Message) -&gt; ShouldRender {</span>
<span>-         true</span>
<span>-     }</span>

<span>-     fn change(&amp;mut self, _: Self::Properties) -&gt; ShouldRender {</span>
<span>-         true</span>
<span>-     }</span>

<span>-     fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Html {</span>
<span>-         html! { &lt;span&gt;{"Hello World!"}&lt;/span&gt; }</span>
<span>-     }</span>
<span>- }</span>

  #[wasm_bindgen(start)]
  pub fn run_app() {
<span>-   App::&lt;Hello&gt;::new().mount_to_body();</span>
<span>+   App::&lt;Home&gt;::new().mount_to_body();</span>
  }</code></pre>
<p>Now, you should see “Home Sweet Home!” instead of “Hello World!” rendered in your browser.</p>
<p>Let’s start designing the <code>State</code> of this component:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to store a list of products retrieved from server</li>
<li>Store the products the user has added to cart</li>
</ul>
<p>We create a simple struct to hold the <code>Product</code> details:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> Product <span>{</span>
    name<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
    description<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
    image<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
    price<span>:</span> f64<span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>We then create a new struct <code>State</code> with field called <code>products</code> to hold the products from server:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> State <span>{</span>
    products<span>:</span> Vec<span>&lt;</span>Product<span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Here’s the full list of changes in the HomePage component:</p>
<pre><code>  use yew::prelude::*;

<span>+ struct Product {</span>
<span>+     id: i32,</span>
<span>+     name: String,</span>
<span>+     description: String,</span>
<span>+     image: String,</span>
<span>+     price: f64,</span>
<span>+ }</span>

<span>+ struct State {</span>
<span>+     products: Vec&lt;Product&gt;,</span>
<span>+ }</span>

<span>- pub struct Home {}</span>
<span>+ pub struct Home {</span>
<span>+     state: State,</span>
<span>+ }</span>

  impl Component for Home {
      type Message = ();
      type Properties = ();

      fn create(_: Self::Properties, _: ComponentLink&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Self {
<span>+       let products: Vec&lt;Product&gt; = vec![</span>
<span>+           Product {</span>
<span>+               id: 1,</span>
<span>+               name: "Apple".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               description: "An apple a day keeps the doctor away".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               image: "/products/apple.png".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               price: 3.65,</span>
<span>+           },</span>
<span>+           Product {</span>
<span>+               id: 2,</span>
<span>+               name: "Banana".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               description: "An old banana leaf was once young and green".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               image: "/products/banana.png".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               price: 7.99,</span>
<span>+           },</span>
<span>+       ];</span>

<span>-       Self {}</span>
<span>+       Self {</span>
<span>+           state: State {</span>
<span>+               products,</span>
<span>+           },</span>
<span>+       }</span>
      }

      fn update(&amp;mut self, _: Self::Message) -&gt; ShouldRender {
          true
      }

      fn change(&amp;mut self, _: Self::Properties) -&gt; ShouldRender {
          true
      }

      fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Html {
<span>+        let products: Vec&lt;Html&gt; = self</span>
<span>+            .state</span>
<span>+            .products</span>
<span>+            .iter()</span>
<span>+            .map(|product: &amp;Product| {</span>
<span>+                html! {</span>
<span>+                  &lt;div&gt;</span>
<span>+                    &lt;img src={&amp;product.image}/&gt;</span>
<span>+                    &lt;div&gt;{&amp;product.name}&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>+                    &lt;div&gt;{"$"}{&amp;product.price}&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>+                  &lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>+                }</span>
<span>+            })</span>
<span>+            .collect();</span>
<span>+</span>
<span>+        html! { &lt;span&gt;{products}&lt;/span&gt; }</span>
<span>-        html! { &lt;span&gt;{"Home!"}&lt;/span&gt; }</span>
      }
  }</code></pre>
<p>The <code>create</code> lifecycle method is invoked when the component is created and this is where we set the initial state. For the time being, we’ve created a mock list of products and assigned it to the <code>products</code> inside the state as initial value. Later, we’ll fetch this list using network request.</p>
<p>The <code>view</code> lifecycle method is invoked when the component is rendered. Here we’ve iterated over <code>products</code> inside state to generate product cards. If you’re familiar with React, this is same as the <code>render</code> method and the <code>html!</code> macro is similar to <code>JSX</code>.</p>
<p>Save some random images as <code>static/products/apple.png</code> and <code>static/products/banana.png</code> and you’ll get this UI:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application/image-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s implement the “add to cart” functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>We keep track of all products added to cart in a new state field called <code>cart_products</code></li>
<li>We render a “add to cart” button for each product</li>
<li>Add logic to update the <code>cart_products</code> state when “add to cart” button is clicked</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>  use yew::prelude::*;

<span>+ #[derive(Clone)]</span>
  struct Product {
      id: i32,
      name: String,
      description: String,
      image: String,
      price: f64,
  }

<span>+ struct CartProduct {</span>
<span>+     product: Product,</span>
<span>+     quantity: i32,</span>
<span>+ }</span>

  struct State {
      products: Vec&lt;Product&gt;,
<span>+     cart_products: Vec&lt;CartProduct&gt;,</span>
  }

  pub struct Home {
      …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>B J Fogg is a Stanford professor who came up with a simple model of behavior that helps us understand why we take action or not take action at any given moment.</p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model"><p>According to FBM, there are three things we need to do something:</p><ul><li>Motivation</li><li>Ability</li><li>Trigger</li></ul><p>The key is that we need to have all three at the same time in order to act.</p><p>Since our problem is procrastination, we'll focus on how we fail at each one of these.</p><h2>Motivation X Procrastination</h2><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm_no_motivation.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model - no motivation"><p>Sometimes we have the ability to do something, and even have a trigger like a time window and a to-do item, but we don't feel motivated.</p><p>We stare at a list of tasks, and stare, and stare, and none of them seem particularly exciting.</p><p>So we do something else - procrastinate.</p><p>The thing is,&nbsp;<strong>motivation doesn't come out of the blue.</strong></p><p>We often have a fantasy in our heads of ourselves, sitting down to work, feeling inspired and tearing into work with a smile on our faces.</p><p>That's often not how it goes.</p><p>On the days when we don't feel motivated,&nbsp;<strong>we need to build motivation.</strong></p><h3>How to build motivation</h3><p>We feel motivated when we viscerally feel how an action is&nbsp;<strong>meaningful, or valuable</strong>&nbsp;to us and when we&nbsp;<strong>believe we can</strong>&nbsp;take it (we'll get to this in the next part).</p><p>Therefore, we don't feel motivated when we don't see the meaning or value hiding behind a to-do item.</p><p>What to do about it then?</p><p><strong>Remind yourself of the why.</strong></p><p>There probably was a reason why you wrote down a task or got one assigned to you.</p><p>Was it to help you learn something?        Was it to make you money?        Was it to help someone?</p><p>Take a task you're putting off, and try to remember in vivid detail why you thought you needed to do it.</p><p>The important part is not only to know the reason, but to feel it, to get excited about it. How to do that? Link the task to a personal goal that you want to achieve. Attach exciting reasons to the task.</p><p><em>Write a thesis</em>&nbsp;  - not motivating.</p><p>Write a thesis to successfully complete a degree and do cutting-edge research.<br>Write a thesis to deepen your understanding of a subject and get recognized by others in your field.<br>Write a thesis to help others see things more clearly and make progress.</p><p><strong>Add personal, meaningful reasons to the tasks that you put off. Make yourself remember why you took them on.</strong></p><h2>Ability X Procrastination</h2><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm_no_ability.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model - no ability"><p>Sometimes we feel motivated, but every task on our plate seems just too darn hard, like standing at the foot of 5 different mountains in the Himalayas and having to decide which one to climb.</p><p>When everything seems hard, it's easy to succumb to procrastination and check email, or social media, or play games. All those actions are much easier than&nbsp;<em>work.</em></p><p>But when&nbsp;<strong>we're finally done with our procrastination, we'll often find that our work hasn't gotten any easier while we procrastinated.</strong>&nbsp;In fact, it seems even harder.</p><p>That's clearly not a good cycle.</p><p>Instead of avoiding anything hard, let's&nbsp;<strong>turn down the difficulty dial by focusing on small steps.</strong></p><p>You probably can't climb the whole mountain at once, but you can ascend a few hundred feet.        You probably can't write a whole thesis at once, but you can write 5 paragraphs.        You probably can't build a business at once, but you can write a blog post, or design a prototype, or contact 10 prospects.</p><p>In short, you need to&nbsp;<strong>break it down</strong>&nbsp;into pieces you are able to complete.</p><h3>How to break work down</h3><p>With mental work, it's often not obvious what all the things we need to do are.</p><p>We need to identify them, to list them.</p><p>If you need to create a presentation, you'll need to research the topic, find images, create the slides, and rehearse. Those are 4 distinct types of activity, 4 smaller pieces that you can take on, one by one.</p><p>When you break down work into parts, it becomes clearer what you feel you can or cannot do.</p><p><strong>Identify the distinct parts that form the whole.</strong></p><p>But even when you identify the parts, they can still intimidate you and seem too hard in their own right. What to do then?</p><p><strong>Create a simple timeline.</strong></p><p>We aren't naturally good at planning work through time. We don't look at a task like "Create a sales report" and see a detailed calendar in our heads with all the tasks neatly organized.</p><p>But we can learn to do that. How?</p><p>We just need a simple timeline.</p><p>It doesn't have to be complicated.</p><ol><li>Start with the due date.</li><li>Go back day by day (or week by week) and write down what you'd like to have done by then, until you arrive at today.</li><li>Put this timeline where you'll see it (remember: out of sight, out of mind).</li><li>Start working on the first piece of the puzzle.</li></ol><p>You might have a 20 slide presentation you'll be delivering 10 days from now.</p><p><em>Day 10</em>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Rehearse 3x and deliver presentation</li></ul><p><em>Day 9</em></p><ul><li>Add finishing touches</li><li>List sources</li></ul><p>...</p><p><em>Day 5</em></p><ul><li>Create first 10 slides</li></ul><p><em>Day 3</em></p><ul><li>Write out the main points</li></ul><p><em>Day 2</em></p><ul><li>Read through the materials</li></ul><p><em>Day 1</em></p><ul><li>Make a list of at least 10 articles and other resources to use</li></ul><p>Even a simple, bulleted timeline like this can make a large project more manageable and ensure that you have the time to learn what you need to do to be able to accomplish your mission.</p><h2>Trigger X Procrastination</h2><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm_no_trigger.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model - no trigger"><p>And sometimes, we feel motivated and able, but we don't know where to start - we're missing a trigger.</p><p>Professional athletes have a coach. Coach is the person who says what to do, and when. Their job is about motivating, cultivating ability, and giving triggers.</p><p>Now do this, now that, now this here, now rest. There's a tight, minute-by-minute plan.</p><p>As a result, the athletes know exactly what to focus on at any given moment.</p><p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<strong>modern work often doesn't have a built-in trigger.</strong></p><p>A professor doesn't tell you when to research, when to write an outline, when to start writing, when to stop writing, when to edit... there are no stopwatches, only vague directions and loooong time windows (days, weeks, months - not minutes).</p><p>As a result,&nbsp;<strong><em>we</em>&nbsp;have to make the decision to start—we have to trigger ourselves into action.</strong></p><p>In effect, we often leave the trigger to circumstance - we start working just before a deadline because we suddenly understand that if we don't start RIGHT NOW, we won't make it. Deadline becomes the only trigger we obey.</p><p>But that doesn't make for a consistent work ethic and healthy work-related confidence.</p><h2>How to add a trigger</h2><p>The key to an effective trigger is a sense of&nbsp;<em>I'm supposed to be doing this, right now.</em></p><p>The timeline exercise from the previous section can help with the first part - identifying a concrete task that will be triggered. However, a timeline doesn't provide us with a&nbsp;<em>cue.</em></p><p>We need to&nbsp;<strong>create a cue.</strong></p><p>One moment that can be used as a trigger is sitting down to work.&nbsp;<strong>When you sit down to work, you can take your to-do list and give yourself 5-15 minutes to decide which task to start with.</strong>&nbsp;If you don't know after the time has passed, pick one at random.<br>Cue #1: sitting down to work = time to find the first task.<br>Cue #2: time limit ends = time to work.</p><p>Another cue takes a little foresight and preparation.</p><p><strong>At the end of one work day, determine where you want to start the next day and put it into your calendar.</strong></p><p>Want to start writing a doc for your teammate? Put it on your calendar at 9–9:30AM, add a reminder and a link to the doc.</p><p>Want to start with a brainstorm? Take a sheet of paper, write the topic in its center, and put it on your desk so that it's the first thing you see tomorrow morning.</p><p>Want to start by looking up flights for a business trip? Download a picture of a plane and make it your wallpaper.</p><p>You can be as creative as you want, but the main point is this:<br><strong>define a specific task to do, at a specific place, at a specific moment in time - and make sure you can't miss the cue.</strong></p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model"><p>That's it.</p><p>Build up your motivation by reinforcing personal, meaningful reasons to do something.</p><p>Break down complex tasks into simple parts and plan them through time by creating a simple timeline.</p><p>And define a concrete trigger that will help you start your work.</p><br><hr><p><a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/how-to-stop-procrastinating-by-using-the-fogg-behavior-model-part-2">Read How to stop procrastinating by using the Fogg Behavior Model - Part 2 here</a></p></article></div>]]>

This is important because the shape will be needed by the convolution layer. We’ll use this shape later to reshape the size of the input data.</p><pre><span id="2997">x_train.shape</span><span id="9e48">(60000, 28, 28)</span></pre><p id="c58b">We kick off by initializing the <strong>sequential</strong> model. Then we pass in our layers as a list. The first layer is the <strong>reshape</strong> layer for changing the shape of the input data. We already know that each image has a size of 28 by 28. We also pass 1 to the reshape layer to ensure that the input data has a single color channel.</p><p id="320f">Next, we create the convolution layer. This layer takes in a couple of parameters:</p><ul><li id="9f47"><strong><em>filters</em></strong> — the number of output filters in the convolution, i.e the number of feature detectors. 32 is a common number of feature detectors used.</li><li id="266b"><strong><em>kernel_size</em></strong> — the dimensions of the feature detector matrix. This is the width and height of the convolution window.</li><li id="95d7"><strong><em>input_shape</em></strong> — the shape of the input data. Since we included a reshape layer, we don’t need to pass this.</li><li id="a1c3"><strong><em>activation</em></strong> — the activation function to be uses. The <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/rectified-linear-activation-function-for-deep-learning-neural-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReLu activation function</a> is a common choice.</li></ul><p id="9830">The next item on the list is to add the<strong> pooling layer.</strong> In this step, the size of the <strong>feature map</strong> is reduced by taking the maximum value during the pooling process. 2 by 2 is a commonly-used pool size. This will reduce the size of the feature map while maintaining the most important features needed to identify the digits.</p><p id="d2e9">After that, we <strong>flatten</strong> the feature maps. This will convert the<strong> </strong>feature maps into a single column.</p><p id="ecea">The results obtained above are then passed to the <strong>dense layer</strong>. The parameters passed to this layer are the number of neurons and the activation function. In this case, those are 128 and ReLu, respectively.</p><p id="f796">Finally, we created our <strong>output layer</strong>. 10 is used here, because our dataset has 10 classes. We’ll use the <strong>softmax activation function </strong>because<strong> </strong>classes are mutually exclusive—an image can’t be, for example, classified as numbers 0 and 1 at the same time. If the case was otherwise, we’d use the <strong>sigmoid activation function</strong>.</p><pre><span id="88d8">model = Sequential([</span><span id="e17a">Reshape((28, 28, 1)),</span><span id="5886">Conv2D(filters=64,kernel_size=(3,3),activation=’relu’),</span><span id="c4ed">MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2)),</span><span id="c5bd">Flatten(),</span><span id="e185">Dense(128, activation=’relu’),</span><span id="7053">Dense(10, activation=’softmax’)</span><span id="99ce">])</span></pre><h2 id="fa74">Compiling the Network</h2><p id="8a88">We now need to apply <strong>gradient descent</strong> to the number. This is done at the compile stage. We pass the following parameters:</p><ul><li id="4091"><em>optimizer</em> — the type of gradient descent to use; in this case, we’ll use stochastic gradient descent</li><li id="24ca"><em>loss</em> — the cost function to use. We use <code>sparse_categorical_crossentropy</code><em> </em>because the classes are integer-encoded. Had we performed one-hot encoding, we’d have to use the categorical cross-entropy loss function.</li><li id="6fd9"><em>metrics</em> — the evaluation metrics to monitor; in this case, accuracy</li></ul><pre><span id="f23b">model.compile(optimizer=’sgd’,</span><span id="1b59">loss=’sparse_categorical_crossentropy’,</span><span id="d899">metrics=[‘accuracy’,])</span></pre><p id="3cb4">Next, we fit the training set to the network. <code>epochs</code> is the number of rounds the data will pass through the network. <code>validation_data</code> is the test dataset that will be used to evalutate the performance of the model during training.</p><pre><span id="f3be">model.fit(x=x_train,y=y_train,epochs=5,validation_data=validation_data)</span></pre><h2 id="404d">Evaluating the Network</h2><p id="ced8">We can now check the performance of the network. We do so using the <code>evaluate</code> function, passing in the test set. The first item in the result produced is the <code>loss</code>, and the second is the <code>accuracy</code>.</p><pre><span id="b542">model.evaluate(x_test,y_test)<br>313/313 [==============================] - 2s 8ms/step - loss: 0.1116 - accuracy: 0.9668<br>[0.1115519180893898, 0.9667999744415283]</span></pre><h2 id="c6d5">Checking the Predictions</h2><p id="e655">Let’s now see if our network is able to correctly identify a digit.

This idea took root and, over the years, we've gradually started tackling the surrounding challenges, such as:</p><ul><li><p>a fast and reliable build system much needed in front-end development, </p></li><li><p>various JS interop features that spawned an ecosystem of well typed libraries,</p></li><li><p>a production-ready standard library,</p></li><li><p>and recently, a fresh, solid syntax.</p></li></ul><p>These developments have attracted many people into our community. But one bigger challenge persisted: newcomers dropped out at the sheer amount of extra incongruent tools and learning overhead from having to understand OCaml concepts, Reason concepts, and BuckleScript's own concepts. Take, for example, what's required to make a ReasonReact app:</p><ul><li><p>Knowledge of React.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of JS.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of ReasonReact's specific idioms (that we've tried hard to keep to a minimum).</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of OCaml idioms, on top of which BuckleScript is built.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of BuckleScript's JS interop and the build system.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of the Reason syntax.</p></li></ul><p>Ironically, the more documentation we pile up, the more mental overhead newcomers suffered. During the various BuckleScript &amp; Reason meetups, we've frequently seen folks' enthusiasm crushed at the sheer prospect of making a web app while keeping 5+ tabs' worth of documentations open. This was discouraging, both for said eager developers and for us maintainers. </p><p>The adoption barrier is real, and it's about time we finally solve it.</p><p>Today, we'll start to truly unify the various BuckleScript-related projects under a single name: ReScript. This includes:</p><ul><li><p>The compiler, the build system and the syntax unified and shipping under a single install. Likewise for future efforts such as editor plugin.</p></li><li><p>A single documentation site which covers the above: <a href="https://rescript-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">rescript-lang.org</a>.</p></li><li><p>Streamlined communication through said website, a <a href="https://forum.rescript-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">new dedicated forum</a> and a new <a href="http://twitter.com/rescriptlang" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter account</a>.</p></li><li><p>The renaming of various tools, always in a backward-compatible way.</p></li></ul><p>In short, all JS-related tools are now called ReScript. Previously, due to the messy situation, most real-world BuckleScript adoption came from a few heroic community members suffering through the technical and social risk of spreading our tech to their coworkers. From today onward, you can simply tell to your coworkers: "this is ReScript", and point to them a clear starting point instead of sending them to various incompatible sources, with a risk of losing goodwill and credibility.</p><p>It's worth emphasizing that while this rebranding seems to be very disruptive, in reality it's mostly a bunch of name changes for the same tech. To reiterate our stance on existing userland code:</p><ul><li><p>Please read our <a href="https://reasonml.org/blog/a-note-on-bucklescripts-future-commitments" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous post</a> on backward compatibility with pure OCaml &amp; Reason syntax.</p></li><li><p>The current Reason website will keep existing, with proper redirects to our new one when relevant. Existing Reason-to-JS users' code keep working, as per above post. Reason itself will continue tackling the parts BuckleScript didn't tackle before, such as native.</p></li><li><p>The various BuckleScript binaries will keep working. Instead of renaming those, we'd create new binaries instead.</p></li><li><p>The BuckleScript docs will redirect to the new site without breaking links.</p></li></ul><p>Thank you for your support and keep shipping. A brighter future awaits us!</p><p>Stay safe,</p><p>The ReScript team (Bob, Cheng, Cristiano, Maxim, Patrick, Ricky).</p></div></div></div>]]>

But with Vue 3's new features, it's likely to upgrade our projects to an upper level. I guess the most thrilling feature in Vue 3 would be the composition APIs.

"Filters" is Deprecated(Removed)</a></h2><p>I think a lot of people think that <code>filters</code> is maybe an awesome feature of Vue.js. It indeed works well in Vue's template engine. (For example, data formatting / calculation etc).</p><p>Let's see how Vue 3 doc explains why <code>filters</code> is removed:</p><blockquote><p>While this seems like a convenience, it requires a custom syntax that breaks the assumption of expressions inside of curly braces being "just JavaScript," which has both learning and implementation costs.</p></blockquote><p>I believe it's nothing bad for development without the <code>filters</code>, even though it may cost you extra time on migrating to Vue 3. In my projects, the appearance of <code>filters</code> is pretty a rare case since I could replace such functionality with a <code>method</code> or <code>computed</code> easily. Because in my opinion, <code>method</code> / <code>computed</code> has higher readability than the <code>filters</code>.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

Since steel’s decline more than 30 years ago, the Mon Valley community has suffered from chronic disinvestment.</p>  <p>“When you look at what changed, it was the community aspect of it. It’s like, let’s get back to relying on one another and building up ourselves,” Reyes says as traffic rolls through Braddock’s commercial district, a sparse collection of businesses scattered among empty storefronts and vacant lots.</p>  <p>Reyes is the director of Neighbors Helping Neighbors, a grassroots group that links volunteers with people who need services such as a car ride or home repair. The goal, Reyes says, is to establish an “alternative economy.”</p> <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/IMG_6592.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/IMG_6592.jpg" alt="As director of the grassroots group Neighbors Helping Neighbors, Jona Reyes has helped to build a network of about 200 residents who can offer and solicit services such as car rides or home repairs.

About five years ago, involveMINT developed a digital currency, called “time credits,” to share with people who invest their time in the community. The East Liberty-based venture initially focused its efforts in Pittsburgh’s Hazelwood neighborhood. But by working with Neighbors Helping Neighbors, the group hopes to begin circulating time credits in and around Braddock.</p>  <p>So far, involveMINT and Neighbors Helping Neighbors have enlisted about 10 local businesses to accept the credits as payment. While the units <a href="https://www.theselc.org/community-currencies-faq">are considered taxable earnings</a>, they reflect a deeper contribution to the community, said involveMINT executive director Dan Little.</p>  <p>“Money is scarce in the communities that arguably would need it most,”&nbsp; Little noted of the lack of funding in places like Braddock. “So the idea is [that] by having an alternative currency, you’re creating an alternative channel for commerce to happen, when that money is not available.”</p>  <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/IMG_6595.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/IMG_6595.jpg" alt="Dan Little, executive director of involveMINT, began to develop time credits as an alternative form of currency in 2015. His organization first arranged a program in Hazelwood, where participants earn time credits for collecting food waste and turning it into compost. They can redeem the credits at Dylamato's Market in Hazelwood.

The idea <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2006/02/11/local-currencies-ithaca_cz_el_money06_0214local.html#eb379bf5b4cd">grew especially popular during the Great Depression</a>, when market failures dried up the supply of cash in circulation. Propronents say alternative currencies help to stimulate local economies by encouraging firms and residents to do business with others who participate in their community's homegrown currency system.</p>  <p>Little added that COVID-19, and the economic turmoil it has caused, further underscore the value of reducing communities’ reliance on dollars.</p>  <p>Although the federal government has <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center#eligibility">distributed coronavirus stimulus payments to qualifying households</a>, Little noted, “for many people, that barely covers rent … And with local businesses, we know that they have seen a tremendous decrease in revenue.”</p>  <p>By using time credits created, or minted, by involveMINT, Little said, businesses can establish a new source of revenue, and use those funds to buy more supplies locally. Little noted that the coronavirus pandemic has revealed the fragility of global supply chains.</p>  <p>“[The new currency] may not be a panacea. It’s not going to pay for everything. But it’s going to get [users] some access to things that are local,” Little said.</p>  <p><strong>‘It will help to unify the community’</strong></p>  <p>COVID-19 prompted Neighbors Helping Neighbors and involveMINT to launch a grocery delivery service as one option for earning time credits. The program aims to help those who are vulnerable to the disease and, thus, should avoid stores.</p>  <p>Retiree Cynthia Underwood is one of several community members who have signed up to make deliveries. Her clients include seniors such as Myrtle Walker, who’s physically unable to go down stairs. In fact, when Underwood makes a delivery, the 72-year-old drops a key from her second-floor apartment window so that Underwood can let herself in.</p> <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/myrtle_walker_2.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/myrtle_walker_2.jpg" alt="Braddock resident Myrtle Walker relies on an oxygen generator to manage her lung disease.

Each unit is supposed to be worth a dollar. But for Underwood, a native of Rankin, the most important benefit is the possibility that participants will invest in each other.</p>  <p>“I think it will help to unify the community a little more and have people have a more vested interest in each other,” Underwood said.</p>  <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/IMG_6623.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/IMG_6623.jpg" alt="Cynthia Underwood previously worked for the Internal Revenue Service, but now that she's retired, she volunteers frequently in Pittsburgh's east suburbs.

Grow Pittsburgh’s director of farm education, Denele Hughson, said time credits are rooted in the same philosophy as her organization, which strives to empower communities like Braddock to draw on existing assets to cultivate their own food economies.</p>  <p>Hughson noted that her organization can use the time credits to buy compost from the local company Worm Return. And she said Grow Pittsburgh will use the units to pay for a few additional hours of work at its urban farm.</p>  <p>“Someone who’s just looking to volunteer for a few hours a week, and in exchange for that they actually get something tangible that they can use it on&nbsp;– I think that would be amazing,” Hughson said.</p>  <p><strong>‘Funny money?’</strong></p> <p>The success of any currency, including the dollar, depends on whether people trust it. And whether they trust it depends on how much they see others use it.</p>  <p>Circulation has been a challenge for local currencies elsewhere. In Ithaca, N.Y., for example, a currency called Ithaca HOURS went defunct after about two decades. Erik Lehmann was the last person to chair the Ithaca HOURS board.</p>  <p>“Towards the end, it was basically like a coupon,” he said of the HOURS. “It wasn’t a full currency. Most vendors that accepted it didn’t accept it at full face value.”</p> <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/grow_pittsburgh_farm_stand.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/grow_pittsburgh_farm_stand.jpg" alt="Grow Pittsburgh is one of about 10 local organizations that have agreed to accept time credits as payment.

While at one time about 300 businesses had signed up to accept the HOURS, Lehamann said, “There weren’t the Wegman’s and the big banks and the big landlords."</p>  <p>In Philadelphia, a local currency called Equal Dollars <a href="https://generocity.org/philly/2014/07/14/equal-dollars-alternative-currency-out-of-circulation-after-19-years/">faced a similar hurdle</a>, though it too had been in circulation for about 20 years. Former Equal Dollars director Deneene Brockington said, because most businesses had nowhere to spend Equal Dollars, they simply donated them to charities of their choosing.</p>  <p>“That kind of resonated with some people and some local businesses: They got to participate in something local and then donate to a community organization that then was able to use those dollars as a way to thank their people for community service,” Brockington said.</p>  <p>Equal Dollars ultimately dissolved in 2014 because, Brockington said, the nonprofit that ran it, Resources for Human Development, decided to stop funding the program. Brockington noted that staffers like her, who managed the Equal Dollars program, still needed to be paid in U.S. dollars. After all, they couldn't use alternative currency to pay their bills.</p>  <p>Scott Morris, who is leading an effort to launch a new currency in Ithaca, called Ithacash, has also struggled to secure funding for personnel.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><code>#100DaysOfCode</code> is a great engagement to refresh some of the concepts that are basic, but extremely important.  Today, I spent time on refreshing my memory on JavaScript's equality operators and methods. Thought, why not to write about it?</p>
<p>Traditionally JavaScript provides 2 special operators for equality comparison:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>==</code> for Abstract Equality Comparison which performs a loose equality between the operands.</li>
<li><code>===</code> for Strict Equality Comparison which performs a strict equality between the operands.</li>
</ul>
<p>With ES6, we have one more way to perform the <code>Same-value equality</code> using <code>Object.is</code> method. In this article, we will get deeper in understanding the usage, impact and use-cases of all of them.</p>

<p>Abstract equality comparison(aka, loose equality comparison) compares two values for equality, after converting both the values into a common type. In this type of comparison, <code>type coercion</code> is performed by JavaScript.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us understand this with an example. Consider two different animals from the type Rodent, i.e, hamsters and guinea pigs. I have no doubts that, the equality comparison with <code>==</code> is going to return <code>true</code> by coercing their type to rodent.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1597131508222/pQgOeyb0E.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>In programming,</p>
<pre><code><span>true</span> == <span>1</span> 
<span>'0'</span> == <span>0</span> 
[<span>9</span>, <span>2</span>] == <span>'9,2'</span> 
<span>""</span> == <span>0</span> 
</code></pre>
<p>You would find the <code>==</code> operator strange, if you are new to the JavaScript and holding your experiences of value comparisons from another programming language. </p>
<p>That's not all. The <code>==</code> operator also has an evil sister called, <code>!=</code>. It does just the opposite comparison of two values to check if they are not equal. However, just like <code>==</code>, it also does a type conversion which leads to confusions.</p>

<p>With strict equality comparison, guinea pigs and hamsters are not equal as, <code>===</code> compares two values for equality. Neither of the values are implicitly converted(coerced) to some other value before being compared. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Strict Equality Comparison, If the values have different types, the values are considered unequal.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code><span>true</span> === <span>1</span> 
<span>'0'</span> === <span>0</span> 
[<span>9</span>, <span>2</span>] === <span>'9,2'</span> 
<span>""</span> === <span>0</span> 
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>===</code> also has an angel sister called, <code>!==</code> which helps in finding if two values are strictly not equal. We should be using the strict type(<code>===</code> and <code>!==</code>) comparison over the loose type(<code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>) comparison <strong>almost</strong> always. </p>
<p>But why almost? Why not always?</p>
<p>The <code>===</code> handles <code>NaN</code>, <code>-0</code>, and <code>+0</code> bit differently.</p>
<pre><code><span>NaN</span> === <span>NaN</span> 
+<span>0</span> === <span>-0</span> 
</code></pre>
<p>Strict equality treats <code>NaN</code> as unequal to every other value, including itself. It also doesn't care about the difference between +0 and -0. Now for some situations, these differences may matter and the strict equality may fail there.</p>

<p>With ES6, we have a new way to determine if the two values are same.</p>
<pre><code><span>Object</span>.is(<span>0</span>, <span>0</span>) 
<span>Object</span>.is(<span>null</span>, <span>null</span>) 
<span>Object</span>.is(<span>undefined</span>, <span>undefined</span>) 
<span>Object</span>.is(<span>true</span>, <span>1</span>) 
<span>Object</span>.is(+<span>0</span>, <span>-0</span>) 
<span>Object</span>.is(<span>NaN</span>, <span>NaN</span>) 
</code></pre>
<p>From <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is">MDN</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two values are the same if one of the following holds:</p>
<ul>
<li>both undefined</li>
<li>both null<ul>
<li>both true or both false</li>
<li>both strings of the same length with the same characters in the same order</li>
<li>both the same object (means both object have same reference)</li>
<li>both numbers and</li>
<li>both <code>+0</code></li>
<li>both <code>-0</code></li>
<li>both <code>NaN</code></li>
<li>or both non-zero and both not NaN and both have the same value</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us try answering couple of questions based on the concepts we have learned so far,</p>
<h3 id="why-do-you-think-the-output-is-false-in-all-the-cases-">Why do you think, the output is <code>false</code> in all the cases?</h3>
<pre><code><span>let</span> obj1 = {name: <span>'GreenRoots'</span>};
<span>let</span> obj2 = {name: <span>'GreenRoots'</span>};

obj1 == obj2 
obj1 === obj2 
<span>Object</span>.is(obj1, obj2); 
</code></pre>
<p>It is because, JavaScript has five primitive data types that are <code>passed by value</code>: Boolean, String, Number, null, and undefined.</p>
<p>Rest of the data types are called non-primitives and those are mostly Objects(yes, including Array, Function and Object itself). These non-primitives types are <code>passed by reference</code>.</p>
<p>Hence both obj1 and obj2 above holds the value as the different memory locations that they are created on. Hence the comparison will be <code>false</code> always.</p>
<p>Here is an article that shows the Object reference concepts visual way,</p>

<h3 id="do-you-think-the-object-is-comparison-result-really-matters-over-">Do you think the <code>Object.is</code> comparison result really matters over <code>===</code>?</h3>
<p>Yes it does. React uses <code>Object.is</code> algorithm to compare the state.  Find a great explanation of it <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/swlh/using-es6-map-with-react-state-hooks-800b91eedd5f">in this article</a> by Avinash Ega.</p>

<p>Here is a comparison chart with sample values compared using, <code>==</code>, <code>===</code> and <code>Object.is</code>:</p>

<section>
	<h3>1. Create data segment</h3>
	<p>Convert each character to bits. For numeric and alphanumeric modes, consecutive characters are grouped together before being encoded into bits. For byte mode, a character produces either 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits.</p>

<p>If you are someone like me who spends hours and hours a day typing then you
might be interested in investing in learning how to properly type, more
precisely on learning how to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing">touch-type</a>.
My story begins 2 years ago when I saw one person typing so fluently and elegantly with almost no effort, focusing on
the result and not the process that it triggered in me to start noting how
badly I was typing and how badly many others were typing.</p>
<p>The problem is that almost all people are a self-taught typist and everyone
with their technique, this technique is usually correlated with inefficiency,
and sometimes speed. I saw many people typing very fast with only 4 fingers, which
in result makes more noise by jumping from one letter to another very fast but
on that particular keyboard, on another keyboard they would struggle because
the muscle memory doesn’t recognize a different keyboard. And it makes so much
harder improving the speed when not using all of your fingers.</p>
<p>I had the same problem as the majority of people, and I wasn’t recognizing it.
For years I would use 4-6 fingers and always from time to time I would
take a look at the keyboard for a specific character or a letter. The right
hand would type the keys on the left side and opposite. That was my typing
technique.</p>
<p>So I started doing some research and got to know better how touch-typing works.
Luckily the web is full of touch-typing resources and training websites, that
I settled for <a href="https://www.typingclub.com/">TypingClub</a>. The website is full of exercises and statistics
on your writing progress in beautiful UI that it satisfies all of my nerdy
requirements, and it’s completely free or supports the services and get some
additional features with as little as 7.50 euros a month.</p>

part was creating a practicing routing and trying to touch-type as much as
possible. That is easier said than done. The beggining was painful, I was slow at
work and I was wasting a lot of my concentration on typing. My fingers were
feeling tired and sometimes in pain, they have never done anything like that.
Changing the muscle memory and rewiring my brain after many years to something
almost unknown was getting into my way.</p>
<p>So I decided to make a switch from an <a href="https://amzn.to/31H9Qgc">Apple keyboard</a> to a mechanical keyboard.
And I got the idea that if I get a keyboard with the blank keycaps I would be
obligated to learn to touch-type and forget about looking at the keyboard. The
idea was promising but also scary for the scenarios like typing a password,
typing with one hand.. so again I did some research! And many people confirmed
my idea and I decided to follow it.</p>
<p>Finding a good keyboard that would last and endure a lot typing was my initial
idea, but there aren’t many keyboards with blank keycaps unless you customize
it. So the list came down to these candidates:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3acp0On">Das Keyboard 4</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3kBK9WP">Filco Ninja Majestouch-2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2XQ3Mkj">Happy Hacking Keyboard (HHKB) Professional2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Filco keyboard is a little different than the other two, by having the keycaps
printed on the bottom side instead on top. This would work better in cases like
typing a password or typing anything with one hand. For someone who doesn’t
want to go extreme this is a good solution.</p>
<p>All of these keyboards are exceptionally good, but having already had
experience with MX Cherry switches, I decided to give a try to Topre
switches with an HHKB. It’s more Vim-style orianted by having no arrow keys
with a clean and minimal design.</p>

and the school to deep dive into this. At the begging I was struggling, but
a keyboard like this pushes you to learn a proper fingers placement on the
home row and unlink all the habits of looking down for a key. It took time
and a lot of practice but it paid off. Today I type comfortably on a blank
keyboard with the average speed of 70-90 wpm and I’m still improving. It is
a huge productivity boost.</p>

<p>I didn’t know that my next project will turn into a nudity platform and a home for spammers. But it did happen while I wasn’t paying attention. And here are the details.</p>



<p>For the next 5/10 years, I’ve decided that my mission will be: “<strong>Can a Moroccan build an online business and make a living from Morocco?</strong>“. I currently launch multiple projects and give them some time to take off. My blog <a href="https://remote.ma/">remote.ma</a>, my jobs board <a href="https://okjob.io/">okjob.io</a>, and other projects are all examples of this. The project I’m talking about today, was also serving the same purpose in theory, but it was a flop.</p>



<p>That project is <a href="https://mylink.fyi/">mylink.fyi</a>, a personal and unique link for all your other links. I built it during my weekends given I already have a full-time job and it took me two months approximately. It’s like <a href="https://linktr.ee/">linktree</a> and other competitors, but I tried to make it different. No ads, no logo, a clean interface, a 100% score in performance… My idea was: take a competitor product, remove all features you don’t need, and make it crazy fast. You have a 14 days free trial to test it out, but you need to upgrade your account afterwards.</p>



<p>I launched it in February 2020 with a completely different identity. I took my name, and thus my followers and my authority, out of the equation. <strong>I wanted to replicate “someone starting from scratch” as close as possible</strong>. I did use the service for my links (and <a href="https://remote.ma/">remote.ma</a>‘s links) but I never advertised the service on my personal account. You can see the <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mylink-fyi">Product Hunt</a> launch, and the imaginary <a href="https://twitter.com/HamidNekcha">Twitter account</a> I created.</p>



<p>Given how I built the app, I optimized it in a way I’ll only pay hosting fees when the site is having a lot of traffic. Like 1M+ visits per month. So I forgot about it, and kept an eye on the bills I get. Two weeks after launch, I had 100 users. No premium account.</p>



<p>Three months went by with 0$ bills. But in June, I received <strong>my non-zero bill</strong>, it’s exciting the app is taking off! I logged to Firebase (the infrastructure I’m using) and found a total of 1000 users! Wow, that’s a lot.</p>



<p>I took a look at the emails, and quickly saw that something was off. I’ve seen multiple accounts with the same email structure, something like emily123@gmail.com, emily456@gmail.com… I knew something isn’t right given there is a lot of them. So I decided to take a closer look and see the links they are sharing.</p>



<p>That’s when I discovered <strong>they were sharing porn and nudes links</strong>. These links aren’t permitted on social media, so they used mylink.fyi to “shadow” them. For these platforms, they are mylink.fyi links. But once you visit it, you’ll see a link for the banned site. <strong>There were hundreds of accounts doing this</strong>. And new ones get created every day. Once the trial period is over, they create a new email, a new account, and then repeat the same process. Oups!</p>



<p>I decided to remove all my links from the platform given it’s probably known for “porn and nudes” now. I logged to Instagram, and got a weird message: “<strong>Your profile link is not working</strong>“. I didn’t know what that means, but once I visited my profile, I’ve seen I can’t click on the mylink.fyi link. Wow, what’s that? I visited my other profile, and got the same message and the same problem! I later discovered that Instagram banned all mylink.fyi links from the platform. A customer also confirmed to me via email that Snapchat started blocking links. Heh, I’m banned by Instagram and Snapchat! From all scenarios I had in mind, <strong>this is not something I prepared for</strong>.</p>



<p>The first thing I tried is reducing the trial period from 14 days to 5 days. I was hoping I’ll make them stop. But nothing changed, I can’t outplay them. Damn it! Other solutions include: requiring credit cards for trial periods, ban all adult content from the platform… But they all require me to put extra effort in the project. And I don’t have time for that.</p>



<p>I disabled signups on mylink.fyi for now, and after all trials reach their end, I’ll take the service off. If you’re interested in acquiring the domain name, and/or the app, <a href="https://elazzabi.com/contact/">let’s talk</a>.</p>



<p><strong>That’s it for your daily dose of weird Internet anecdotes.</strong></p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Not only is layout shift annoying and a bad user experience, it's now part of Google's Core Web Vitals which will become a ranking factor for Google Search in 2021.</p>
    <p>Lighthouse is a great tool for identifying your Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) score, but it's not so great for quickly visualising what's actually changing on a page. The Layout Shift GIF Generator allows you to quickly see which elements are moving around in the viewport and return your CLS metric.</p>

    <div>
        <h3>Device Information</h3>
        <p>The tool is able to check both a desktop and a mobile viewport.</p><p><em>- The desktop viewport is a standard 1920x1080 resolution.</em></p>
        <p><em>- The mobile viewport is the Nexus 5X profile from Lighthouse.</em></p>
        <p>Both the CPU and the network are throttled simulating a good 3G network.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Command Line Tool</h3>
    <p>The command line tool can be installed directly from <a href="https://github.com/workeffortwaste/layout-shift-gif">GitHub</a> using NPM.</p>
    <pre>npm install -g workeffortwaste/layout-shift-gif</pre>
    <p>Once installed the tool can be used as per the following example.</p>
    <pre>layout-shift-gif --url https://blacklivesmatter.com/ --device mobile --output layout-shift.gif</pre>
    <h2>Changelog</h2>
    <h3>1.0.0</h3>
    <p>- All the changes.</p>

    <h2>Known Issues</h2>
    <p>- If there is a lot of vertical movement on a page it can be difficult to discern which elements have shifted.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="django-views-the-right-way">

<p>Welcome to my opinionated guide on how to write views in Django!</p>
<p>It is the result of mistakes made and lessons learned in a range of
Django and Python projects over 15+ years.</p>
<p>It has also been prompted by the fact that “Class Based Views” (CBVs from now
on) seem to have become the default way to teach and learn Django views in some
circles, to the point that some are even scared to write “Function Based Views”
(FBVs).</p>
<p>Perhaps worst of all, some official Django documentation has <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/class-based-views/mixins/">well-intentioned
advise that will help to continue the torture of mixins</a>, but
without actually killing you and putting you out of your misery. (After a bit of
“git blaming” it turns out that I’m <a href="https://github.com/django/django/commit/c4c7fbcc0d9264beb931b45969fc0d8d655c4f83">credited</a>
in the commit log for that page. I hate it when that happens…)</p>
<p>So, in view of all this, here I am to save the day, and show you The Right Way
:-)</p>
<p>The essential part of this guide is very short, because FBVs are very easy and
simple. In fact, the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/intro/tutorial03/">Django tutorial for views</a> already has all you
need to know. Just read that, and skip the bits about CBVs, and you’ll be fine.</p>
<p>But if you want a different take on the same things, this guide might be for
you. I’ve also added extra bits for common tasks and patterns in FBVs for which
CBVs are often suggested as the solution. I have a few aims:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I want to show how simple and easy views can be.</p></li>
<li><p>I want you to be freed from learning a whole stack of additional APIs that
were only making your life harder (and teaching you bad patterns).</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of learning a bunch of Django specific APIs, I want to cover much more
transferable knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>HTTP principles</p></li>
<li><p>General OOP/multi-paradigm programming principles</p></li>
<li><p>General Python techniques</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are some other goodies along the way, like how to type-check all the
URL parameters to your view functions.</p>
<p>Each page is composed of <strong>two parts</strong>, which have <strong>two different audiences</strong>.</p>
<p>First, the business — the <strong>what and how</strong>: a short, definitive guide to The
Right Way. As a less experienced developer, either in general or in terms of
knowledge of Django, this part is all you need. Since this guide is not intended
to be reference documentation, I’ll include various links to the official Django
reference docs. All example code can be found in full in the <a href="https://github.com/spookylukey/django-views-the-right-way/tree/master/code">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>Second, discussion — the <strong>why</strong>: a longer, in-depth explanation of why everyone
else who tells you differently is wrong :-). It’s targeted at slightly more
experienced developers, and especially those who are responsible for teaching
other people, or making decisions about the patterns used in a code base. These
discussion sections are really about general programming principles, and how
they apply in Python and Django.</p>
<p>So let’s go!</p>

<p>Something missing? This guide is a <strong>work in progress</strong>, and no matter how much
I add it probably always will be! If you have requests for things to include,
you could file an issue on <a href="https://github.com/spookylukey/django-views-the-right-way">GitHub</a>.</p>
</div><div id="caveats-and-disclaimers-etc">

<ol>
<li><p>Yes, there may in fact be more than one Right Way. But not in this guide!</p></li>
<li><p>I’m assuming you are writing a ‘classic’ web app or web site — in which
most of your pages are server-side rendered HTML, with perhaps some Javascript
loaded onto those pages, as opposed to a site where your server mostly sends
data (e.g. JSON) to a client-side Javascript web app that puts the pages together.</p></li>
<li><p>My comments mainly apply to the CBVs that come with Django. Specifically,
many of my criticisms don’t apply to Django Rest Framework, the Django admin
(which uses a form of CBV), and possibly other implementations. See later
discussion on this.</p></li>
<li><p>Although I’m a Django core dev, I’m not speaking for all the Django
developers. I was actually around when CBVs were first being added to Django,
and even involved in the design of them a bit, and at the time didn’t see the
things I’m expressing now. So please understand my criticisms as a form of
“learning process debate”, rather than as attacks!</p></li>
</ol>

August 11, 2020 | https://blog.graphqleditor.com/urql-graphql-client/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.graphqleditor.com/urql-graphql-client/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Universal React Query Library (URQL) is a highly customizable GraphQL client, exposed as a set of React components by <a href="https://formidable.com/">Formidable</a>, aiming to become a lightweight alternative that would uphold the principal values of the GraphQL protocol &amp; SDL.</p>
<p>Currently, the most popular client libraries come with large API footprints. URQL’s  main goal is to simplify some of the most popular aspects arising when using GraphQL by providing:</p>
<h3>1. The Declarative Queries</h3>
<p>URQL Client internally manages the lifetime and updates for query &amp; mutation operations in the background:</p>
<ul>
<li>when a cache invalidates their results you may receive updated data,</li>
<li>when your app stops being interested in results URQL will teardown the operation (it will stop requesting new data, stop updating results)</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. The abstracted caching</h3>
<p>Caching is handled &amp; customizable with so-called Exchanges. The default <code>cacheExchange</code> offers basic cache implementation that will avoid sending the same requests to a GraphQL API repeatedly by caching the result of each query. For more complex cases containing data interdependencies, URQL offers normalized caching provided by <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/tree/main/exchanges/graphcache"><code>@urql/exchange-graphcache</code></a> package.</p>
<h3>3. The central point of extensibility and integration with GraphQL API</h3>
<p>URQL provides <code>Exchanges</code> to abstract how the Client interacts with frameworks, GraphQL API, or your app. URQL’s  <code>Exchanges</code> have access to all operations and all results (the concept is very similar to middlewares in Redux). The core package’s default behaviors are implemented using Exchanges as both operations as their results are treated as a stream of events:</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Built to be easy to use</strong> -  URQL prioritizes usability and adaptability aiming to be the first-choice pick for both, newcomers as well as GraphQL power-users,</li>
<li><strong>Performant and functional</strong> - Lightweight &amp; powerful GraphQL client, easy to use with React, Preact, and Svelte, makes URQL a great alternative to other bulky GraphQL clients.</li>
<li><strong>Logical default behavior and caching</strong> - URQL enables you to use GraphQL in your apps out of the box without complex configurations, large API overhead, and all that fuss.</li>
<li><strong>Easily extensible</strong> - one of the most interesting concepts presented in URQL are <em>Exchanges</em>. They are a kind of middleware that will help you change how you fetch, cache, or subscribe to data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<p>The method <code>createClient</code> creates the GraphQL client which requires providing API’s URL as a bare minimum. This Client will manage all your operations. To make it work in React &amp; Preact provide it via the Context API with the help of the <code>Provider</code> export.</p>
<div data-language="react"><pre><code>import { createClient, Provider } from 'urql';
const client = createClient({
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/graphql',
});
const App = () =&gt; (
  &lt;Provider value={client}&gt;
    &lt;YourRoutes /&gt;
  &lt;/Provider&gt;
);</code></pre></div>

            <!-- content --><p>In 2020, Arm is making rapid advancements in the server space well beyond what we have seen in recent years. Aside from the obvious hardware advancements (which we will get into later in this article), the biggest piece of the puzzle here is arguably the software ecosystem maturity. Many workloads can now more or less seamlessly transition from running on traditional x86 hardware to running on Armv8 metal. In this article, we are going to explore the Arm opportunity at cloud service providers or CSPs.<span id="more-45868"></span></p>
<p><em>Note on naming conventions: throughout this article, we will use x86 as a shorthand for x86_64, which is also known as amd64. In this context, it means traditional, Intel-compatible hardware. Armv8 stands for the – relatively – new Arm architecture, outed by Arm Holdings in 2011, and also capable of 64-bit memory addressing. Armv8 is also sometimes known as AArch64 or arm64. We need to keep things simple and standardize.</em></p>
<h2>Arm software ecosystem maturity</h2>
<p>Hardware and software engineers often see their jobs as different, but in order to bring about new architecture, better software means better investment in hardware and better hardware means more are willing to invest in software. Having an Arm server hardware discussion necessarily means that we need to discuss the software side. Indeed, that has been perhaps the most visible area of advancement over the past half-decade.</p>
<p>Arm’s software ecosystem has not hit an x86 level of maturity despite what many of its promoters argue. In many cases there may still be a bit a software engineering required, like tweaking compilation flags or container configuration files. In turn, these small tweaks often mean incremental testing effort. As a result, swapping from x86 to Arm has a switching cost. It may be a small cost, but the swap is usually non-zero. While closed source software is another story, open-source software underpinning popular workloads at CSPs, is rapidly gaining maturity. For example nginx a popular web server has done a great job developing its Arm solution.</p>

<p>Armv8 software maturity has come a long way in the last few years. All popular Linux distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, Fedora, Centos, and OpenSUSE now offer an Armv8 spin just as naturally as they offer a traditional x86 spin. This was not the case a few years ago. We have already covered this topic <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/arm-neoverse-n-e-tech-day/">in February of last year</a> when Arm launched its Neoverse line of server CPU cores. Other vendors are moving this direction as well as we are seen even legacy platforms such as <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/vmware-esxi-64-bit-arm-support-announced/">VMware ESXi venture to 64-bit Arm support</a>.</p>
<p>A second very important milestone in the Arm software ecosystem came last year when NVIDIA <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-announces-arm-support-for-gpu-accelerated-computing/">announced</a> support for CUDA-on-Arm at SC19. This was essentially a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-cuda-on-arm-becoming-a-reality/">very potent signal</a> sent to all the industry that Armv8 was soon to be considered on par with x86 for running GPU-accelerated workloads. AI is a pioneering workload, in the field. NVIDIA offering its full AI stack on Arm to build parity with x86 is a big deal since it is an offering for the future of compute, not the past.</p>
<h2>New Armv8 hardware changes the game</h2>
<p>Even though having software that ‘just works’ is essential, one also needs hardware. And in this regard, the Arm world certainly does not disappoint and is as vibrant as ever. Three main actors stand out: Ampere Computing, Marvell, and Amazon’s AWS. (<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/huawei-kunpeng-920-64-core-arm-server-cpu/">Huawei</a> in China as well, although we are going to set that aside for now.) You will of course immediately note that if the first two are CPU vendors, the third one is a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) or a traditional Intel Xeon customer.</p>
<p>Ampere Computing has already had its 7nm <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-80-arm-cores-for-cloud/">Altra</a> sampling for a few months now. As a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-q80-30-in-action-at-ampere-hq/">reminder</a>, it is certainly a solid 2P capable offering on paper, with up to 80 <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/arm-neoverse-n-e-tech-day/">N1 cores</a> at up to 3.3Ghz, 8 DDR4-3200 channels, and 128 PCIe Gen4 lanes (192 in a 2P configuration), all for a TDP of up to 250W. Ampere Computing has already announced next year’s follow up, the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-max-targets-a-128-core-arm-cpu-shipping-in-2021/">Altra Max</a>, which stays on 7nm and pushes the core count to 128. 2022 will see the company outing its 5nm Siryn follow-up.</p>

<p>Marvell, for its part, finalized its acquisition of Cavium in 2018, has arguably been the first Arm CPU vendor to properly enter the data center market, and we have covered the ThunderX2 <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/cavium-thunderx2-review-benchmarks-real-arm-server-option/">extensively</a> since its 2018 launch and the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/cavium-thunderx-micro-benchmarks-enterprise-arm-developers-need-machines/">ThunderX</a> before it. Marvell’s counterpart to the Ampere Altra is the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/marvell-thunderx3-arm-server-cpu-with-768-threads-in-2020/">ThunderX3</a>, to become available this year. It is also a 2P capable 7nm part with eight DDR4-3200 channels but limited to 64 PCIe Gen 4 lanes per CPU (128 in a 2P configuration.) Where it differs greatly from Ampere’s offering is in the choices of CPU cores. Instead of going for “off the shelf” Arm N1 cores, Marvell is using custom Arm cores, offering 4-way Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT). The ThunderX3 will be offered with up to 96 cores (and thus 384 threads) per socket. This is a big differentiating point for Marvell. Just like everyone else, Marvell has a roadmap, and a ThunderX4 is slated for 2022. It will likely be a 5nm part.</p>

<p>And then there is Amazon. Having bought the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/exclusive-gigabyte-annapurna-labs-arm-storage-server-benchmarks/">Anapurna Labs</a> CPU design house in 2015, and after testing the waters with a first-generation <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/putting-aws-graviton-its-arm-cpu-performance-in-context/">Graviton</a> at the end of 2018 (and selling its Arm chips for applications such as <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ubiquiti-unifi-usw-leaf-overview-not-review-48x-25gbe-6x-100gbe-switch/">switches</a>), Amazon announced the general availability of its <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/aws-graviton2-64-core-arm-cpu-heightens-war-of-intel-betrayal/">Graviton2 based instances</a> in March of 2020. Just like the Ampere Altra, the Gaviton2 is also a Neoverse N1 based design, manufactured at 7nm. It is a single socket design, offering 64 cores, 8 DDR4-3200 channels, and 64 PCIe Gen 4 lanes. The fact that AWS decided to build its own CPUs is important because a traditional Xeon/ x86 customer is now taking that in house. It also allows software development to happen at a more rapid pace by showing strong backing for Arm infrastructure, offering it to a wide array of customers. The industry is changing, and long gone are the days when only hardware vendors could decide its fate.</p>

<p>(1)&nbsp; Ampere’s <a href="https://amperecomputing.com/altra/">documentation</a> calls this “sustained turbo”, but presumably this can be treated as a kind of base clock, as all cores should be able to sustain said clock while fully loaded. To be confirmed in STH testing.</p>
<p>(2) These specifications are to be confirmed as the chips become commercially available and may change as the parts transform into shipping products.</p>
<p>Looking at the above table, a few things come to mind. First of all, the industry as a whole seems to be settling on a few “standard” specifications. Each of these three chips comes equipped with a memory controller supporting eight channels of DDR4, just like AMD’s EPYC line and Intel’s upcoming 10nm <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/the-2021-intel-ice-pickle-how-2021-will-be-crunch-time/">Ice Lake</a> Xeon line. Likewise, 250W+ seems to be to the new upper bound for acceptable maximum TDP per socket. A quick look at AMD’s and Intel’s 2020 shipping and roadmap offerings confirms this. Arm chips are looking to keep core counts high and TDPs low.</p>

<p>Amazon designed the Graviton only for internal use, it is a simpler design focused on 1P operation. Note that Ampere Computing and Marvell opted for different solutions enabling 2P operation: Ampere uses 32 (<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/cxl-may-have-just-won-as-amd-joins-cxl/">CCIX</a> enabled) PCIe Gen4 lanes per processor to enable communications between the two sockets, whereas Marvell uses a dedicated interface. Enabling 2P operation complicates the design quite a bit, and as it does not have to cater to any CPU buyer’s needs but its own, Amazon went for simplicity here. This may of course change with a future generation. It also, in some ways, validates AMD’s vision for single-socket EPYC.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to explore this decision of off-the-shelf or custom Arm CPU cores.</p>

	<div>
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p dir="ltr">There is a lot of praise for weekly reviews. There is noticeably less doing of weekly reviews, even among the people doing the praising. It’s a very hard habit to keep up. We could spend a lot of time diving into why that is and how to fix it in a systematic way… or I could tell you how I use <a href="https://predictionbook.com/">PredictionBook</a> to get many of the promised benefits of weekly reviews without any willpower.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a nutshell, when I find myself making a choice about how to spend time or money that’s dependent on some expectation, I write out the expectation as a prediction (with % likelihood) in PredictionBook, which then automatically prompts me to evaluate the prediction at a date I set. This has so many benefits I’m struggling to figure out where to start. If I had to sum them up in a phrase, it would be “more contact with reality”. But to expand on that…</p>

<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Q0ozB77P5ESZiGHUbcOOwEKmLkOnfe6DrHZJsRiJyWH8izn9qVWP2qO1dqem9SQO5si1RFMZ8UjhfGFKSqJkg8zcjvuo4g5_agcJ9Z610wSw-8WxabmUknYTMaXcEylDiS9WJL3Z" width="286" height="190"><figcaption>What contact with reality may look like</figcaption></figure>

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Making the prediction forces me to assess my anticipated outcomes and do an expected value calculation. This in turn forces me to be explicit about what I value, and how I will know if I got it. It also makes it explicit when I’m doing something because I expect the median or modal outcome to be good, vs. when I’m doing it for the long tail of unlikely but super good outcomes. It also gives me a chance to say “huh, that EV is not competitive” and do something else.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Evaluating the prompt gives me more information on how my plans are working out. <a href="https://blog.andymatuschak.org/post/159979927467/satisfaction-and-progress-in-open-ended-work">Andy Matuschak</a> talks about the dilemma of knowledge work, where you can’t make a plan for success but leaving things open ended often leads nowhere. His solution to this is to give himself unstructured time, but then look back and see if it worked out the way he wanted, and if it didn’t, do something different next time. Predictions provide a really natural, lightweight prompt for this reflection.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sometimes I withdraw a question for being poorly phrased- often when my answer makes the decision sound “bad” but I feel like it was actually “good”, or vice versa. This is an easy way to notice I was wrong about what I valued and look for what is actually driving my decisions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then there are the framing benefits. It’s easier to view something as an experiment if you’re explicitly writing down “5% chance of success”, which makes failure feel less bad. I didn’t fail to make something work, I executed the correct algorithm and it failed to produce results this particular time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Making an explicit prediction and writing it down closes open loops in my head, freeing RAM for other things.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s helpful to notice when the habit doesn’t trigger. For example, I have a meeting planned today (when I’m writing this) that I just “didn’t feel inspired” to make a prediction for. When I looked closer I realized that’s because I was kind of eh on this meeting but felt obliged to take it, and was avoiding that fact. I don’t know how this is going to work out because I’m choosing to work on this blog post before tackling that, but I still credit the prediction habit with noticing, which is the first step towards better choices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also it seems like this might make my predictions more accurate, which has all kinds of applications. But to be honest that’s not what’s reinforcing this.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p dir="ltr">So we’re on the same page, here are some sample predictions, and the decisions that rested on them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Reading Pavlov and his School will lead to behavior change in the area of learning or sleep (20%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Should I buy a physical copy of Pavlov and his School and spend the time to read it?</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Talking with my friend Jane on 8/1 will be energizing (95%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I take a call with Jane?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Bob the recruiter will describe a job that I am at all capable of and interested in doing (3%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I take a call with Bob?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">I will judge the seminar on 7/28 will be worth the interruption of flow (40%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I spend money and time on this seminar?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Sam will finish task Y by 7/31 (20%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">No immediate decision riding on this one, but it sure seems useful to calibrate on how well I can predict a project partner’s productivity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">I will play with an Oculus Quest at least an hour a week (98%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I buy a Quest?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">California will catch fire to the point I need to keep my windows closed (95%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I buy an air conditioner?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Company Z will offer me at least an hour of work (15%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">No immediate decision</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Supplement S will improve my sleep to the point I don’t need a nap (3%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I buy and use supplement S?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p dir="ltr">If I were starting from scratch, here are the instructions I would want to receive (many of which I did receive, from <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/raemon">Raemon</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Create an account on <a href="https://predictionbook.com/">PredictionBook.com</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Go to Settings to correct your time zone and set your prediction default to “visible to creator” rather than “visible to public” (unless you’d like them to be public by default).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Create a handful of predictions that will resolve over the next week (PredictionBook will e-mail you when they should be resolved).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The goal is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Quickly get feedback about how this feels for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Get yourself in the habit of making and resolving predictions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">When making predictions, try to hone in on things that are decision-relevant to you; that you would do something different based on if the prediction was true or not.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Create a link to <a href="https://predictionbook.com/predictions/new">https://predictionbook.com/predictions/new</a> in your browser so you can access it easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">As you take more actions based on predictions (implicit or explicit), notice that you are doing so, and register the predictions in PredictionBook</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Resolve predictions as you are prompted to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">After a week or two, check in with yourself and how you feel about the project. For calibration: I found creating the initial predictions kind of a pain but by a week in the project was naturally rewarding and required no will power on my part.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">This should take &lt; 30 minutes, and it should take &lt; 45 minutes total to get a good sense of whether this is working for you.</p>

<h3>Why Does This Work?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I’ve been thinking a lot about flow and distraction recently. One thing I’ve noticed is that it takes an awful long time, measured in hours, to get into the mindset for certain tasks. Those tasks then feel amazing, unless I’m pulled out of them prematurely, which hurts (and makes it take even longer to get into the next time). There’s a lot of implications of this that I’ll hopefully get to in some other post; the relevance here is that I think weekly reviews might be one of those tasks that requires a lot of time to get into the required headspace and hurts to leave prematurely. This makes them costly- much more costly then I would have estimated before I learned to bill tasks for their prep time. It’s also something of an all or nothing task- doing 50% of your weekly review does not get you nearly 50% of the benefits of a full weekly review.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But predictions, both making and evaluating, integrate into my life pretty naturally most of the time, and scale gracefully. Writing them up can take as little as 15 seconds, and when it takes longer, it’s because I’ve discovered something important I need to work out. Doing this fits in naturally with the process of making plans, so I don’t need to spend time getting into the right head space. Evaluating them is usually trivial- and if it’s not, it’s highlighting a problem with my models.</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
<p dir="ltr">“I will enjoy X” is very rarely the right prediction for me to make, because enjoyment is a tricky thing for me. I don’t like admitting I didn’t enjoy something, and sometimes I will burn a lot of energy trying to make something enjoyable, which can be a bad decision even if it works. My equivalent is “X will be energizing”</p>
<p dir="ltr">When trying to create predictions, think about what you’ll be spending money and time on in the next week. How do you think those things are going to go? What outcomes would make you change your decision?</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p dir="ltr">My original inspiration for this experiment, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jL7uDE5oH4HddYq4u/raemon-s-scratchpad?commentId=nuWrC9MxrgsjjS69W">Raemon</a>, hasn’t gotten the benefits I describe. He’s more focused on improving his prediction calibration and accuracy, and so far hasn’t done as much decision-relevant predictions. I’ve encouraged him to try it my way and hopefully he’ll comment after he’s spent a few weeks on that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">PredictionBook is pleasantly lightweight but it’s already a little cluttered with predictions. If I really do solidify this habit I may need to find or create a better system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’ve been doing this for about a month. People have kept up weekly reviews for longer before letting them fall by the wayside. I’m writing this up now because the act of solidifying a habit makes me worse at writing about it. I’ve set a reminder for 12/1 to write an update.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Thanks to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/raemon">Raemon</a> for pushing me to a better version this post and for initiating the experiment in the first place.</p>

We’ll call this flight AA2305, and we’ll use an Airbus A321 to operate it.</blockquote><p>Airlines distribute their schedules through industry data providers, who then make them available to other airlines, travel sellers and tech providers. <a href="https://www.oag.com/">OAG</a> and <a href="https://www.cirium.com/">Cirium</a> are the leaders in this space.</p><p>This isn’t just static data which changes infrequently - airlines generally update their schedules at least once a day, and there are about 800 scheduled airlines for the data providers to work with.</p><h2 id="fares">Fares</h2><p>A fare describes a price at which an airline is willing to sell seats on a particular flight, and the rules (sometimes known as "conditions") that go with that price.</p><p>A fare from American Airlines might look something like this:</p><blockquote>We’re willing to sell seats on our flights AA2305 and AA2307 for $200, as long as there is space in booking class N. However, you must book your seat as part of a return, you’ll have to stay in San Francisco for a Saturday night, and we won’t give you any refund if you want to cancel.</blockquote><p>A fare has a name, called a “fare basis code”. A fare basis code is a short set of letters and numbers - for example <code>NVAKZNM3</code>.</p><p>Fares are made up of rules which describe who is eligible for them, what flights they can be used for, and restrictions on how they can be sold or used. Examples of fare rules could include:</p><ul><li>You must fly via Los Angeles (<code>LAX</code>)</li><li>You can change flights, but only if you pay a $50 penalty</li><li>You can't have a "stopover" overnight on your journey</li></ul><p>The full fare rules for a fare can easily be thousands of words long - you can see the real-life fare rules for the American Airlines fare <code>NVAKZNM3</code> <a href="https://gist.github.com/timrogers/ef7a0070d29ea1ffa5d925184e7a4887">here</a>.</p><p>Fortunately, the most important fare rules can be described in a structured way which a computer can understand, allowing a search engine to work out what fares match your search without a human reading through manually.</p><p>Airlines file their fares in an industry directory run by <a href="https://www.atpco.net/">ATPCO</a>, which other airlines, travel sellers and tech providers can subscribe to. Each airline can change their pricing by refiling fares many times a day. All in all, ATPCO processes more than 10 million fare updates per day.</p><p>Airlines offer many fares for the same flight at the same time, since a traveller won’t always want the cheapest, most restrictive option. For example, you might want a checked bag, or the ability to change your flights free of charge.</p><h2 id="availability">Availability</h2><p>Airlines don’t just say “this flight has seats available” or “this flight doesn’t have seats available”.</p><p>Airlines want to make as much money as they can from their metal boxes flying through the sky, so they want to sell some seats cheaply, but hold some seats back for travellers who are willing to pay more.</p><p>A flight is broken into different “booking classes”, sometimes known as “reservation booking designators” (RBDs). These are letters of the alphabet, so a flight can be split into 26 different buckets: <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, etc..</p><p>A fare points to a specific booking class. The example fare we looked at above, <code>NVAKZNM3</code>, is for the booking class <code>N</code>. Usually, the first character of the fare basis code is the booking class.</p><p>Each booking class on a flight can have different availability. For example, imagine that American Airlines uses the booking classes <code>N</code>, <code>V</code> and <code>Y</code> for economy.</p><p>They might use <code>N</code> for the most restrictive economy fares, <code>Y</code> for the most flexible ones and <code>V</code> for ones in the middle. Being able to control availability for each booking class means that “cheap economy” can be sold out, but there can still be “expensive economy” seats left.</p><p>Airlines don’t “publish” their availability. To know the latest, up-to-the-minute availability, you have to go to the airline’s passenger service system (PSS). Popular passenger service systems include <a href="https://amadeus.com/en/industries/airlines/altea-suite">Amadeus Altéa</a>, <a href="https://www.sabreairlinesolutions.com/home/software_solutions/customer_sales_service/">Sabre Sonic</a> and <a href="https://www.navitaire.com/new-skies-reservation-system">Navitaire New Skies</a>.</p><h2 id="putting-this-all-together">Putting this all together</h2><p>To find results for a simple search, a flight search engine has to combine together schedules, fares and availability.</p><p>There is only a small number of flight searches engines on the market. Most travel sellers use the search built into the global distribution system (GDS) they use (for example <a href="https://amadeus.com/">Amadeus</a>, <a href="https://www.sabre.com/">Sabre</a> or <a href="https://www.travelport.com/">Travelport</a>). But there are competitors: airlines and larger sellers often use search solutions from providers like <a href="https://www.itasoftware.com/">ITA Software by Google</a> and <a href="https://pros.com/">PROS</a>.</p><p>Flight search is very complex, and it requires a lot of computer power.</p><p>The first step is to identify possible routings. For our trip from New York to San Francisco, there are tens of thousands of reasonable options if we take into account connecting flights and the full range of available airlines.</p><p>At the simple end, we could take a direct flight, <code>AA2305</code>. But we could also fly with Alaska Airlines on <code>AS17</code>, <code>AS398</code> and <code>AS3311</code>, connecting in Seattle (<code>SEA</code>) and Los Angeles (<code>LAX</code>).</p><p>For each of those routings, the search engine needs to work out what fares are applicable, checking all of the rules.</p><p>There can be hundreds or thousands of potentially relevant fares to check per airline, especially given that there can be many different ways to apply fares to a set of flights.</p><p>If we take our example above with Alaska Airlines, you’d fly from <code>JFK-SEA</code>, then <code>SEA-LAX</code> and finally <code>LAX-SFO</code>. In terms of fares, this could be structured as:</p><ul><li>A one-way from <code>JFK-SFO</code></li><li>A one-way from <code>JFK-SEA</code>, and then a one-way from <code>SEA-SFO</code></li><li>Three one-ways: <code>JFK-SEA</code>, <code>SEA-LAX</code> <code>LAX-SFO</code></li><li>…</li></ul><p>If we’re booking a round trip, this gets even more complex.</p><p>Once you’ve combined the schedules and fares, you’ll have a series of “priced itineraries” - for example:</p><blockquote>You can fly on AA2305 direct from JFK to SFO for $200, using fare NVAKZNM3, as long as booking class N is available</blockquote><p>The final step is to bring availability into the picture. You’ll probably find that a lot of your priced itineraries are not available because one or more of the booking classes you need are full.</p><p>The end result is a series of search results — or what we call "offers" in the Duffel API.</p><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2><p>When you search for flights, a flight search engine has to combine schedules, fares and availability to generate your search results.</p><p>To do this, it has to consider hundreds of millions of options (at least!), turning them into a relatively small number of valid, relevant combinations. And all of that in just a couple of seconds!</p></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1597054012512/yOWZ6zJsl.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Have you ever met someone who kept apologising for every question or favour they asked? Perhaps you are that person and you can hear yourself saying "sorry" over and over again for basic and normal requests which really don't need an apology. It is annoying for everyone involved and usually, the person apologising is just in <em>such</em> a habit of doing it that a gentle "No need to apologise" or even "Please stop apologising" won't actually lead to any change.</p>
<p>I heard a great tip a few years ago which could help you escape this annoying habit, and lead to better relationships with colleagues, friends, and superiors. This tip helps avoid a <strong>weird power dynamic</strong> where you put yourself in the position of someone begging or being needy, and changes it into a collaborative, positive space. In my opinion, it not only helps others respect you more, but leads to you respecting yourself more.</p>
<h2 id="replace-sorry-with-thank-you-">Replace 'sorry' with 'thank you'</h2>
<p>We know that replacing bad habits is easier than removing them completely, so every time you feel the urge to apologise for something unnecessarily, try to rephrase it as a thank you. This puts you in a better headspace, but people also feel a lot more comfortable accepting thanks than accepting unnecessary apologies. As said, it also turns a generally negative feeling and frames it positively. You're still showing gratitude without begging forgiveness for an everyday request.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Instead of</td><td>Try</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Sorry for the inconvenience</td><td>Thank you for your time</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Sorry you had to wait so long</td><td>Thank you for your patience</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Sorry to ask, but...</td><td>Thanks for seeing me, would you mind telling me...</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>You helped me so much, sorry</td><td>Thank you for helping me so much</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These are just a few examples. For me, "thank you for your time" was the most valuable and easy to implement in a variety of situations. </p>
<p><strong>If you try to utilise this technique in your everyday life, you'll see that not only do people respond a lot better to your requests and explanations, but you'll also walk away feeling more like you collaborated, rather than grovelled.</strong></p>
<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> This advice does not apply for when you truly should apologise. If you hurt someone (even accidentally) or do someone wrong, you should apologise. The above is only applicable when you are in the unfortunate habit of apologising for normal requests.</p>

These frameworks create a window which GoLang can inject HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the UI.</p><p id="c60c">But I don’t want to write JavaScript(!) and deal with all the complexities that comes with it like npm, webpack, typescript… Fortunately, I can just compile GoLang to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebAssembly</a> (WASM) and use that in place of JavaScript. WASM is a binary format that can be executed natively in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most modern browsers</a>. <em>My </em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maori.geek.nz/a-web-app-using-bazel-golang-wasm-and-proto-c020914f4341"><em>previous post</em></a><em> showed how to build a WASM web-app with the Bazel.</em></p><p id="14af">Also, using WASM in a desktop app (as opposed to a web app) dodges two of its main downsides:</p><ol><li id="a01f"><strong>Large WASM binaries</strong> (especially from GoLang): these take a long time to send over the network increasing loading times. In a desktop app the binary isn’t transferred over the network, so less overhead.</li><li id="c65b"><strong>Browser incompatibility: </strong>Some WebAssembly methods are unavailable in browsers and older browsers are not supported at all. In a desktop app the “browser” is controlled (Chrome for Lorca and Safari for webview), so no compatibility issues.</li></ol><p id="382a">Let’s get started and build the app.</p><h2 id="ad5c">The Main Desktop App</h2><p id="04fb">First, I want to sketch out the <code>main</code> function for the app:</p><pre><span id="49df">func main() {<br> // Create the Data URI of index.html<br> url := fmt.Sprintf(<br>  "data:text/html,%s", <br>  url.PathEscape(assets.INDEX_HTML)<br> )</span><span id="6f7e"> // Create Lorca UI<br> ui, _ := lorca.New(url, "", 600, 200)<br> defer ui.Close()</span><span id="7141"> // Create a JS function that returns the WASM binary in base64 <br> ui.Bind("getWASM", func() string { return assets.WASM_BIN })</span><span id="4a42"> // Initialize the wasm_exec.js script<br> ui.Eval(assets.WASM_EXEC_JS)</span><span id="77ea"> // Call the initial JS functions to load the WASM<br> ui.Eval(assets.INIT_JS)</span><span id="cbed"> &lt;-ui.Done()<br>}</span></pre><p id="6eb4"><em>Note: the core difference between with webview, is using </em><code><em>Init</em></code><em> instead of </em><code><em>Eval</em></code></p><p id="062d">This app will start a Chrome window then:</p><ol><li id="9913">load the webpage with HTML <code>assets.INDEX_HTML</code></li><li id="79c2">define a function <code>getWASM</code> that is a promise of <code>assets.WASM_BIN</code>, the WASM binary as a base64 encoded string</li><li id="c64f">load the JS GoLang WASM library <code>assets.WASM_EXEC_JS</code> copied from <code>$(go env <strong>GOROOT</strong>)/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js</code></li><li id="7f2e">load the JS initialization script <code>assets.INIT_JS</code></li></ol><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1676/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png" width="838" height="287" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="ce8d">This is pretty simple example Lorca app, it is basically the demo example. The main complication is the <code>assets</code> package and how it can be created. This is where Bazel comes in.</p><h2 id="74f4">Embedding Files in GoLang Binary using Bazel</h2><p id="8571"><em>Note: an easier way to do this was pointed out to me using the </em><code><a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/blob/fbbbfde2dff5072fe118b369a699d456ec756b0c/go/extras.rst#id3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>go_embed_data</em></a></code><em> rule, better to use that.</em></p><p id="9249">The <code>assets</code> package contains the HTML, JS and WASM files as string constants. There are GoLang tools like <a href="https://github.com/markbates/pkger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pkger</a> or <a href="https://github.com/go-bindata/go-bindata" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go-bindata</a> to do this, but we can keep this simple with a Bazel rule in <code>to_go_constant.bzl</code>:</p><pre><span id="aace">def to_go_constant(name, package, constant, file, base64 = False):<br> pkgStr = '&lt;(echo "package %s")' % package<br> conStr = '&lt;(echo "const %s string = \`")' % constant<br> suffix = '&lt;(echo "\`")'<br> genGo = 'cat %s %s - %s ' % (pkgStr, conStr, suffix)</span><span id="56aa">if base64:<br>  printContents = 'cat $(SRCS) | base64'<br> else:<br>  printContents = 'cat $(SRCS)'</span><span id="8c11">native.genrule(<br>  name = name,<br>  srcs = [file],<br>  outs = [name + ".go"],<br>  cmd =  printContents + ' | ' + genGo + '&gt; $@'<br> )</span></pre><p id="e3d4">This rule uses <code>cat</code> to take a <code>file</code> and output a <code>.go</code> file with the <code>package</code> and <code>const</code> defined. If <code>base64=True</code> then the file is base64 encoded.</p><p id="2176">An example of this rule in action is adding the <code>assets.INDEX_HTML</code> built from the file <code>index.html</code>:</p><pre><span id="90f6">load("//:to_go_constant.bzl", "to_go_constant")</span><span id="fba4">to_go_constant(<br>    name = "index",<br>    constant = "INDEX_HTML",<br>    file = ":index.html",<br>    package = "assets",<br>)</span></pre><p id="16e5">This takes the <code>index.html </code>file:</p><pre><span id="5a54">&lt;html&gt;<br>&lt;body&gt;<br> &lt;!-- add stuff here --&gt;<br>&lt;/body&gt;<br>&lt;/html&gt;</span></pre><p id="4a53">and creates the <code>index.go</code> file:</p><pre><span id="e546">package assets<br>const INDEX_HTML string = `&lt;html&gt;<br>&lt;body&gt;<br> &lt;!-- add stuff here --&gt;<br>&lt;/body&gt;<br>&lt;/html&gt;`</span></pre><p id="8cd7"><code>index.go</code> can be added to the <code>go_library</code> rule for the <code>assets</code> package:</p><pre><span id="f437">go_library(<br>    name = "go_default_library",<br>    srcs = [<br>        "assets.go",<br>        ":index.go",  # keep<br>    ],<br>    importpath = "github.com/.../assets",<br>)</span></pre><p id="1cbf">Now the <code>INDEX_HTML</code> constant is in the assets package.</p><p id="4aa6">It is straight forward for most the other files, but a bit more complicated for the WASM binary data:</p><pre><span id="758f">to_go_constant(<br>    name = "wasmbin",<br>    base64 = True,<br>    constant = "WASM_BIN",<br>    file = "//project/wasm",<br>    package = "assets",<br>)</span></pre><p id="cc54">The file <code>//project/wasm</code> refers to the generated <code>go_binary</code> rule that compiles the WASM (as described below). <code>base64</code> is also <code>True</code> so that the binary data can be encoded as a constant.</p><p id="6b53"><em>Note: There is one minor issue is the </em><code><em>wasm_exec.js</em></code><em> file, it has a few </em><code><em>`</em></code><em>’s in it that must be replaced.</em></p><h2 id="dede">The WASM part</h2><p id="406c">The WASM binary is the client-side GoLang application running in the browser. This example injects a <code>Hello World</code> <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag into the body:</p><pre><span id="a864">package main</span><span id="bd53">import (<br> "fmt"<br> "syscall/js"<br>)</span><span id="8acd">func main() {<br> fmt.Println("Hello World")</span><span id="b814"> document := js.Global().Get("document")<br> p := document.Call("createElement", "p")<br> p.Set("innerHTML", "Hello World")<br> document.Get("body").Call("appendChild", p)<br>}</span></pre><p id="7de3">The <code>go_binary</code> rule for this just needs <code>goos="js"</code> and <code>goarch="wasm"</code> for its output to be a WASM binary, e.g.:</p><pre><span id="d208">go_binary(<br>    name = "wasm",<br>    embed = [":go_default_library"],<br>    goarch = "wasm",<br>    goos = "js",<br>    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],<br>)</span></pre><p id="f178">The output of this rule is used to above to create the <code>WASM_BIN</code> constant above.</p><h2 id="71cd">Initializing the App</h2><p id="8bd2"><code>assets.INIT_JS</code> is built from <code>init.js:</code></p><pre><span id="7b05">loadWebASM = () =&gt; {<br> const go = new Go();<br> getWASM().then( (b64) =&gt; {<br>   // Decode and convert to ArrayBuffer<br>   buf = Uint8Array.from(atob(b64), c =&gt; c.charCodeAt(0)).buffer<br>   return WebAssembly.instantiate(buf, go.importObject)<br> }).then((result) =&gt; {<br>    go.run(result.instance);<br>  }).catch((err) =&gt; {<br>    console.error("loading wasm failed: " + err);<br>  });<br>}</span><span id="e6cf">loadWebASM()</span></pre><p id="c227">This code takes the <code>WASM_BIN</code> promised by <code>getWASM</code>, then decodes and converts it to an ArrayBuffer.

This also makes it easy to convert other WASM apps to desktop applications, e.g. I converted the WASM app at <a href="https://github.com/olivewind/go-webassembly-canvas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/olivewind/go-webassembly-canvas</a> to a desktop application with minimal effort:</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/998/1*SR_WdfWLKkNX_nFAEc2Kdw.png" width="499" height="502" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*SR_WdfWLKkNX_nFAEc2Kdw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/998/1*SR_WdfWLKkNX_nFAEc2Kdw.png 499w" sizes="499px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*SR_WdfWLKkNX_nFAEc2Kdw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><h2 id="5c7c">Conclusion</h2><p id="80dd">There are many libraries and tools written in GoLang that could use a nice user interface, e.g. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terraform</a> and <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docker</a> (just off the top of my head). A web app does not fit their requirements very well since they are editing local files and talking to local daemons. The alternative is then to reimplement or bind their API and integrations to another language which is complicated, error prone and a lot of work. A method of building pure GoLang desktop applications makes a lot of sense for these kinds of tools.</p><p id="93db">This approach can pretty quickly create a distributable, single executable, desktop application with minimal external dependencies. An app that can reuse many GoLang libraries and tools that have already been built. I suppose the worst part of this approach is that it throws away years of development on JavaScript tools like React and Vue. But that just means I have to write more Go to reimplement them, so it isn’t that bad :)</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p>This guide covers timeless ideas that are helpful to keep in mind while working with
systems where performance matters. Many of these ideas are fairly “durable”
and will apply regardless of what hardware, programming language, operating
system, or decade you are working in.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for follow-up articles that will drill into hardware and
more Rust-specific techniques.</p>

<p>Skip to the <a href="#contents">table of contents</a> if you don’t like intros.</p>

<p>There’s some foul language in here. Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="executive-summary">executive summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>make it work, then make it pretty, then make it fast</li>
  <li>only do things that are necessary for correctness and safety</li>
  <li>your engineers will burn out, leave your team, and relentlessly shit talk you
if they don’t make their code pretty and low-friction to work with</li>
  <li>align all latency-throughput queuing positions for everything in the
serial dependency graph, or you will get worst-of-all-worlds
latency-throughput behavior, increasing latency and lowering throughput</li>
  <li>if something necessary can be done in the background without blocking,
queue it up for eventual batch processing to improve cache performance</li>
  <li>look at allocation lifetime using DHAT, avoid short-lived allocations
and ensure that long-lived allocations employ time-space trade-offs
that consume plentiful resources instead of scarce ones where possible</li>
  <li>seriously, it’s always your fault if your engineers quit.</li>
  <li>performance happens naturally when engineers love the codebase and they
are aware of which parts of the system can be sped up</li>
  <li>before wasting time optimizing things that don’t matter, we can easily test
whether optimizing could be useful at all by adding delays or deleting
relevant code to see what the impact of infinite optimization would be</li>
  <li>by default your machine will randomly change your cpu frequency, yank
processes across cores and sockets, and generally make measurements
deceptive and non-reproducible. we can control this behavior. if you
don’t account for this behavior, your measurements are not sound justifications
for code changes</li>
  <li>wait, why does an executive care about performance, anyway?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="non-executive-introduction">non-executive introduction</h2>

<p>Ok, now that the executives are gone, it is time to party.</p>

<p>Let’s put on some nice music.</p>

<p>Take a deep breath.</p>

<p>Let it out.</p>

<p>The year is 2020. and we are utterly fucked.</p>

<p>Supposedly we are here reading this article because we “like computers” or
something but let’s be clear about one thing - you’re not here because of that.
I know. You know. We all know. You couldn’t give two fried pennies about
computers if they didn’t help you feel the things you so desperately need to
feel.</p>

<p>You’re here, ultimately, because of control. Your entire life is entombed
in an elaborate, entirely abstract labyrinth of machines that define so
many aspects of every moment of your waking life. You’re here to better
understand the prison you find yourself within. You’re here to sympathize
with the machine.</p>

<p>While you will only seep ever more deeply into this morass of gold and glass,
you have the power to turn your captors into familiar friends. You have the
power to make the machines into the only friends you will ever need. You are
here to abandon the organic and the analogue. There is nothing for you on the
other side of your window. As you lounge (please fix your posture now) in your
designated quarantine pit, gazing listlessly into the LED mesh while biding
your time, I invite you to join me - your newest simulated human experience -
on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure into the bowels of the machine through which
you experience joy and place orders for more toilet paper.</p>

<p>It begins today.</p>

<p><img src="https://sled.rs/art/sunrise.jpg" alt="warm sun rising over the water with a boat and mountains in the background"></p>

<p>This guide contains basic information for getting started with
performance-sensitive engineering. I think most folks will learn something new.
I know I have. And, part of why I wrote this is to have a single place with a
memorable URL where I can return to when I forget most of this stuff. More
importantly, when I unfurl fiery screeds in random internet comments I want to
have an intimidating reference to which I can mercilesly link.</p>

<p>I initially wrote this guide for the Rust ecosystem, where many people are now
trying their hands at optimization for the first time. But nearly all of this document
applies to general programming, with a few of the hardware effects mentioned
being specific to x86 and ARM circa 2020. Linux is assumed, because that’s
what the overwhelming majority of server workloads run today.</p>

<p>This guide brings together ideas from systems engineering, systems theory,
psychology, hardware, queuing theory, statistics, economics,
distributed systems, concurrency and philosophy of science with the goals of
helping you to be less of an asshole and write code that tends to improve
the metrics you care about.</p>

<p>Performance is about being thoughtful about the metrics that matter to us and
allowing ourselves to be aware of them while making decisions.</p>

<p>These materials are based on Tyler Neely’s Rust workshop content, and have been
inspired by the writings of

<h2 id="principles">principles</h2>

<div><div><pre><code>You are not a Bayesian homunculus whose
reasoning is “corrupted” by cognitive biases.

You just are cognitive biases.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Rationality-An-Introduction">- Luke Muehlhauser, via R:AZ</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing to consider is that our minds are pure shit and everything we
know is wrong. We must accept our fallibility before embarking down the path to
fast-as-fuck machinery.</p>

<p>We build towers of assumptions that are bound to specific contexts, and when the
conditions that caused us to form these beliefs change, we tend not to revisit
the now-invalidated beliefs. Cache invalidation is hard when we are so rarely
aware of the dependency graphs of what we believe.</p>

<p>So, we measure. Even when we’re convinced that we’re right. Because we are
always out of sync with reality, and we are fundamentally incapable of altering
this fact. But we can be responsible in the face of that.</p>

<p>Corollary: allow yourself to be wrong. Allowing yourself to be wrong with
yourself, your collaborators, and in public is a key optimization for learning
faster and building better things with less effort and in less time.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, machines tend to be somewhat amenable to measurement. We built
them that way. Indeed, constructing them to be somewhat measurable in the first
place was the only way we were able to assemble them at all despite our
innumerable shortcomings. We took the predecessor to your current machine,
chose some metrics to improve, made a huge number of mistakes while continuing
to measure, and occasionally we got lucky: the metrics we cared about improved
enough to alter production lines, crystallizing our occasionally successful
results into new production processes that eventually put your machine in front
of you.</p>

<p>We must measure.</p>

<p>The only thing that matters is that real programs on real hardware see real
improvements in relevant metrics like total cost of ownership, responsiveness,
etc… If a metric doesn’t help a human, it’s just a vanity pursuit that may
make the important metrics worse due to under-investment.</p>

<p>We must select our measurements with care. Our time is precious.</p>

<p>By making decisions that are considerate of available data, we are able to cut
through so much bullshit. We have so many ideas that our experience tells us
should cause our code to improve, but it simply isn’t true when we actually
measure. Code changes that made your Java, C++, Haskell or JS programs faster
may not make Rust any faster. Don’t make Rust code ugly just because some
program you wrote in the 90s worked better with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">manual loop
unrolling</a>. Compilers change,
in many ways for the better.</p>

<p>Don’t be macho. Make decisions while having real data on-hand and limit the
damage of hubris.</p>

<h2 id="e-prime-and-precise-language">e-prime and precise language</h2>

<p>So many aspects of performance-critical engineering can be highly contextual
and may vary wildly from one machine to another. It helps to avoid the verb
“to be” and its conjugations “is”, “are” etc… when describing observations.</p>

<p>When we say something “is” something else, we are casually equating two
similar things for convenience purposes, and we are lying to some extent.
By avoiding false equivalences (usually easily spotted through use of “is”, “are” etc…)
we can both communicate more precisely and we can allow ourselves to reason
about complexity far more effectively. Situations that may seem completely
ambiguous when described using “to be” phrases are often quite unambiguous
when taking care to avoid false equivalences. This general form of speech
is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime">E-Prime</a>.</p>

<p>Don’t say “lock-free queues are faster than mutex-backed queues”, say “on
hardware H with T threads running in tight loops performing operations O, our
specific lock-free queue has been measured to achieve a latency distribution of
X1 and our specicific mutex-backed queue has been measured to achieve a latency
distribution of X2.” It’s likely your lock-free queue will sometimes perform
worse than a well-made mutex-backed queue given certain hardware, contention
and many other factors. What does “perform worse” even …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In my spare time (whenever I get to have some these days) I like to
poke around in the world of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a>.</p>

<p>I do have some experience with various Lisp dialects such as Scheme,
<a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> and <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>,
so this is not my first introduction to the Lisp family. I’ve been
developing in Clojure at my current job and has also used Scheme
(<a href="https://www.call-cc.org/">Chicken Scheme</a> in particular) and Racket
in various small to mid-sized personal and hobby projects. Having
spent a fair amount of my time with the various Lisp dialects I
wouldn’t say that I’m expert in Lisp, not even close.</p>

<p>We are now in the 2020 year, and this is also the year that Lisp would
become 62 years old! That is an impressive age for a programming
language. With that said that does not mean that the concepts and
ideas developed in Lisp are old.</p>

<p>A thing so common for all languages these days such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If%E2%80%93then%E2%80%93else">if-then-else</a> was first
introduced by the creator of Lisp itself - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)">John
McCarthy</a>.
Another notable thing so common to lots of modern languages such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)">garbage
collection</a>
came from Lisp too. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">Read-Eval-Print-Loop
(REPL)</a> that most
of us cannot live without is another good example.</p>

<p>And these are just a few of the things that Lisp gave to the world.</p>

<p>These days Lisp isn’t very popular compared to other languages as it
used to be back in the days, but that isn’t to say that Lisp itself is
dead. As a matter of fact it is in a pretty good shape - various
Common Lisp implementations are actively being maintained – few days
ago <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/all-news.html#2.0.0">SBCL 2.0.0</a> got released
for example. Research and innovations are still happening in Racket
(check out the Honu project for instance), and Clojure is kicking
butts in the JVM world.</p>

<p>So, why spending time with Lisp you might ask?</p>

<p>Is it for the famous Lisp enlightenment everyone is talking about? I
don’t know, maybe. Personally, I find programming in Lisp quite fun.
Exploring stuff and poking around at the REPL in Common Lisp is a
whole different story than most of the REPLs you’ve dealt with.  Maybe
it is my personal curiousity about programming and computer science
that drove me to Lisp.</p>

<p>The language has a long history, so you would find lots of
reading materials, research papers and it’s fascinating to know that
you can still run such old code in modern Common Lisp implementations.</p>

<p>Have I been enlighted by Lisp? I don’t feel smarter after learning
Lisp. I do however feel that I’ve gained more experience as a
programmer. And maybe that’s the <em>Lisp enlightment</em> these old Lispers
talk about, maybe it’s something else. What I do know however is that
learning new paradigms and techniques definitely makes you a better
problem solver, so that’s another another reason to try learning some
Lisp.</p>

<p>Oh, and I <em>do</em> like the s-expr syntax. That for me is a good enough
reason to be excited about Lisp.</p>

<p>In this post I’m going to summarize my experience with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">Common
Lisp</a> so far, and hopefully
the things I write here are going to be useful to someone else in
his/hers own journey in the world of Lisp.</p>

<p>I also need to mention that even though I have experience with Scheme
and Clojure, I’m quite new to Common Lisp. These being Lisp dialects
does not mean they are fully compatible with each other. Scheme takes
the functional-first approach to solving problems and Clojure is a
more modern reincarnation of Lisp which is closer to Scheme being a
Lisp-1 dialect, while Common Lisp is the ANSI standardized vision of
what Lisp should be.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that this post is not intended as a tutorial for all
things related to Lisp, but rather they document my particular
development setup and show various code samples which I’ve found
useful, and hopefully others will too.</p>

<p>At the end of this post you will also find additional references to
learning materials such as books and documentation, which I’d
recommend checking out. These references will be valuable to anyone
starting up with Common Lisp as they provide useful information and
insight.</p>

<h2 id="installing-common-lisp">Installing Common Lisp</h2>

<p>The nice thing about Common Lisp being ANSI standardized language is
that you can <a href="https://common-lisp.net/implementations">choose between various
implementations</a>.</p>

<p>You need high-performance Lisp compiler -
<a href="http://www.sbcl.org/all-news.html#2.0.0">SBCL</a> has got you covered,
you need to use the JVM platform - <a href="https://abcl.org/">ABCL</a> is there
for you. You can check out the various Common Lisp implementations and
choose the one that suits you most. My personal choice has been SBCL,
but as long as you develop standard compliant code your project be
portable to any conforming implementation.</p>

<p>Installing SBCL on my Mac is as simple as the following command.</p>



<p>And when I’m working on my <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> system
I would install SBCL using the following command.</p>



<p>You would want to get a copy of the <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/common-lisp.html">Common Lisp
Hyperspec</a> as
well. On Macs you can install the HyperSpec using the following command.</p>



<p>Or you can grab the HyperSpec from
<a href="http://ftp.lispworks.com/pub/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec-7-0.tar.gz">here</a>
instead.</p>

<p>After installing SBCL you can test things up quickly in the REPL and
confirm everything has been installed properly.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>sbcl
This is SBCL 2.0.0, an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp.
More information about SBCL is available at &lt;http://www.sbcl.org/&gt;.

<p>Evaluating the following expression from the REPL would return
the Lisp implementation type and version.</p>

<span>"2.0.0"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="editor-setup">Editor setup</h2>

<p>I’ve been a long time Emacs user and for me the choice of editor
support for Common Lisp is simple -
<a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a>.  Vim users would
probably want to pick <a href="https://github.com/l04m33/vlime">Vlime</a>.</p>

<p>What follows below are snippets from my Emacs config. I keep these as global
settings at the top of my <code>~/.emacs</code> file.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving">Seam carving</a> is a technique
for <em>content-aware resizing</em>, which changes the size of an image while
attempting to preserve the interesting content of the image. The basic
idea behind the technique is to remove <strong><em>low-energy seams</em></strong>: paths of pixels
that are similar to their surroundings. A removed seam can be either vertical or
horizontal, to reduce either the width or height of an image.</p>

<p>For example, here’s a panorama I took a few years ago near Spruce Knob, WV.</p>

<p><img width="100%" src="https://shwestrick.github.io/assets/seam-carve/pano.jpg"></p>

<p>The image is super wide, but we can carve it down.
Here’s an animation of the process, generated by the
<a href="https://github.com/MPLLang/mpl/pull/123">seam-carver I implemented recently</a>
as a parallel benchmark for
<a href="https://github.com/mpllang/mpl"><code>mpl</code></a>.</p>

<p>Getting real parallel speedups in this implementation turned out to be an
interesting challenge. For typical images, which are fairly small,
I found that the most obvious approach for parallelizing the algorithm was not
able to extract enough parallelism, because it required too small of a
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granularity_%28parallel_computing%29">grain size</a></em>.
So, I designed a new way of parallelizing the algorithm which works much
better on small images. This post presents some of the details.</p>

<h2 id="the-seam-carving-algorithm">The Seam Carving Algorithm</h2>

<p>The idea behind seam-carving is to consider all possible seams in an image,
select the one which is least important, and remove it. A <strong><em>seam</em></strong> is a path of
pixels that cuts across an image, touching one pixel in each row (or column)
along the way. When we remove a seam, we reduce either the width or height
of the image by 1. We can repeat this process as many times as desired to
shrink the image.</p>

<p>We’ll base the “importance” of seams on a notion of pixel <strong><em>energy</em></strong>, which
can be defined in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_gradient">many different ways</a>.
For seam-carving, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference">color difference</a> gradient
seems to work well, which measures how different a pixel’s color is in
comparison to its surroundings. The <strong><em>energy of a seam</em></strong> is just the
cumulative energies of all pixels touched by the seam. With this setup,
the seam with <em>minimum energy</em> should be unimportant and safe to remove from
an image.</p>

<p>To compute <em>minimum seam energies</em>, we can use a simple
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a>
algorithm. For simplicity here, let’s focus on vertical seams. Let
\(M(i,j)\) be the minimum energy of
any partial seam that ends at row \(i\) and column \(j\), and let
\(E(i,j)\) be the energy of the pixel at that position. These minimum seam
energies are related by the following equation:</p><p>

\[M(i,j) = E(i,j) + \min(M(i-1,j-1), M(i-1,j), M(i-1,j+1))\]

</p><p>A picture might help. For each position, we look at the minimum partial
seams that end above it, pick the smallest, and then add the next pixel.</p>

<p><img width="250px" src="https://shwestrick.github.io/assets/seam-carve/equation.svg"></p>

<p>Once \(M\) has been fully computed, we can find the minimum overall seam by
working backwards, from bottom to top, by walking upwards along the path of
minimum seam energies starting at the smallest in the bottommost row.</p>

<h2 id="finding-the-minimum-seam-in-parallel">Finding the minimum seam in parallel</h2>



<p>The dependencies within the equation for \(M\) appear to offer a lot of
parallelism. Perhaps the most immediately obvious approach is to compute
\(M\) in <strong><em>row-major</em></strong> order,
where first we do all of row 0, and then all of row 1, etc. With this ordering,
the values within a row can be computed entirely in parallel, because each
\(M(i, j)\) only depends on three values \(M(i-1, \ldots)\) from the previous row.</p>

<p>However, there’s a major problem in practice with row-major order:
typical images are only at most a few thousand pixels wide, and each pixel
only requires a small amount of work. That’s not enough work (per row)
to parallelize effectively! We’ll need a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granularity_%28parallel_computing%29">granularity</a>
of at least, say, a thousand pixels to amortize the cost of parallelism itself.</p>

<p>This pretty much rules out using row-major order for typical, small images.
Is there a better to compute \(M\) without reducing the grain size?</p>



<p>To extract more parallelism without reducing the grain size, we need a
better way to partition up the work. This is something that probably
<em>could</em> be done “automatically” (e.g. take a look at
<a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/c/Chowdhury:Rezaul_Alam.html">Rezaul Chowdhury</a>’s
work), but here we’ll just try to design something ourselves.</p>

<p>What are all of the dependencies for a single value \(M(i,j)\)? Visually,
the dependencies form a triangle with the pointy-end pointing down:</p>

<p><img width="300px" src="https://shwestrick.github.io/assets/seam-carve/depend.svg"></p>

<p>We can use triangles like these to split up the work in a nice way. First,
imagine grouping adjacent rows into <strong><em>strips</em></strong>. Within one strip,
cover the top of the strip with a bunch downward-pointing triangles. The
leftover space will look like a bunch of upward-pointing triangles, each
of which has all of its dependencies already satisfied (this is not immediately
obvious but drawing a picture will help). So, we
can process one strip in two parallel rounds, where first we do a bunch of
downward-pointing triangles in parallel, and then we do a bunch of
upward-pointing triangles to fill in the leftover space.</p>

<p>Here’s a picture using triangles that are 6 pixels wide at the base. Note that
if we use triangles of even base-width, then these tile naturally with no
overlap.</p>

<p><img width="350px" src="https://shwestrick.github.io/assets/seam-carve/strips.svg"></p>

<p>How wide should each triangle be in practice? Recall that we’re shooting for a
target granularity of maybe one or two thousand pixels. This corresponds to
triangles with base-widths of somewhere between 64 (1056 pixels in the triangle)
and 90 (2070 pixels in the triangle).</p>

<p>So, in a smallish image, e.g. 1000 pixels wide, we can fit
at least 11 triangles horizontally, suggesting a maximum possible
speedup of 11x or more. This is a big improvement over the row-major strategy,
which (using a granularity of 1000 pixels) would not be able to extract any
parallelism from such an image.</p>

<h2 id="implementation-and-performance">Implementation and performance</h2>

<p>With <a href="https://github.com/mpllang/mpl"><code>mpl</code></a>, I implemented both the row-major
and triangular strategies to compare their performance. The code for the
triangular strategy is available in the <code>examples/src/seam-carve/</code> subdirectory
of the <a href="https://github.com/mpllang/mpl"><code>mpl</code></a> repo. I’ll leave the row-major
code as an exercise to the reader. (It’s not too bad!)</p>

<p>Here are some performance numbers for
removing 10 seams from an image of size approximately 2600x600. I did a little
bit of tuning, and ended up choosing a row-major granularity of 1000 pixels,
and a triangular base-width granularity of 88 (1980 pixels).</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Strategy</th>
      <th>P = 1</th>
      <th>P = 10</th>
      <th>P = 20</th>
      <th>P = 30</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>row-major</td>
      <td>0.66</td>
      <td>0.38</td>
      <td>0.38</td>
      <td>0.38</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>triangular</td>
      <td>0.78</td>
      <td>0.17</td>
      <td>0.12</td>
      <td>0.09</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>On 1 processor (P = 1), the row-major strategy is faster by about 15%, but
on more processors quickly hits a maximum speedup of about 2x, seeing no
additional improvement above 10 processors.
In contrast, the triangular strategy continues to get faster as the number
of processors increases, with self-speedups of about 5x on 10 processors,
6.5x on 20, and 9x on 30.</p>

<p>Despite having a mild amount of overhead on 1 processor, we can see that
the triangular strategy provides significant gains. On higher core counts,
it is as much as 4x faster than the row-major strategy.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>One might wonder: why are the speedups we got so far away from theoretical
limits? With a base-width of 88, shouldn’t we be able to get up to 30x speedup
on an image of width 2600? Well, unfortunately, there are a large number of
barriers to achieving such good speedup in practice: ineffective cache
utilization, memory bandwidth bottlenecks, non-optimal scheduling… and
many more.</p>

<p>In the case of seam carving, there are two major limiting factors.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Seam carving is largely memory-bound, i.e., for each memory access it
  only does a small amount of work before the next access. To get around this
  bottleneck, we might need better cache utilization, and so we would have to
  more carefully lay out the values of \(M(i,j)\) in memory. (For this
  implementation, I used a simple flat-array layout, where \(M(i,j)\) lives at
  index \(iW + j\). We could instead try storing these values in a
  hierarchical structure, indexing first by strip, and then by triangle, to
  better improve locality.)</li>
  <li>Seam carving has high span, performing a small amount of work in
  between each synchronization. For example in the row-major strategy, we use
  a barrier between each row, and in the triangular strategy, we use two
  barriers per strip. This can cause the scheduler to perform too many thread
  migrations. To mitigate this, one thing we could try is to let triangles
  overlap slightly, to increase the size of each strip. This trades a small
  amount of duplicated work for fewer barrier synchronizations overall, which
  could prove to be hugely beneficial.</li>
</ol>

						<p>SpaceX wants to transform the Boca Chica Village in Texas into a modern spaceport, according to a new <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/spacex/jobs/4816599002?gh_jid=4816599002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job listing</a> for “Resort Development Manager” posted this week. Spotted by CNBC reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/thesheetztweetz/status/1292913032042086401">Michael Sheetz</a>, the job description states that “SpaceX is committed to developing this town into a 21st century Spaceport.”</p>
<p>Boca Chica is the small area near Brownsville, Texas, where SpaceX already conducts tests with the Starship project — which aims to deliver new spacecrafts designed to take passengers beyond low Earth orbit.</p>

<p>According to the job description for the SpaceX Brownsville facility, the company wants to turn the entire region into a spaceport to accommodate both the people and cargo that will be on board the Starship vehicle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>SpaceX is committed to developing revolutionary space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets. Boca Chica Village is our latest launch site dedicated to Starship, our next generation launch vehicle. SpaceX is committed to developing this town into a 21st century Spaceport. We are looking for a talented Resort Development Manager to oversee the development of SpaceX’s first resort from inception to completion.&nbsp;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Resort Development Manager will be responsible for managing the entire project, including design and architectural aspects, costs, schedules, and all government approvals.</p>

<p>With so much effort on this project, SpaceX clearly wants to offer a unique experience for those planning to travel to the Moon or even Mars.</p>

<p>Bad decision-makers who make quick decisions get themselves in a lot of trouble. They need to slow down and be more thoughtful.</p>



<p>Bad decision-makers who make slow and thoughtful decisions are still bad decision-makers. They need to make better decisions.</p>



<p>Good decision-makers who makes slow and thoughtful decisions do well for themselves but they waste time and endure unnecessary stress due to indecision. They need to be more decisive.</p>



<p>Good decision-makers who make quick decisions are great decision-makers. They trust their good judgement and make the most good decisions.</p>

It’s becoming increasingly normal for teams to update their Kanban boards on a weekly basis and adapt their projects to the changing requirements.</p><p>Many of us would find this flexible approach a little familiar mainly because many teams are attempting to apply the Agile approach in their work processes.</p><p>We wanted to get a real-life perspective about the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blogs.oracle.com/datascience/taking-an-agile-approach-to-data-science" target="_blank">Agile approach in data science</a>, so we got in touch with Christos Hadjinikolis, the Lead ML-Engineer of Data Reply UK, to talk about this topic. You can check out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://christos-hadjinikolis.github.io/" target="_blank">his personal website to learn more about his credentials and work in Machine Learning (ML)</a>.</p><h2 id="0-agile-in-data-science">Agile in Data Science</h2><p>Christos spoke about the Agile approach in data science in his session <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://2018.mcubed.london/sessions/data-science-agile-way/" target="_blank">Doing Data Science The Agile Way</a> at the Mcubed London event in 2018. You can watch the video for more information.</p><figure><p> <iframe title="M3 18: Christos Hadjinikolis - Doing Data Science the Agile Way" width="500" height="281" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-data-cli-class="cli-blocker-script" data-cli-label="Youtube embed" data-cli-script-type="analytics" data-cli-block="true" data-cli-block-if-ccpa-optout="false" data-cli-element-position="body" data-cli-placeholder="Accept <a class='cli_manage_current_consent'>Analytics</a> cookies to view the content." data-cli-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nRsqFrutfSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure><p>Hadjinikolis defines Agile Software Development as a time-boxed, iterative and incremental approach to software delivery. The Agile approach in data science is based on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank">its twelve principles</a> (you can click on the anchor texts to find out what they are if you don’t know).</p><p>According to Christos, a data scientist’s role in an Agile team is to experiment and learn what works and what doesn’t. Agile Software Development is all about creating experiments, not tasks. Experimentation tolerates failure as education.</p><blockquote><p>“If practicing Agile Software Development produces value from learning through failing fast and safe… then a Data Scientist’s role in an Agile team is to help the team to fail faster!”</p><cite><a href="https://2018.mcubed.london/sessions/data-science-agile-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christos Hadjinikolis at Mcubed London 2018</a>.</cite></blockquote><p>When we do an experiment, we start by forming a hypothesis and determining the variables. Then, we proceed to collect and analyse data based on those variables.</p><p>When the results are not what we wanted or expected, it shows that the hypothesis doesn’t work or there’s not enough data to test this hypothesis. So, we adjust the hypothesis and redo the experiment to see if that hypothesis works or not.</p><h3 id="1-story-splitting">Story splitting</h3><p>In Agile, a use case is split into different user stories. A user story is an explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end-user. A user would describe the functionality they want in a feature and the benefit gained from that functionality.</p><p>Here’s an example we came up with. In a non-tech use case of baking the town’s best range of cupcakes, a user would say in a user story, “As a <em>cupcake seller</em>, I want <em>more vanilla essence in the cupcake batter</em>, so that <em>the cupcakes will be tastier</em> <em>for cupcake eaters</em>.”</p><p>In this user story, the “cupcake seller” is the description of the user, “more vanilla essence in the cupcake batter” is the functionality requested and “the cupcakes will be tastier for cupcake eaters” is the benefit of the functionality.</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter.jpg" alt="Putting cupcake batter into the cupcake mold." srcset="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter.jpg?v=1597029413 960w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-300x200.jpg?v=1597029413 300w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-768x512.jpg?v=1597029413 768w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-600x400.jpg?v=1597029413 600w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-old-src="//www.iunera.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter.jpg?v=1597029413 960w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-300x200.jpg?v=1597029413 300w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-768x512.jpg?v=1597029413 768w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-600x400.jpg?v=1597029413 600w"><figcaption>Hypothesis testing can be applied to making a good cupcake batter for delicious cupcakes.<br>Image Source: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pixabay.com/photos/baking-cupcakes-cake-batter-4020041/" target="_blank">Alice_Engelbrink</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>The baker would test the hypothesis that more vanilla essence in the cupcake batter would result in tastier cupcakes. The baker would experiment with several batches of cupcake batters with different amounts of vanilla essence, and then, record the data to analyse if more or less vanilla essence is better.</p><p>The baker would repeat experiments for other user stories about other cupcake features like the amounts of sugar, flour, ground flaxseed, water, colouring, oven temperature, flavouring and icing.</p><p>The same can be done in software development. Let’s look at it from the lens of a customer service colleague who is logging an issue about an online shopping app feature as a user story in the use case of improving the online shopping app.</p><p>This user would say, “As a <em>customer service representative</em>, I want <em>the</em> <em>quantity of items in the shopping cart to be changeable</em>, so that <em>the customers can buy more than one of the same product</em>“.</p><p>The software developer would then experiment with hypothetical ways to enable the quantity of items to change from 0 or 1 to the maximum number in stock.</p><hr><h2 id="2-agile-cuts-time-consuming-planning-and-speeds-up-turnaround-of-projects">Agile cuts time-consuming planning and speeds up turnaround of projects</h2><p>Frameworks based on Agile including Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming, Feature-Driven Development and Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) may emulate the adaptivity encouraged by Agile Software Development.</p><p>But they don’t necessarily have to be followed if they don’t necessarily meet the needs of failing faster, getting results faster and deploying software faster to give value to the customer faster.</p><p>That’s the beauty of the Agile approach. Nothing has to be concrete from the start and adjustments can be made along the way.

There are surely research projects as well as business requirements around the delivery of software that could potentially be delivered through the Waterfall approach or maybe through a combination of the two.”</p><p>To this, he recommended that project managers and teams should strive to increase their effectiveness and efficiency.</p><p>“If that can be done by building on top of the Agile values then great; if not, then maybe they will need to try and come up with a different formula.”</p><blockquote><p>“People focusing too much on what Agile is and what is not—if it needs to be Scrum or Kanban or if too much documentation or too much time spent in design is not Agile—are bound to make mistakes.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h3 id="5-the-agile-industrial-complex">The Agile Industrial Complex</h3><p>He also agreed that the imposition of Agile on teams, i.e. The Agile Industrial Complex, is defeating the purpose of Agile in finding what works best for teams in working adaptively.</p><p>“Once more, I can’t stress enough how there is no single perfect development model. Project managers need to always assess what is fit for purpose.”</p><p>“Primarily though, they should focus on the underpinning values and principles that Agile or other development models are characterised by. When they do, a recurrent mistake that I have experienced through my consulting career is the oversimplification of Agile as an anti-methodology, anti-documentation and anti-planning development model.”</p><p>“I appreciate that this makes understanding Agile much easier, but at the same time it is a very unfair representation of what Agile is!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>While working on <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault’s</a> <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/playground/go">Go Playground</a>, I came across a very strange error. The standard library’s <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/?m=all#Printf" rel="noopener">fmt.Printf()</a> function prints nothing to the console when called. <em>Nothing.</em></p>



<p>For those of you who are familiar with the function, when compiled to a “normal” executable <code>fmt.Printf</code> prints a formatted string to standard output. As per the official documentation, this program:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	const name, age = "Kim", 22
	fmt.Printf("%s is %d years old.", name, age)
}</code></pre>



<p>Will print:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Kim is 22 years old.</code></pre>



<p>The interesting thing is that when the same exact program is compiled using Web Assembly, we get a different result. If you want to try it, copy the above program and run it <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/playground/go">here</a>.</p>



<p>Spoiler alert: <em>It doesn’t print anything.</em></p>



<p>However, if you change the program slightly:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	const name, age = "Kim", 22
	// add a newline character
	fmt.Printf("%s is %d years old.\n", name, age)
}</code></pre>



<p>Then it may print the expected:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Kim is 22 years old.</code></pre>



<p> thought if you run the two programs back to back, you may actually find that this is printed instead:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Kim is 22 years old.Kim is 22 years old.</code></pre>



<h2>Why?</h2>



<p>When compiled to Web Assembly, the <code>fmt.Printf</code> function is writing to a buffer, and that buffer is not cleared until a newline character is printed to standard out. In other words, you can call <code>fmt.Printf</code> as many times as you want, but nothing is printed until a <code>\n</code> character comes through standard output.</p>



<p>Take a look at the <code>writeSync()</code> code in Go’s <a href="https://github.com/lane-c-wagner/classroom.qvault.io/blob/master/public/wasm_exec.js#L43">wasm_exec.js</a>, which is a required include to execute Go Web Assembly in the browser:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">writeSync(fd, buf) {
	outputBuf += decoder.decode(buf);
	const nl = outputBuf.lastIndexOf("\n");
	if (nl != -1) {
		console.log(outputBuf.substr(0, nl));
		outputBuf = outputBuf.substr(nl + 1);
	}
	return buf.length;
}</code></pre>



<p>As you can see, <code>console.log()</code> is only called on the buffer if a newline is found within the output string, otherwise the output is just appended to the stateful <code>outputBuf</code>.</p>



<p>My current working theory is that it was implemented this way because there is no way to print to the console in a browser without appending a newline. JavaScript’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log" rel="noopener">console.log()</a> <em>always </em>appends a newline.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_13429"><div><p>We’ve all sat in those presentations.  A speaker with a stream of slides full of text, monotonously reading them off as we read along.  We’re so used to it we expect it.  We accept it.  We even consider it ‘learning’. As an educator I push against ‘death by PowerPoint’ and I'm fascinated with how we can improve the way we present and teach.  The fact is we know that PowerPoint kills.  Most often the only victims are our audience’s inspiration and interest.  This, however, is the story of a PowerPoint slide that actually helped kill seven people.</p><p>January 16th 2003.  NASA Mission STS-107 is underway. The Space Shuttle Columbia launches carrying its crew of seven to low orbit.  Their objective was to study the effects of microgravity on the human body and on ants and spiders they had with them.  Columbia had been the first Space Shuttle, first launched in 1981 and had been on 27 missions prior to this one.  Whereas other shuttle crews had focused on work to the Hubble Space Telescope or to the International Space Station this mission was one of pure scientific research.  </p><p>The launch proceeded as normal.  The crew settled into their mission.  They would spend 16 days in orbit, completing 80 experiments.  One day into their mission it was clear to those back on Earth that something had gone wrong.  </p><p>As a matter of protocol NASA staff reviewed footage from an external camera mounted to the fuel tank.  At eighty-two seconds into the launch a piece of spray on foam insulation (SOFI) fell from one of the ramps that attached the shuttle to its external fuel tank.  As the crew rose at 28,968 kilometres per hour the piece of foam collided with one of the tiles on the outer edge of the shuttle’s left wing.  </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_17738"><div><p>It was impossible to tell from Earth how much damage this foam, falling nine times faster than a fired bullet, would have caused when it collided with the wing.   Foam falling during launch was nothing new.  It had happened on four previous missions and was one of the reasons why the camera was there in the first place.  But the tile the foam had struck was on the edge of the wing designed to protect the shuttle from the heat of Earth’s atmosphere during launch and re-entry.  In space the shuttle was safe but NASA didn’t know how it would respond to re-entry.  There were a number of options.  The astronauts could perform a spacewalk and visually inspect the hull.  NASA could launch another Space Shuttle to pick the crew up.  Or they could risk re-entry.  </p><p>NASA officials sat down with Boeing Corporation engineers who took them through three reports; a total of 28 slides.    The salient point was whilst there was data showing that the tiles on the shuttle wing could tolerate being hit by the foam this was based on test conditions using foam more than 600 times smaller than that that had struck Columbia.  This is the slide the engineers chose to illustrate this point:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_26426"><div><p>NASA managers listened to the engineers and their PowerPoint.  The engineers felt they had communicated the potential risks.  NASA felt the engineers didn’t know what would happen but that all data pointed to there not being enough damage to put the lives of the crew in danger.  They rejected the other options and pushed ahead with Columbia re-entering Earth’s atmosphere as normal.  Columbia was scheduled to land at 0916 (EST) on February 1st 2003.  Just before 0900, 61,170 metres above Dallas at 18 times the speed of sound, temperature readings on the shuttle’s left wing were abnormally high and then were lost.  Tyre pressures on the left side were soon lost as was communication with the crew.  At 0912, as Columbia should have been approaching the runway, ground control heard reports from residents near Dallas that the shuttle had been seen disintegrating.  Columbia was lost and with it her crew of seven.  The oldest crew member was 48.  </p><p>The shuttle programme was on lock down, grounded for two years as the investigation began.  The cause of the accident became clear: <em>a hole in a tile on the left wing caused by the foam let the wing dangerously overheat until the shuttle disintegrated</em>.  </p><p>The questions to answer included a very simple one: <strong>Why, given that the foam strike had occurred at a force massively out of test conditions had NASA proceeded with re-entry? </strong> </p><p>Edward Tufte, a Professor at Yale University and expert in communication reviewed the slideshow the Boeing engineers had given NASA, in particular the above slide.  His findings were tragically profound.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555332030872_26463"><p>Thirdly, there is a huge amount of text, more than 100 words or figures on one screen.   Two words, ‘SOFI’ and ‘ramp’ both mean the same thing: the foam.  Vague terms are used.  <em>Sufficient</em> is used once, <em>significant </em>or <em>significantly</em>, five times with little or no quantifiable data.  As a result this left a lot open to audience interpretation.  How much is significant?  Is it statistical significance you mean or something else?  </p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555332030872_55842"><div><p>NASA’s subsequent report criticised technical aspects along with human factors.  <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/akamai.netstorage/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_full.pdf" target="_blank">Their report</a> mentioned an over-reliance on PowerPoint:</p><p><em> “The Board views the endemic use of PowerPoint briefing slides instead of technical papers as an illustration of the problematic methods of technical communication at NASA.” </em></p><p> Edward Tufte’s full report makes for<a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB" target="_blank"> fascinating reading</a>. Since being released in 1987 PowerPoint has grown exponentially to the point where <a href="https://www.thinkoutsidetheslide.com/are-we-wasting-250-million-per-day-due-to-bad-powerpoint/" target="_blank">it is now estimated</a> than thirty million PowerPoint presentations are made every day.  Yet, PowerPoint is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/23/powerpoint-thought-students-bullet-points-information" target="_blank">blamed</a> by academics for killing critical thought.  Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/08/22/jeff-bezos-banned-powerpoint-presentations-at-amazon-meetings-heres-what-replaced-them/#4578b4773b5f" target="_blank">banned it from meetings</a>.   Typing text on a screen and reading it out loud does not count as teaching.  An audience reading text off the screen does not count as learning.  Imagine if the engineers had put up a slide with just: “<strong>foam strike more than 600 times bigger than test data</strong>.”  Maybe NASA would have listened.  Maybe they wouldn’t have attempted re-entry.  Next time you’re asked to give a talk remember Columbia. Don’t just jump to your laptop and write out slides of text.  Think about your message.  Don’t let that message be lost amongst text.  Death by PowerPoint is a real thing.  Sometimes literally.</p><p>Thanks for reading</p><p> - Jamie </p></div></div></div>]]>
