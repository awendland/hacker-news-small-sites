<div>
<p><strong>Wireguard is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology that aims to enable the easy deployment and configuration of servers and clients. Wireguard is intended to replace the use of IPSec or OpenVPN for many VPN applications.</strong> </p>



<p>Wireguard offers both kernel and userspace implementations. The in-kernel version is faster, but must be customized for each OS, and not every OS supports this yet. The first kernel implementation was offered for Linux, but there is now an in-kernel implementations for FreeBSD, and also one for OpenBSD, with a NetBSD implementation in progress. Wireguard needed crypto primitives that were not present in FreeBSD, having high quality native support required a large amount of work and communication with the upstream Wireguard project. The FreeBSD kernel implementation was written by Matt Macy with sponsorship from NetGate, without this vendor support it is unlikely that a project of this size would have been successful.</p>



<p>The main userspace implementation of wireguard is a golang application and it is available via the wireguard-go tool available in FreeBSD ports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A wireguard network configuration is formed of interfaces and peers. Each interface is defined by its private key, peers are defined by their public key and the set of addresses they are allowed to use. This forms a network that uses cryptokey routing.</p>

<p>With cryptokey routing, hosts are defined by their cryptographic keys, where public keys are used as identifiers. This means that most of the configuration for wireguard requires dealing with these public keys. Wireguard does not specify mechanisms for key distribution and management, and it is fair to compare this with the distribution of ssh keys. Unlike ssh, the public keys need to be available for both sides of the connection.</p>



<p>Wireguard uses INI files for static configuration, a config file might look like:</p>



<pre><code>[Interface]
PrivateKey = EO9b4bV1qg0veyFelERv69v4eamKu/evGZ/Hbiq82Eg=
ListenPort = 51820

[Peer]
PublicKey = ZBF6vo22sBkT0ro/xnlZ0EZsFGTYPTOvY8luFFtJwwk=    
AllowedIPs = 10.10.0.2/32

[Peer]
PublicKey = fnpAo3hMf9UOtPpM+CUtpB+ETvB5XjNLIuTGsX+qnCc
AllowedIPs = 10.10.0.138/32

[Peer]
PublicKey = Tpdhd68aaDAQfNsnqzoViMl1h+yHeYuVZ22xrY1BM0I=
AllowedIPs = 10.10.0.3/32, 192.168.2.1/24
</code></pre>



<p>The allowed IP addresses act as a routing table. When traffic is sent, the packet is compared to the peer’s AllowedIPs, and if it matches the address or the subnet, the packet is encrypted using the peer’s public key and forwarded over the tunnel in its direction.</p>



<p>On receipt of a packet, AllowedIPs acts as a receive filter. The packet is first decrypted and authenticated, and then it is evaluated against the AllowedIPs to verify that it is allowed to enter the network.</p>



<h4><strong>Installation</strong></h4>



<p>Wireguard makes a serious effort to make the tools it offers consistent on all platforms. To do this, there are two components that determine whether the kernel or userspace implementation is used. The first is a method to create a wireguard interface; this is the component that changes between kernel and userspace versions, then there is a single configuration wg(8) tool to manage the VPN.</p>



<p>This approach intends to smooth over platform configuration differences. The platform specific part is creating and configuring the network interface, but the VPN configuration should all be manageable with a single consistent tool.</p>



<p>FreeBSD has an in-kernel implementation of wireguard that landed in the tree in&nbsp;<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=368163">November 2020</a>. The in-kernel implementation is still very fresh, so in this article we will use the userspace tool, as it is available in the most supported versions of FreeBSD today. The in-kernel implementation key generation is still performed using the wg(8) tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can install wg(8) and wireguard-go (the wireguard userspace implementation) from ports with:</p>



<pre><code># pkg install wireguard wireguard-tools</code></pre>



<h4><strong>Creating Keys</strong></h4>



<p>Our host’s identity is defined by its key pair. We need to generate a wireguard private key using the&nbsp;wg genkey&nbsp;command; wireguard helpfully (if frustratingly) insists that we don’t place the private key in a world readable file. To generate the key and append it to a file, we need to temporally change our umask:</p>



<pre><code># (umask 0077; wg genkey &gt; private.key)
# cat private.key
MOtM8w02ONtGK9vmLCXlx6em+5pRTm6C0z7HCeIrPlY=
</code></pre>



<p>This command creates a private key and places it into a file called private.key. We can view the private key by catting the file; anyone with the private key can act as the server, so you should be very careful with your wireguard private keys. Wireguard tools will typically censor the private key in output unless additional flags are given.&nbsp;</p>



<div data-columns="3" data-layout="50-25-25"><div>




<div><div>
<p>Did you know?</p>



<h2>You can maximize the <strong>power of your FreeBSD</strong> infrastructure with our <strong>Support Subscription!</strong></h2>




</div></div>




</div></div>



<p>Wireguard uses our public key as our identity, wg(8) will show us the public key for a private key with the&nbsp;<em>wg pubkeycommand</em>:</p>



<pre><code># wg pubkey &lt; private.key
APWANIrAD3drcSNUdDuUuXLsCRksKxuQxwBHf56UxiM=
</code></pre>



<h4><strong>Server Side</strong></h4>



<p>First, let’s configure our server side. The server is going to act as the central host in our network with several clients connecting to it for access. This host needs to have a stable public IP and a known shared port to accept wireguard traffic on.</p>



<p>We need to generate keys for the server:</p>



<pre><code>wg-server (umask 0077; wg genkey &gt; server.key)
wg-server # cat server.key
AJKFyhDoLfLnlclEcKV97bRonVKGgEbRGi7vGfeYNnw=
wg-server # wg pubkey &lt; server.key      # show the public key for this private key
j2klzAC0RnWOOUAcZw+/GEtp5URCSwf9r3yW+JYJRRE=
</code></pre>



<p>Next, there are a few steps to set up the network. We need to create a wireguard interface using wireguard-go:</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # wireguard-go wg0
INFO: (wg0) 2021/01/08 14:35:42 Starting wireguard-go version 0.0.20200320
</code></pre>



<p>This interface needs to be configured to have an address in our private network on the host and a route to direct traffic into the wireguard tunnel. We use the wg(8) tool to configure the interface’s private key.</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # ifconfig wg0 inet 10.10.0.1/24 10.10.0.1
wg-client # route add 10.10.0.0/24 -interface wg0
wg-server # wg set wg0 private-key ./server.key listen-port 51820
</code></pre>



<p>If we don’t specify the listen port here, then wireguard will select a random port when the wg0 interface is brought up. For a destination server like this, we need to have a consistent port between addresses, and so we use one common to wireguard here.</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # ifconfig wg0 down
wg-server # ifconfig wg0 up
</code></pre>



<p>Finally, we need to configure each peer with its public key and the IP addresses it is allowed to use:</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # wg set wg0 peer &lt;peer pubkey&gt; allowed-ips 10.10.0.2/32 </code></pre>



<h4><strong>FreeBSD Client</strong></h4>



<p>Each client needs to go through similar steps: first create a private key to identify the client:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client (umask 0077; wg genkey &gt; client.key)
wg-client # cat client.key
gM3ydSBBTZOw1nzIyV/nxJuONB8/MNe/RhcOikQbE3Y=
wg-client # wg pubkey &lt; client.key      # show the public key for this private key
jILr21Xt+3sXDZepu5Z3syuJMXyc29f5GBXHZFPulEE=
</code></pre>



<p>We need to create the wireguard interface by running wireguard-go:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # wireguard-go wg0            # create the wg0 interface</code></pre>



<p>This interface is then configured for the internal VPN network. wireguard-go creates a tun interface, and tun interfaces need to be configured with a source and destination address. As that is not important here, we can use the same address for both parts. To make sure we can reach the internal network properly, we also need to add a route:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # ifconfig wg0 inet 10.10.0.2/24 10.10.0.2
wg-client # route add 10.10.0.0/24 -interface wg0
</code></pre>



<p>With the interface configured, we can now configure wireguard:</p>



<pre>wg-client # wg set wg0 private-key ./client.key&nbsp;</pre>



<p>Finally, we need to configure the wg0 interface with an endpoint for the server:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # ifconfig wg0 down
wg-client # ifconfig wg0 up
wg-client # wg set wg0 peer &lt;peer pubkey&gt; allowed-ips 10.10.0.0/24 endpoint 192.0.2.42:51820
</code></pre>



<p>When we configured the client peer, we told wireguard where to find the server with the endpoint parameter. In this case the client doesn’t listen on a predictable port, but instead it first has to create the wireguard tunnel with the server when traffic needs to be sent.</p>



<p>Now that we have created and configured our client, we need to add its public key and allowed-ip addresses to the server.</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # wg set wg0 peer jILr21Xt+3sXDZepu5Z3syuJMXyc29f5GBXHZFPulEE= allowed-ips 10.10.0.2/32 </code></pre>



<p>Finally we can test the set up using ping:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # ping 10.10.0.1
PING 10.10.0.1 (10.10.0.1): 56 data bytes                 
64 bytes from 10.10.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=3.253 ms  
64 bytes from 10.10.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.358 ms  
64 bytes from 10.10.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.089 ms                                                            
64 bytes from 10.10.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=1.649 ms                                                            
^C                           
</code></pre>



<p>Wireguard is not a ‘chatty’ protocol. If there is no traffic to send from the client for a long time, and it doesn’t have a fixed address, the server can ‘forget’ how to reach the client.</p>



<p>It might be the case that the client is behind a NAT network. To support this case, wireguard supports the<em>&nbsp;persistent-keepalive&nbsp;</em>configuration option. This option is disabled by default, but it allows our client to receive packets from the server when it is not sending traffic itself.</p>



<p>RFC4787 recommends a 2 minute timeout interval for NATs and middleboxes, but recent UDP protocols (such as QUIC), recommend sending packets every 30 seconds to prevent middleboxes from&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1879141.1879174">losing state for UDP flows</a>.</p>



<p>If you need the tunnel connection kept alive, add the&nbsp;persistent-keepalive&nbsp;parameter:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # wg set wg0 peer &lt;peer pubkey&gt; allowed-ips 10.10.0.0/24 persistent-keepalive 30 endpoint 192.0.2.42:51820</code></pre>

<p>The pandemic has subsided; the number of people who have recovered from COVID19 (SARS-CoV-2) have been steadily rising. With this new development, the question of how long the immunity against the virus will last remains a cause for concern for experts, including the general public.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.rockefeller.edu/news/30005-sars-cov-2-immune-response-improves-long-term-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new study</a> has found that the immunity against COVID-19 post recovery remains for at least six months and likely even longer.</p>
<p><span>In the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03207-w#citeas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper published</a> in the journal <em>Nature</em>, the researchers note that the immune system studies the nature of the virus remarkably well and strategize itself to develop better and more effective antibodies even after the infection has abated.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p>Now before we get further into detail, let’s first understand how our immune system protects us from many different types of unwanted invaders, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi, and how it helps us attain immunity against them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The immune system is an army of cells, tissues, and organs that coordinate the bodily defenses against any threats. The white blood cells, also known as leukocytes, are one of the most important cells involved in the process, and they circulate throughout the body and make sure there are not any unwanted foreign invaders that may harm us.</p>



<p>There are two divisions of leukocytes, and they are: phagocytes and lymphocytes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phagocytes are the first cells to trigger <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000821.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immune response</a>; they destroy any foreign cells they encounter through ingestion. This helps them identify the antigen present in the foreign cells, and transmit this information to lymphocytes, which then hunt for infected body cells and annihilate them completely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lymphocytes unit of the immune system comprises of two major cellular components called B-cells and T-cells. These cells utilize the information collected from the antigens to recognize any unwanted visitors in the future. So once a threat makes another visit, the cells will unleash the right antibodies to destroy the invaders. This is how our body develops immunity against certain diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the effectiveness of immune response decreases with time as the level of antibodies drops after a certain period. So in order to deal with pathogens more efficiently, the immune system doesn’t always produce antibodies, instead it resorts to creating memory B-cells that easily recognize the pathogen and release a new batch of antibodies upon re-exposure to the any unwanted visitors.</p>



<p>In the study, the researchers found that these antibodies emerged post SARS-CoV-2 infection are the results of immune cells working in choir to evolve while simultaneously being constantly exposed to hidden remnants of the virus in the intestinal wall. And as a result, the next time a recovered patient contracts the virus, their body will initiate a rapid immune response to the virus, hence preventing reinfection. However, the efficacy of this memory on warding off the infection is solely determined by the nature of the pathogen the person has contracted with.</p>



<p>For the study, the researchers assessed the antibody responses of 87 participants at two separate time-points: one month following infection, and then again after six months. They found that although the antibodies lingered on the participants’ blood plasma for six months, there were significant drops in their levels and as a result of that, the ability to neutralize the virus plummeted five-fold.</p>



<p>Surprisingly however, the subsequent batch of antibodies produced by the memory B cells in patients, increased in some cases. The researches have specified that the overall numbers of memory B-cells that unleashed antibodies that attack the receptor-binding domain of the virus, remained the same. These antibodies are the ones that will fend off the virus upon re-encounter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, upon closer inspection at the memory B cells, the team also found that these cells had mutated many times over even after the infection waned, and this made the antibodies the cells created outperformed the originals in staving off the virus. Moreover, this new set of antibodies could latch on to the virus and even identify the mutated versions of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They have been found to be able to identify even the mutated version of SARS-CoV-2 including <a href="https://theconversation.com/south-african-scientists-who-discovered-new-covid-19-variant-share-what-they-know-153313" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South African Variants</a> (called 501Y.V2) that have undergone mutations for more than 20 times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The memory B cells of course mutate and deploy antibodies at times of infections like HIV or herpes, but seeing them evolve with SARS-CoV-2, which is believed to wither soon after infection has resolved, was never expected until now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SARS-Cov-2 thrives and replicates in the upper respiratory tract. However, upon examining biopsies of intestinal tissue from recovered patients, its genetic materials and proteins were detected within it. The researchers conjecture this could be what’s fueling the evolution of memory B-cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The infectiousness of these viral remnants are yet to be determined. In the future, the team plans to understand the role these viral remnants play in immunity as well as in the progression of the disease by making more participants involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study has been published in the journal <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03207-w#citeas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature</a></em>:</p>

<p>Some critics think the curl project shouldn’t use GitHub. The reasons for being against GitHub hosting tend to be one or more of:</p>



<ol><li>it is an evil proprietary platform</li><li>it is run by Microsoft and they are evil</li><li> GitHub is American thus evil</li></ol>



<p>Some have insisted on craziness like “we let GitHub hold our source code hostage”.</p>



<h2>Why GitHub?</h2>



<p>The curl project <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2010/03/23/curl-goes-git/">switched to GitHub</a> (from Sourceforge) almost eleven years ago and it’s been a smooth ride ever since.</p>



<p>We’re on GitHub not only because it provides a myriad of practical features and is a stable and snappy service for hosting and managing source code. GitHub is also a developer hub for millions of developers who already have accounts and are familiar with the GitHub style of developing, the terms and the tools. By being on GitHub, we reduce friction from the contribution process and we maximize the ability for others to join in and help. We lower the bar. This is good for us.</p>



<p>I like GitHub.</p>



<h2>Self-hosting is not better</h2>



<p>Providing even close to the same uptime and snappy response times with a self-hosted service is a challenge, and it would take someone time and energy to volunteer that work – time and energy we now instead can spend of developing the project instead. As a small independent open source project, we don’t have any “infrastructure department” that would do it for us. And trust me: we already have enough infrastructure management to deal with without having to add to that pile.</p>



<p>… and by running our own hosted version, we would lose the “network effect” and convenience for people that already are on and know the platform. We would also lose the easy integration with cool services like the many different CI and code analyzer jobs we run.</p>



<h2>Proprietary is not the issue</h2>



<p>While git is open source, GitHub is a proprietary system. But the thing is that even if we would go with a competitor and get our code hosting done elsewhere, our code would still be stored on a machine somewhere in a remote server park we cannot physically access – ever. It doesn’t matter if that hosting company uses open source or proprietary code. If they decide to switch off the servers one day, or even just selectively block our project, there’s nothing we can do to get our stuff back out from there.</p>



<p>We have to work so that we minimize the risk for it and the effects from it if it still happens.</p>



<p>A proprietary software platform holds our code just as much hostage as any free or open source software platform would, simply by the fact that we let someone else host it. They run the servers our code is stored on.</p>



<h2>If GitHub takes the ball and goes home</h2>



<p>No matter which service we use, there’s always a risk that they will turn off the light one day and not come back – or just change the rules or licensing terms that would prevent us from staying there. We cannot avoid that risk. But we can make sure that we’re smart about it, have a contingency plan or at least an idea of what to do when that day comes.</p>



<p>If GitHub shuts down immediately and we get zero warning to rescue anything at all from them, what would be the result for the curl project?</p>



<p><strong>Code.</strong> We would still have the entire git repository with all code, all source history and all existing branches up until that point. We’re hundreds of developers who pull that repository frequently, and many automatically, so there’s a very distributed backup all over the world.</p>



<p><strong>CI</strong>. Most of our CI setup is done with yaml config files in the source repo. If we transition to another hosting platform, we could reuse them.</p>



<p><strong>Issues</strong>. Bug reports and pull requests are stored on GitHub and a sudden exit would definitely make us lose some of them. We do daily “extractions” of all issues and pull-requests so a lot of meta-data could still be saved and preserved. I don’t think this would be a terribly hard blow either: we move long-standing bugs and ideas over to documents in the repository, so the currently open ones are likely possible to get resubmitted again within the nearest future.</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that it would be a significant speed bump for the project, but it would not be worse than that. We could bounce back on a new platform and development would go on <em>within days</em>.</p>



<h2>Low risk</h2>



<p>It’s a rare thing, that a service just suddenly with no warning and no heads up would just go black and leave projects completely stranded. In most cases, we get alerts, notifications and get a chance to transition cleanly and orderly.</p>



<h2>There are alternatives</h2>



<p>Sure there are alternatives. Both pure GitHub alternatives that look similar and provide similar services, and projects that would allow us to run similar things ourselves and host locally. There are many options.</p>



<p><strong>I’m not looking for alternatives. I’m not planning to switch hosting anytime soon!</strong> As mentioned above, I think GitHub is a net positive for the curl project.</p>



<h2>Nothing lasts forever</h2>



<p>We’ve switched services several times before and I’m expecting that we will change again in the future, for all sorts of hosting and related project offerings that we provide to the work and to the developers and participators within the project. Nothing lasts forever.</p>



<p>When  a service we use goes down or just turns sour, we will figure out the best possible replacement and take the jump. Then we patch up all the cracks the jump may have caused and continue the race into the future. Onward and upward. The way we know and the way we’ve done for over twenty years already. </p>

<h2>Updates</h2>



<p>After this blog post went live, some users remarked than I’m “<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/bfxd28">disingenuous</a>” in the list of reasons at the top, that people have presented to me.  This, because I don’t mention the moral issues staying on GitHub present – like for example previously reported workplace conflicts and their association with hideous American immigration authorities.</p>



<p>This is rather the opposite of  disingenuous. This is the truth. Not a single person have <em>ever</em> asked me to leave GitHub for those reasons. Not me personally, and nobody has asked it out to the wider project either.</p>



<p>These are good reasons to discuss and consider if a service should be used. Have there been violations of “decency” significant enough that should make us leave? Have we crossed that line in the sand? I’m leaning to “no” now, but I’m always listening to what curl users and developers say. Where do you think the line is drawn?</p>

January 27, 2021 | https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>
I am often asked what I mean when I say that developers spend most of their time figuring the system out. Let’s unpack the statement.
</p>
<p>
The oldest reference on the topic I know of dates back to 1979 in a book by Zelkowitz, Shaw, and Gannon entitled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-software-engineering-design-Prentice-Hall/dp/013710202X">Principles of software engineering and design</a>. It said that most of the development time was spent on maintenance (67%).
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/1979-graph-picture.png" alt="Software development costs (1979)">
	<figcaption>Software development costs (1979)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Granted, the book does not specify how the figure was obtained. Still, it was deemed an important enough problem to attract significant research attention since then.
</p>
<p>
So, how far are we now, more than 4 decades later?
</p>
<p>
Let’s look at a recent paper by Xia, Bao, Lo, Xing, Hassan, &amp; Li entitled <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318811113_Measuring_Program_Comprehension_A_Large-Scale_Field_Study_with_Professionals">Measuring Program Comprehension: A Large-Scale Field Study with Professionals</a> and published in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 44, 951-976, 2018. This paper is quite interesting in that it describes in great details how the figures are obtained. And it says that Comprehension took on average ~58%.
</p>
<p>
Now, take a closer look at the results table.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/2018-costs.png" alt="Software development costs (2018)">
	<figcaption>Software development costs (2018)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
In particular, take a look at the third column in the table: it says Navigation accounts for 24% of the effort, and that is considered separately from the Comprehension effort!
</p>
<p>
So, after 4 decades, we can observe that not much has changed beside learning how to measure the “figuring out” time.
</p>
<p>
So what?
</p>
<p>
Well, that is the single largest expense we have. If we want to optimize anything in our discipline we should look at this part first. We talk often about how we build systems, but how often do you talk about how you spend the “figuring out" time? If we do not talk about it, it’s not explicit. If it’s not explicit, it does not get optimized.
</p>
<p>
If we do talk about how the “figuring out the system” time is spent, we notice that people spend it reading. In fact, as the above paper also shows, comprehension is essentially measured as reading! The two are considered as mostly synonymous.
</p>
<p>
So, how should we talk about how we figure the system out?
</p>
<p>
Given that not much happened for 4 decades, we should entertain the idea that maybe we should frame the problem differently. 
</p>
<p>
Please, bear with me. This is where it gets interesting. So, why do developers read code? Because they want to figure the situation enough to know what to do next. The intent is important. This is decision making.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/decision-making.png" alt="The figuring out time is a decision making time">
	<figcaption>The figuring out time is a decision making time</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
From this perspective, reading is just the means through which information is gathered from data. It also happens to be the most manual possible way to do that, so this lends itself to an important opportunity for optimization.
</p>
<p>
Before you can do something significant about anything, you have to name it. Otherwise it's like with Voldemort. <a href="http://humane-assessment.com/">Many winters ago</a>, I called the effort of “figuring the system out to know what to do next" assessment. And I claimed we should optimize development around it.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/assessment.png" alt="Assessment is the process of understanding a situation around a system enough to make a decision">
	<figcaption>Assessment is the process of understanding a situation around a system enough to make a decision</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
For a whole decade my colleagues and I explored this idea. And it led us to what we now call moldable development.
</p>
<p>
What’s that?
</p>
<p>
Reading is the most manual way to extract information out of data. It does not scale and leads to incomplete information &amp; uncertainty.
</p>
<p>
Software is hard enough. Not knowing what the current system is like should not be an acceptable variable in the equation. A hand drawn picture about the current system is a belief. Decisions should never be based on beliefs. Not in engineering.
</p>
<p>
Once we accept that systems are data, it becomes obvious we should approach it like data, too. Data science tells us that you first start from the problem and then reason through a tool that matches the context.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/molding.png" alt="Tools should match the context">
	<figcaption>Tools should match the context</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
 As software is highly contextual we cannot predict specific problems. We can only predict classes of problems. To handle this, the key idea of moldable development is that the tool should be moldable after knowing the problem. In this way it can deal with what's important in context, and because of it, it can take care of the boring part of reading. Of course, for this to be practical, the cost of creating custom tools must be small.
</p>
<p>
I see the flow of constructing custom tools during development, and, ideally, for every single development problem, as the next major leap in software development.
</p>
<p>
In a decade from now, we should not be measuring the "figuring the system out” in terms of reading. We should occupy our energy with solving actual problems. To get there we should start by talking about how not to read code. We cannot afford not to.
</p>
<p>
We created <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a> to provide a concrete start for the "how not to read code" conversation. Glamorous Toolkit is a moldable development environment that makes it possible to create custom tools about software systems inexpensively.
</p>
<p>
So, go to <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">gtoolkit.com</a>. Play with it. Feel #MoldableDevelopment.
</p>
<p>
And do engage with us: <a href="https://discord.gg/FTJr9gP">discord.gg/FTJr9gP</a>.
</p>
<p>
Let’s make that conversation happen.

<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2020-01-18</span>. Modified on <span id="moddate">2020-03-13</span>.</p>
<p>As an operating system GNU/Linux has become a mess because of the fragmented nature of the project, the bloatware in the kernel, and because of the jerking around by commercial interests. There exist several technical reasons for when a migration from GNU/Linux to BSD might make sense, but this article isn't about that, it's an opinionated rant, more than anything else.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the past I have always been a favorite of choosing operating system and tools based upon technical merit. However, in today's world of companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and many others, compromising user privacy, and conducting controversial activities, I don't believe that to be the right cause of action.</p>
<p>Proprietary operating systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10#Privacy_and_data_collection">Microsoft Windows 10</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/iosecure/357e724811fe04167332ef54e736670d">Apple MacOS</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29#Security_and_privacy">Google Android</a> have become famous for their ill conduct, and even companies like Lenovo is using UEFI boot to inject custom Windows components, so that the system can phone home to Lenovo.</p>
<p>As a result of all this I have been a proponent for the Open Source alternatives, like GNU/Linux and BSD, for a very long time. Not only that, I also believe that the Open Source alternatives are much better in many technical areas.</p>
<p>I have also always been very much against <a href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/the-typical-discussions-about-bsd-vs-linux.html">The typical discussions about BSD vs Linux</a>, and as I wrote in my article back then, I have always believed that the different Open Source projects can help each other and cooperate in kindness, and that end-users should only debate such issues from a technical stand point rather than personal preference.</p>
<p>Whenever it has been possible, I have proposed people, both private and in the industry, to change the operating systems they use to Open Source alternatives, and when people have been receptive to my advocacy I have helped them migrate from Microsoft Windows on their workstations to something like Linux Mint, Xubuntu, or Debian GNU/Linux. And on the server side I have used both BSD and GNU/Linux. This has been a successful endeavor and I have honestly never experienced a dissatisfied person.</p>
<p>However, things are beginning to change in the GNU/Linux world as more and more companies want to control the direction of the project. Due to the structure and organization of GNU/Linux as an operating system, it is unfortunately susceptible to these influences, and while it is still Open Source, and still not anywhere near the bad things that is going on with the proprietary alternatives, some opt-out features have slowly been introduced into both the kernel and systemd.</p>
<p>You can still choose to opt-out of these features and go your merry way, but as an Open Source enthusiast and proponent, and as a privacy concerned individual, perhaps the better approach is to migrate systems to something where you don't have to concern yourself with "creepware".</p>
<p>As a system administrator I don't want to worry about whether I am going to be surprised the next time I upgrade a system, and I don't want to keep a list of things I have to remember to opt-out of whenever I run one of these systems.</p>
<p>Several Linux distributions have decided (not only because of privacy opt-out issues, but other issues as well) to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Linux_distributions_without_systemd">other init solutions than systemd</a>, but with the situation going on in the kernel development, and with many third party applications becoming more and dependent upon systemd, the problems are spreading to other parts of the system and I believe this is becoming an uphill battle.</p>
<p>I don't believe the future of GNU/Linux looks as bright as it used too, and as a possible alternative solution I suggest migrating everything (when possible) to something a bit more sane, like the BSD projects.</p>
<h2 id="fragmented">Linux is fragmented</h2>
<p>In 1983 Richard Stallman announced his intent to start coding the GNU Project in a Usenet message. By June 1987, the project had accumulated and developed free and Open Source software for an assembler, an almost finished portable optimizing C compiler (GCC), an editor (GNU Emacs), and various Unix utilities, such as ls, grep, awk, make and ld.</p>
<p>In 1991, the Linux kernel appeared, developed outside the GNU project by Linus Torvalds, and in December 1992 it was made available under version 2 of the GNU General Public License. Combined with the operating system utilities already developed by the GNU project, it became the GNU/Linux operating system, better known as just "Linux".</p>
<p>Then came the Linux distributions. Different projects took the Linux kernel, the GNU tools and libraries, additional third party software, documentation, the X Window System, a window manager, and a desktop environment, and combined those components into the distributions. Different distributions focused on different goals, some put focus on the desktop while others put their main focus on servers, and again others tried to provide a multi-purpose operating system.</p>
<p>In the past all these different components and projects where developed by Open Source enthusiasts and the passion for programming and Open Source was the driving force.</p>
<p>This is no longer the case!</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds has many times made it very clear that he doesn't care about what goes on in the "Linux world", all he cares about is the kernel development, and on January 6, 2020 in the "Moderated Discussions" forum at <a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=189711&amp;curpostid=189841">realworldtech.com</a>, Linus Torvalds answered a user's question, with an absolute jaw-dropping comment, about a year-old kernel maintenance controversy that heavily impacted the ZFS on Linux project.</p>
<p>After answering the user's actual question, Torvalds went on to make very wrong and damaging claims about the ZFS filesystem. Torvalds said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It (ZFS) was always more of a buzzword than anything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that statements Linus Torvalds has just reduced more that 15 years of development of one of the most robust and popular filesystems in the world into a "buzzword"!</p>
<p>ZFS is described as "The last word in filesystems". It is a combined filesystem and logical volume manager originally designed by Sun Microsystems. ZFS is a stable, fast, secure, and future-proof filesystem. It is scalable, and includes extensive protection against data corruption, support for high storage capacities, a maximum 16 Exabyte file size, and a maximum 256 Quadrillion Zettabytes storage with no limit on number of filesystems (datasets) or files, efficient data compression, snapshots and copy-on-write clones, continuous integrity checking and automatic repair, RAID-Z, native NFSv4 ACLs, and can be very precisely configured.</p>
<p>The two main implementations, by Oracle and by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenZFS">OpenZFS</a> project, are extremely similar, making ZFS widely available within Unix-like systems.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the Wikipedia article, OpenZFS is an umbrella project aimed at bringing together individuals and companies that use the ZFS file system and work on its improvements, aiming as well at making ZFS more widely used and developed in an open-source manner. OpenZFS brings together developers from the illumos, Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS platforms, and a wide range of companies. High-level goals of the project include raising awareness of the quality, utility and availability of open-source implementations of ZFS, encouraging open communication about ongoing efforts toward improving open-source variants of ZFS, and ensuring consistent reliability, functionality and performance of all distributions of ZFS.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/commits/master">OpenZFS on Linux</a>, which is the Linux part of the project, has currently 345 active contributors with more that 5.600 commits, and commits are being made on an almost daily basis!</p>
<p>Some of the worlds biggest CDN and data storage services runs ZFS on either FreeBSD or Linux!</p>
<p>In another situation Linus Torvalds gave an interview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mysM-V5h9z8">TFiR: Open Source and Emerging Tech YouTube channel</a> about Linux on the desktop in which he makes another amazing statement saying that Linux still isn't ready for the desktop and that perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS">Chrome OS</a> is the solution to that problem.</p>
<p>These and many other statements by Linus Torvalds shows that Torvalds should avoid authoritative statements about projects he's unfamiliar with, but more importantly they also show that Linux as an operating system has no real direction and no clear management because the kernel development is performed in isolation from the rest of the Linux world.</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds is generally very open to the rapid influence by corporate interests and his perspective on security is also worrying.</p>
<p>In 2009 Linus Torvalds admitted that the kernel development is getting out of control.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're getting bloated and huge. Yes, it's a problem ... Uh, I'd love to say we have a plan ... I mean, sometimes it's a bit sad that we are definitely not the streamlined, small, hyper-efficient kernel that I envisioned 15 years ago ... The kernel is huge and bloated, and our icache footprint is scary. I mean, there is no question about that. And whenever we add a new feature, it only gets worse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At LinuxCon 2014, he said that he thinks the bloat situation is better because modern PCs are a lot faster!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've been bloating the kernel over the last 20 years, but hardware has grown faster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very problematic attitude.</p>
<p>When software gets bloated it not only becomes more insecure and more error prone, but it also becomes much slower. Thinking that the problem goes away because hardware becomes faster is an immature attitude. In this day and age we need to optimize software so that less power is required, we need to save power and limit pollution.</p>
<p>In a 2007 interview "Why I quit": kernel developer Con Kolivas he stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is any one big problem with kernel development and Linux it is the complete disconnection of the development process from normal users. You know, the ones who constitute 99.9% of the Linux user base. The Linux kernel mailing list is the way to communicate with the …</p></blockquote></article></div>

			<p>I have never used WhatsApp, and never will. Despite this, I still feel the need to write an article about WhatsApp since it’s the perfect case study to help understand a class of businesses models I call “user domestication”. The domestication of users is high on my list of problems plaguing the human race, and is worth a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>With the meta-explanation out of the way, let us begin.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-rise">WhatsApp’s rise</h2>
<p>For those unfamiliar, WhatsApp is a tool that makes it convenient and easy to help Facebook further its core mission: the optimization and auctioning of human behavior (colloquially known as “targeted advertising”). It originally persuaded people to consent to this by allowing them to send text to each other over the Internet, something that was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_protocols">already possible</a>, and combining an easy-to-learn UI with successful marketing. It then expanded to include features such as free voice and video calls. Free calls helped it grow to become the de-facto communication platform in many other countries.</p>
<p>Having its own proprietary chat system incompatible with other clients allowed WhatsApp to build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a>: WhatsApp’s existing users were held captive by the fact that leaving WhatsApp meant losing the ability to communicate with WhatsApp users. People switching from WhatsApp must convince all their friends to switch, too; this includes less technically inclined friends who had a hard time learning WhatsApp in the first place.</p>
<p>In a WhatsApp world, people who want to keep in touch must abide by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone can only use the proprietary WhatsApp client to send messages; developing alternative clients isn’t supported.</li>
<li>Everyone’s mobile device must run an operating system supported by said client. Since WhatsApp developers will only write a client for popular operating systems, the Android and iOS duopoly strengthens.</li>
<li>Users fully depend on WhatsApp developers. If WhatsApp developers decide to include user-hostile features in the app, users must go with it. They can’t switch to a different server or client without switching away from WhatsApp and losing the ability to communicate with all their WhatsApp contacts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-domestication">User domestication</h2>
<p>WhatsApp rose by trapping previously-free beings in their corral and changing their habits to create dependence on masters. Over time, this made it difficult or impossible to return to their previous lifestyle. That process should sound familiar: it’s eerily similar to the domestication of animals. I call this type of vendor lock-in <strong>user domestication:</strong> the removal of user autonomy to trap users into serving vendors.</p>
<p>I chose this metaphor because animal domestication is a gradual process that isn’t always deliberate, and typically revolves around one group becoming dependent upon another. For example: there’s evidence that domestication of dogs began with socialization, resulting in not-entirely-artificial selection promoting genes that resulted in more friendliness with and dependence upon humans.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Whether it happens on purpose or by accident, user domestication almost always follows the same three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>A high level of dependence given from users to a software vendor</li>
<li>An inability for users to control their software, through at least one of the following methods:
<ol>
<li>Preventing modification of the software</li>
<li>Preventing migration onto a different platform</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The exploitation of now-captive users who are unable to resist</li>
</ol>
<p>The completion of the first two steps left WhatsApp users vulnerable to user domestication. With investors to answer to, they had every incentive to implement user-hostile features without consequence.</p>
<p>So, of course, they did.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-descent">WhatsApp’s descent</h2>
<p>Domestication has a purpose: it enables a master species to exploit the domesticated species for its own gain.</p>
<p>Recently, WhatsApp updated its privacy policy to allow sharing data with its parent, Facebook. Users who agreed to use WhatsApp under its previous privacy policy had two options: agree to the new policy or be unable to use WhatsApp again. The WhatsApp privacy policy update is a classic bait-and-switch: WhatsApp lured users in with a sleek interface and the impression of privacy, domesticated them to remove their autonomy to migrate, and then backtracked on its previous commitment to privacy with minimal consequence. Each step in this process enabled the next; had user domestication not taken place, it would be easy for most users to switch away with minimal friction.</p>
<p>Those of us who were sounding the alarm a few years ago experienced a brief moment of sadistic bliss when our titles were upgraded from “annoying and paranoid conspiracy theorists” to just “annoying”.</p>
<h3 id="an-attempt-at-damage-control">An attempt at damage control</h3>
<p>The bait-and-switch operation incurred backlash significant enough for a noticeable minority of users to actually migrate; this number turned out to be slightly more than the rounding error WhatsApp was likely expecting. In response, WhatsApp delayed the change and published the following ad:</p>

	<img width="600" src="https://seirdy.one/p/whatsapp_ad.png" alt="WhatsApp ad describing data not collected">
</picture>

<p>The ad lists various data that WhatsApp doesn’t collect or share. Allaying data collection concerns by listing data <em>not</em> collected is misleading. WhatsApp doesn’t collect hair samples or retinal scans either; not collecting that information doesn’t mean it respects privacy because it doesn’t change the information WhatsApp <em>does</em> collect.</p>
<p>The ad denies “keep[ing] logs of who everyone is messaging or calling”. Collecting data is not the same as “keeping logs”; it’s possible for metadata to be fed into an algorithm before being discarded. A model can thus learn that two users call each other frequently without keeping logs of the metadata for each call. The fact that they specifically chose to phrase this line around logging implies that WhatsApp either already collects this class of data or has deliberately left the door open to collecting it in the future.</p>
<p>A stroll through WhatsApp’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210124061525/https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en">actual privacy policy</a> at the time reveals that they do collect considerable metadata used for marketing through Facebook.</p>
<h2 id="software-freedom">Software freedom</h2>
<p>With user domestication, providing useful software to users is a means to the end of exploiting them. The alternative is simple: make serving users the end in and of itself.</p>
<p>To prevent being controlled by software, users must be in control. Software that allows users to be in control is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a>. The word “free” in this context refers to freedom rather than price. Software freedom is similar to the concept of open-source, but the latter is focused on practical benefits rather than ethics. A less ambiguous term that neutrally refers to both free and open-source software is <strong><abbr title="free and open-source software">FOSS</abbr></strong>.</p>
<p>Others have <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">explained</a> the concepts underpinning free software better than I can, so I won’t go into detail. It comes down to four essential freedoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-money-with-foss">Making money with FOSS</h3>
<p>The most common objection I hear is that FOSS makes it harder to make money.</p>
<p>The key to making money with FOSS is to make software a <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Complement">commoditized complement</a> of other, more profitable services. Examples of such services include selling support, customization, consulting, training, managed hosting, hardware, and certifications. Plenty of companies use this approach instead of building proprietary software: Red Hat, Collabora, System76, Purism, Canonical, SUSE, Hashicorp, Databricks, and Gradle are some names that come to mind.</p>
<p>Managed hosting isn’t a basket worth all your eggs if giants like AWS can do the same at a lower price. Being the developer can give an edge in areas like customization, support, and training; it doesn’t offer as obvious an advantage when it comes to hosting.</p>
<h2 id="foss-isnt-always-enough">FOSS isn’t always enough</h2>
<p>Free software is a necessary but sometimes insufficient requirement to build domestication immunity. Two more measures include <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong>open platforms.</strong></p>
<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
<p>When software grows too complex, it needs to be maintained by a large team. Users who disagree with a vendor can’t easily fork and maintain a multi-million-line codebase, especially if the software in question potentially contains security vulnerabilities. Dependence on the vendor can grow quite problematic when complexity causes development costs to skyrocket; the vendor might resort to implementing user-hostile features to stay afloat.</p>
<p>Complex software that can’t be developed by a different group of people creates dependence, step one of user domestication. That alone is enough to open the door to problematic developments.</p>
<h4 id="case-study-mozilla-and-the-web">Case study: Mozilla and the Web</h4>
<p>Mozilla was a ray of hope in the browser wars, a space dominated by adtech, surveillance, and vendor lock-in. Unfortunately, developing a browser engine is a monumental task difficult enough for Opera and Microsoft to give up and re-skin Chromium. Browsers are more than the document readers they were meant to be: they’ve evolved into application runtimes with their own stacks for GPU acceleration, Bluetooth, permissions, device enumeration, bundled media codecs, <abbr title="digital rights management">DRM</abbr><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, extension APIs, developer tools…the list goes on. It takes billions of dollars a year to respond to vulnerabilities in such a massive attack surface and keep up with a standard that grows at such a worrying rate. Those billions have to come from somewhere.</p>
<p>Mozilla ended up having to make major compromises to stay afloat. It cut search deals with blatantly user-hostile companies, and bundled the browser with <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2014/02/11/publisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center/">ads</a> and bloatware such as a partially ad-funded proprietary bookmarking SaaS called <a href="https://dustri.org/b/firefox-youre-supposed-to-be-in-my-pocket-not-the-other-way-around.html">Pocket</a>. Since acquiring Pocket (to diversify its sources of income), Mozilla hasn’t yet delivered on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/27/mozilla-pockets-pocket-in-first-acquisition/">earlier statements</a> saying it would open-source its code: while the clients have been open-sourced, the server code remains proprietary. Open-sourcing this and re-writing portions if necessary …</p></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<!-- Article Start -->
			
<p>In May 2020, former president Donald Trump wrote on Twitter and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/01/facebook-staff-angry--zuckerberg.html">Facebook</a>, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” encouraging the use of lethal force against Black Lives Matter protesters. Mark Zuckerberg, in communicating with his staff about why he decided not to take down the post, compared it with a statement the company removed from its platform earlier that year in India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kapil Mishra, a Delhi politician from the governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, had given the Delhi police <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/kapil-mishra-delhi-police-caa-protests-jaffrabad-6282870/">an ultimatum</a> a few months earlier on Twitter and Facebook. If the police didn’t clear the streets of protesters demanding a withdrawal of a discriminatory citizenship law, read the now deleted post, Mishra and his supporters would get out there and do it themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he wasn’t alone. Other members of India’s Parliament, such as junior finance minister Anurag Thakur, were <a href="https://fb.watch/3975ctWeM7/">caught</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDQYanaVApE">tape</a> at an election rally in Delhi, urging their supporters to “pump bullets” into “traitors.” When questioned by the media, Thakur suggested that they merely reflected the mood of the public in Delhi.</p>



<p>In the days after Mishra’s statements, mobs of BJP supporters carrying firearms, iron rods, and petrol bombs began attacking Muslim neighbourhoods, killing <a href="https://thewire.in/communalism/delhi-riots-kapil-mishra-minority-commission-report">53 people</a> and injuring another 250 in the heart of India’s capital. The Delhi government’s <a href="https://ia801906.us.archive.org/11/items/dmc-delhi-riot-fact-report-2020/-Delhi-riots-Fact-Finding-2020.pdf">fact-finding commission</a>, headed by an advocate of the Supreme Court, couldn’t have been clearer about what happened: “An incendiary public speech by BJP leader and former MLA Kapil Mishra on 23 February 2020 clearly incited violence in words and intent,” the report read.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet politicians like Kapil Mishra, <a href="https://twitter.com/ianuragthakur?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Anurag Thakur</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/p_sahibsingh?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Parvesh Verma </a>— all implicated in the government’s report — still have their Facebook and Twitter accounts, where they can spread their anti-Muslim message to their combined hundreds of thousands of followers. One post was removed, but their accounts remain. The social media platforms did nothing to block or limit their ability to make similar violent threats in the future or publicize policies that subscribe to Hindutva, an explicitly Hindu-supremacist ideology, despite India’s secular constitution. If these companies can silence a sitting United States President — the world’s most powerful official — why can’t they curb politicians with far less power, like Kapil Mishra?</p>



<p>There’s an obviously cynical conclusion to make: Donald Trump has lost his political power, while Kapil Mishra is only gaining his. The way that Facebook and Twitter have treated these two politicians highlights the fact that the platforms exist to protect the powerful and their own profits over everything else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Populists don’t gain power in a vacuum. They build it using all the advantages that social media gives those who are not constrained by facts and are willing to make open calls for violence. The problem is not freedom of speech— that is sacrosanct. The problem is that, in the pursuit of profit, social media giants will amplify incendiary voices, giving them the freedom to reach more followers. It’s a systemic risk that governments need to tackle with emerging legislation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social media algorithms are the automated editors that decide what you see in your feeds. They are built on massive volumes of data that platforms extract by surveilling everything their users do online. These algorithms are built to maximize our attention and keep us clicking and scrolling so that people can be shown more ads. This addictive design has not been programmed to discern what is true or what is false, what is harmful or what is not.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>While the most stringent regulations are currently in places like California and the European Union, the worst harm is happening far away from the West.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>My organization, <a href="https://www.reset.tech/">Reset</a>, was built to tackle these flaws at the heart of how social media is built. We advocate for stronger enforcement of rules and standards that can severely curtail the amplification of disinformation and hate. And we want to ensure that voices from the “rest of the world” are not lost in regulatory discussions of systemic risk. While the most stringent regulations are currently in places like California and the European Union, the worst harm is happening far away from the West.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In India, staff at Facebook can’t and don’t want to challenge political power that produces industrial quantities of hate and disinformation on their platform. In 2019, I was very surprised to find Facebook’s team in India asleep at the wheel ahead of a major “citizenship” counting exercise that <a href="https://www.fidh.org/en/region/asia/india/assam-the-biggest-mass-disenfranchisement-of-the-21stcentury">could disenfranchise</a> hundreds of thousands of genuine Indian citizens in the eastern state of Assam.</p>



<p>The government, with the help of the media, painted Muslim Bengalis in Assam as immigrants from Bangladesh. India’s home minister called them “<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha-2019/infiltrators-are-termites-will-throw-them-out-amit-shah/article26805646.ece">termites</a>” and threatened to throw them out of the country. Despite <a href="https://avaazpress.s3.amazonaws.com/FINAL-Facebook%20in%20Assam_Megaphone%20for%20hate%20-%20Compressed%20(1).pdf">strong parallels</a> to how Rohingya Muslims were disenfranchised in Myanmar and Facebook’s disastrous role in fanning the flames of genocidal violence there, the company hadn’t seemed to have learned any lessons. It had no plan in place to tackle the huge spike in hate speech and lies that accompanied the citizenship exercise, because they had barely any content moderators who could read and write in the Assamese language.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/07/facebook-does-not-benefit-from-hate/">Public statements</a> by Facebook claimed that what people say and do on its site is merely a mirror of society. If Donald Trump incites a whole movement of white supremacists, it is because white supremacy exists in American society, or Hindu supremacy exists in Indian society, as demonstrated by members of India’s own democratically elected parliament. There is, of course, some truth to that, and traditional media has also helped fan the flames of hatred.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the “passive mirror” defense lodged by major social media companies is one of their greatest lies. Facebook’s own research in Germany showed that 64% of people who joined an extremist group did so because of Facebook’s recommendation tools (the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/facebook-group-recommendations-election/">later paused the feature</a>).&nbsp;In 2014, a former Facebook product manager <a href="http://andrewledvina.com/blog/2014-07-04-10-ways-facebook-is-the-devil/">wrote</a> that Facebook carries out experiments on users all the time — to make them click the like button, click on more ads, and spend more time on the site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The violent events in Washington on January 6 played out under the full glare of the global press, forcing platforms to enforce their own policies on inciting violence. But in the U.S. as well as around the world, social media is still enabling the rise of more Donald Trumps, like Kapil Mishra or Anurag Thakur in India. It won’t stop unless we hit “reset” on Big Tech.</p>

        <p>Rust functions are surprisingly diverse, sitting at the intersection of multiple
language features which may take time to understand. In this post, we’ll walk through
those features and explain how they appear in function signatures, so you can be
well-equipped to understand functions you see in the wild, or identify the best way
to write the functions you need in your own code.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2>



<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<div id="info-1">
    
    <div>
        <div>
            
<h3 id="describing-not-recommending">Describing, not Recommending</h3>

<p>This is a survey of what function signatures <em>can</em> look like in Rust, not a commentary
on what they <em>should</em> look like. Any one of the patterns shown here may be seen in the wild,
and learning to read other people’s code in any language is a valuable skill.</p>

<h3 id="part-of-a-series">Part of a Series</h3>

<p>This is the first of a pair of posts describing how to read Rust function signatures. Part 2,
tackling generic functions, is currently in the works.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
</div>


<h2 id="signatures">Signatures</h2>

<p>First things first, we need a function signature. Let’s start with something basic.</p>

<figure id="code-1">
    <a href="#skip-code-1">Skip this content.</a>
    
<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>example_1</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span><span>;</span>
<span>//           ↑  ↑    ↑  ↑       ↑</span>
<span>//           |  |    |  |       |</span>
<span>//           | type  | type    type</span>
<span>//         pattern  pattern</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

    <figcaption><span>Code 1</span> <p>A simple function signature example.</p> <a href="#code-1"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>This is a function that takes in two 32-bit integers (the <code>i32</code> type), and
returns a 32-bit integer as well. The arrow (<code>-&gt;</code>) indicates the return type.</p>

<p>Note that the types are all explicit. Rust <em>does</em> support type inference, but not for
function signatures. All parameter and return types must be specified.</p>



<p>We can also see that the pattern comes before the type, separated by a colon. This
<code>&lt;pattern&gt;: &lt;type&gt;</code> syntax matches Rust’s general syntax for
<dfn id="def-type-ascription">type ascription</dfn>, which is the Rust term for
specifying types explicitly.</p>

<h2 id="destructuring">Destructuring</h2>

<p>Notice too that I keep saying “pattern” instead of “variable name.” That’s because Rust
parameters are <dfn id="def-pattern" title="pattern">patterns</dfn>, meaning you can
destructure and bind against the internal structure of the types.</p>

<figure id="code-2">
    <a href="#skip-code-2">Skip this content.</a>
    
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>IpV4Address</span><span>(</span><span>u8</span><span>,</span> <span>u8</span><span>,</span> <span>u8</span><span>,</span> <span>u8</span><span>);</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>print_ipv4addr</span><span>(</span><span>IpV4Address</span><span>(</span><span>o1</span><span>,</span> <span>o2</span><span>,</span> <span>o3</span><span>,</span> <span>o4</span><span>):</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>IpV4Address</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}.{}.{}.{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>o1</span><span>,</span> <span>o2</span><span>,</span> <span>o3</span><span>,</span> <span>o4</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>addr</span> <span>=</span> <span>IpV4Address</span><span>(</span><span>127</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>print_ipv4addr</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>addr</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

    <figcaption><span>Code 2</span> <p>An example of a function with destructuring in its parameter list.</p> <a href="#code-2"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>In this example, the <code>IpV4Address</code> type is destructured in the function signature, binding four
variables (<code>o1</code>, <code>o2</code>, <code>o3</code>, and <code>o4</code>) to the respective items in the tuple struct. These
variables are then used in the function body to print the address.</p>

<h3 id="refutability">Refutability</h3>

<p>One restriction of pattern matching in function signatures is that you can only use
<dfn id="dfn-irrefutable">irrefutable</dfn> patterns, meaning <em>patterns that always match</em>.
By contrast, <dfn id="dfn-refutable">refutable</dfn> patterns may sometimes fail to match,
perhaps because they specify only a single variant of an <code>enum</code> with multiple variants.
Refutable patterns can be used in a <code>match</code> expression or equivalent construct, where the
collection of patterns is checked for exhaustiveness (meaning all values are guaranteed to
match at least pattern), but patterns in function signatures are all alone, so they must
be irrefutable.</p>



<p>Here’s a table to help explain:</p>

<figure id="table-1">
    <a href="#skip-table-1">Skip this content.</a>
    <figcaption><span>Table 1</span> <p>A survey of pattern refutability.</p> <a href="#table-1"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Pattern</th>
      <th>Refutability</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>a</code></td>
      <td>Irrefutable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>_</code></td>
      <td>Irrefutable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>MyStruct { f1: x, f2: y }</code></td>
      <td>Irrefutable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Some(b)</code></td>
      <td>Refutable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Err(MyError::Foo)</code></td>
      <td>Refutable</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


    
</figure>

<p>The first three patterns could be found in a function signature. The last two could not.</p>

<h3 id="renaming">Renaming</h3>

<p>Another feature of declaring and assigning to new variables in a function
signature pattern is that you can create a variable with a name different from the
name of the field in the relevant type.</p>

<figure id="code-3">
    <a href="#skip-code-3">Skip this content.</a>
    
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Something</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>field_1</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>field_2</span><span>:</span> <span>f64</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// The `field_1: x` and `field_2: y` parts are assigning</span>
<span>// the values of `field_1` to `x` and `field_2` to `y`.</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>Something</span> <span>{</span> <span>field_1</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>field_2</span><span>:</span> <span>y</span> <span>}:</span> <span>Something</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"x: {}, y: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Something</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>field_1</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span>
        <span>field_2</span><span>:</span> <span>1.0</span><span>,</span>
    <span>};</span>
    
    <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

    <figcaption><span>Code 3</span> <p>An example of renaming.</p> <a href="#code-3"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>This can be useful when you want to locally use a different name than the name of
the field, and do so in a single line rather than binding to a local variable
with a new name in the body of the function.</p>

<h2 id="bindings">Bindings</h2>

<p>As we use patterns to bind, we can also set the kind of binding, which may be the
default (with no specifier) <code>mut</code>, <code>ref</code>, or <code>ref mut</code>. Collectively, the binding
options are as follows:</p>

<figure id="table-2">
    <a href="#skip-table-2">Skip this content.</a>
    <figcaption><span>Table 2</span> <p>Binding syntax and the resulting types</p> <a href="#table-2"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Binding Specifier</th>
      <th>Mutability</th>
      <th>Ownership</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>No specifier</td>
      <td>Immutable</td>
      <td>Owned</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>mut</code></td>
      <td>Mutable</td>
      <td>Owned</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ref</code></td>
      <td>Immutable</td>
      <td>Borrowed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ref mut</code></td>
      <td>Mutable</td>
      <td>Borrowed</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


    
</figure>

<p>The <dfn id="dfn-binding">binding</dfn> pattern specifies how a binding should occur; should it be
by-value (meaning in Rust that it either takes ownership of the bound value, or makes a copy of it,
depending on whether the type of that value implements the <code>Copy</code> trait), by-reference, or
by-mutable-reference?</p>

<h3 id="owning-binding">Owning Binding</h3>

<p>An owning binding may display one of two behaviors, depending on the type involved in the binding.
If the type implements the <code>Copy</code> trait, then it will be copied to the new owner at the binding site.
If the type <em>does not</em> implement <code>Copy</code>, then it will be moved from the prior owner to the new owner
at the binding site.</p>



<p>To understand this, let’s talk about <code>Copy</code>. <code>Copy</code> is a trait indicating a type is “trivially copyable,”
meaning it can be copied with only a call to <code>memcpy</code>, so all the data contained in the structure
is contiguous; there are no pointers to chase. <code>Copy</code> tells us that copying a piece of data is fast.</p>

<p>At the same time, it improves ergonomics for certain types which may otherwise be tedious to use under
Rust’s ownership semantics. Imagine if number types (which all implement <code>Copy</code>) were moved any time
they were assigned. Something as simple as <code>x = y</code> would invalidate <code>y</code>, and thus make mathematical code
much more frustrating to write.</p>

<p>So, <code>Copy</code> pulls double-duty. It tells us something is cheap to copy, and it permits that copying to be
done implicitly.</p>

<p>In contexts where a type doesn’t implement <code>Copy</code> but <em>does</em> implement the <code>Clone</code> trait, you can instead
call <code>.clone()</code> on it explicitly to create a duplicate which will be moved into the new owner, without
invalidating the prior owner.</p>

<p>Now, what does this look like in the context of a binding?</p>

<figure id="code-3">
    <a href="#skip-code-3">Skip this content.</a>
    
<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Clone,</span> <span>Debug)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Thing</span><span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>Thing</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// This moves `t` into the `takes_ownership` function.</span>
    <span>// `t` no longer owns any data, and thus is invalid</span>
    <span>// to use again.</span>
    <span>takes_ownership</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// If uncommented, this line would not compile.</span>
    <span>//</span>
    <span>// println!("{:#?}", t);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>takes_ownership</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>Thing</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// `x` is the owner of whatever `Thing` is passed</span>
    <span>// into the `takes_ownership` function, and when</span>
    <span>// `x` goes out of scope at the end of the function,</span>
    <span>// any necessary cleanup of the data will be</span>
    <span>// performed (only relevant if the type in question</span>
    <span>// implements `Drop`).</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

    <figcaption><span>Code 3</span> <p>An example of a broken use of owning binding in a function signature.</p> <a href="#code-3"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
</figure>



<p>Sometimes this kind of binding is exactly what you want. For example, you may have a need for a
“consuming builder,” one of two forms the Builder Pattern can take in Rust. In a consuming builder,
the builder type passes ownership of some data to the type that it’s building, because that type
will need ownership of the data to operate.</p>

<p>If you take ownership of a piece of data with an owning binding and want to return ownership to the
calling context, you can return it from the function. For example, the popular <code>once_cell</code> crate features
a type which can only be written to once. If you try to write to it again, it returns ownership of the
value you attempted to set.</p>

<h3 id="mutable-owning-binding">Mutable Owning Binding</h3>

<p>Sometimes, in addition to taking ownership of a piece of data, you’d like for that data to be mutable
from the start as well. In that case, you can use a mutable owning binding.</p>

<p>The use of a mutable owning binding can always be replaced with an immutable owning binding followed by
a mutable rebinding to a variable of the same name in the body of the function (shadowing the parameter
from that line onward). The choice is one of taste.</p>

<h3 id="reference-binding">Reference Binding</h3>

<p>Reference bindings inside function signatures in Rust can seem a little unusual, but they are permitted.
The idea is that the binding performed is a reference to the type of the value. If the value was passed
in by value, then it’s either moved or copied as discussed in the owning binding section, and in the body
of the function the value is of a reference to the post-move data (if the type is <code>Copy</code>, the difference
doesn’t amount to much). This is different from an owning binding of a reference type both for the caller
of the function, and inside the function itself (<code>x: &amp;Number</code> is <em>not</em> the same as <code>ref x: Number</code>).</p>

No server needed, either!</li><li>Combine them for a serverless web app with persistent data, written entirely in Python!</li></ol><h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2><ul><li>Intro: What is Firestore, and why should we use it?</li><li>Part 1: A simple Streamlit Sharing app</li><li>Part 2: Setting up Firestore</li><li>[Coming soon] Part 3: Building the Reddit home page</li><li>[Coming soon] Part 4: Tips and tricks for app development</li></ul><h2 id="intro-what-is-firestore-and-why-should-we-use-it">Intro: What is Firestore, and why should we use it?</h2><p>So what even is this Firestore thing? Well, from <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore">their website</a>:</p><blockquote>Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development...</blockquote><p>Let's break that down! First, Firestore is a <em>database</em> - that means it's a good place to store data, and retrieve it later. If you're into ML/data science, and have been building dashboards with Streamlit, the data you work with probably looks like Pandas tables, Numpy arrays, CSV files. These tend to be fairly <em>static</em>. You'll rarely need to create new entries or update them, let alone make your data accessible from apps all over the world. But many web apps need to be <em>dynamic,</em> allowing lots of edits to the data and creation of new data — and databases excel at this! Every consumer web app you can think of (Gmail, Youtube, Slack, Airbnb) have databases that manage the things that their users create (emails, videos, chat messages, and listings).</p><p>Unlike other databases, Firestore is <em>flexible</em>. In technical terms, we call it a "NoSQL" database, which means that you don't have to design a fixed schema for how your data will be structured before you begin. This is great for quick prototyping! Oftentimes, when I'm making a web app, I don't exactly know what it will look like or do, much less how I should store my data.</p><figure><img src="https://geekandpoke.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341d3df553ef0148c80ac6ef970c-pi" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://geekandpoke.typepad.com/geekandpoke/2011/01/nosql.html</figcaption></figure><p>As an analogy, let's say I wanted to bake a bunch of desserts. A SQL database is a bit like having to write out a pie recipe beforehand, and then always following it line-by-line. I can efficiently bake lots of pies, which will be tasty if my original recipe was good. But the NoSQL approach is more like: let me start with something vaguely pie-like, but maybe it'll become a tart, or drift towards more of a cupcake... I can experiment until I land on something that really hits the spot.</p><p>Finally, Firestore is hosted on the <em>cloud</em>. This means that it's a service, very much like <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> or our very own <a href="http://streamlit.io/sharing">Streamlit Sharing</a>, where you don't have to worry about maintaining your own servers. You don't need to worry about scaling, uptime, or a bunch of other issues that can get in the way of building out your idea.</p><h3 id="what-are-some-downsides-of-firestore">What are some downsides of Firestore?</h3><p>First, as a hosted service, Firestore can cost you money. They do have a generous free tier to start out with — no credit card needed! And if your app exceeds the free limits, they'll inform you and stop new writes. Even if you hit the paid tier, Firestore is pretty cheap; I run a <a href="https://oneword.games/">side project</a> with hundreds of daily users and thousands of daily writes, and Firestore only costs me ~$1/month.</p><p>Second, other databases may perform better on complicated queries, or when you get to e.g. millions of daily users. For pure speed of setup, Firestore is great, but if you already know that scaling will be an issue, you may want to consider other options like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html">SQLite</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>, or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/spanner">Cloud Spanner</a>.</p><p>And finally, most Firestore users use JavaScript, so there are fewer Python code snippets and Stack Overflow answers to find. For this tutorial, we'll use <a href="https://googleapis.dev/python/firestore/latest/index.html">Firestore's Python library</a>, which is very pleasant to work with. Here's a snippet from their Python API for inspiration:</p><pre><code>from google.cloud import firestore

# Add a new user to the database
db = firestore.Client()
doc_ref = db.collection('users').document('alovelace')
doc_ref.set({
    'first': 'Ada',
    'last': 'Lovelace',
    'born': 1815
})

# Then query to list all users
users_ref = db.collection('users')

for doc in users_ref.stream():
    print('{} =&gt; {}'.format(doc.id, doc.to_dict()))
</code></pre><p>Pretty easy to read, right?</p><h2 id="part-1-a-simple-streamlit-sharing-app">Part 1: A simple Streamlit Sharing app</h2><p>Okay! If you're sold on the awesomeness of Firestore, I'm now going to show you how to bake in that awesomeness into a Streamlit app. Let's cook up a simple version of the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/">Reddit home page</a>, from scratch! (Okay, that was the last cooking analogy, I promise.)</p><p>Once again, <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> is the fastest way to build web apps in Python. <a href="https://blog.streamlit.io/introducing-streamlit-sharing/">Streamlit Sharing</a> is the fastest way to put your app online, so you can share it with the world. Here's what Sharing can do for you, in 1 minute:</p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/czWaLgF9sA0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Here in Part 1, I'm going to walk you step-by-step through the process of building a Streamlit Sharing app, even if you've never done it before. Ready? Let's do this!</p><p><em>If you're already a Streamlit master, feel free to skip down to Part 2; just remember to <code>pip install google-cloud-firestore</code> , or the equivalent in your Python library manager of choice.</em></p><h3 id="setting-up-your-git-repo">Setting up your Git repo</h3><p>We'll start by <a href="https://github.com/new">creating a new repo on GitHub</a> — the folder where all your code will go. Name it whatever you like! (I'm calling mine <code>streamlit-reddit</code>). Make sure it's public, though, so we can host it on Streamlit Sharing later.</p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vpwzgFv.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/vpwzgFv.png"><figcaption>New GitHub repo</figcaption></figure><p>Next, you'll want to download (aka "clone") this repo on your own computer. (<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">You'll need to have Git installed</a>.) Open up a local shell, and run the following commands, replacing <code>{username}</code> with your own GitHub username:</p><pre><code># Creates a copy of this repo on your computer
$ git clone https://github.com/{username}/streamlit-reddit.git

# Enters the repo, which is currently empty
$ cd streamlit-reddit
</code></pre><h3 id="running-streamlit-on-your-own-computer">Running Streamlit on your own computer</h3><p>With our Git repo set up, let's add in the two main files every Streamlit Sharing app needs:</p><p><code>requirements.txt</code> — A list of the Python libraries we use, so Streamlit Sharing will know to install them.</p><p>For this tutorial, we'll only be using two libraries: Streamlit itself, and the <a href="https://googleapis.dev/python/firestore/latest/index.html">Python client for Firestore</a>. So this is all you need inside your <code>requirements.txt</code> file:</p><pre><code>streamlit
google-cloud-firestore
</code></pre><p><code>streamlit_app.py</code> — Where our app code will go! Let's start with just a few lines:</p><pre><code>import streamlit as st

st.header('Hello 🌎!')
if st.button('Balloons?'):
    st.balloons()
</code></pre><p>This app imports the Streamlit library, and then shows some text and a button. When you click on the button, a bunch of balloons will float up from the bottom of the screen!</p><p>Now, we're going to use <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/">Pip</a> to install the Streamlit and the Firestore libraries onto your own computer. (If you prefer <a href="https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html">pipenv</a> or <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a> or <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/">conda</a>, any of those are fine too!)</p><pre><code># Install all the libraries mentioned in requirements.txt
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
...
</code></pre><p>We're ready to run our starter Streamlit app!</p><pre><code># Run this Streamlit app on your own computer
$ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  Network URL: http://192.168.1.3:8501
</code></pre><p>If you see the Streamlit app launched on your own browser, that means everything worked. (You may have to enter in the URL, like <a href="http://localhost:8501/">http://localhost:8501</a>). Try clicking on that button!</p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/c6YSDvk.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/c6YSDvk.png"><figcaption>Streamlit app running locally</figcaption></figure><h3 id="deploying-your-app-on-streamlit-sharing">Deploying your app on Streamlit Sharing</h3><p>Okay, we're ready to put our app on Streamlit Sharing! First, we need to save our changes to Git (aka "commit"), and then upload (aka "push") our changes onto GitHub. Again, from a shell that's inside your repo:</p><pre><code># Add and all changes in your files
$ git commit -am "Create requirements.txt and a simple Streamlit app"

# Push all commits back to GitHub
$ git push
</code></pre><p>Now if you go to the GitHub page for your repo, you should see the code that you just wrote:</p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HhxVgnQ.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/HhxVgnQ.png"><figcaption>Successfully pushed code</figcaption></figure><p>Once your code is on GitHub, you're ready to deploy your app for the world to see! Head over to <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/">https://share.streamlit.io/</a> and create a new app. (If you don't have access to Sharing yet, post below in the comments and we'll sort you out.) <a href="https://blog.streamlit.io/deploying-streamlit-apps-using-streamlit-sharing/">Here's a great tutorial</a> on deploying through sharing if you'd like to read more.</p><p>Fill in the name of your repo — the others should populate automagically — then click "Deploy!" 🎈</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/01/GIF_1.2.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Steps to deploying an app on sharing</figcaption></figure><p>That URL you are on (e.g. <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/akrolsmir/streamlit-reddit">https://share.streamlit.io/akrolsmir/streamlit-reddit</a>), is one that anyone on Earth can go to and play with. Isn't that cool? You've gone from "literally nothing" to "functioning, globally-hosted Streamlit app" in the space of 15 minutes! But hold on to your horses, we're about to get to the <em>really</em> cool stuff: saving data online, with Firestore.</p><h2 id="part-2-setting-up-firestore">Part 2: Setting up Firestore</h2><p>Once again, Firestore is the database we're using to create, edit, and read our data. For our Reddit home page, we're going to use it to store things like the links, titles, and later upvotes. Here in Part 2, I'll walk you through how to set that up.</p><h3 id="set-up-a-firebase-account">Set up a Firebase account</h3><p>To clear up some potential confusion: <em>Firestore</em> is the database we're using, one of many services provided by <em>Firebase</em> (which is a part of Google). You'll want to sign in to your Google account at <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">https://console.firebase.google.com/</a>. Then, create a Firebase project:</p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/h3PS1m6.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/h3PS1m6.png"><figcaption>The Firebase sign-up screen</figcaption></figure><p>These are the steps to create an account:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/01/GIF_2.2.gif" alt=""></figure><ul><li>Name your project</li><li>Enable analytics [You <em>can</em> skip this since we're not using it today, but I think Analytics are really cool 🙂]</li><li>Accept terms and click create!</li></ul><p>Once created, you'll see Firebase loading and will be notified when the project is ready [this is pretty quick].</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/01/GIF_3.2.gif" alt=""></figure><p>Awesome, our Firebase project is set up! Firebase has a lot of different tools for building web apps, but the only one we're using today is Firestore.

    <div>

      

      <article role="main">
        <p>It all started with a meme tweet:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.acepace.net/images/xlatb/meme.jpg" alt="twitter meme describing waves to extract values from an array in x64"></p>

<p>Laugh, scroll past, then I started wondering, “what are the chances this obscure opcode is faster than optimized loads?” and I realized I had just been <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd sniped</a>. So I decided to dig up my half-remembered memories of how to benchmark opcodes and get to the bottom of this meme.</p>

<p>For those of us who do not recall every opcode that Intel dreamed up, the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-instruction-set-reference-manual-325383.pdf">Intel reference manual</a> is a useful reference and says the following:</p>

<p>XLAT/XLATB - <em>Locates a byte entry in a table in memory, using the contents of the AL register as a table index, then copies the contents of the table entry back into the AL register. The index in the AL register is treated as an unsigned integer. The XLAT and XLATB instructions get the base address of the table in memory from either the DS:EBX or the DS:BX registers</em></p>

<p>In other words, the instruction performs</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>MOV</span> <span>AL</span><span>,[</span><span>EBX</span><span>+</span><span>AL</span><span>]</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>EBX is the array base and AL is the offset.</p>

<p>Which is exactly the core line of the last snippet in the meme.</p>

<p>My guess was <strong>the equivalent load opcode version would outperform xlatb</strong>. How I tested this simple question is worth writing up, if only to have a reference for micro benchmarking from end to end.</p>

<h3 id="technical-background">Technical background</h3>

<p><em>Feel free to skip this if you’re familiar with benchmarking, CISC vs RISC and why I guessed what I guessed</em></p>

<h4 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking</h4>

<p>What I did to test my guess is called micro benchmarking. The difference from regular benchmarking is in the focus and minimization of context. It helps in answering very small questions such as “What is the fastest way to sort an array of numbers in C”, and ignoring memory pressure, design and other considerations that are important in the real world of benchmarking.</p>

<p>The challenge in micro benchmarking is that there is a lot of noise in the process. Compilers, operating systems, CPU temperature and frequency changes can all serve to create large shifts in the performance of the benched code snippet.</p>

<p>Therefore, the goal is to define the problem as accurately as possible. For example</p>

<ul>
  <li>Minimize hardware considerations. This means removing frequency scaling, branching, any chance of the data being evicted from the cache.</li>
  <li>No interaction with the system. This means no system calls, but also no memory allocations and hopefully remove the role the runtime plays (for example if we’re benchmarking .NET code)</li>
</ul>

<p>These typically lead micro benchmarks to being written in assembly code and measuring runtime using the <a href="https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/X86-assembly/Instructions/rdtsc">rdtsc</a> opcode.</p>

<p>To understand this at a basic level, I really recommend the book <a href="https://nostarch.com/insidemachine.htm">Inside the Machine</a> (Jon Stokes), another option is <a href="http://www.lighterra.com/papers/modernmicroprocessors/">Modern Microprocessors in 90 minutes</a> but for more than that, the relatively up to date reference is <a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/cpu/">Real World Technologies</a> articles on CPU architecture.</p>

<p>The reference for nearly everything relating to opcode latency for Intel and AMD CPUs is <a href="https://www.agner.org/optimize/">Agners guides</a> and <a href="https://uops.info/table.html">uops.info</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to measure these latencies and what exactly a CPU is doing when executing an opcode, you need to read the Performance Measurement Counters embedded in the hardware. This gives us precisely numbers for (example) how many L1 cache hits and misses happened in a code block, how many branch mispredictions happened and so forth.</p>

<h4 id="xlat-and-cisc">XLAT and CISC</h4>

<p>Now, what the heck is XLAT and why does it exist?</p>

<p>The basic idea behind the XLAT instruction is the idea behind Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISC), that states hardware should implement common instruction sequences with dedicated instructions that perform the same task but faster. This is the idea behind many of the weird x86 instructions (or other CPUs).</p>

<p>However, since that time, all modern CPUs have turned RISC-like, by internally using a reduced instruction set and translating the ISA opcodes into internal commands, some implemented using CPU microcode. This also allows for different optimizations such as micro opcode fusion. Another note, CPU designers spend a lot of time optimizing the commonly use instructions, which makes them very fast (for example xor rax,rax is free) This leaves very little room for opcodes like xlatb to shine.</p>

<p>While we’re dunking on CISC, I came across the following great snippet on the difference between the good parts of CISC and the bad parts.</p>

<p><em>We should distinguish the “Complex” instructions of CISC CPUs - complicated, rarely used, and universally low performance, from the “Featureful” instructions common to both CISC and RISC CPUs, which combine a small sequence of operations, are commonly used, and high performance. - <a href="https://gist.github.com/erincandescent/8a10eeeea1918ee4f9d9982f7618ef68">erincandescent</a></em></p>

<h3 id="the-experiments">The experiments</h3>

<p>What I ended up doing was running the different code snippets in the Andreas Abel’s micro benchmarking harness, available on <a href="https://github.com/andreas-abel/nanoBench">GitHub</a>. The machine used for execution was a VM running on a Broadwell i7-5500U, Debian 9.9, kernel version 4.9 with the host CPU frequency governor set to disabled (max clock speed all the time).</p>

<p>The executed code snippets were as described in the table below.</p>

<table>

<p>In order to remove as much variance as possible, it’s best to make sure all accesses are kept inside the L1 cache (code and data). For this reason, the following initializations are required</p>

<ul>
  <li>Aim RBX at RSP, making sure the array accessed is inside the L1 data cache</li>
  <li>Set RAX to 0</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, this opcode sequence is small enough to be in the same L1 code cache line so no effort was required there (manually verified).</p>

<p>For this experiment, what matters is the number of cycles required to execute (which is a close approximation of time) and the cycles elapsed (wall time). In addition, I’ll also measure how many loads happened while executing this snippet, by tracking the <a href="https://download.01.org/perfmon/index/haswell.html">MEM_LOAD_UOPS_RETIRED.L1_HIT PMC</a>.</p>

<p>The command line I used when executing the benchmarks was</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">./nanoBench.sh <span>-avg</span> <span>-n_measurements</span> 500 <span>-asm_init</span> <span>"mov rbx, rsp;xor rax,rax;"</span> <span>-asm</span> SNIPPET_HERE <span>-config</span> configs/cfg_Broadwell_common.txt</code></pre></figure>

<p>The results, summarized in a table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Snippet 0</th>
      <th>Snippet 1</th>
      <th>Snippet 2</th>
      <th>Snippet 3</th>

    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Core cycles: 7.02</td>

    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

<p>There are a few things that stand out.</p>

<p>Foremost, xlatb is slower than the equivalent optimized x64 code.</p>

<p>Second, as is generally known, memory loads are the most expensive part of any algorithm, but once the data is in L1, the difference in number of loads doesn’t seem to matter. The xlatb sequence has only one data load yet is slower than the optimized x64 version.</p>

<p>Second, the core cycle count for the xlatb instruction precisely matches the <a href="https://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf">Agner table</a> (page 229). Good to know our measurements line up with others :)</p>

<p>Last, note that reducing the amount of instructions used does not decrease time required linearly. Why? The number of instructions is not linearly correlated to the actions performed by the processor. A classic example is xor rcx,rcx. This opcode never actually executes. Instead, the CPU just updates a pointer in the register renaming file.</p>

<p>To examine these type of questions, another tool is required - the Intel Architecture Code Analyzer (<a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-architecture-code-analyzer">IACA</a> - unfortunately now deprecated). This tool will look at the machine code and tell you how different Intel CPUs will execute them. Let’s look at one case in particular to see why removing instructions doesn’t always linearly save time. Attached are only the relevant parts of the output, which are the micro-op count.</p>

<p>* - instruction micro-ops not bound to a port</p>

<p>^ - Micro Fusion occurred</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Number of Uops</th>
      <th>opcodes</th>
      <th>Number of Uops</th>
      <th>opcodes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>3^#</td>
      <td>push rcx</td>
      <td>3^#</td>
      <td>push rcx</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1*</td>
      <td>xor rcx,rcx</td>
      <td>1*</td>
      <td>movzx rcx,al</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>mov cl,al</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>add rcx, rbx</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>add rcx,rbx</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>mov al, byte ptr [rcx]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>mov al, byte ptr [rcx]</td>
      <td>2^#</td>
      <td>pop [rcx]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2^#</td>
      <td>pop rcx</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The important bit is noting that in snippet 0, the opcodes xor rcx,rcx; mov cl,al takes up one execution unit (xor rcx rcx is not bound to an execution port).</p>

<p>In snippet 1, the opcode movzx rcx,al doesn’t take up an execution port at all.</p>

<p>You can also play around with llvm-mca which does something similar, and see the same results, by using Compiler Explorer (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/6SjY_d">snippet link</a>).</p>

<h4 id="side-note-on-actually-running-the-experiments">Side note on actually running the experiments</h4>

<p>All my machines are Windows machines, where accessing the PMCs is not as fun or easy as it is on Linux. The proper reaction should be “so run it inside a VM”, but apparently Hyper-V doesn’t expose PMCs to guests by default and I couldn’t find a way to do it easily.</p>

<p>I ran into every possible frustration while searching for a cheap bare metal cloud machine, including Oracle gating the bare metal instances behind a request form that requires a human being to look at.</p>

<p>In the end, VMWare Workstation exposes PMCs to guests so a friend with power to spare gave me a VM to test.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>The meme is wrong, no surprise. An optimized sequence of x64 instructions beats out a single complex instruction. This isn’t always true (POPCNT as a counter example) but some instructions are legacy for a reason. If LLVM doesn’t output the opcode, it’s probably for the best.</p>

<p>Also this was an opportunity to rediscover micro benchmarking. It’s quite likely I made some measurement mistakes, so if you found any, feel free to contact me.</p>

<h2 id="also-thanks-are-in-order-for-help-in-this-bit-of-fun">Also, thanks are in order for help in this bit of fun</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wobel_">@wobel_</a> for providing the VM and therapy while I swore at cloud providers.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/damageboy">@damageboy</a> for generally knowing everything and in this case, for writing a series of blog posts on micro benchmarking .NET instructions available <a href="https://bits.houmus.org/2018-08-18/netcoreapp3.0-instrinsics-in-real-life-pt1">here</a> that pushed me to do this sort of stuff</p>

<p>And again to Andreas Abel for saving me a lot of time with his micro benchmarking harness available on <a href="https://github.com/andreas-abel/nanoBench">GitHub</a></p>

<p><em>TL;DR: Use your access logs to get messages from users - then manually add them to your post front matter. Publish on rebuild.</em></p>
<hr>


<p><strong>Warning: This article will be of interest to a very specific - and very small -group of people.</strong></p>

<p>If you:</p>

<p>a) like extremely hacky solutions to problems;</p>

<p>b) Host a static website with an Apache-based server;</p>

<p>c) Want a comments section, and don’t want to either rely on external service such as Disqus or Comment.io or spin up a yet another self-hosted service to handle comments for you.</p>

<p>You should read on. Otherwise, bugger off. You’re wasting your time here.</p>



<p>Static sites, are by their nature, static. You can’t interact with them really. They exist as a collection of HTML pages in a hierarchy on the root of your server. The attractions of a static site are many - not least security, portability, and speed.</p>

<p>But as a writer or site owner, you crave interaction with your readers. How do you manage it without relying on an external service?</p>

<p>Actually, it’s a piece of piss. A very hacky piece of piss.</p>



<p>Alright. Down towards the bottom of the page, you’ll see a box which says “leave a comment.” or something like that. It’s some basic HTML and javascript which I adapted from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.</a> I’m not really a coder. I have virtually no experience with javascript and only a little with HTML. It’s included as an include called comments.html on my posts template - because we’re all about imagination here.</p>

<p><img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/pretty-sure-I-nicked-most-of-this-from-somewhere-else-too.png" alt="pretty-sure-I-nicked-most-of-this-from-somewhere-else-too.png"></p>
<center><h6>It's called borrowing</h6></center>
<p>If you write in the box and click the submit button, your browser will push you to a relative URL based on the text, and prefaced with the string “COMMENT.”</p>

<p>For instance, if you wrote, “your site sucks and I hate you so much. Just go away and die.” you would be redirected to “https://thecrow.uk/COMMENTyour site sucks and I hate you so much. Just go away and die”</p>

<p>Obviously, that URL doesn’t exist, so you’ll be directed to a custom 404 page saying something like: “Thanks for your comment.”</p>

<p>With me so far? Good.</p>

<p>As I said, I’m running an Apache server on a Linux system (Raspbian actually), and I have access logs enabled. Not because I want to track you across the internet, but because it has historically been useful in sniffing out bots (suspiciously absent since ditching WordPress) and bad actors.</p>

<p>Using grep, I can find any entries in my logs which contain the string “COMMENT”</p>

<p>eg: grep COMMENT /thecrow.log</p>

<p>Will bring up the plain text comment along with date &amp; referring URL.</p>



<p>OK. So I have the comment. Everyone hates me and thinks I’m a dick (they are correct), and I want to share their disdain with the world.</p>

<p>On the yaml front matter I have an array called  “article_comments” Comments which I have found in my access logs are manually added to the array. Consider it as a kind of moderation queue. It’s not quite as easy as clicking ‘approve’ on WordPress - but it works.</p>

<p>I also have an _includes called submitted_comments.html which contains the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/jekyl-submitted-comments-loop.jpg" alt="assets/jekyl-submitted-comments-loop.jpg"></p>



<p>I can have a script called by cron at 11.59pm every day (just before logs are archived), which will echo the output to a text file - I can then inspect this this text file at my leisure - kind of like a ready-made, automated moderation queue.</p>

<p>I don’t doubt that there will be some unforeseen problem with this, but I can’t think of any right now.</p>



<p>If you’ve understood what I’ve written so far, well done! This has been a mess from start to finish.</p>

<p>But you know what? It works. Leave a comment and try to keep it to under 230 characters.</p>

<p>Happy new year :)</p>

<p>*edit 31/12/2020: For the purpose of this post, I’m approving everything which comes in. But if you could write in complete sentences, that would be nice. Shit gets tedious real fast.</p>

In any case, well done.That reminds me: years ago, when I subscribed to writer Warren Elli's' newsletter, he mentioned that he'd find the oddest items in his search logs, like 'sonicboomkake' and the like.

                 [26/Jan/2021:07:29:53] After getting the 404 page, I thought, why not add a comment input to that 404 page too, in case there is a legit 404 someone can report to you! </p><p>-----------------<br>

                 [05/Jan/2021:08:52:27] You're right to an extent - it does need active comment moderation if there are a lot of comments coming in - but then, so would a regular comments blog. At the moment I'm checking in two or three times a day - that will probably drop off unless I've *just* published something new. Rebuilding and pushing out takes maybe a second. One of the many benefits of being in the same physical location as the server :) - The Crow </p><p>-----------------<br>
                 &nbsp;
                 
                 [05/Jan/2021:02:14:03] Pretty interesting approach! Only issue I could see is if your site becomes greatly popular overnight or something and then the comments are delayed so it stifles user discussion in the time until you decide to rebuild. But I personally think it's cool either way </p><p>-----------------<br>

                 [01/Jan/2021:13:58:00] In response to 'this is stupid and can be spammed' - Well, not really. It's a manual review process. If I choose not to pull a comment from the logs, it just stays in the logs and is deleted after a day or two. Everything that appears in this comment section is here because I want it to be - I am deliberately not automating the process. Overall comment quality is low because for the purposes of this post, I'm letting absolutely everything through. When I *do* add more automation - magically echoing comments to a text file for my perusal, I will be using filters against known spammy domains, IPs, and keywords. Don't worry dude, it will be fine. - The Crow </p><p>-----------------<br>

<![CDATA[Twitter’s Birdwatch Is Fundamentally Flawed]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>Earlier this week, Twitter announced an initiative to combat misinformation on their platform that they call <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-birdwatch-a-community-based-approach-to-misinformation.html">Birdwatch</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210126122026/https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/about/overview/">How Birdwatch works</a>: Volunteers sign up (assuming they meet all the requirements) and can add notes to fill in context on misleading tweets. Other users can rate these contextual tweets as helpful or not helpful. All of these “notes” and ratings of notes are completely transparent.</p>











<p>At its face, Birdwatch is an attempt to scale up the existing fact-checking capability used during the 2020 U.S. Elections while also crowdsourcing this decision-making.</p>



<p>I will give Twitter credit for two things, and only two things, before I get into the problems with their design.</p>



<ol><li>They’re distributing the power to fact-check bad tweets to their users rather than hoarding it for themselves.</li><li>They correctly emphasized transparency as a goal for this tool.</li></ol>



<p>But it’s not all sunshine and rainbows.</p>



<h2>The Fatal Flaw of Birdwatch’s Design</h2>



<p>There’s an old essay titled <em><a href="https://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/">The Six Dumbest Ideas in Computer Security</a></em>, that immediately identifies two problems with Birdwatch’s design. They also happen to be the first two items on the essay’s list!</p>



<ol><li><strong>Default Permit</strong></li><li><strong>Enumerating Badness</strong></li></ol>



<p>This is best illustrated by way of example.</p>



<p>Let’s assume there are two pathological liars hellbent on spreading misinformation on Twitter. They each tweet unsubstantiated claims about some facet of government or civil service. Birdwatch users catch only one of them, and correctly fact-check their tweet.</p>



<p>What happens to the other liar?</p>



<p>What happens if Birdwatch users can only identify one out of ten liars? One out of a hundred? One out of a thousand?! Et cetera.</p>







<p>To be clear: The biggest flaw in their product design is simply that their “notes” and “fact-checks” are negative indicators on known-bad tweets.</p>



<p>This will create a dark pattern: If a tweet slips past the Birdwatch users’ radars, it won’t be fact-checked. In turn, users won’t realize it’s misinformation. A popular term for the resulting conduct is <strong>coordinated inauthentic behavior</strong>.</p>



<p>This already happens to YouTube.</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="580" height="327" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1PGm8LslEb4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>Hell, this is already happening <em>to Twitter</em>:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="580" height="327" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V-1RhQ1uuQ4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<h2>How To Fix Birdwatch</h2>



<p>I wrote an entire essay on <a href="https://medium.com/@soatok/defeating-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-at-scale-a872badf721">Defeating Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior at Scale</a> in 2019. I <em>highly</em> recommend anyone at Twitter interested in actually solving the misinformation problem to give that a careful consideration.</p>







<p>But in a nutshell, the most important fix is to change the state machine underlying Birdwatch from:</p>



<ul><li>No notes -&gt; trustworthy</li><li>Notes -&gt; misinformation</li></ul>



<p>…to something <em>subtly</em> different:</p>



<ul><li>No notes -&gt; unvetted / be cautious</li><li>Notes -&gt;<ul><li>Negative notes -&gt; misinformation</li></ul><ul><li>Positive notes -&gt; verified by experts</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>This effectively creates a traffic light signal for users: Tweets start as yellow (exercise caution, which is the default) and may become green (affirmed by notes) or red (experts disagree).</p>



<h3>What Would This Change Accomplish?</h3>



<p>Malicious actors that accomplish Birdwatch evasion will only manage to encompass their message in caution tape. (Metaphorically speaking, anyway.)</p>



<p>If their goal is to spread misinformation while convincing the recipients of their message that they’re speaking the truth, they’ll have to get a green light–which is ideally more expensive to accomplish.</p>



<h3>Bonus Round</h3>



<p>I would also recommend some kind of “this smells fishy” button to signal Birdwatch contributors that this tweet needs fact-checking. Users might self-select into filter bubbles that Birdwatch users are totally absent from, and in turn come across things that are completely unvetted and possibly ambiguous.</p>



<p>While I have your attention, here’s a quality of life suggestion, on the house:</p>



<p>Being able to link claims together (e.g. reposted images with a false claim, n.b. like how the minions memes on Facebook) to deduplicate their claims about reality would save a lot of unnecessary headache.</p>



<p>(Anyone who has used Stack Overflow will appreciate the utility of being able to say “this is a duplicate of $otherThing”.)</p>



<h2>What If These Fundamental Flaws Remain Unfixed?</h2>



<p>Although Birdwatch will probably meet the immediate goal of scaling up the fact-checking efforts beyond what Twitter can provide (and satisfy the public relations requirements of tangibly doing <em>something</em> to combat this problem), propagandists and conspiracy theorists will simply become incentivized to evade Birdwatch contributors’ detection while spreading their lies.</p>



<p>As I said above, coordinated inauthentic behavior is already happening. This isn’t some abstract threat that only academics care about.</p>



<p>To the aid of the malicious, most users will confuse tweets that evaded detection with tweets that didn’t warrant correction. This might even lead to users trusting misinformation <em>more</em> than they would before Birdwatch. This would be a total self-own for the entire Birdwatch project.</p>

<![CDATA[Sudo: Buffer overflow in command line unescaping]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
<h3>Release Date:</h3><p>
January 26, 2021
</p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>
A serious heap-based buffer overflow has been discovered in sudo
that is exploitable by any local user. It has been given the name
<em>Baron Samedit</em> by its discoverer. The bug can be leveraged
to elevate privileges to root, even if the user is not listed in
the sudoers file. User authentication is not required to exploit
the bug.
</p><h3>Sudo versions affected:</h3><p>
Sudo versions 1.8.2 through 1.8.31p2 and 1.9.0 through 1.9.5p1 are
affected.
</p><h3>CVE ID:</h3><p>
This vulnerability has been assigned <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156" onclick="getOutboundLink('http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156');">CVE-2021-3156</a>
in the <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/" onclick="getOutboundLink('http://cve.mitre.org/');">Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures</a> database.
</p><h3>Details:</h3><p>
When sudo runs a command in <em>shell</em> mode, either via the
<strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-i</strong> command line option, it
escapes special characters in the command's arguments with a backslash.
The sudoers policy plugin will then remove the escape characters from
the arguments before evaluating the sudoers policy (which doesn't
expect the escape characters) if the command is being run in shell
mode.
</p><p>
A bug in the code that removes the escape characters will read
beyond the last character of a string if it ends with an unescaped
backslash character. Under normal circumstances, this bug would
be harmless since sudo has escaped all the backslashes in the
command's arguments. However, due to a different bug, this time
in the command line parsing code, it is possible to run <tt>sudoedit</tt>
with either the <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-i</strong> options,
setting a flag that indicates shell mode is enabled. Because a
command is not actually being run, sudo does <strong>not</strong>
escape special characters. Finally, the code that decides whether
to remove the escape characters did not check whether a command is
actually being run, just that the shell flag is set. This inconsistency
is what makes the bug exploitable.
</p><p>
To test whether your version of sudo is vulnerable, the following
command can be used:
</p><pre>sudoedit -s '\' `perl -e 'print "A" x 65536'`
</pre><p>
If you receive a usage or error message, sudo is not vulnerable.
If the result is a <strong>Segmentation fault</strong>, sudo is
vulnerable.
</p><p>

</p><h3>Impact:</h3><p>
A local user may be able to exploit sudo to elevate privileges to
root as long as the sudoers file (usually /etc/sudoers) is present.
</p><h3>Workaround:</h3><p>
None. Sudo version 1.9.5p2 or a patched vendor-supported version
must be installed.
</p><h3>Fix:</h3><p>
The bug is fixed in sudo 1.9.5p2.
</p><h3>Credit:</h3><p>
Thanks to the Qualys Security Advisory team for their detailed bug
report and explanation of its implications.

Mimoun, the founder of the digital security nonprofit Horizontal, asked the participants to list messaging platforms that they'd heard of or used, and they quickly rattled off  <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-messenger-end-to-end-encryption-default/">Facebook Messenger</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-facebook-data-share-notification/">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-tips-private-messaging-encryption/">Signal</a>, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/telegram-still-hasnt-removed-an-ai-bot-thats-abusing-women/">Telegram</a>. When Mimoun then asked them to name the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/encrypted-messaging-isnt-magic/">security advantages</a> of each of those options, several pointed to Telegram's encryption as a plus. It had been <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-isis-is-now-harder-to-track-onlinebut-thats-good-news/">used by Islamic extremists</a>, one noted, so it must be secure.</p><p>Mimoun explained that yes, Telegram encrypts messages. But by default it encrypts data only between your device and Telegram's server; you have to turn on end-to-end encryption to prevent the server itself from seeing the messages. In fact, the group messaging feature that the Southeast Asian activists used most often offers no end-to-end encryption at all. They'd have to trust Telegram not to cooperate with any government that tries to compel it to cooperate in surveilling users. One of them asked where Telegram is located. The company, Mimoun explained, is based in the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>First laughter, then a more serious feeling of "awkward realization" spread through the call, says Mimoun. After a pause, one of the participants spoke: "We're going to have to regroup and think about what we want to do about this." In a follow-up session, another member of the group told Mimoun the moment was a "rude awakening."</p><p>Earlier this month, Telegram announced that it had hit a milestone of 500 million active monthly users and pointed to a single 72-hour period when 25 million people had joined the service. That surge of adoption seems to have had two simultaneous sources: First, right-wing Americans have sought less-moderated communications platforms after <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-trump-ban-easy-fixing-facebook-twitter-hard/">many were banned</a> from Twitter or Facebook for hate speech and disinformation, and after Amazon dropped hosting for their preferred social media service <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/parler-app-free-speech-influencers/">Parler</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/parler-russia-privacy/">taking it offline</a>.</p><p>Telegram's founder, Pavel Durov, however, has attributed the boost more to WhatsApp's clarification of a privacy policy that includes sharing certain data—though not the content of messages—with its corporate parent, Facebook. Tens of millions of WhatsApp's users <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-facebook-data-share-notification/">responded to that restatement of its (years-old) info-sharing practices</a> by fleeing the service, and many went to Telegram, no doubt attracted in part by its claims of "heavily encrypted" messaging. "We've had surges of downloads before, throughout our 7-year history of protecting user privacy," Durov wrote from his Telegram account. "But this time is different. People no longer want to exchange their privacy for free services."</p><p>But ask Raphael Mimoun—or other security professionals who have analyzed Telegram and who spoke to WIRED about its security and privacy shortcomings—and it's clear that Telegram is far from the best-in-class privacy haven that Durov describes and that many at-risk users believe it to be. "People turn to Telegram because they think it's going to keep them safe," says Mimoun, who last week <a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://hackernoon.com/7-reason-why-telegram-is-insecure-by-design-but-millions-still-flock-to-it-ignoring-privacy-concerns-qq1o344c&quot;}" href="https://hackernoon.com/7-reason-why-telegram-is-insecure-by-design-but-millions-still-flock-to-it-ignoring-privacy-concerns-qq1o344c" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">published a blog post about Telegram's flaws</a> that he says was based on "five years of bottled up frustration" about the misperceptions of its security. "There is just a really big gap between what people feel and believe and the reality of the privacy and security of the app."</p><p>Telegram's privacy protections aren't necessarily faulty or broken on a fundamental level, says Nadim Kobeissi, a cryptographer and founder of the Paris-based cryptography consultancy Symbolic Software. But when it comes to encrypting users' communications so that they can't be surveilled, it simply doesn't measure up to WhatsApp—not to mention the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-encrypted-messaging-features-mainstream/">nonprofit secure messaging app Signal</a>, which Kobeissi and most other security professionals recommend. That's because WhatsApp and Signal end-to-end encrypt every message and call by default, so that their own servers never access the content of conversations. Telegram by default only uses "transport layer" encryption that protects the connection from the user to the server rather than from one user to another. "In terms of encryption, Telegram is just not as good as WhatsApp," says Kobeissi. "The fact that encryption is not enabled by default already puts it way behind WhatsApp."</p></div></div><div><div><p>Telegram does offer end-to-end encryption for one-to-one chats but requires users to enable a "secret chats" feature, which must be switched on for every contact individually. Starting that secret chat requires four menu taps that aren't particularly intuitive. (Tap the contact's name, then "more," then "start secret chat," and then confirm when a prompt asks whether you're sure.) Conversation history from the default chat doesn't carry over to the “secret” one, and you have to initiate that encryption option every time you pick a conversation back up with a contact.</p><p>"Would you rather go for the car where airbags work any time you get into a crash?" asks Kobeissi. "Or are you going to go for the car where, every time you turn it on you have to type in a PIN to enable airbags? Why not have them on by default? There's going to be a time where you're going to forget to type that PIN and you're going to get into a crash."</p><p>Worse still, Telegram doesn't offer its secret chats feature at all for group chats, where many of its most at-risk users congregate. It also stores all default chat histories on its servers. That adds a measure of convenience; threads conveniently reappear whenever you install the app on a new device. But the approach leaves them vulnerable to being read by everyone, from Telegram itself to hackers who manage to breach the company's network and legal authorities who compel it to share user data.</p><p>That threat of government coercion became more concrete when Telegram moved its development team—and the official headquarters of one company in the Telegram Group—from Berlin to Dubai three years ago. Though Telegram keeps its servers spread elsewhere around the world, that location nonetheless leaves the company particularly vulnerable to pressure from the United Arab Emirates, a country known for its record of aggressively <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/08/hacking-group-selling-ios-vulnerabilities-state-actors/">hacking</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/totok-google-play-apple-app-store-uae-surveillance/">surveilling</a> human rights activists and dissidents.</p><p>When WIRED reached out to Telegram for comment on these criticisms, its head of marketing, Mike Ravdonikas, responded in a Telegram message that the company doesn't store data in the UAE and has never received a data request from the UAE government. He added that its "lean Dubai-based team is ready to move to a different location if it ever faces pressure." As for its lack of end-to-end encryption by default, Ravdonikas writes that Telegram's non-secret chats have features that "are not possible to implement in an end-to-end encrypted environment," such as persistent chat histories across devices, very large user groups, and sending large documents and video. "We are not going to cripple Telegram by throwing away dozens of its great features because some folks are misled by marketing tricks from our competitors or are too lazy to start Secret Chats when they think they need them," Telegram founder Durov wrote on his public Telegram channel earlier this month.</p><p>But many cryptographers remain wary of Telegram's encryption scheme, even in secret chats. The company uses its own unique encryption protocol known as MTProto. That preference for homebrewed encryption is widely considered deeply unwise by cryptographers who have long held that it's far safer to implement standard, well-tested protocols. After all, sussing out the vulnerabilities in any new protocol takes years of work and careful auditing, no matter how clever a company's in-house cryptographers may be.</p><p>Telegram's MTProto protocol isn't obviously broken in a practical way, concedes Matt Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University who has consulted for Facebook on encrypted messaging systems. But it's uniquely "weird," he says, in a way that suggests its inventors don't understand tried-and-true cryptography practices and raises his suspicions that it may yet have undiscovered vulnerabilities. "It's like if everyone else in the world has agreed that we're going to use drywall to do the walls in a house, and then you've got somebody who's using toothpaste," says Green. "Even if the toothpaste works and makes a nice wall, that's weird. How do you know they're not doing other weird, nonstandard things when they put the electrical wiring into the house? And that's what scares me."</p></div></div><div><div><p>Telegram's Ravdonikas argues that “Telegram encryption relies on classical algorithms, because we consider some approaches promoted by US-based cryptographers after 9-11/the Patriot Act (which your sources refer to as 'state of the art cryptography') questionable."</p><p>That rebuttal elicited an eye-roll emoji from Johns Hopkins' Green. "We use these standard approaches because they have public and verifiable mathematical proofs of security," Green says. The standard protocols that Telegram avoids have had plenty of scrutiny outside of the US, he adds in response to the allegation that the Patriot Act biases US cryptographers who have examined them. And Telegram itself uses standard crypto algorithms developed and certified by US government agencies, just in nonstandard ways.</p><p>But Green emphasizes that any criticism of Telegram's encryption protocol is almost academic. The real, overarching problem with Telegram's security protections is that it doesn't actually offer end-to-end encryption by default. "If you're not using secret chats, then Telegram and anyone who hacks into Telegram's servers sees all of your communications. And that's really the biggest problem," Green says. "Signal has default end-to-end encryption. WhatsApp has default end-to-end encryption. Telegram does not."</p><p>Raphael Mimoun, the digital security trainer, says …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>
Keyboard input on Terminals has many deficiencies to it. I want them all fixed. I have a plan on how to do it but it Needs Your Help
</p>

<p>
I want terminal keypresses to Just Work. What do I mean Just Work? I mean programs in a simple orthogonal way, can determine the key that was pressed, and this model should easily map to the user's expectation.
</p>

<p>
Why doesn't it currently? Currently, there are a number of classes of physically-distinct key presses that terminals encode using the same bytes.

</p><ul>
<li>Special names for some ASCII characters collide with <tt>Ctrl</tt>-modified letters. For example, <tt>Tab</tt> is <tt>Ctrl-I</tt>.</li>
<li>The <tt>Ctrl</tt> modifier encodes lower or upper-case letters identically; <tt>Ctrl-I</tt> is <tt>Ctrl-Shift-I</tt>.</li>
<li>UTF-8 collides with 8bit-high characters; e.g. <tt>Alt-C</tt> might be encoded as <tt>0xc3</tt>, which is the first UTF-8 byte of many Unicode characters, such as Ã©.</li>
<li>Sometimes programs rely on timing information to distinguish, for example, <tt>Alt-C</tt> from the two separate keypresses of <tt>Escape</tt> followed by <tt>C</tt>. This results in delays to recognise a plain <tt>Escape</tt> key if the time is too long, or erroneously recognising <tt>Escape</tt> followed by a letter as an <tt>Alt</tt>-modified letter if typed too quickly, or if the time limit is too short.</li>
</ul><p>

Even when keys produce unique unambiguous byte sequences, it may be that some programs cannot recognise them.
</p><ul>
<li>The way terminals encode modified keypresses is an extension to the original methods used in the 1970s, and some older code cannot parse them correctly. Press <tt>Ctrl-Up</tt> on a modern xterm and watch a program fail and die in all sorts of interesting ways because they don't have real CSI parsers.</li>
</ul>



<h2>How can we fix this?</h2>

<p>
By having a sane and sensible model on BOTH ends of the terminal interaction, and a well-defined way of communicating.
How exactly we go about this really depends who you are:
</p>

<h3>Authors of Programs that Read Terminal Keypresses</h3>

<p>
The simplest way to go about this is to use the key input handling features of my terminal UI library, <a href="http://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libtickit/">libtickit</a>.
Failing this, if you're using some existing system of keyboard input, such as GNU Readline, I suggest you apply pressure to the maintainers of that system until they adopt this method of reading extended keypresses.
</p>

<h3>Authors of Terminal Emulators</h3>

<p>
Making a terminal send the correct key encodings should be a relatively easy task, given the encoding scheme already splits modifiers and keysyms in a way likely to be similar to the underlying input system at work, such as X11 or Win32.
</p>

<h3>End-users of Programs</h3>

<p>Even if you're not the author of a program like this, you can still help fix the situation. Write to the maintainer of your program, report a bug. Explain that you wanted to use such a keybinding, or whatever the problem was. Explain that, because their program doesn't correctly handle these cases, it wasn't possible, but if they were to adopt this scheme, then it would be and your problem would be solved. With enough voices, even the most stubbon developer who believes it's 1970 and everyone lives behind a green-phosphor glass teletype on a 9,600 baud modem, can still change his ways.</p>

<h2>Encoding Specification</h2>

<p>
The primary motivation of this scheme is to encode any possible keypress uniquely; that a keypress maps to one possible sequence of bytes, and a valid sequence of bytes encodes only one keypress. For backward compability, it is also required that any keypress that can be represented without this scheme is also represented by the same bytes within it; that is, this scheme is an <em>extension</em> of existing encodings, not a replacement of.
</p>

<dl>

<dt>Modifiers</dt>
<dd>
The two encoding forms used by this specification to encode modifiers both put a number as their second parameter whose value is 1 + a bitmask encoding the modifiers. We add 1 because by convention, a missing CSI parameter is equivalent to 1, so in the "unmodified" state the modifier field would be 1 - we must add 1 to it so that no-bits-set (unmodified) is encoded as 1 (though, in practice, we rarely use the 1 form explicitly).<br>

Thus, the various encoding forms using these modifiers will look like:
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>unmodified</td><td>Shift+</td><td>Alt+</td><td>Alt+Shift+</td><td>Ctrl+</td><td>Ctrl+Shift+</td><td>Ctrl+Alt+</td><td>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+</td></tr>
<tr><td>(direct UTF-8)</td><td><tt>CSI ...;2 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;3 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;4 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;5 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;6 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;7 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;8 u</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>CSI ... ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;2 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;3 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;4 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;5 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;6 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;7 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;8 ~</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>CSI X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;2 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;3 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;4 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;5 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;6 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;7 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;8 X</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
These various forms are explained more below.
</dd>

<dt>Unicode Characters</dt>
<dd>
When unmodified, just send UTF-8 bytes as normal. No UTF-8 sequence of a regular character starts with a <tt>C0</tt> or <tt>C1</tt> byte, so these will be unique. The <tt>Shift</tt> key should not be considered as a modifier for Unicode characters, because it is most likely used to obtain the character in the first place (e.g. the shift key is often required to obtain the <tt>!</tt> symbol).<br>

Certain key presses have special behaviours with modifiers. <tt>Alt</tt> tends to prefix <tt>Escape</tt>. <tt>Ctrl</tt> tends to mask with <tt>0x1f</tt>. When the simplest form of these keys are pressed, they should be encoded as previously.
Existing schemes lack a way to encode more general modifiers with Unicode codepoints at present, so we are at liberty to invent something new for these. The CSI <tt>u</tt> command lies in the private-use area, so has no fixed meaning at present.
<pre>CSI [codepoint];[modifier] u</pre>
We can use this to represent the problematic combinations of keys; for example variations on the letter "A" (ASCII decimal value 65) and "a":
<table>
<tbody><tr><td></td><td>unmodified</td><td>Alt+</td><td>Ctrl+</td><td>Ctrl+Alt+</td></tr>
<tr><td>without Shift</td><td><tt>a</tt></td><td><tt>ESC a</tt></td><td><tt>0x01</tt></td><td><tt>ESC 0x01</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>with Shift</td><td><tt>A</tt></td><td><tt>ESC A</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 65;5 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 65;7 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
This same pattern is continued for the other letters, except for the awkward cases of 

We can now represent the usual problematic keys unambiguously:
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Ctrl-I = <tt>CSI 105;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-I = <tt>CSI  73;5 u</tt></td><td>Tab        = <tt>0x09</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl-M = <tt>CSI 109;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-M = <tt>CSI  77;5 u</tt></td><td>Enter      = <tt>0x0d</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl-[ = <tt>CSI  91;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-{       = <tt>CSI 123;5 u</tt></td><td>Escape     = <tt>0x1b</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">Ctrl-@ = <tt>CSI  64;5u</tt></td>                                 <td>Ctrl-Space = <tt>0x00</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
Because other <tt>C0</tt> bytes do not have usual alternative names or keypresses, these can continue to be sent using the simple single-byte encoding. This is essential to ensuring that legacy systems continue to interpret them correctly (e.g. <tt>termios</tt> still sends <tt>SIGINT</tt> on Ctrl-C).
The <tt>Space</tt> key is unique among the printing Unicode keys in that its behaviour doesn't normally change as a result of the <tt>Shift</tt> modifier. We can capture this by encoding it using CSIu - uniquely, the only printing Unicode key for which we use this:
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Ctrl-Space = <tt>0x00</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-Space = <tt>CSI 32;6 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</dd>

<dt>Modified C0 controls</dt>
<dd>
The problematic keys listed above plus <tt>Backspace</tt> can be represented using the <tt>CSI u</tt> encoding when any modifiers are present. Because these symbols are almost universally found on their own physical keycap, there is no problem with encoding the <tt>Shift</tt> modifier as well, with the value 1. We encode these keys using their normal <tt>ASCII</tt> codepoint values.
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Enter     = <tt>0x0d</tt></td><td>Shift-Enter     = <tt>CSI  13;2 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Enter     = <tt>CSI  13;5 u</tt></td><td rowspan="4">...</td></tr>
<tr><td>Escape    = <tt>0x1b</tt></td><td>Shift-Escape    = <tt>CSI  27;2 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Escape    = <tt>CSI  27;5 u</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>Backspace = <tt>0x7f</tt></td><td>Shift-Backspace = <tt>CSI 127;2 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Backspace = <tt>CSI 127;5 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
The <tt>Space</tt> key is trickier, because it's traditionally used with the <tt>Ctrl</tt> modifier to obtain the <tt>NUL</tt> byte encoding.
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Space     = <tt>0x20</tt></td><td>Shift-Space     = <tt>CSI  32;2 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Space     = <tt>0x00</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-Space = <tt>CSI  32;6 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
Since most terminals repesent <tt>Shift-Tab</tt> as <tt>CSI Z</tt>, that needs handling specially as well.
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Tab = <tt>0x09</tt></td><td>Shift-Tab = <tt>CSI  Z</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Tab = <tt>CSI 9;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-Tab = <tt>CSI 1;5 Z</tt></td><td>...</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</dd>

<dt>Special keys</dt>
<dd>
Existing schemes usually use <tt>CSI ~</tt> to encode special (i.e. non-Unicode) keypresses. XTerm and other terminals use the second CSI parameter to pass encoding the set of modifiers in effect.
<pre>CSI [number];[modifier] ~</pre>
If the modifier value is 1; i.e. there are no modifiers, then for backward-compatibility to send the same bytes as previously, it should be omitted, sending simply
<pre>CSI [number] ~</pre>
<table>
 <tbody><tr><th>Key</th><th>Number</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Insert   </td><td> 2</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Delete   </td><td> 3</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Page Up  </td><td> 5</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Page Down</td><td> 6</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Home (*) </td><td> 7</td></tr>
 <tr><td>End (*)  </td><td> 8</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F1 (*)   </td><td>11</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F2 (*)   </td><td>12</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F3 (*)   </td><td>13</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F4 (*)   </td><td>14</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F5       </td><td>15</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F6       </td><td>17 (**)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F7       </td><td>18</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F8       </td><td>19</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F9       </td><td>20</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F10      </td><td>21</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F11      </td><td>23</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F12      </td><td>24</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<b>(*)</b>: Note that some terminals prefer to encode <tt>Home</tt>, <tt>End</tt> and the <tt>F1</tt> to <tt>F4</tt> function keys using shorter <tt>CSI letter</tt> encodings. Parsers or other receiving programs should accept either encoding identically.
<b>(**)</b>: Note also the discontinuity of numbered function keys. After every group of 5 F keys there is a missing number; so every 6th number is not used by an F key (10, 16, 22, 28,...). This is purely for historic reasons; the numbered F keys on the original VTxx keyboards had physical gaps in these locations.
</dd>

<dt>Really special keypresses</dt>
<dd>
Some terminals encode certain keys outside of the <tt>CSI ~</tt> encoding, instead picking a different CSI command. This too can accomodate the modifier in its second position.
<pre>CSI 1;[modifier] {ABCDFHPQRS}</pre>
<table>
 <tbody><tr><th>Key</th><th>Code</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Up</td>   <td>A</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Down</td> <td>B</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Right</td><td>C</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Left</td> <td>D</td></tr>
 <tr><td>End</td>  <td>F</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Home</td> <td>H</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F1</td>   <td>P</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F2</td>   <td>Q</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F3</td>   <td>R</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F4</td>   <td>S</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
As before, if the modifier is 1 then the modifier parameter should be omitted. Since the leading number is also implied, this can be omitted too.
<pre>CSI {ABCDFHPQRS}</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Advantages: solves above problems. <b>Can be fitted into existing programs with a minimum of fuss and without breaking back-compat</b>.
</p>

<p>
Extension: We can take it one step further, and require CSI to be sent as the single 8bit code <tt>0x9b</tt> and never as 7bit multibyte <tt>0x1b 0x4b</tt> (Escape [). This reserves the single <tt>0x1b</tt> byte exclusively for the Escape key. If this is known to be in effect, then it is no longer required to use timing information to recover accurate keypress information, as every possible keypress now has a unique encoding. Even if this is not known to be in effect, programs ought to accept the single <tt>0x9b</tt> byte encoding of CSI anyway, in anticipation of a time when terminals may send it encoded this way by default.

The new funding will allow Ukko to enter clinical trials with its investigational therapeutic for peanut allergy. It will also accelerate development of Ukko’s gluten that is designed for people with celiac and other gluten sensitivities. The round was led by Leaps by Bayer – the impact investment arm of Bayer – and was joined by Continental Grain Company, PeakBridge Ventures, Skyviews Life Science and Fall Line Capital, as well as existing investors Khosla Ventures, Innovation Endeavors, and TIME Ventures, the investment fund of Marc Benioff.</p><h2><b>Novel approach with AI-powered platform</b></h2><p>Ukko’s novel approach uses a proprietary AI-powered platform that precisely engineers food proteins to eliminate their allergenicity, while keeping their good biochemical and nutritional characteristics. The platform uses patient samples, computational biology, immunology, and protein engineering to make proteins that do not trigger the immune system.</p><p>“We are at a unique crossroads in the history of science,” said Prof. Yanay Ofran, Chairman and Co-founder of Ukko. “Big data allows us to understand the underpinnings of food sensitivities. Computational tools allow us to precisely design the proteins that make up our bodies and our food. New genome editing technologies allow us to rewrite DNA to produce these new proteins in living cells. Ukko sits at the intersection of these breakthrough technologies, allowing us to redefine healthy food at the molecular level, based on real data.”</p><p>Ukko has already built one of the largest clinically-validated molecular maps of food allergies, which unlocks critical data and allows the company a rich foundation for further innovation. Ukko has also generated promising data, based on patient samples, that suggests the company’s investigational peanut and gluten proteins do not trigger allergic reactions responses in the immune system of patients.</p><p>“We are at the forefront of a revolution. Pharma and the food industry will redefine how they think about their products and missions,” said Anat Binur, CEO and Co-Founder of Ukko. “Hundreds of millions of people around the world suffer from food allergies and experts see it as a global epidemic. Ending food allergy is critical and is only the beginning. Ukko’s tech has the potential to leverage science and human data to redesign our food and medicine.”</p><h2><b>Improved gluten proteins and therapy for peanut allergy</b></h2><p>Ukko has a holistic food-to-therapy approach to solving food allergies and sensitivities. On the food side, Ukko is working on improved gluten proteins that are especially designed for people with celiac and other gluten sensitivities, which allows bakers, food companies, and home cooks to make delicious bread, pizza, pasta, and baked goods that everyone can eat. On the therapeutic side, Ukko is using its protein design platform to develop a new and promising investigational therapy for peanut allergy. Ukko’s future pipeline includes plans to address additional major food allergens.</p><p>“Ukko’s investigative approaches to solving allergies and food sensitivities both from the food side and the patient therapeutics side have the possibility of delivering enormous benefits for humanity,” said Juergen Eckhardt, MD, Head of Leaps by Bayer, which was built to drive fundamental breakthroughs in the fields of health and agriculture through new technologies. “One of the big challenges we’re addressing through our Leaps investments is attempting to reverse autoimmune diseases, which have enormous impacts on the world’s food systems and our health systems in every community around the globe. We are proud to lead this investment in Ukko and help solve the biggest allergies and food sensitivities. It is a great fit to our global leadership role in both health and nutrition.”</p><p>“I have been a witness to my patients’ growing urgency to discover a cure for food allergies. While there are tremendous breakthroughs coming from the research and biotech worlds, safety remains a significant hurdle. Ukko’s efforts to solve these challenges for allergies and sensitivities is one of the most promising and exciting approaches I have seen” said Prof. Lynda Schneider, Director of the Allergy Program at Boston Children’s Hospital and Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.</p><h2><b>Number of people suffering food allergies to climb in the coming years</b></h2><p>Hundreds of millions of people around the world suffer from food allergies and experts predict the numbers will continue to climb in the coming years. In the U.S. alone, one in 13 children has food allergies (about two in every classroom) and every three minutes a food allergy reaction sends someone to the emergency room. The incidence of celiac disease has been doubling every 15 years and – even at that rate of growth – over 80% of patients remain undiagnosed, leaving these people with higher risk for developing other serious conditions like anemia or even cancer. Economically, food allergies and sensitivities cost more than $25 billion<sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup> every year in the U.S. alone and place enormous strain on families, communities, the healthcare system, and the ag and food industries.</p><p>Ukko has formed an Advisory Board that includes some of the world’s top clinical experts in food allergy and sensitivities, and experts in food and agriculture innovation. The Advisory Board supports the company on the policy, business strategy, science, and clinical aspects of Ukko’s work. Some of Ukko’s advisors include<b> Bernhard Van Lengerich</b>, Former Chief Science Officer &amp; Vice President for Technology Strategy at General Mills;<b> Ann M. Veneman</b>, Former US Secretary of Agriculture; <b>Dr. Wesley A. Burks</b>, Dean and CEO of the Univ. of North Carolina (UNC) School of Medicine and UNC Health; <b>Dr. Edwin Kim</b>, Associate Professor, Allergy &amp; Immunology Program Director, UNC Food Allergy Initiative; <b>Dr. Kari Nadeau</b>, Director of the Sean N.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><a href="https://leontrolski.github.io/index.html"><img src="https://leontrolski.github.io/pic.png">â‡¦</a><p><em>Discussion <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25933121">here</a> and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ldzfsw/oo_python_is_mostly_pointless">here</a>. Call to arms for idiomatic OO code <a href="https://github.com/leontrolski/call-to-arms">here</a>.</em></p><p>People bash OO a lot these days, I'm increasingly coming to the opinion they're right, at least in Python. My point here is not to argue that OO is bad per se, more that its introduction is simply unnecessary, AKA not useful.</p><h2>Oli's Conjecture</h2><blockquote>All OO code can be refactored into equivalent non-OO code that's as easy or more easy to understand.</blockquote><p>Let's take an example that should pan out in OO's favour, we've all seen/written code somewhat like the following:</p><pre><code>class ApiClient:
    def __init__(self, root_url: str, session_cls: sessionmaker):
        self.root_url = root_url
        self.session_cls = session_cls

    def construct_url(self, entity: str) -&gt; str:
        return f"{self.root_url}/v1/{entity}"

    def get_items(self, entity: str) -&gt; List[Item]:
        resp = requests.get(self.construct_url(entity))
        resp.raise_for_status()
        return [Item(**n) for n in resp.json()["items"]]

    def save_items(self, entity: str) -&gt; None:
        with scoped_session(self.session_cls) as session:
            session.add(self.get_items(entity))


class ClientA(ApiClient):
    def construct_url(self, entity: str) -&gt; str:
        return f"{self.root_url}/{entity}"


class ClientB(ApiClient):
    def construct_url(self, entity: str) -&gt; str:
        return f"{self.root_url}/a/special/place/{entity}"


client_a = ClientA("https://client-a", session_cls)
client_a.save_items("bars")</code></pre><p>We chose OO it because we wanted to bind the <code>root_url</code> to something and we didn't want to pass around the <code>sessionmaker</code>. We also wanted to utilise inheritance to hook into a method halfway through the call stack.</p><p>But what if we do just pass data around, and write 'boring' functions, what happens then?</p><pre><code>@dataclass
class Client:
    root_url: str
    url_layout: str


client_a = Client(
    root_url="https://client-a",
    url_layout="{root_url}/{entity}",
)

client_b = Client(
    root_url="https://client-b",
    url_layout="{root_url}/a/special/place/{entity}",
)


def construct_url(client: Client, entity: str) -&gt; str:
    return client.url_layout.format(root_url=client.root_url, entity=entity)


def get_items(client: Client, entity: str) -&gt; List[Item]:
    resp = requests.get(construct_url(client, entity))
    resp.raise_for_status()
    return [Item(**n) for n in resp.json()["items"]]


def save_items(client: Client, session_cls: session_cls, entity: str) -&gt; None:
    with scoped_session(session_cls) as session:
        session.add(get_items(client, entity))


save_items(client_a, session_cls, "bars")</code></pre><p>We had to pass round the <code>Client</code> and the <code>session_cls</code> around.</p><p>ðŸ¤·</p><p>Who cares? We even wrote like 10% fewer characters. Also, the conjecture stands, the resulting code is at least as easy to understand and we didn't need any OO.</p><p>I've heard this style referred to as the <b>bag-of-functions</b> style. That is to say, all your code just consists of typed data and module-namespaced-bags-of-functions.</p><h2>What about long lived global-y things?</h2><p>Use <a href="https://leontrolski.github.io/sane-config.html">this pattern</a> to reuse config/db session classes over the lifetime of an application.</p><h2>What about interfaces/abstract base classes?</h2><p>Just try writing without them, I promise it's going to be OK. <em>(To be fair, it's only the introduction of type hints to Python that has made the <b>bag-of-functions</b> style so pleasant).</em></p><h2>What about impure things?</h2><p>If you've taken the pure-FP/hexagonal-architecture pill, you want to write pure classes that take impure 'adapter' instances for <code>getting-the-current-datetime/API-calls/talking-to-the-db/other-impure-stuff</code>. The idea is nice in principal - should be good for testing right? - in practice, you can just use <a href="https://github.com/spulec/freezegun">freezegun</a> / use <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/responses">responses</a> / <a href="https://dhh.dk/2014/slow-database-test-fallacy.html">test with the db</a> (the <code>other-impure-stuff</code> tends to not actually exist) and save yourself a lot of hassle.</p><h2>Exceptions:</h2><p>I'd like to make exceptions for the following:</p><ul><li>You'll notice I put <code>@dataclass</code>s in the refactored code, these are fine - they're just record types. Python 5 will only have these, not 'normal' classes.</li><li>It's fine to subclass <code>Exception</code>s.  The usage of <code>try: ... except SomeClass: ...</code> fundamentally ties you to a heirarchical worldview, this is fine, just don't make it too complicated.</li><li><code>Enum</code>s - same as above, they fit in well with the rest of Python.</li><li>Very, very occasionally (at least in application development), you come up with a core type that's used so often, it's nice to have the cutesy stuff - think something like a <code>pandas.DataFrame</code>/<code>sqlalchemy.Session</code>. In general though, don't kid yourself that you're building anything that exciting, it's just vanity getting the better of you.</li></ul><h2>I lied.</h2><blockquote>My point here is not to argue that OO is bad per se.</blockquote><p>OK, I lied, it's not just a case of OO being a largely futile addition to the language, it's that it often obscures the problem at hand and encourages bad behaviours:</p><ul><li>It encourages you to mutate. Bag-of-functions makes it feel icky to mutate arguments - as it should feel. (Feel free to mutate within the confines of your function BTW, let's not go mad FP).</li><li>It's somewhat just the return of global variables. Not being able to share data between functions with <code>self</code> forces you to write functions with a smaller state-space that are easier to test.</li><li>Smooshing in functions in with your data makes it harder to serialise anything - in a world of REST APIs, serialisability is super useful.</li><li>It encourages mad inheritance hierarchies - this has been talked about at length elsewhere.</li><li>Most importantly though, it adds nothing, it's just noise that distracts from the problem at hand and makes it harder to navigate/comprehend your code.</li></ul><h2>Notes</h2><ul><li><a href="https://leontrolski.github.io/poor-mans-object.html">I've written before about the poor man's object/closure thingy.</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0">A classic video in the OO-bashing genre.</a></li></ul>

        <p>Have you ever wondered what’s the smallest amount of static storage (code +
data) needed to map emoji :shortcodes: to emoji?</p>
<p>Probably not… but now that I’ve posed the question, aren’t you at least a
little curious what the answer might be?</p>
<p>So hey, if you’ve got some time to spare, why not stick around a while and learn
a bit about cool topics such as perfect hashing, probabilistic data structures,
and 2D dynamic programming algorithms?</p>
<p>Take a break from solving whatever “important problem” you’re working on, kick
back, relax, and join me on my [somewhat useless] quest to find a highly
compressed emoji :shortcode: lookup function!</p>
<p>
  <img alt="A GIF of the online demo" src="https://prilik.com/blog/assets/emoji-shortcodes/shortcode_demo.gif">

<h2 id="what-even-is-a-highly-compressed-emoji-shortcode-lookup-function">What even is a “Highly Compressed Emoji Shortcode Lookup Function”?<a href="#what-even-is-a-highly-compressed-emoji-shortcode-lookup-function" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Before embarking on our quest, we should probably clarify what it is we’re
looking for exactly exactly.</p>
<p>We want to write a function that accepts shortcode strings as input, and outputs
UTF-8 emoji as output:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// e.g: shortcode_to_emoji("flamingo") -&gt; Some("🦩")
</span><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>shortcode_to_emoji</span>(input: <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span>) -&gt; Option<span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>At first glance, this doesn’t seem too difficult: just find a free, open source
dataset of emoji shortcodes, load that data into memory, construct a hashmap,
and start querying it - easy peasy!</p>
<p>Not so fast.</p>
<p>While that approach would work just fine on your fancy shmancy
Linux/Windows/macOS/TempleOS powered desktop computer, what if we wanted to run
this lookup function on something a little bit more… embedded? If we tried to
dynamically construct a hashmap at runtime on a tiny, resource-constrained
ARM/AVR microcontroller, we’d very quickly run out of dynamic memory (assuming
something like <code>malloc</code> is even <em>available</em> on said platform).</p>
<p>Indeed, therein lies the need for a “Highly Compressed” lookup function - if we
want to run this code on an embedded system, the lookup function will have to
occupy as little static storage (code <em>and</em> read-only data) as possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At this point, you might be thinking to yourself “who in their right mind
would want to map emoji shortcodes on embedded hardware?” Fair enough! I’ve
included my inspiration behind this wild endeavor in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="-inspiration-">💡 Inspiration 💡<a href="#-inspiration-" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>I’m a big fan of
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards">custom mechanical keyboards</a>, as
aside from looking and sounding awesome, they’re also an excellent
hardware-hacking platform. Most custom mechanical keyboards use the open source
<a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware">QMK firmware</a>, which comes with a host of
built-in features for doing just about anything you’d want on a keyboard.</p>
<p>One particularly useful QMK feature is its ability to
<a href="https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/software-features/feature_unicode">type Unicode characters</a>.
In a nutshell, you can program your keyboard such that when a certain key (or
sequence of keys) is pressed, it will send whatever keystrokes are required to
input Unicode on any of the several
<a href="https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/software-features/feature_unicode#2-input-modes-id-input-modes">supported platforms</a>.
This is great, because it means that the 🅱 emoji is never more than a few
keystrokes away!</p>
<p>One somewhat annoying limitation of QMK’s built-in Unicode support is that users
are required to define which emoji they’d like to use <em>ahead of time</em>. While
it’s not too difficult to find a set of “workhorse” emoji to preload onto the
keyboard, it’d certainly be convenient to also be able to type more “bespoke”
emoji when the need arises. Sure, quick and easy access to the 🅱 emoji is great
and all, but what about those rare cases where I quickly need access to the 🦩
emoji? What am I supposed to do - use my OS’s built-in emoji picker like a
<em>peasant??</em> Never!</p>
<p>And so, I decided to spend my valuable free time on something some folks might
call “a total waste of time”: writing a Rust library that exports a single
function that can look up emoji shortcodes using the minimum amount of code +
read-only data, and without requiring <em>any</em> heap allocation!</p>
<p>Now, without further ado, let’s dive into the implementation!</p>
<h2 id="-getting-a-feel-for-the-data-">📝 Getting a feel for the Data 📝<a href="#-getting-a-feel-for-the-data-" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>First things first, we’ll need a dataset of emoji shortcodes to work with. For
this project, I decided to use the same emoji database as used by GitHub, since
it’s the one I’m most familiar with, and it’s also readily available as a big
‘ol
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gemoji/master/db/emoji.json">JSON blob</a>.
The particular dataset exhibits the following properties:</p>
<!-- Markdown doesn't support tables without a header smh -->
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>total shortcode, emoji pairs</td>
            <td>1848</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>raw shortcode character data</td>
            <td>18715 bytes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>raw emoji UTF-8 character data</td>
            <td>11096 bytes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>average shortcode length</td>
            <td>10.12716 bytes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>average emoji length</td>
            <td>6.004329 bytes</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>Converting this data set into a CSV file of raw <code>shortcode,emoji</code> pairs would
result in roughly <strong>~34kb</strong> file. Aside from being a totally impractical data
structure for querying on an embedded system, 34kb is quite a bit of data in an
embedded context! Let’s see if we can do any better…</p>
<h2 id="-implementation-">🛠️ Implementation 🛠️<a href="#-implementation-" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Since we know all the key-value pairs ahead of time, a good place to start off
might be to generate a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function">perfect hash map</a> of
shortcodes to emoji at compile time. Unlike typical hash functions, <em>perfect</em>
hash functions guarantee that each individual valid input is mapped to a
<em>distinct</em> index. This property means that there is <em>zero wasted space</em> in the
underlying hash table.</p>
<p>In fact, the foundation of this entire project is the incredible
<a href="https://github.com/sfackler/rust-phf"><code>rust-phf</code></a>, which I ended up heavy
modifying and optimizing for this specific use-case. That said, even without
doing any modifications, the base <code>rust-phf</code> crate results in <strong>~100kb</strong> of
code + data overhead, and can be used on systems without dynamic allocation.</p>
<p>Now, 100kb doesn’t <em>seem</em> that bad, but when you consider that the raw dataset
of shortcodes + emoji is only ~34kb, and the fact that most embedded platforms
I’m targeting have at most ~256kb of flash ROM, it’s should be obvious that
there’s plenty of room for improvement.</p>
<p>Not to spoil the ending, but by using the host of optimizations and data
layout/representation tricks outlined in the next couple sections, that 100kb
number ends up shrinking down to a measly <strong>~20kb!</strong></p>
<h3 id="trick-1---storing-hashes-of--keys--instead-of-the-keys-themselves">Trick 1 - Storing hashes of 🔑 keys 🔑 instead of the keys themselves<a href="#trick-1---storing-hashes-of--keys--instead-of-the-keys-themselves" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Let’s start off with a guiding question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do hash tables need to store both values <em>and</em> keys, even in situations
where there’s never a need to iterate over key-value pairs in the map?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question has a couple different answers, but the one most relevant to this
discussion is that hash tables need a copy of the original key to prevent <em>false
positive lookups</em>, whereby an invalid key returns an unrelated value.</p>
<p>A fundamental property of hash tables is that given a unlimited set of inputs
(i.e: all possible strings), and a limited set of outputs (i.e: the ~2000 emoji
in our data set), a hash collision is essentially guaranteed to happen. As such,
hash tables need to employ some sort of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Collision_resolution">collision resolution algorithm</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If hash tables didn’t have any collision resolution, just imagine what sort of
chaos simple input errors might result in! A harmless spelling mistake while
trying to input <code>😄</code>, compounded with some spectacularly bad statistical
chance, somehow results in <code>🍆</code> instead!</p>
<p>Unlikely? Sure. But why even take the chance?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our case, since we happen to be using a <em>perfect</em> hash function, the conflict
resolution strategy happens to be incredibly simple: just include an
<a href="https://github.com/sfackler/rust-phf/blob/9b70bd9/phf/src/map.rs#L88">additional check</a>
that compares the input key against the expected key at that particular index.
With this one simple trick, the hash table can ensure that invalid inputs are
rejected with 100% certainty!</p>
<p><strong>But enough about how hash functions work in general, we have a problem we want
to solve!</strong></p>
<p>One key insight about our problem is that we are only even interested in
<em>looking up</em> values, and don’t actually care about what the set of valid keys
is.</p>
<p>This begs the question: <strong>Is there any way we could somehow <em>avoid</em> storing all
the keys in their entirety?</strong></p>
<p>At last, we arrive at our first trick: Instead of storing each shortcode key in
its entirety as a raw string (which would take up a <em>lot</em> of space, around
<code>size_of(char*) + 10</code> bytes on average), just store a <strong>small <em>secondary hash</em>
of the key!</strong></p>
<p>This trick results in some absolutely <em>monstrous</em> space savings, cutting the
~18kb of raw shortcode string data down to just <strong>~4kb</strong> (i.e:
<code>size_of(hash("input")) * num_shortcodes</code> bytes, assuming a 16-bit hash).</p>
<hr>
<p>Unfortunately, this trick doesn’t come for free, and brings with it a nasty
side-effect: since the hash function only stores a <em>hash</em> of the key, <strong>the
collision resolution algorithm stops being 100% accurate.</strong> Indeed, the lookup
function ends up having an <em>infinite</em> number of “false positive” inputs 😱</p>
<p>Fortunately, it turns out that it’s possible to greatly reduce the number of
“reasonable” false positives (“reasonable” in the sense that the input isn’t
comprised on random gibberish characters) simply by increasing the number of
bits used for the secondary hash.</p>
<p>Now, I’m no statistician, so I really can’t comment to the theoretical impact of
using more/less bits to reduce false positives, but I can say that though some
extensive empirical testing - both via
<a href="https://github.com/daniel5151/compressed-emoji-shortcodes/tree/main/kowalski-analysis">automated testing</a>
and human trials (read: mashing random keys on my keyboard) - it seems that a
<strong>16-bit hash works almost perfectly</strong>. Heck, if you’re really worried about
space, <strong>even a single byte hash works great!</strong></p>
<p>And don’t just take my word for it - go and play around with the
<a href="https://prilik.com/compressed-emoji-shortcodes">online demo</a> and see how well
this “imperfect” collision resolution algorithm actually works - it ought to be
pretty difficult to find any “reasonable” false positive inputs.</p>

<p>The typical way to store static strings within a map is to store <em>pointers</em> to
the strings, and storing the strings themselves somewhere else in read-only
memory. Unfortunately, in this particular situation, this naive way of storing
strings results in some substantial overhead, as aside from storing the raw
UTF-8 string data for each emoji, we also need to store a pointer to the
string + some way to mark the bounds of a string (either by storing …</p></div></div></div>

A “group” versus “pod”.&nbsp; Some may care deeply about tags for compliance while others may not.</p><figure id="w-node-f4d9d698d04f-0ff58005"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fd1d1ab54430e6b747263b2/6011840533a1c51a66480fcf_7TTT6OvZA1gFtcT3cZNFST0CIogTSyM6nYloYwCJ9OLTM9H3H43bOe4xUNcAdBkdeGNzHnZ7SuGLNqkHDcflYTF9Hrqb-QrW3n1zXqtS3eY6ghP11_8aT44GanEWrTiVXsliqk2A.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>The effx microservice catalog allows you to define your taxonomy in code</em></figcaption></figure><p>One team may prioritize dashboards that combine both time-series data and logs into one, while others may have a separate dashboard for each pillar of observability.&nbsp; Runbooks could be a separate entity or a team may have a culture of having that information directly in its alert descriptions.<br></p><p>Every company is different -- and at times, those differences exist on a team level!<br></p><p>A flexible taxonomy for how metadata is described and labeled allows your team to build a microservice catalog that makes sense for your cultural engineering norms, versus fitting a strongly-opinionated structure.<br></p><h2>Portability<br></h2><p>Imagine if you could only use data from another common catalog-like service, Wikipedia … on Wikipedia.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>When developers build systems to send microservice metadata or events into a platform, they expect to be able to also retrieve it to use in their own applications.&nbsp; An API-first microservice catalog is a must.<br></p><p>Once the metadata for a service is aggregated into a single location, the applicability of that data in other platforms is nearly limitless.&nbsp; Source of truth information like service ownership can help drive priorities or roles and responsibilities in other platforms that require it.<br></p><p>Having a well-documented, easy-to-use API that has strong library support and follows common access patterns like REST helps ensure that your platform is both extensible and portable.<br></p><p><a href="https://effxhq.github.io/effx-api-v2/"><strong>Check out our effx API documentation</strong></a><br></p><h2>Accuracy<br></h2><p>In the sales world, folks describe CRMs as only being as useful as the data inside of it.&nbsp; A microservice catalog is no different.<br></p><p>Beyond being appropriately filled out, engineers need to feel confident that the data is up-to-date.&nbsp; A single pane of glass with incorrect information, whether it be broken links or out-of-date data can actually be more harmful than the absence of data.<br></p><p>How does one go about providing an accurate catalog?&nbsp;

January 27, 2021 | https://eugeneyan.com/writing/you-dont-need-another-mooc/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://eugeneyan.com/writing/you-dont-need-another-mooc/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Donâ€™t get me wrong, I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" target="_blank">MOOCs</a>. Theyâ€™re great for trying to learn a new programming language (e.g., Python, Scala) or framework (e.g., Spark, TensorFlow) or subject (e.g., statistics, machine learning). The structured learning environment, excellent teaching, and exercises (and solutions) guide us through the best way to learn new concepts.</p>
<p><strong>But most of the time, we donâ€™t really need it.</strong> If we <em>already</em> know machine learning, taking that shiny new MOOC wonâ€™t help with applying it more effectively. Doing another Python tutorial wonâ€™t help with writing better code. Most MOOCs follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank">Pareto Principle</a> and teach students the 20% they need to achieve 80% results. Thus, past the first or second course, our learning tapers off. (Also see Susanâ€™s view on <a href="https://www.susanshu.com/should-i-take-more-online-courses-data-science#rule-of-thumb-diminishing-marginal-returns" target="_blank">diminishing returns</a>.)</p><p>
\[\text { Diminishing returns from similar MOOCs }=1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{16}+\cdots \approx 2\]
</p><p><strong>Sometimes, new MOOCs become a reason to procrastinate, or worse, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-handicapping" target="_blank">self-handicap</a>.</strong> You know this is happening when you hear yourself, or something else, having these thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>â€œIâ€™m not able to start building that <em>until</em> I finish this MOOC specialization.â€�</li>
<li>â€œMy resume isnâ€™t getting picked up <em>because</em> I donâ€™t have certs on Spark &amp; PyTorch.â€�</li>
<li>â€œI havenâ€™t studied enough about deep learning, <em>so</em> I wonâ€™t do well in the interview.â€�</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Watching lecture videos isnâ€™t learningâ€”itâ€™s passive consumption.</strong> We sometimes equate taking an MOOC, or reading a technical book cover to cover, with learning the material. But how often do we struggle when we try to apply the technical knowledge or skills at work? Children donâ€™t learn to ride bicycles via how-to videos. Similarly, we canâ€™t learn how to program or apply technical knowledge just solely watching videos.</p>
<h2 id="go-off-the-happy-path">Go off the happy path</h2>
<p>Most good MOOCs or tutorials will provide hands-on practice. However, that hands-on practice will lie on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path" target="_blank">happy path</a>. We can copy-paste the code and itâ€™ll work. This makes sense as thereâ€™s a lot of material to cover and we donâ€™t want to spend time debugging, doing prep work, or solving problems via trial and error. Students will lose patience, causing <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/60e90be2-1a77-11e9-b191-175523b59d1d" target="_blank">completion rates to drop</a>.</p>
<p>Being on the happy path makes it easier to complete MOOC after MOOC. However, when we try to apply what weâ€™ve learnedâ€”either at work or on a personal projectâ€”it becomes much harder. This is because weâ€™re <em>now</em> off the happy path. And this is a good thing!</p>
<p><strong>Going off the happy path is how we further our learning <em>beyond the classroom</em>.</strong> This is especially so for our field of data science and machine learning, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-world data is messy and dirty, but most MOOCs or YouTube classes start with clean, structured data.</li>
<li>Most of the skills we require are technical. Thus, hands-on coding (read: <a href="https://danluu.com/teach-debugging/" target="_blank">debugging</a>) is essential to master them.</li>
<li>Experimentation is fundamental in our field. We need to try different approaches, fail, and learn beyond what can be practically taught in an MOOC or online tutorial.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>â€œI hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.â€� â€“ Confucius</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>We go off the happy path by doing real-world projects</strong>, dirty data, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cuda+errors" target="_blank">CUDA errors</a>, and all. Through projects, we learn how to define problems, apply algorithms wrongly (and correctly), google error messages, and iterate until it works. We practice resourcefulness, grit, and how to learn. These are the lessons that push us towards excellence.</p>
<p>But, I donâ€™t know enough to start a personal project!</p>
<h2 id="just-in-time-learning">Just-in-time learning</h2>
<p><strong>You just need to know enough to start; the rest youâ€™ll pick up along the way.</strong> We donâ€™t need to know Python <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators" target="_blank">generators</a> before developing your first Python program. We donâ€™t need to know Spark before processing 2 million rows of data. We donâ€™t need to know TensorFlow before training your first machine learning model.</p>
<p><strong>Just start, and let the challenges guide you towards your next learning needs.</strong> This way, you immediately apply what youâ€™ve learned. This reinforces learning, improves retention, and increases satisfaction. Similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_manufacturing" target="_blank">just-in-time</a> manufacturing, just learn whateverâ€™s needed to make progress on your project. Technical skills are perishableâ€”if we donâ€™t apply what we learn, theyâ€™ll decay.</p>
<p><strong>Apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it" target="_blank">YAGNI</a> to learning.</strong> Just like we donâ€™t need to add functionality until itâ€™s required, we donâ€™t need to do every new MOOC or read every new textbook. No point overwhelming ourselves with all that information and knowledge which we wonâ€™t use or apply.</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How to become expert at thing:<br>1 iteratively take on concrete projects and accomplish them depth wise, learning â€œon demandâ€� (ie donâ€™t learn bottom up breadth wise)<br>2 teach/summarize everything you learn in your own words<br>3 only compare yourself to younger you, never to others</p>— Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1325154823856033793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2020</a></blockquote> 
</div>
<p>To be clear, Iâ€™m not saying that we should stop exploring and learning new things. Iâ€™m saying that we should lean towards being more focused.</p>
<p>When learning about new domains, subjects, or skills, adopt a childlike <em>exploratory</em> mindset. Donâ€™t concern ourselves with the practicality of what we learn. However, if our intent is mastery, we should adopt a <em>focused</em> mindset and learn via hands-on projects, mistakes, and feedback.</p>
<h2 id="but-but-here-are-my-reasons-for-_____">But, butâ€¦ here are my reasons for _____</h2>
<p>I often get pushback when I suggest doing a personal project instead of another MOOC, Kaggle, or further education. Hereâ€™s how some conversations go:</p>
<p><strong>â€œIâ€™m very time-constrained and donâ€™t have time for a personal project. MOOCs are self-contained and need only 2-4 hours a weekâ€�</strong></p>
<p>Yes, MOOCs are great return on time-invested for getting up to speed on a subject. But past a certain threshold of knowledge and understanding, youâ€™re going to need hands-on practice to take your learning further. AFAIK, projects are the best way to do this.</p>
<p><strong>â€�I tried doing a personal project in the past. But I got a lot of errors and had to google a lotâ€”I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m ready for them until I do more MOOCs.â€�</strong></p>
<p>Getting errors and googling for help is perfectly normal! Even the instructors who created those MOOCs do that too. Thatâ€™s how we learnâ€”by trying, failing, and overcoming.</p>
<p><strong>â€�Personal projects are too difficult. Taking an MOOC is easier.â€�</strong></p>
<p>Thatâ€™s exactly why you need to do a personal project. The difficulty you experience is the learning curveâ€”without it, thereâ€™s no learning.</p>
<p>MOOCs <em>feel</em> easier because their tutorials and assignments are structured to follow the happy path. But this means youâ€™re deliberately steered away from the hairy issues that youâ€™ll face in the real world, unlike in a personal project.</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/mooc-jackie.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Why I can't serve ML models?!" alt="Why I can't serve ML models?!"></p>
<p><strong>â€�Doing that MOOC/Masters gives me a certificate that helps my resume.â€�</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps. Nonetheless, companies are placing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/15-companies-that-no-longer-require-employees-to-have-a-college-degree.html" target="_blank">less emphasis on educational qualifications</a>, even for technical roles. Recruiters and hiring managers are also becoming more open-minded. And in the end, from a hiring managerâ€™s perspective, what <em>really</em> counts is if you can do the work, not that cert.</p>
<p><strong>â€�The recruiter said I would be tested on technical skills and knowledge. Thus, I need to do more technical MOOCs.â€�</strong></p>
<p>To an extent, MOOCs and YouTube videos are helpful, especially for questions that test your knowledge (read: memory) or require you to know the trick (e.g., leetcode type questions).</p>
<p>However, for most interviews, youâ€™ll likely get more nebulous tasks, like designing a data pipeline, whiteboarding a machine learning API, or coding up a basic k-nearest neighbors or decision tree. These assess your ability to design and develop maintainable systems, think through edge cases, and adapt based on feedback. The hands-on practice from projects will be more helpful in such interviews</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/interview-board.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Lets just focus on the easy questions" alt="Lets just focus on the easy questions"></p>
<p><strong>â€�What personal project should I do?â€�</strong></p>
<p>Start with something youâ€™re interested in. If youâ€™re not intrinsically interested in it, you might find difficulty finishing.</p>
<p>Aim for something you can complete over the weekends in 12 weeks, ideally, 6 - 8 weeks. Any longer and it wonâ€™t seem urgent enough (and youâ€™ll lose momentum).</p>
<p><strong>â€�Iâ€™m familiar with web scraping/ruby/excel, can my personal project be about that?â€�</strong></p>
<p>Sure. Just start somewhere and evolve it along the way.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if youâ€™re doing a personal project to learn, youâ€™ll probably want to deliberately pick something new and unfamiliar. Or if youâ€™re doing a personal project to build your portfolio (and get a job), youâ€™ll want to look over the job requirements to make sure you address them.</p>
<p><strong>â€�But, I canâ€™t think of any interesting personal projects!â€�</strong></p>
<p>Look back on the classes and material youâ€™ve covered. Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll find something interesting that youâ€™ll want to dig deeper into.</p>
<p>This is also a good test of whether youâ€™re interested in a discipline. If you canâ€™t think of a personal project that interests you, do you <em>really</em> want it for a career? (And the answer might be yes, for various reasons such as compensation, prestige, etc.)</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/project-drake.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Do a personal project? Nah..." alt="Do a personal project? Nah..."></p>
<p><strong>â€�Other than personal projects, anything else you would recommend?â€�</strong></p>
<p>Nope. My <em>sole</em> recommendation is to start a personal project and learn whatever you need to complete it.</p>
<p>â€¢ â€¢ â€¢</p>
<p>In 2021, instead of taking that MOOC or watching another YouTube machine learning playlist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning-by-doing" target="_blank">learn by doing</a> instead.</p>
<p>Learning a programming language? Build an app, any app. Share it online and get feedback. Iterate and add new features. Learning a new machine learning technique? Find some novel data and apply it. Understand where it fails, where it shines, and how to adapt it for different data sets. Share your findings via writing online or at a meetup.</p>
<p>Learning comes from doing. Not watching videos, or reading textbooks. Start doing now.</p>

And often, those electric vehicles are being charged at home.</p>  <p>Most of the electricity generated by North American grids has some greenhouse gas emissions connected to it. So even if a car isn't belching carbon, it doesn't mean it's perfectly clean.</p>  <p>For instance, coal is about the dirtiest way to generate electricity to recharge a car battery. Powering an EV with electricity generated from coal is marginally better than burning gasoline in an internal-combustion engine, according to numbers compiled by Jennifer Dunn at Northwestern University's Center for Engineering Sustainability and Resilience.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5396097.1576270362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/ghg-emissions-by-vehicles.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5396097.1576270362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/ghg-emissions-by-vehicles.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5396097.1576270362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/ghg-emissions-by-vehicles.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5396097.1576270362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/ghg-emissions-by-vehicles.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5396097.1576270362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/ghg-emissions-by-vehicles.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5396097.1576270362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/ghg-emissions-by-vehicles.jpg"></p></div></figure></span></p>  <p>Most North American grids are composed of a mix of generating sources, from coal to hydro to nuclear, though Canada has pledged to eliminate coal-burning plants by 2030. When that mix is taken into account, charging a car generally creates less than half the carbon emissions compared to gasoline, according to Dunn.</p>  <p>It's only when electricity comes from clean, renewable sources like wind and solar that you see the most pronounced drop in EV emissions generated to power the car.</p>  <h2>Where does your battery come from?</h2>  <p>Before an electric vehicle even charges for the first time, however, one key part of its power system already has a significant carbon footprint.</p>  <p>"One really important aspect of an EV to think about is its battery," explains Dunn.</p>  <p>"For example, the material that helps power the battery is produced from a number of different metals, things like nickel and cobalt and lithium."</p>    <p>Mining and processing the minerals, plus the battery manufacturing process, involve substantial emissions of carbon.</p>  <p>Lithium mining, needed to build the lithium ion batteries at the heart of today's EVs, has also been connected to other kinds of environmental harm. There have been mass fish kills related to lithium mining in Tibet, for example. The freshwater supply is being consumed by mines in South America's lithium-rich region. Even in North America, where mining regulations are strict, harsh chemicals are used to extract the valuable metal.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5399271.1576601860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/rockwood-lithium-plant.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5399271.1576601860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/rockwood-lithium-plant.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5399271.1576601860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/rockwood-lithium-plant.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5399271.1576601860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/rockwood-lithium-plant.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5399271.1576601860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/rockwood-lithium-plant.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5399271.1576601860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/rockwood-lithium-plant.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>An aerial view of the brine pools and processing areas of the Rockwood lithium plant on the Atacama salt flat in northern Chile, the largest lithium deposit currently in production.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Ivan Alvarado/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>And all the operations are energy intensive, sometimes running on diesel generators and relying on carbon-emitting heavy machinery.</p>  <p>Adding to the cumulative effects on the environment, lithium demand is expected to at least triple by 2025, pushing more exploration and extraction globally.</p>  <h2>Second life for lithium-ion batteries&nbsp;</h2>  <p>And all that extracted raw material —&nbsp;once the batteries are worn out —&nbsp;will land somewhere.</p>  <p>It's something Andrew MacDonald at Maritime Autoparts in Debert, N.S., is thinking about.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Overview</h2><p>Accuracy is the most important characteristic of a speech recognition system. While AssemblyAI’s production end-to-end approach for speech recognition is able to provide better accuracy than other commercial grade speech recognition systems, improvements could still be made to achieve human performance. As part of our core research and development efforts to continue pushing the state of the art of speech recognition accuracy, in this post, we explore speech recognition architectures that are gaining new popularity in both research and industry settings.</p><h2>1. Introduction<br></h2><p>As we continue our core research and development efforts to push the boundaries of state of the art accuracy, we begin exploring architectures for end-to-end speech recognition that are gaining relative new popularity, not only in the research domain but also in production settings in industry ([1], [2]). We are specially interested in architectures that have shown production level accuracy matching or surpassing that of conventional hybrid DNN-HMM ([3], [4]) speech recognition systems. With that in mind, we survey the following two architectures: Listen Attend and Spell (LAS, [5]), and Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNNT, [6]).</p><p>We survey these new architectures from a production perspective. In section 2, we report on accuracy comparisons from some of the latest research done on both LAS and RNNT ([7], [8], [2]). We also do a comparison of these techniques against Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC, [9]) ([7], [1]), which is a more widely known end-to-end approach, and is what early versions of AssemblyAI’s <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/">speech recognition system</a> was based on. We also a look at recent research that combines RNNT and LAS into a single system ([8], [2]).</p><p>In section 3, keeping our focus on production grade speech recognition, we compare LAS and RNNT models from the perspective of feature parity. We focus on contextualization ([10], [1]), inverse text normalization ([11], [1], [8]), word timestamps, and the possibility of doing real time speech recognition ([1], [2]).</p><p>And we finish this post in section 4, with high level conclusions about our survey as well as next steps for future blog posts.</p><h2>2. Accuracy<br></h2><p>While human parity speech recognition accuracy has been reached for some research data sets ([12]), word error rates (WER) for industrial production grade applications in challenging acoustic environments is far from human level. One example of such domain is spontaneous telephone conversations, where, even in research datasets, human level parity has not yet been achieved ([13]).</p><p>We set our focus in this section on LAS and RNNT systems tested on production data, and not on research datasets. We avoid looking into research datasets as they are easily overfit by models that do not generalize well to real live audio signals. We want to keep our focus on datasets that contain challenging characteristics such as channel noise, compression, ambient noise, crosstalk, accents and speaker diversity.</p><h3>2.1 LAS vs RNNT<br></h3><p>When comparing accuracy of LAS and RNNT based architectures, the consensus seems to be that LAS has better accuracy than RNNT. [7] compares both LAS and RNNT models using 12500 hours of production voice-search traffic, artificially distorted by adding noise and by simulating room acoustics. WER is reported on both dictation as well as voice search utterances. Both LAS and RNNT use the same encoder neural network architecture and size. Their parameters however, are different and were initialized to those of a converged CTC trained network with the same encoder architecture. The decoders also have the same architecture, same number of layers, size and output the set of 26 lower case letters plus numerals, space and punctuation symbols. As a result, the only difference in terms of numbers of parameters lies in the RNNT joint network and the LAS attention mechanism. Neither the LAS nor the RNNT model use any sort of external language model. Table <a href="#">1</a> summarizes their results showing LAS performing better in general.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fbd459f3b05914cf70496d7/601023b3c2415b14faf3fee3_Screen%20Shot%202021-01-26%20at%208.13.59%20AM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Table 1:&nbsp;Accuracy of RNNT vs LAS</figcaption></figure><p>[8] also shows LAS performing better in general. They emphasize RNNT models lag in quality while LAS shows competitive performance when compared to hybrid DNN-HMM models ([11]). [8] also compares the WERs of LAS with RNNT. Similar to [7], the encoder and decoder networks are the same for both RNNT and LAS, differing only on the joint and attention networks. Both predict outputs from a set of 4096 word pieces. The training data used is the same for both models and consists of 30,000 hours of voice search training data, corrupted with added noise and room acoustics. The models are tested on two test sets: one made of utterances shorter than 5.5 seconds (Short Utts.) and another one made of utterances longer than 5.5 seconds (Long Utts.). Results showing LAS performing better can be seen in table 1. LAS shows degrading accuracy on long utterances, which is attributed to the attention mechanism as explained in [14].</p><p>While [2] does not explicitly compare the accuracy rates of LAS and RNNT models, they do mention, similar to [8], that under low latency constraints the accuracy of LAS outperforms conventional DNN-HMM models, while RNNT models do not.</p><h3>2.2 LAS and RNNT vs CTC<br></h3><p>Comparisons with <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/end-to-end-speech-recognition-pytorch">CTC based models</a> are not as simple as comparisons just between LAS and RNNT. The main reason being that a CTC model is highly dependent on the use of an external language model to have acceptable accuracy. LAS and RNNT models do not need an external language model due to the existence of a decoder component in the model.</p><p>[7] compares LAS, RNNT and CTC models without any external LM, where the encoder architecture and size is the same across all three models. CTC’s accuracy without any external LM, which is shown in table 2, is significantly lower than RNNT and LAS. The rest of the experimental details are the same as those described section 2.1.</p><p>[1] compares RNNT and CTC, but with significant differences in each architecture. The CTC model consists of 6 LSTM layers with each layer having 1200 cells and a 400 dimensional projection layer. The model outputs 42 phoneme targets through a softmax layer. Decoding is preformed with a 5gram first pass language model and a second pass LSTM LM rescoring model. The RNNT model’s encoder consists of 8 LSTM layers with 2048 cells each and a 640 dimensional projection layer. A time reduction layer of factor 2 is inserted after the second layer of the encoder. The prediction network has 2 LSTM layers each with 2048 cels and a 640 dimensional projection layer. The joint network has 640 hidden units. The output layer models 4096 word pieces. The size of the RNNT model is 120MB, while the size of the CTC model is 130MB.</p><p>[1] performs training with 27500 hours of voice search and dictation data, artificially corrupted to simulate room acoustics and noise. Table 2 shows the comparison between their CTC and RNNT models on both a voice search and a dictation test sets, showing the RNNT model being significantly better.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fbd459f3b05914cf70496d7/6010241853756e7b2a8e4771_Screen%20Shot%202021-01-26%20at%208.15.41%20AM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Table 2:&nbsp;Accuracy of RNNT and LAS&nbsp;vs CTC</figcaption></figure><h3>2.3 Combining LAS and RNNT<br></h3><p>While LAS is perceived as having better accuracy, RNNT models are perceived to have production quality features, such as streaming capabilities, that make them more desirable.</p><p>With the objective of bridging the accuracy gap between both architectures, [8] and [2] develop a combination of RNNT and LAS models. RNNT is used during first pass decoding, and LAS is used as a second pass rescoring model.</p><p>The experimental details of [8] with respect to separate RNNT and LAS models are described in section 2.1. The two pass experiments use the same architecture for both and LAS and RNNT. The number of parameters are the same as well but this time the encoder parameters are shared between them. Training is done in three steps. First an RNNT model is converged. Then the RNNT encoder is frozen and a LAS decoder is trained with it. Finally a combined loss is used to retrain both the RNNT and LAS models (with a shared encoder) together. Table <a href="#">3</a> shows the rescoring approach significantly improves the accuracy of the RNNT model. It also improves the LAS weakness with respect to longer utterances.</p><p>[2] also implements LAS rescoring on a second pass, where the first pass is an RNNT model. Besides using search data during training they also use data from multiple other domains (e.g.: far field, phone) and accented speech from countries other than the U.S. The number of hours used for training is not specified, but the model architecture details related to LAS rescoring are similar: A shared encoder is used between the RNNT model and the LAS model, and the LAS model is used to rescore hypotheses coming from the RNNT model. They add an additional LAS encoder layer in between the shared encoder and the LAS decoder. Table 3 shows that LAS rescoring significantly improves RNNT accuracy.</p><p>More importantly, table 3 shows the combination of RNNT and LAS beating a conventional HMM-RNN hybrid model. The acoustic model of the conventional model outputs context dependent phones, and uses a phonetic dictionary with close to 800,000 words. A 5-gram language model is used during first pass decoding and a MaxEnt language model is used for second pass rescoring. The total size of the conventional model is around 87 GBs. The RNNT+LASS model’s size is 0.18 GBs. The RNNT model has 120 million parameters and the LAS model (both the additional encoder and the decoder) have 57 million additional parameters. Parameters are quantized to be 8bit fixed point.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fbd459f3b05914cf70496d7/6010247b5c33d430166ed715_Screen%20Shot%202021-01-26%20at%208.17.06%20AM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Table 3:&nbsp;Accuracy of RNNT and&nbsp;LAS&nbsp;rescoring</figcaption></figure><h2>3. Feature Parity<br></h2><p>While accuracy is the most important characteristic of a speech recognition system, there are many other features that contribute to usability and cost. In this section we explore LAS and RNNT from the perspective of features such as contextualization, inverse text normalization, timestamps and real time speech recognition.<br></p><h3>3.1 Contextualization<br></h3><p>The words …</p></div></div>

<p>One morning a few weeks ago, we woke up to excited messages from friends telling us that our website, <a href="https://sidehustlestack.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Side Hustle Stack</a>, had appeared on their TikTok For You Page. That video led to hundreds of thousands of pageviews per minute, crashing our site in the middle of the night.</p>



<p>The surprise? We hadn’t actually created any content on TikTok. The flood of traffic was driven by a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@alexcazam/video/6907067263535320326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> created by <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@alexcazam/video/6907067263535320326?_d=secCgsIARCbDRgBIAMoARI%2BCjz16CzfQZDnuVFO5P7oyX%2FO2bJ%2B%2Fw2rH98MHZG%2BGs0HXlI0Yt%2BGo1ObeRVjkOnblekXA1asv%2BLYyKcVziwaAA%3D%3D&amp;language=en&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAtbN000KPBvmJn60GeGUqH5Hni4_Jv5RisXXmYGJyyK0MTquqlPHKwjhVpmKF90E_&amp;share_item_id=6907067263535320326&amp;share_link_id=21FDAEFA-F555-4AF7-9D01-B8425CA44C50&amp;timestamp=1608227611&amp;tt_from=sms&amp;u_code=dfa2fifm696gmf&amp;user_id=6890831503513994242&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=sms&amp;source=h5_m&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;sender_web_id=6899548486124635654&amp;is_from_webapp=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@alexcazam</a>, a 19 year-old college student that none of us knew, who had stumbled across the site. In the weeks afterwards, her TikTok has surpassed 5 million views.</p>



<p>Before this, we had tried other strategies for driving distribution—press outreach and launching on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/side-hustle-stack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Product Hunt</a> where we got over 600 upvotes—but none of these tactics came close to approaching the success of a single viral TikTok video.</p>



<p>We quickly realized: <strong><strong>businesses that figure out how to leverage TikTok will have an advantage in building brand awareness, cultivating user trust, and efficiently acquiring customers.</strong></strong></p>



<p>Since that day, our initial viral boost has led to a stable, high level of traffic to the site, and in parallel, we’ve gone down a rabbit hole to better understand how startups can best leverage TikTok. That includes surveying the <a href="https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1343699470358294528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitterverse</a>, diving deep and interviewing creators and brands, and creating an account of our own (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sidehustlestack?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@sidehustlestack</a>, which has grown to 14K followers in &lt;2 weeks).</p>



<p>The following is a summary of what we’ve learned so far. Note that while we this piece can help guide your TikTok strategy, it should be taken with a grain of salt: the platform is ever-evolving and requires constant experimentation. Our plan is to update these learnings on a continual basis.</p>



<h2>What are the best uses of TikTok for startups?</h2>



<p>Despite being best known for viral dances, lip sync videos, and other challenges popular among Gen Z, TikTok has exploded in mass appeal, and now counts a broad swath of the population in its exponentially growing user base. As of June 2020, TikTok had around 50 million daily active users and 92 million monthly active users in the US, up nearly 800% from January 2018. The average US user opens the app 8 times a day and spends 46 minutes per day on the app.</p>



<p>For startups, TikTok can be a goldmine for growth. The app is designed with a <a href="https://li.substack.com/p/building-the-middle-class-of-the">level playing field</a> that enables newcomers to quickly grow and go viral. Unlike more established social networks that reward users with already-accrued status, TikTok’s For You Page and personalization algorithm purposefully surfaces videos from even little-known accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Businesses of all sizes have seen success on TikTok. On one hand, there’s Netflix, which amassed 12 million followers in a little over a year by leaning into trends and creating entertaining highlights. Then there are small businesses like <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pouncecatcafe?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pounce Cat Cafe</a> which has made viral videos and cultivated a community on the platform, leading to over 1,700 cat adoptions.</p>



<p>There is no one-size-fits-all strategy for businesses looking to succeed on TikTok: anything from a low-effort iPhone clip to a fully staged and edited promotion can go viral. That makes it great for startups who are strapped for cash but can bring a lot of fun and passion. </p>



<p>There are a few areas where TikTok really excels for startups:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Building user trust and buy-in</strong></li><li><strong>Driving awareness of new products and services</strong></li><li><strong>Creating buzz around a category</strong></li><li><strong>Getting user feedback and creating a two-way dialogue</strong></li></ol>



<p>Let’s dive in to each:</p>



<h3>1. Building user trust and buy-in&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Because TikTok is video-based, it’s naturally conducive to storytelling and showcasing a more multifaceted narrative instead of simply shilling products. Brands can show off their authenticity in a more raw, unpolished way and promote trust with the audience. </p>



<p>Creators have told us that the less commercial-like and more word-of-mouth-like, the better. The best content feels like something your best friend might share with you.</p>



<p>For startups, there’s a built-in advantage for generating trust and buy-in on TikTok: most founders are truly passionate about what they’re building. Showing that authenticity, excitement, and passion can help make users feel bought into your success and want to support your journey.</p>



<p>Pre-launch, startups can create anticipation by talking about the context and story behind an idea. Companies can direct those fans to sign up for a mailing list or be added to a waitlist. When companies launch, there’s a built-in set of fans ready to evangelize a product.</p>



<p>New dating app <a href="https://monet.world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monet</a>’s beta launch on TikTok is a perfect example of generating user trust and creating hype. The launch video introduces users to the team behind the app and explains their journey, from first identifying the problem to building out a solution. There are fun, personal anecdotes: the team living together, going on hikes, and making dinner. Gen Z viewers come away excited by the product and rooting for the team’s success.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><figcaption><em><strong>Monet’s beta launch video on co-founder Joanna Shan’s personal account (</strong></em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@joanna.shan?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowZGu5wFeWdpLiXlNz79KgY%2B8L%2FWjJY7VAqOInxayeH8enBubowpHHmR22lais8%2FJuGgA%3D&amp;language=en&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAtbN000KPBvmJn60GeGUqH5Hni4_Jv5RisXXmYGJyyK0MTquqlPHKwjhVpmKF90E_&amp;share_item_id=6883220655790181638&amp;share_link_id=4BC4467C-6803-47CA-A5EB-3D196A3E6BE9&amp;timestamp=1609630388&amp;tt_from=copy&amp;u_code=dfa2fifm696gmf&amp;user_id=6890831503513994242&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=copy&amp;source=h5_m&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;sender_web_id=6899548486124635654&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>@joanna.shan</em></strong></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Subscription-splitting startup <a href="https://www.tabtabapp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TabTab</a> (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@victordanielcarde?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowjzoxpQDv7bI%2F0y72yWTNElljZT3kYk7cbn07afvx047Y%2BwnmgzQ3R2qB7PD2iOBdGgA%3D&amp;language=en&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAtbN000KPBvmJn60GeGUqH5Hni4_Jv5RisXXmYGJyyK0MTquqlPHKwjhVpmKF90E_&amp;share_item_id=6900817950551411974&amp;share_link_id=9C5AB4A4-7893-4876-B575-1BD4E3185BA8&amp;timestamp=1609631222&amp;tt_from=copy&amp;u_code=dfa2fifm696gmf&amp;user_id=6890831503513994242&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=copy&amp;source=h5_m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@victordanielcarde</a>) and friend-finding app <a href="https://www.flox.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flox</a> (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jamietylerlee?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowNLx7RH%2BJk5hafXlCBSq8cpSzUXPd%2FHXWkQ2DL6O9jI7pTosXlusUDUn2Fc5dgKSOGgA%3D&amp;language=en&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAtbN000KPBvmJn60GeGUqH5Hni4_Jv5RisXXmYGJyyK0MTquqlPHKwjhVpmKF90E_&amp;share_item_id=6905238996863962374&amp;share_link_id=84868AFD-D169-45FA-B597-7A103E0C7568&amp;timestamp=1609630632&amp;tt_from=copy&amp;u_code=dfa2fifm696gmf&amp;user_id=6890831503513994242&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=copy&amp;source=h5_m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@jamietylerlee</a>) have both found success by employing similar TikTok strategies as Monet.</p>



<figure><figcaption><strong><em>TabTab’s launch video on founder Victor Daniel Carden’s personal account.</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><strong><em>Flox’s waitlist launch video on founder Jamie Lee’s personal account.</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<h3>2. Driving awareness of new products and services</h3>



<p>From our own survey of 100+ Gen Zers, over half of TikTok users have downloaded an app or visited a website they discovered through the app, and more than one-third have purchased a product.</p>



<p>Companies can use TikTok to show off their products in a way that doesn’t feel overly commercial or transactional. Think: cool demo videos, product walk-throughs, tutorials, and other information that can be conveyed visually.</p>



<p>Consumer research suggests that more than 51% of consumers trust other posts by real people than those created by brands. TikTok benefits from built-in social proof, through comments, dueting, stitching, and other users creating videos about products. If other users are raving about how cool something is, users are more likely to trust it. </p>



<p>Ephemeral messaging app <a href="https://honk.me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Honk</a> (<a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZS7oxQvF/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@usehonk</a>) shows off their product in a way that speaks to the <a href="http://culture.affinitymagazine.us/the-isolation-absurdity-of-gen-z-humor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">absurdity</a> of Gen Z humor:&nbsp;full of non-sequiturs, Monke memes, and astrology.</p>



<p>Our takeaway? The more ridiculous and Gen Z the humor, the better.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><figcaption><strong><em>Honk’s Launch Video on TikTok received 1.2M views.</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>Breathing app <a href="https://www.breathwrk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breathwrk</a> (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@breathwrk?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Breathwrk</a>) makes their visual breathing exercises a part of the TikTok experience.&nbsp;The account, which has amassed over 1.5M followers and 18.6M likes, consistently interacts with users and creates content in response to comments.</p>



<figure><figcaption><strong><em>Breathwrk breathing exercise for migraines received 374K likes.</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>For an example of a brand leveraging TikTok to drive product purchases, take a look at <a href="https://aavia.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aavia</a>‘s (<a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZS7omoMu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@aavia.io</a>) account. By combining a trending sound and demos that show off the coolest features, their videos get consistently high viewership.</p>



<figure><figcaption><strong><em>Aavia’s product demo received 1.3M views.</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>Though virality on TikTok may be short-lived, it’s often accompanied by significant follower growth, which, over time, translates to more viral videos. And while consistently posting new content is key, the best TikToks are evergreen and can continue to attract viewers long after they were initially posted.</p>



<p>Remember: the people you’re reaching on TikTok will reflect the demographics of the app. That means consumer-friendly products are more well-suited to TikTok than, say, something related to enterprise apps (except for Notion, which seems to be having a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215782/tiktok-notion-enterprise-software-teen-studyblr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moment</a>).</p>



<h3>3. Creating buzz around a category</h3>



<p>TikTok’s algorithm surfaces content — however niche — that users may find interesting. That means it’s a great place to create buzz around an entire category or educate users regarding a certain topic. Once users are interested in your category, companies can suggest related products/services that users are likely to be interested in.</p>



<p>Users often refer to these niches as which “<a href="https://www.bustle.com/life/sides-of-tiktok" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">side</a>” of TikTok they are on — Alt TikTok, NostalgiaTok, FoodieTok, straight TikTok, BookTok, FrogTok, you name it. Scroll through the “How to Go Viral on TikTok” side (yes, it’s a category of its own!) and you’ll see countless mentions of the importance of finding your niche. Owning a niche and continuing to create content for it over time will translate into a base of educated users who are actively invested in that particular topic.</p>



<p>Some great creator-led business examples are <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@smallbusinesstips_?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@smallbusinesstips_ </a>and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pricelesstay?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@pricelesstay</a>, both of whom have cultivated and grown their audiences by refining their content to focus on niches like small business advice and Gen Z financial literacy, respectively.</p>



<p>Sneakerhead app <a href="https://getplugd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plugd</a>’s (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@get.plugd?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@get.plugd</a>) audience growth reflects their success in carving out a following among sneakerheads.&nbsp;By creating content around this category (like how to spot fake sneakers), they’ve used TikTok to drive top-of-funnel awareness before pushing users to the app itself.</p>



<figure><figcaption><strong><em>Plugd’s video helping users identify fake sneakers received 500K+ views.</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="http://copy.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CopyAI</a> (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@copy.ai?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@copy.ai</a>) has carved out a niche in the in the small business vertical, with consistent content about starting side hustles and ways that its product can make entrepreneurs’ lives easier.</p>



<figure><figcaption><strong><em>A recent CopyAI TikTok exploring e-commerce trends for 2021.</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<h3>4. Getting user feedback and creating a two-way dialogue</h3>



<p>Because discovery on TikTok is primarily driven through the For You Page, a video that gains traction is a clear indication that users have excitement for its content. That means creating content on TikTok is a great, lightweight way to test ideas: before even building out a product, startups can gauge reception to a concept via TikTok.</p>



<p>TikTok is also a treasure trove of user insights. The <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-comments-are-now-the-best-part-of-tiktok-78c624d51141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comments section</a> resembles no …</p></div></article></div>

These questions can range from simple customer support queries ("Does user X have the right plan?") to evaluating KPI's and growth metrics ("How many users signed up in the last month and what percent of those converted to paid?") to the more open-ended ("How much revenue will we have in 12 months?").</span></span></p><div id="block-3e9cd828f5334adda85fdbfb4b4cc69a"><div id="block-71f39a4ef039454287b8caa8e53eea89"><p><span><span>To make my job easier, I try to automate as many of these questions as I can. My company, </span><span><a href="https://seekwell.io/blog-gpt3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SeekWell</a></span><span>, builds awesome tools to help with this, like a unified team SQL repository and seamless scheduling of queries, reports, and alerts. Many things, though, like actually writing SQL code, are difficult to automateâ€”or at least have been. </span></span></p></div><div id="block-05f0094e96104a55b608aecb7c35791b"><div id="block-fd67e43c00754a16b725e54946093bb4"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/74a62dc5-b3f1-45ba-a090-36e1f21cd166.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div><h3 id="block-f0f41f92c9ed46f88da1c7319c105013"><span id="f0f41f92c9ed46f88da1c7319c105013"></span><span><span>Enter GPT-3</span></span></h3><p><span><span><a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Openai</a></span><span>'s </span><span><a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT-3</a></span><span> is starting to break the conventional wisdom of what tasks can and can't be automated. At the most basic level, GPT-3 is a text-completion engine, trained on huge swaths of the internet. It takes inputted text and returns the text that it thinks would appear next. Many have already used it to generate HTML and CSS </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code</a></span><span> from specific design instructions. Others have made </span><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1 trending blog posts</a></span><span> generated mostly by GPT-3 with some creative prompts.</span></span></p><p><span><span>In my case, since so much of my job is writing SQL, I want to be able to describe a question in plain English and have GPT-3 convert it into the SQL code that, if executed on my Postgres database, would answer the question. </span></span></p><p><span><span>To accomplish this, I found more success using </span><span><a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/the-instruct-series-beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT-3 Instruct</a></span><span> (still in beta) than the more generalized GPT-3 engines. GPT-3 Instruct (in particular,</span><span><a href="https://beta.openai.com/playground?model=davinci-instruct-beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> davinci-instruct</a></span><span>) lets you give specific instructions, like "Only respond in correct SQL syntax", that guides GPT-3's responses. If you're interested in trying it out, you can sign up for the waitlist for the GPT-3 API </span><span><a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1Lfc7WtPLRk2ppXhPjcYY-A4sk30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span><span>. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Below, I'll detail my experience with the API. In each example, I'll include a gif of asking GPT-3 a question. Below the gif will be the input question (generated by me, in green) and GPT-3's response translating it into SQL (generated by GPT-3, in blue). I'll also include my instructions to GPT-3 (in yellow) and examples I fed GPT-3 (in orange). </span></span></p><p><span><span>Here's the first instruction I gave it, a question, and the response from GPT-3:</span></span></p><div id="block-48ecab24b59a4404bae7f20fb8caf501"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/d99a5fe5-1ca9-43f2-a233-818d878160ac.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Instruction:</strong></span><span> Given an input question, respond with syntactically correct PostgreSQL. Be creative but the SQL must be correct.</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how many users signed up in the past month?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response: </strong></span><span>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users
WHERE signup_time &gt; now() - interval '1 month'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Woah. I never gave it my database schema but it assumes I have a table called "users" (which is accurate) and that there's a timestamp field called "signup_time" for when a user signed up. Pretty logical. It also knew the correct way to subtract a month from today's date in PostgreSQL (now() - interval '1 month') without seeing an example. Pretty cool!</span></span></p><p><span><span>To give GPT-3 a little more context, I'll add information about my database schema to the instruction. My new Instruction: </span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Instruction:</strong></span><span> Given an input question, respond with syntactically correct PostgreSQL. Be creative but the SQL must be correct. Only use tables called "users" and "charges". The "users" table has columns: id (integer), signup_dt (timestamp), email (character varying), and plan_type (character varying). The "charges" table has columns: amount (bigint), user_id (integer), and charge_dt (timestamp).</span></span></p><p><span><span>Now I'll try asking another question, and see if GPT-3 can respond based on my actual database:</span></span></p><div id="block-a4da842d10ee45bdaee9837e612a0afb"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/85ecbb57-3212-4ebd-8d13-534d98573a64.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how much revenue did we have in the past 7 days?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT SUM(amount) FROM charges WHERE charge_dt &gt; now() - interval '7 days'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Nice. I gave it a little more information on the tables and columns in my database, and it correctly inferred that "amount" = "revenue" and knew to SUM() that amount for the past 7 days of charges to answer the question. Clearly, it already knows some basic SQL syntax, and can make inferences about what I mean.</span></span></p><h3 id="block-77e3952dbf77411c987d2139118a5c14"><span id="77e3952dbf77411c987d2139118a5c14"></span><span><span>Priming GPT-3 with examples</span></span></h3><p><span><span>I'll try another question but first it might make sense to explicitly tell GPT-3 the columns in my tables via a simple example. Examples are a great way to give GPT-3 context and flesh out subtleties that might not be obvious in just an instruction. I found this helpful for really hammering into it which columns and tables are eligible to use (GPT-3 sometimes likes to "invent" columns to make answering the question easier). Here are the examples I added to the prompt:</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> select all available columns from users table.
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT id, signup_dt, email, plan_type FROM users</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> select all available columns from charges table.
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT amount, user_id, and charge_dt FROM charges</span></span></p><p><span><span>Now with those examples fed to GPT-3, I'll ask another question:</span></span></p><div id="block-58c943723b154475bf698435c315d98d"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/b349a134-f123-4451-bee0-b1ab88b3a3dc.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> what was the largest payment amount made in the past 30 days?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT MAX(amount) FROM charges WHERE charge_dt &gt; NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'</span></span></p><p><span><span>It knew to use MAX(amount) to get the largest payment and set the date condition correctly without seeing an example on how to subtract a number of days from the current date. It's doing pretty well, but let's try something a little trickier now, using the same instruction and examples:</span></span></p><div id="block-1af088fb733248dc82c23d45d4f90707"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/bc58b0bf-c5ab-46c6-903c-989e2d5bd0c0.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> when did user with email </span><span><a href="mailto:brian@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brian@seekwell.io</a></span><span> make his last payment?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT MAX(charge_dt) FROM charges WHERE user_id = 1 AND email = 'brian@seekwell.io'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Okay, not </span><span><em>quite </em></span><span>right. The "charges" table doesn't have a column for email, so this query would fail. I also never said the user with email = "brian@seekwell.io" has user_id = 1â€”don't know where it got that idea from. To answer the question correctly, you would have to join the "charges" table with the "users" table since only "users" has an email column. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Since it's a big leap to know to join those tables on </span><span><a href="http://users.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.id</a></span><span> = charges.user_id (even if that seems perfectly logical to a human analyst), I'll give GPT-3 an example of a "join" so it has something to go off of:</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> when did jane</span><span><a href="mailto:mike@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@seekwell.io</a></span><span> make her first payment?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT MIN(charge_dt) as last_payment_dt from charges LEFT JOIN
users ON </span><span><a href="http://users.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.id</a></span><span> = charges.user_id
WHERE users.email = 'jane</span><span><a href="mailto:mike@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@seekwell.io</a></span><span>'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Now I'll try again:</span></span></p><div id="block-f72440390edc4af5a45a8c530582b236"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/a9502b6e-cadf-4c9f-bc2c-f52c6dfb1a15.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> when did user with email </span><span><a href="mailto:brian@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brian@seekwell.io</a></span><span> make his last payment?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT MAX(charge_dt) as last_payment_dt from charges LEFT JOIN users ON </span><span><a href="http://users.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.id</a></span><span> = charges.user_id WHERE users.email = '</span><span><a href="mailto:brian@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brian@seekwell.io</a></span><span>'</span></span></p><p><span><span>So maybe this made it a little </span><span><em>too </em></span><span>easy based on the example, but it correctly changed MIN() â†’ MAX() and replaced the email with the one I asked forâ€”so it wasn't a total gimme. Let's try another level of difficulty, but first, I'll add in a few more examples to provide more context and improve the responses. New examples:</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input: </strong></span><span>how many users signed up in the past 30 days?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE signup_dt &gt;= now() - interval '30 days'</span></span></p><p><span><span>I</span><span><strong>nput:</strong></span><span> when did user with email </span><span><a href="mailto:brian@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brian@seekwell.io</a></span><span> sign up?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT signup_dt FROM users WHERE email = 'brian@seekwell.io'</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how much revenue did we have in the past 7 days?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT SUM(amount) from charges WHERE charge_dt &gt;= now() - interval '7 days'</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how much revenue did we have from 10-01-20 through 11-15-20?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT SUM(case when charge_dt&gt;= '10-01-20'::date and charge_dt &lt; '11-15-20'::date then amount else 0 end) as revenue
FROM charges</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how much revenue have we had from users that signed up in the last 6 months?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT SUM(charges.amount) FROM users INNER JOIN
charges ON </span><span><a href="http://users.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.id</a></span><span> = charges.user_id
WHERE users.signup_dt&gt;= now() - interval '6 months'</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> when did user with email </span><span><a href="mailto:brian@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brian@seekwell.io</a></span><span> make his first payment?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT MIN(charge_dt) as last_payment_dt from users INNER JOIN
charges ON </span><span><a href="http://users.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.id</a></span><span> = charges.user_id
WHERE users.email = 'brian@seekwell.io'</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how many new users signed up in each of the last 2 months?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT sum(case when signup_dt&gt;= now() - interval '1 month' then 1 else 0 end) as signups_this_month,
sum(case when signup_dt&gt;= now() - interval '2 months' and signup_dt &lt; now() - interval '1 month'  then 1 else 0 end) as signups_last_month
FROM users</span></span></p><p><span><span>These examples give it some basic queries so it's more familiar with my database and the specific terms and concepts of my use case (like that a "paid user" means their plan_type="pro"). I also gave it a taste of some more advanced concepts like aggregating a metric (revenue) between 2 dates. Now I'll try something harder:</span></span></p><div id="block-6441ce9d88ce4930a612ba57661ab84d"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/7a7fdfbb-5a5e-40e3-8190-551be566af21.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><div id="block-18b369cf81324662a709ad4fbb328dda"><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how many payments has user with email </span><span><a href="mailto:joe@freshpizza.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joe@freshpizza.com</a></span><span> made?</span></span></p></div><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users INNER JOIN  charges ON </span><span><a href="http://users.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.id</a></span><span> = charges.user_id WHERE users.email = 'joe@freshpizza.com'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Cool! GPT-3 intuited that COUNT() was the appropriate expression here, knew to join the "users" with the "charges" table, and correctly set the email to the one that I asked about. Another question for GPT-3:</span></span></p><div id="block-ffa8bb2d8599471281fb42c295d51031"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/dc73f28b-a0c0-4ccd-9713-af5f77c72710.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span>I</span><span><strong>nput:</strong></span><span> how much revenue have we received from users with an email ending in '</span><span><a href="http://seekwell.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seekwell.io</a></span><span>' in the last 3 months?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT SUM(charges.amount) FROM users INNER JOIN charges ON </span><span><a href="http://users.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.id</a></span><span> = charges.user_id WHERE users.email LIKE '%</span><span><a href="http://seekwell.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seekwell.io</a></span><span>%' AND users.signup_dt&gt;= now() - interval '3 months'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Perfect! It knew that "email ending in seekwell.io" translated in SQL to "</span><span><a href="http://users.email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.email</a></span><span> LIKE '%seekwell.io%' " (even though it hadn't seen that before) and took the sum of all charges for users matching that condition.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>It’s 2021, and data fetching on the web still sucks. This is crazy!</p>
<p>If you’re building a web app at scale you have plenty of options for data management:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fetch</code>, <code>XMLHTTPRequest</code>, etc. (REST)</li>
<li><a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> (REST)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/falcor">Falcor</a> (REST)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client">Apollo</a> (GraphQL)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/relay">Relay</a> (GraphQL)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/protobufjs/protobuf.js">Protobuf</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node">gRPC</a></li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>But none of these do everything well. What do you need to do well to be a good data fetching library?</p>
<h2>Fetching Data</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency when fetching data</strong>. When your app fetches new data, the UI should automatically update everywhere that data is used.</li>
<li><strong>Request batching</strong>. When multiple requests are made at the same time, they should be combined into one request, when reasonable, to avoid hitting browser-imposed concurrency limits.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding network waterfalls</strong>. When fetching data for a component, you should make one request that includes data for all its descendents too, to avoid lots of network round trips. GraphQL solves this with fragments, but it’s still painful in modern clients (eg. Relay does this by requiring you  manually compose fragments up the React tree so they’re fetched together, then pass fragment pointers down the tree to tell Relay where to look for fetched data; it also requires a compilation step).</li>
<li><strong>UX when fetching data</strong>. It’s a big burden for engineers to have to manually add loading spinners and error states, and engineers often forget.</li>
<li><strong>Colocation</strong>. You should declare data dependencies close to where they’re used, ideally in the same file. Same principle as colocating CSS with your components.</li>
<li><strong>File size</strong>. You shouldn’t have to ship kilobytes of metadata describing your data schema to clients in order to fetch data.</li>
<li><strong>Type safety</strong>. Your code should know what type of data it got from the server.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong>. Updating your data model should be backwards-compatible; clients should be forwards-compatible.</li>
<li><strong>Realtime updates</strong>. Sometimes, you want data to be pushed, not pulled (eg. for things like notifications). But the APIs for pushing and pulling data are often different, both on the client and on the server.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Updating Data</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency when updating data</strong>. When you update a piece of data, your data fetching library should automatically refetch dependent data that will change after the request completes (eg. if you update <code>Person.FirstName</code>, <code>Person.FullName</code> should automatically be refetched).</li>
<li><strong>Optimistic updates</strong>. The UI should optimistically render the success state before a server response comes back, if there’s a high chance the request will succeed. This makes your UI feel snappy and fun to use. Today’s data fetching libraries make this a lot of manual work.</li>
<li><strong>Request queueing</strong>. Requests that depend on one another need to be queued; independent requests can be sent in parallel. Otherwise, network weather and server queuing can cause your client to end up in a state that’s inconsistent with the server.</li>
<li><strong>UX when updating data</strong>. Product engineers shouldn’t need to manually render loading spinners and success and error notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Durability when updating data</strong>. Exponential backoff for retrying idempotent requests and idempotence tokens for network failures; eager persistance to disk for client/server failures.</li>
<li><strong>Type safety</strong>. You shouldn’t be able to send invalid input to the server, for some definition of invalid.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong>. Updates to your mutation APIs should be backwards-compatible; clients should be forwards-compatible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>I think the reason this hasn’t been solved is it’s a hard problem that’s at the intersection of a bunch of fast-moving technologies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Programming languages (to infer what data depends on what)</li>
<li>Databases (client-side stores are small databases)</li>
<li>Server APIs and protocols (REST, GraphQL, RPC, etc.)</li>
<li><s>UI frameworks</s> (at this point, React has won)</li>
<li>User experience and perceived performance</li>
</ol>
<p>So far, every attempt at solving data fetching has either tightly coupled all of these layers, leading to trouble gaining mass adoption (think <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>); other solutions have tackled just one layer, ignoring the rest. This smells to me like the abstractions &amp; APIs for each layer are wrong: you shouldn’t need tight coupling to solve data fetching. Instead, you need better abstractions.</p>
<p>Is this a problem that can be solved?</p>

            <p>Over the past year I’ve used web technologies to create audio games like soundStrider and participate in numerous game jams.
With syngen I’m releasing my tools as open-source so folks can join me in crafting dynamic audio experiences and games for the web.
Continue reading to dive into its features, view example code, and learn more about its future.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>syngen is a game engine and synthesis toolkit that specializes in creating audio games with fully synthesized sounds.
If you’ve played any of my games before, then you might be familiar with its capabilities.</p>

<p>It provides a light wrapper around the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Web Audio API</a> with tools for building synths and positioning them as props on a three-dimensional binaural soundstage.
Its event loop fires each frame to update props and core systems.
Additional utilities provide tools for engineering custom systems that hook into its API to deliver rich experiences.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Wrapper for the Web Audio API with a domain-specific API</li>
  <li>Event-driven main loop and core systems</li>
  <li>Interfaces and utilities for building custom sounds and systems</li>
  <li>Binaural processing to position sounds on a realistic stage</li>
  <li>Virtualized mixer for advanced signal routing and mastering</li>
  <li>Built-in synthesizers, effects, and global reverb send</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>Please <a href="https://github.com/nicross/syngen" rel="noopener" target="_blank">clone the repository</a> or install with your favorite package manager:</p>



<p>The library <em>must</em> be used within a browser environment so it can access the <code>window</code> object.
You may <code>require('syngen')</code> as a UMD module, or include <code>dist/syngen.min.js</code> to assign it to the <code>syngen</code> global.</p>

<h3 id="example-usage">Example usage</h3>
<p>This example demonstrates how to define a prop and instantiate one on the soundstage.
Here you’ll hear a relatively loud sine tone playing Middle C, centered in the stereo field:</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="the-future-of-syngen">The future of syngen</h2>
<p>This initial release reflects a year of learning with game development.
It contains some assumptions and vestiges that have remained since I first started this journey.
For this reason it’s been released as version 0.1.0 to indicate that it’s experimental and to be used at your own risk in production.
Hopefully the examples above demonstrate the rewards of that gamble.</p>

<p>Because I have games in production on this release branch, it needs to remain backwards compatible.
Therefore, minor version bumps and patch releases will only contain new features and bug fixes.
If it ever reaches the 1.0.0 milestone, then that will indicate a stabilization of this current API.</p>

<p>What I would like to do in a 2.0.0 release branch is reflect on my previous assumptions to rework it entirely.
This might include simplifications and optimizations that improve its power and usability.
Ideally it would empower me to build a new generation of audio games beyond what I’ve thought possible and learned this past year.</p>

<p>Please reach out or <a href="https://github.com/nicross/syngen/issues" rel="noopener" target="_blank">create an issue on GitHub</a> if you encounter any bugs or have any questions or projects to share.
I’m excited to hear your creations!</p>

            <section>
                <div><p>I've been using React since 2016. React has changed a lot since then, but the fundamentals have stayed the same.</p>
<p>In the last couple of years, the <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a> team and I have settled on a way to structure our components.</p>
<p>The goal is to make understanding components easier.</p>
<p>Every component should provide quick answers to the following questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the props this component needs?</li>
<li>What does this component do?</li>
<li>What are the component's states?</li>
<li>What is the component's logic?</li>
<li>How can we trace the logic?</li>
<li>Is it easy to refactor?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="componentasdirectory">Component as directory</h2>
<p>Components are encapsulated in directories that contain their individual parts.</p>
<p>The only public thing there is the main <code>index</code> file.<br>
Everything else is considered private.</p>
<p>Here is what the component directory looks like:</p>
<pre><code>~/components/[Component]/index.tsx                // default export is the used component
~/components/[Component]/Fragment.graphql         // GraphQL fragment for the component
~/components/[Component]/Mutation.graphql         // GraphQL mutation for the component
~/components/[Component]/styles.module.css        // css-module, with styles for the component
~/components/[Component]/[icon].svg               // icon asset
~/components/[Component]/utils.ts                 // helper functions/classes for the component
~/components/[Component]/utils.test.ts            // tests for helper functions/classes
~/components/[Component]/[SubComponent]/index.tsx // when this component is complex, it's might
~/components/[Component]/[SubComponent]/...       // be split it into multiple components
~/components/[Component]/[SubComponent]/...       // they are private and shouldn't be imported
~/components/[Component]/[SubComponent]/...       //  from outside its parent component
</code></pre>
<h2 id="component">Component</h2>
<p>Every component we have, has an entry point like the following:</p>
<pre><code>// components/Component/index.js

// 1) Component props
// always name this "IProps"
// this makes it easy to quickly see the expected props for this component
interface IProps {
  // ...
};

// 2) Main component export
// immediately after, put the component name since this is what this package is all about
// use default function values for default props
export default function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 = 'default value' }: IProps) {
  // component is structured by
  // 2.1) Hooks
  // if this is more than 5 lines, a custom hook is extracted
  // more about this - https://blog.rstankov.com/extract-react-hook-refactoring/

  // 2.2) Guard clauses
  if (someCondition) {
    return null;
  } 

  if (someOtherCondiation) {
    return &lt;SamePlaholder /&gt;
  }

  // 2.3) The happy path of the component
	return &lt;div&gt;My component&lt;/div&gt;;
}

// 3) Everything else...
// Here's where the smaller helper hooks, utils, and components live.
// If those get bigger, they can be moved into separate files in the component directory
</code></pre>
<p>This structure makes it very easy to scan component and find what you are looking for.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This structure has served us well, and its fundamentals have stayed the same when migrating from classes to hooks, from flow type to TypeScript, and so.</p>

<p>All the things that can happen to databases, corruption is not the one that happens frequently, but when it does it can result in major downtime and data loss. Probably it is one of the most terrifying things for a DBA to come across and the best way to deal with it is to not even deal with it in the first place.</p>







<p>Database corruption can be defined as a problem associated with unintended modification of original data or improper storage of actual data. It is referred to error in database that happens during reading, writing, storing or processing of unintended changes to original data.   </p>



<p>The symptoms of the corrupted database can range from getting a WARNING message in a log file to database server crashing and refusing to startup.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I will try to list some administrative measures and best practices that we can follow to avoid the PostgreSQL database from getting corrupt in the first place and the subsequent post will talk about the options we have to recover from a corrupted database.</p>







<p>PostgreSQL databases, or for that matter any database can get corrupted for a variety of reasons, Some of those are avoidable while others can be mitigated. There are three main causes of database corruption that ranges from bad hardware/software, misconfigurations, and user errors.</p>



<h2>Bad Hardware</h2>



<p>Bad hardware is one of the top causes of database corruption. Most commonly it’s the bad-disk and rarely the culprit turns out to be a bad memory. When it’s a problematic hard disk and the data that we previously wrote is no more there or becomes different. More often it results in a database crash and sometimes gives other symptoms as well.</p>



<p>While bad-memory is very unusual but not impossible. When that happens the data gets corrupted even before it gets written to the disk and eventually corrupted data gets stored on the disk and it usually gives similar symptoms as corrupted disks.</p>



<h2>Bad Software</h2>



<p>The second big cause of database corruption is bad software. All software has bugs and there are lots of software that needs to work perfectly to produce and store the correct data.  It is possible that data corruption can trace back to a software bug. It could be a bug in the PostgreSQL server itself, or the operating system, or a filesystem. For example, <code>zfs</code> on Linux is known to have data corruption bugs.</p>



<h2>Misconfigurations and User errors</h2>



<p>Out of all the known causes of data corruption, the most common one is the user errors and misconfigurations. There are several things that we can do wrong which can result in database corruption and this category of database corruption can be easily avoided by following best practices.</p>



<h2>Symptoms of a corrupted database</h2>



<p>Corruption by its nature is one of a thing, there exists no specific error that gets thrown by PostgreSQL when the database becomes corrupted. So you need to carefully lookout for the signs to detect it. Sometimes the data corruption problems are easily identifiable while other times they can go on undetected till they drive us crazy.</p>



<p>Some of the problems that can give the hint of database corruption are.</p>



<h3>Unexpected Query Results</h3>



<ul><li>The user inserted a data in table and subsequent select on table returned altogether a different/invalid result. </li><li>User who executes a particular query, part of his regular workflow suddenly notices an unexpected reduction in the number of rows. </li><li>Query that was working fine now went into infinite loop. </li></ul>



<p>These kinds of problems hint at database corruption. Obviously, there could be other reasons but if the investigation on these unexpected results turns out to be a problem with the contents of the actual data stored in the file rather than some bug or user action, only then it is database corruption.</p>



<h3>Start getting deleted or duplicate rows.</h3>



<p>If you notice that SQL queries started returning deleted or duplicated rows, rows from the rollbacked transactions, then this could be a database corruption and needs immediate attention,</p>



<h3>System crashes attempting to read data</h3>



<p>Process crashes while trying to read data could be caused by a variety of reasons including the corrupted database.</p>



<h3>Hints of corruption in log messages</h3>



<p>Be vigilant about Error messages that complain about internal things rather than user-visible things. <br>For example: below are some error messages that give the hint of database corruption&nbsp;</p>



<pre><span>ERROR:&nbsp; could <strong>not</strong> <strong>read</strong> block 274179 in file "base/13642/24643.2": <strong>read</strong> only 0 of 8192 bytes

ERROR:&nbsp; could not access status of transaction 3250922107
DETAIL:&nbsp; Could not open file "pg_xact/0C1C": No such file or directory.

ERROR: failed to re-find parent key in index "pg_attribute_relid_attnum_index" for split pages 6424/6425&nbsp;

PANIC could not locate a valid checkpoint record

ERROR:&nbsp; found multixact 68834765 from before relminmxid 73262006

Error:&nbsp; failed to re-find parent key in the index "xxx" for split pages yyy/zzz

ERROR:&nbsp; cache lookup failed for type 16292881

PANIC could not locate a valid checkpoint record</span></pre>







<p>So let’s now discuss how we can avoid or at least quickly detect database corruption.</p>



<h2>Backup and Restore</h2>



<h3>Take regular backups.</h3>



<p>The first and foremost practice you need to follow is to take regular backups. Taking a backup serves two purposes. First, it gives us a copy of data that we can use for disaster recovery, secondly successful backup means that all of your data is readable. Which is the first checkpoint in maintaining that the database is not corrupted.</p>



<h3>Test by restoring the backup.</h3>



<p>The backup that is not restorable is not a backup. So it is important to test each backup by restoring it and starting the server on the restored backup and verifying the contents. It may not be possible to verify every single byte of the restored database but you can write or use some script that can do the sanity checking of the restored database.</p>



<h2>Configurations</h2>



<p>There are three database settings that are important for preventing the database corruption.</p>



<h3>Use fsync=on</h3>



<p><code>fsync</code> ensures that all data is flushed to the disk so that all changed information can be retrieved even if the system crashes or is rebooted. Although you may feel a slight performance impact of keeping the <code>fsync=on</code> but turning it off would mean it is highly likely that you will get a corrupted database in case of an operating system crash.</p>



<h3>Use full_page_writes = on</h3>



<p>In theory, if the operating system’s filesystem cache uses the 8k or larger chunk size then we don’t require a full_page_write to be turned on. But practically we can end up in situations where we get a partial page written to disk in an event of a system crash or power failure. So it is highly recommended to keep the <code>full_page_writes</code> to guard against data corruption.</p>



<h3>Figure out the right value for <code>wal_sync_method</code></h3>



<p>Wal_sync_method has multiple options to choose from. The default is not necessarily ideal; it might be necessary to change this setting or other aspects of your system configuration in order to create a crash-safe configuration or achieve optimal performance. Refer to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-reliability.html">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-reliability.html</a> for selecting the correct value for the parameter for your operating system and also check <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtestfsync.html">pg_test_fsync</a>  output to try out the configured value (hint: The correct method would not be the fastest one)</p>



<h3>Use checksum enabled</h3>



<p>You want to detect corruption as early as possible to ensure that you have the best chance of fixing it and stop it from spreading. So it is highly recommended to use checksums since in case of data corruption the checksum fails and you will get an error straight away.</p>



<p>To enable checksums you need to do <code>initdb</code> with -k switch and from PG 12 onwards you can use the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/app-pgchecksums.html">pg_checksums</a> -e to enable the checksums on the existing data directory. </p>



<h2>Storage</h2>



<p>The next area of best practices is to choose a good storage system and filesystem. For example, relying on a single disk and hoping it will never get failed is not a wise option. So using <code>RAID</code> is a good practice. Similarly, exercise caution when selecting the filesystem, there are filesystems that have known data corruption problems, avoid using those. <code>Ext4</code> and <code>xfs</code> on Linux are known to be more reliable than other filesystems. So double-check all your storage and filesystem selections.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Administration</h2>



<p>Finally lets go through some of the DOs and DON’Ts to avoid the data corruption&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Plug-pull test your system</h3>



<p>Before going live Plug-pull test your system. Put it under load with something like, <code>pgbench</code>, then literally pull the power plug out, so your server loses power and shuts down uncleanly. If your database doesn’t come back up fine you have hardware, OS, or configuration problems. Do this repeatedly while under load, until you’re confident it’ll come up reliably.</p>



<h3>Never Modify the data files manually</h3>



<p>Everything in the PostgreSQL data directory is absolutely vital and should never be messed with directly. So except for conf files, it’s not wise to directly modify any file part of the data directory.</p>



<h3>Do not delete postmaster.pid</h3>



<p>Deleting the <code>postmaster.pid</code> file can allow multiple servers to run on the same data directory. And this is the quickest recipe for getting a corrupt database.</p>



<h3>Do not run Antivirus on the Data directory</h3>



<p>Antivirus can modify or delete files and that is absolutely not recommended to delete/modify any PostgreSQL data files. So it’s best to avoid running antivirus software on the system that is hosting the PostgreSQL database.</p>



<h3>Avoid Kill-9 any PostgreSQL process</h3>



<p><code>kill -9</code> is not smart and should be the last resort; first, use <code>pg_cancel_backend</code> then <code>pg_terminate_backend</code> before thinking about kill -9</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The post lists some DOs and DON’Ts for avoiding data corruption and talks about the causes and symptoms of the database corruption. In the second part, I will discuss the possible ways to recover from the corruption …</p></div></div>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>In this web essay I present research on dynamically injecting realtime annotations and visualizations into a programming environment for live coding performance. The techniques I describe enable both performers and audiences to gain greater insight into discrete events, continuous signals, and the algorithmic transformation of musical pattern. I catalog these techniques and encourage readers to interactively experiment with each of them, and conclude by describing challenges and future directions for this line of research.</p>
      </section>

			<section id="Introduction">
        <p><em>NOTE: The examples in this essay currently only work in Chrome, and even then not in iOS. I'm working on it!</em></p>

				<h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This web essay will explore the addition of annotations and visualizations to custom-developed programming environments for <a href="http://toplap.org/about">live coding performance</a>; in this essay I will use the term 'live coding' to refer to the digital arts practice, as opposed to live programming more generally.  I provide a catalogue of techniques I've developed to help reveal algorithmic activity to both audience members and programmer/performers. These techniques are implemented in standard JavaScript, which is also the end-user language; however, many are generalizable and some have drawn inspiration from features found in programming environments for other languages. The code examples below are <em>live</em>; feel free to make minor edits and view / listen to the resulting changes. In addition to pressing the 'Play' button, which selects all code in a given example and runs it, you can also highlight code you'd like to execute and hit Ctrl+Enter.</p>

        <p>Before diving in, I'd like to provide an example of what many of these annotations look like when combined, as shown in Listing 1. Although they might be somewhat overwhelming when simultaneously viewed, in my experience they can provide valuable scaffolding to the development of a program as it is written over time.</p>

			<section id="Motivation">
				<h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>The initial motivation for this research was to improve audience understanding of live coding performances, where source code is written on stage and often projected for the audience to follow. However, over time the feedback provided by the annotations and visualizations described also became important to my personal performance practice [<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14794713.2016.1227602?journalCode=rpdm20">7</a>]. The feedback provides important indications of activity, and a quick way to visually confirm that algorithms are proceeding as intended. A survey I conducted with over a hundred live coders and computer scientists indicated a high level of interest in the types of annotations presented here [<a href="http://www.charlie-roberts.com/pubs/gibber.annotations.pdf" target="_blank">1</a>].</p>

        <p>Although parts of this research have been previously presented to the digital arts community, my goal in describing it to the LIVE community is to obtain feedback from a broader community of computer scientists with interests in the psychology of programming and in novel techniques for interactive programming environments. There are also a number of new techniques presented in this essay for the first time. Finally, I believe that the web essay format is fundamentally the best vehicle for presenting this research, as the animated/temporal characteristics of the annotations and visualizations are difficult to convey in static text and images, such as in the papers I have previously published on the subject.</p>

        <p>Outside of informal, high-level descriptions, I do not explain the code or APIs used in the examples. The focus is instead on how algorithms are annotated / visualized, and I provide only the minimal explanation necessary to understand our design decisions in this regard. While my research to date has focused on implementation and evaluation in the context of our personal artistic practice, I look forward to more formal user evaluations in the future, and are particuarly interested in implications for teaching computational media.</p> 
			</section>


      <section id="Principles">
      <h3>Guiding principles</h3>
      <p>There are three principles that guide the design of the presented annotations and visualizations.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>If a value changes over time (typically related to musical progression or signal processing), display its current state, either by adding a visualization / annotation  or by modifying the source code to reflect the current value.</li>
        <li>Make annotations and visualizations as proximal as possible to the code fragment responsible for generating the data they are representing.</li>
        <li>In addition to displaying when values change, whenever possible also provide some indication of when a value is being <em>read</em>, in particular when there is a direct affect on musical / sonic output.
      </li></ol>

      <p>The first principle is fundamentally constrained by screen real estate; therefore, only the current state of variables found in code within the editing environment's current viewport is actively displayed. However, this is still very different from environments where time-varying variables must be explicitly 'watched' by the programmer. By displaying all updates concurrently, audience members can choose the algorithms they'd like to watch develop, and the time programmer/performers must spend on user interactions for viewing state is minimized.</p>

      <p>In regards to the second principle, the types of data that can be easily represented inside of an editing environment constrain annotations and visualizations. It is easy to display short sequences of musical data outputted by a generative algorithm inside of the editor; it is more difficult to display sequences that are thousands of values in length. While I can readily imagine use cases where longer sequences are musically useful, in the environments I work on shorter sequences are more common during typical use.</p>

      <p>With these three principles in mind, the next section describes a variety of annotations and visualization that I, and other users, have found useful in the context of live coding performances.</p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Catalog of techniques</h3>
        <p>This research augments programming interfaces to include visualizations, self-modifying source code, automated annotations via inserted code comments, and a variety of other techniques. By injecting annotations and visualizations into the source code itself, we improve association between code and the annotations / visualizations depicting its effects. This placement of visualizations is characterized as <em>in situ</em> by Hofswell et. al, [<a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jhoffs/website/resources/papers/2018-AugmentingCode-CHI.pdf" target="_blank">2</a>], who demonstrated the effectiveness of such visualizations in improving both speed and accuracy when completing tasks related to data visualization and code comprehension.</p> 

        <h4>Repeating static values</h4>
        <p>The simplest annotation added to our environment is a rotating border around static elements that are accessed repeatedly. The rotation provides a visual indication of when the values are used. Survey results indicated that rotation was preferable to other techniques (such as flashing) due to its less distracting nature [<a href="http://www.charlie-roberts.com/pubs/gibber.annotations.pdf" target="_blank">1</a>].</p>
        
        <p>Listing 2 shows a repeated scale index (0) being triggered every quarter note. We'll see how this simple annotation can be useful in combination with others in the next section.</p>

        <div id="static1" caption="Listing 2: Rotating borders indicating actvity.">
          <p>
syn = Synth('bleep')
syn.note.seq( 0, 1/4 )
          </p> 
        </div>

        <p>It is worth noting that 'distracting' flashes can also be used to great effect; in the live-coding environment SchemeBricks by Dave Griffith blocks flash whenever they receive a control signal, providing an indication of activity with greater spectacle.</p>

      <section>
        <h4>Cycling through musical patterns</h4>
        <p>Musical patterns (aka sets) are common ways of expressing lists that can be transformed and manipulated algorithmically.
        However, even if a pattern is read from start to finish without modification, it can still be useful to know which elements of
        the pattern are being triggered when, so that programmers and audience members can associate the the values being triggered with
        the corresponding sonic results.</p>

        <p>In Listing 3, a synthesizer plays a simple pattern that loops through the seven notes of a standard scale from Western harmony. In addition to this melodic pattern, a rhythmic pattern alternates between quarter notes and eighth notes in duration.</p>

        <div id="array1" caption="Listing 3: Revealing the phase of musical patterns.">
          <p>
syn = Synth('bleep')
syn.note.seq( [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7], [1/4,1/8] )
          </p> 
        </div>

        <p>The potential of this method is more apparent when the pattern is not playing sequentially. In Listing 4, scale indices are randomly chosen. Also note that the rotating border annotation now provides a indication of how many times a randomly chosen value has been repeated in a row (modulo 4). </p>

        <div id="array2" caption="Listing 4: Highlighting randomly selected members of patterns.">
          <p>
syn = Synth('bleep')
syn.note.seq( [0,3,7].rnd(), 1/8 )
          </p> 
        </div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p>Every so often I get asked for advice on how to become an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/">AWS Hero</a>.</p><p>The specific answer isn’t that interesting – “get involved in the community and hope someone nominates you as a Hero” seems to be the process at AWS. I understand that the <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/overview">Microsoft MVP process</a> is a bit more transparent and better prescribed.</p><p>But the general question of “how do I become well-respected in my chosen technical specialty” is VERY interesting. Even if you don’t have any aspirations to build a public following, there is tremendous career value in becoming the go-to person within your technical niche.</p><p>The person who everybody on your team comes to with their toughest question about that language or framework. The person who knows where all the bodies are buried in ActiveDirectory or Typescript or DynamoDB. Those folks have great careers and job security because authoritative knowledge like that is rare.</p><p>To some extent, it’s rare because wisdom only comes with experience. But I know plenty of engineers who’ve sat in the same chair for ten years getting the same year of experience ten times. Heck, I’ve been there myself; I spent a couple of years as an “accidental DBA” who never really learned that much about SQL Server beyond what the daily firefighting required.</p><p>I used to spend a lot of time wondering how other people seemed to level up so quickly on new technologies. How do you break through that stagnant cycle of learning and forgetting stuff in bits and pieces, using the same technology for years without ever feeling like an expert?</p><p>A few years ago I learned a secret for doing this, a cheat code if you will, from my fellow AWS Hero <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/author/jared-short">Jared Short</a>. This is his secret recipe for leveling up in tech:</p><p><strong>Read the documentation for one job-relevant technology, cover-to-cover, every week. </strong></p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Forrest is giving away my secrets, but it's true. I'd estimate around 700+ hours of just reading AWS docs over my career with intent to retain / learn (not just reference). It feels silly until you almost immediately understand some esoteric side-effect or behavior. <a href="https://t.co/juQ0b9mENI">https://t.co/juQ0b9mENI</a></p>— Jared Short (@ShortJared) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShortJared/status/1347629518312378369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div></figure><h2 id="h-reading-docs-the-wrong-way-and-the-right-way">Reading docs: the wrong way and the right way</h2><p>I get it, that doesn’t sound revolutionary. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM">RTFM</a>” is literally as old as computing itself. It’s the classic kiss-off answer to questions you ought to be able to Google.</p><p>And that betrays a key limitation in how a lot of us think about documentation. We think of it tactically, as a resource to query when we have a specific question or encounter a particular error. We use docs to fill in our <em>known unknowns.</em></p><p>That’s how you can get stuck for years, say, administering a PostgresSQL cluster and never really becoming that deep of an expert on Postgres. If you only learn something new when the situation demands it, your mental model of Postgres (or whatever) will look like a gradually expanding version of this:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2181" height="1647" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 2181w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 1024w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 768w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 1536w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2181px) 100vw, 2181px"></figure><p>Over time, as you encounter more new use cases for the technology, you’ll burn more “never forget” bubbles into the mental model. But you’ll still have this heavy sense of unknown unknowns hanging over you, and you’ll never be sure if you’re really using the optimal approach to solve a new problem.</p><p>Instead, Jared’s approach is to read docs strategically<em>, </em>preemptively, curiously: as a way to fill in your <em>unknown unknowns</em>. The things you might not encounter in ten years, but that would cost you two days of troubleshooting if you ran into them tomorrow.</p><p>Read docs like novels (cover to cover), not like dictionaries (look up the term, cross-reference, and stop). Over time, that strategy will lead to a mental model of your professional domain that looks more like this:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="727" height="549" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/strategic.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/strategic.png 727w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/strategic.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px"></figure><p>(This is <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/how-many-certifications-do-i-need-to-get-a-cloud-job">the same benefit</a> you get from studying for certifications, by the way: you’re building a mental map of the domain, so you don’t have to stumble through the darkness on every new quest.)</p><p>On the surface, that sounds simple, but it’s far from easy. Here are three common objections people raise when I advise reading docs as a career-advancement strategy:</p><h4 id="h-i-don-t-have-a-photographic-memory-i-ll-never-remember-a-bunch-of-random-docs"><strong>“I don’t have a photographic memory. I’ll never remember a bunch of random docs.”</strong></h4><p>Back when I was in college, a well-meaning friend convinced me I should read a book on SAP. Forget today — I couldn’t have told you a single thing about SAP <em>ten minutes after finishing that book</em>. I’d never been inside an enterprise, much less understood the problems these ERP integrations I was reading about were supposed to solve. It was like trying to talk to the aliens in the movie <em>Arrival</em>: my brain was the wrong shape.</p><p>Likewise, you probably won’t get much value out of glancing through docs for a technology you don’t use and have no context for.</p><p>So do these two things:</p><p>1. <strong>Focus on docs for technologies you are already using</strong>. We’ve all had that mind-numbing feeling when plowing through some esoteric text that doesn’t relate to our daily lives, where you glaze over for three pages and then go, “what did I just read?”</p><p>Avoid this by focusing on docs for technologies or languages you’ve already got a vested stake in – say, because they’re on your plate at work or you’re trying to build them into a side project.</p><p>Encourage active reading and engagement with the information by asking yourself questions like these as you read:</p><ul id="block-ef7bb5e0-252c-434f-98de-116c8c0e2003"><li>Did I understand that? (If not, maybe read the section again)</li><li>Does what I just read match my existing mental model of how this technology works? (If not, do I need to go review a different doc and then come back to this?)</li><li>Could this feature or fact help me on my current project?</li><li>If I had known this six months ago, what would I have done differently? (“Chosen a different technology” is a totally acceptable answer!)</li></ul><p>Then, <strong>2. Read those docs repeatedly, on a schedule, over and over</strong>. Seriously. If you’re on a team that’s building out centralized CI/CD for Azure, maybe read the part of the Azure DevOps docs on pipelines this week and the part on build agents next week, and when you get to the end, start over. The cloud changes fast. You’ll fold in new information at the same time you’re reinforcing the old.</p><h4 id="h-i-don-t-have-time-to-read-a-bunch-of-documentation"><strong>“I don’t have time to read a bunch of documentation.”</strong></h4><p>Yes, and weeks of work can save you hours of planning. Maybe use some of the time you currently spend injecting “HERE” print statements into your code to figure out why it’s not working.</p><figure><img src="https://faasandfurious.com/pages/debugging-tactics.png" alt="Debugging Tactics"></figure><p>More seriously, it’s not a bad idea to block a bit of time on your calendar each day – 30 minutes, even –  for targeted doc-reading. You may find it hard to carve that time out of your workday, but defending time and setting expectations with your manager is its own skill, worth practicing. Call the block of time “deep work.” It is.</p><h4 id="h-the-docs-for-technology-x-are-no-good-trust-me-they-re-not-worth-reading"><strong>“The docs for [technology X] are no good. Trust me, they’re not worth reading.”</strong></h4><p>I don’t always buy this excuse. The docs might not be that bad; you might just have the wrong expectations.</p><p>For example, the AWS documentation gets <a href="https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1347737875991777280">a terrible rap</a> for being wordy and poorly-organized. And it’s maybe even worse than you’ve heard – if you’re trying to look up the name of an IAM action or the syntax of a CLI command, that is.</p><p>But as an educational tool that dives deep on the architectural underpinnings and technical limitations of services, the AWS docs are <em>fantastic. </em>They’re better than any book you could ever buy about the cloud. (And the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/">Builder’s Library</a> is better still.) The AWS docs are designed not just to be referenced, but to be read. Read ’em!</p><p>On the other hand, some types of docs like step-by-step tutorials are very much designed to be referenced during hands-on builder time. It may not make sense to spend a lot of time reading those in the abstract. So bring your common sense.</p><p>However. There are also plenty of technologies out there where the docs are truly incomplete, out of date, or just plain wrong – many smaller open-source projects, in particular.</p><p>Turns out you have another option here, at least for OSS projects: <em>read the source code.</em> Not sure what a module does, what its edge cases are, what the error code means? Read the source code and find out! It might be faster than (and will definitely be at least as accurate as) looking for the answer in the docs, <em>even if the docs are pretty good. </em></p><p>If you write code for a living, reading other people’s shipped, battle-tested code — not just PRs from your own team — is genuinely one of the most transformative things you can do for your career. Because while you’re answering your immediate question, you’ll also be picking up style, organization, and technique from professional programmers operating under all kinds of interesting constraints. Seriously. Read code.</p><p>(And then, if it’s open-source, maybe consider contributing some docs!)</p><h2 id="h-what-do-i-get-out-of-all-this"><strong>What do I get out of all this?</strong></h2><p>If you read a targeted set of docs consistently over a sustained period — say, a couple of years — while actively practicing on that technology, you will be able to perform magic. That’s a promise.</p><p>Let’s go back to Jared Short again for an example. (Yes, I checked with Jared, he graciously agreed to let me spill his secrets in this piece.) As an engineer at an AWS shop, Jared …</p><ul><li>Reads the documentation for one AWS service, cover to cover, every week.</li><li>Blocks daily time for this on his calendar.</li><li>Focuses on services he’s actually using at work (he tells me that so far in 2021, he’s been through all the docs for Lambda, AppSync, and Step Functions).</li></ul><p>Jared’s been doing this week in, week out, for *years*. And that  unglamorous commitment lets him perform nerd magic like this:</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I needed to understand extensions better for a thing, read the docs cover to cover like an insane person.</p>— Jared Short (@ShortJared) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShortJared/status/1347612782389301249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>If you don’t want to take the time to read that whole Twitter thread, let me sum it up for you.</p><ol><li>An experienced AWS engineer encounters a weird behavior: AWS Lambda seems to be executing code when it should not be. He posts a plea for help on Twitter.</li><li>Other experienced engineers take a look and go, “huh. Weird.” To be clear, this is not a case of RTFM. The problem is nontrivial and the solution, if there is one, is not well-known. …</li></ol></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<!-- Article Start -->
			
<p>On December 22, acting on a tipoff, Indian police swooped on six call centers in Hyderabad, Gurugram, and Bangalore, from which nearly 1,500 telecallers had been working to extract money from indebted and often vulnerable Indians, resulting in 24 arrests. More raids and arrests followed; the next week, a Chinese national and alleged kingpin, Zhu Wei — known as Lambo — was apprehended as he tried to flee the country.</p>



<p>Over the past few months, an <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/economy-finance/india-plunges-into-technical-recession-as-gdp-contracts-75-in-q2fy21">economic contraction</a> and an <a href="https://unemploymentinindia.cmie.com/">increase in unemployment</a> due to the Covid-19 pandemic have led to thousands of Indians turning to online loan apps to meet their day-to-day expenses. These apps often charge interest rates as high as 40% for sums as low as $70. Some are legitimate, regulated businesses, but with government oversight of the sector lax, illegal players — <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/loan-apps-india-cracks-down-on-china-backed-fintech-startups-in-the-country/articleshow/80396442.cms">many of them operated by Chinese companies</a> — have thrived.</p>



<p>Some analysts say that Google, whose Android operating system is by far the most commonly used in the country, bears some responsibility for the rise of these predatory lenders. In the last year alone, <a href="https://dbhub.io/srikanthlogic/loanapps.db">more than 750 loan apps</a> have been added to the Google Play store. Many seem to violate the company’s policy, which doesn’t allow personal lending apps to list if they ask users for repayment less than 60 days after a loan is issued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“By Google’s own policy, it’s illegal,” said Srikanth Lakshmanan, a member of Cashless Consumer, a consumer protection collective for digital payments. “These instances have clearly shown that the system of enforcing [Google’s] policy is broken.”</p>



<p>The illegal payday lending business is large and sophisticated. KVM Prasad, Hyderabad’s assistant commissioner of police for cyber crime, estimates that rogue apps have handled $3 billion (220 billion rupees) in transactions over the past year. Some of the companies, such as Cash Guru, Udhaar Loan, Go Cash, and Krazy Rupee masquerade as legitimate payday lenders to dupe users. When it comes to calling in their debts, they become predatory, harassing borrowers by sending abusive messages, publicly shaming them on social media, and calling their relatives and friends.</p>



<p>Since September 2020, Anil Rachamalla, an internet ethics and digital wellness expert, has been approached by around 190 people who have been targeted by payday lenders and has been collecting their testimonies to build a legal case. He now runs a support group for 68 victims. Typically, he said, when a user installs an online loan app, they agree to give access to their mobile’s GPS location, gallery, and contact list. Once the user uploads proof of identification, the app credits an instant loan ranging from $60 to $1,000 to a mobile wallet or bank account, deducting up to 30% as a processing fee. The term of the loan is usually between seven and 15 days, after which point, the harassment begins.</p>

<p>Telecallers working for the loan apps start with subtle warnings by SMS, followed by verbal abuse. “If [the borrower] is not lifting his phone, his phone is going to ring the next 100 times,” Rachamalla said. The app’s operators use their access to the borrower’s contacts list to create WhatsApp groups of their friends and families, in which they brand the user as a “fraudster” and threaten them with fake court notices and police complaints.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have seen people who are [holding their phones] shiver out of fear,” Rachamalla says.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/another-youth-ends-life-over-loan-app-harassment/article33531216.ece">At least 11 people</a> have died by suicide since November 2020 after falling into these debt traps. Sometimes, telecallers force defaulters to borrow from other apps to repay their existing loans. Rachamalla documented one user who started out with a $75 loan from Udhaar Loan — the rip-off version of a legitimate payday lender, Udhaar. To repay it, he ended up more than $1,000 in debt, having borrowed from 15 other apps to cover his arrears.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, most of the victims are “not any carpenter or mason,” Rachamalla said, but “highly qualified people working at the best of the multinational organizations.” He said that the list of victims included people working at Google, Amazon, and Apple who had taken loans after losing their jobs during the downturn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google’s reticence in dealing with the proliferation of these apps has disappointed groups working to mitigate the impact of predatory lending. Lakshmanan said that his <a href="https://medium.com/cashlessconsumer/fake-digital-lending-apps-collection-harassment-8e56ab5ac0bd">analysis</a> in November showed that many of these apps had no registered entities, fake addresses, and <a href="https://medium.com/cashlessconsumer/fake-digital-lending-apps-collection-harassment-8e56ab5ac0bd">identical boilerplate privacy policies</a>, all of which should have been red flags. However, some of the apps <a href="https://medium.com/cashlessconsumer/fake-digital-lending-apps-collection-harassment-8e56ab5ac0bd">were downloaded over a million</a> times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Udhaar Loan was removed from the Play store in only late December, after Ravi Sethia, the co-founder of Udhaar, filed a copyright infringement complaint with Google. In November, a woman attempted suicide after <a href="https://twitter.com/itisprashanth/status/1325500193836421120">a telecaller for Udhaar Loans demanded nude videos</a> when she was on the verge of defaulting on her loan. “People thought it was us, and they were bombarding us,” Sethia said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google declined to comment but pointed <em>Rest of World </em>to a January 14 blog post, which said that they were dropping from the Play store apps that were unable to demonstrate compliance with local laws.</p>



<p>Critics say that the company should have acted sooner but also that the failings are widespread — payment services providers and regulators all had opportunities to prevent tragedies from happening. “Everybody should take responsibility,” Rachamalla said.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The latest events have changed many aspects of our personal and business life. Technology has become more essential than ever in connecting people. As an adaptation to the new normal conferences are increasingly being organized online. </p>
<p>The GraphQL Community’s thirst for knowledge knows no bounds so no wonder that more and more conferences are present online. One of them is <strong>GraphQL Asia</strong> 2021 edition organized by Hasura.</p>
<h2>The conference</h2>
<p>The conference takes place <strong>online on 24th &amp; 25th Feb 2021</strong> and anyone is free to join (no fee). This year’s edition is already the third one and considering the quality speakers &amp; talks that took place during the previous ones it is a must-have event in every GraphQL fan’s calendar.</p>
<p>This year’s cast looks super interesting including speakers from industry top companies including <strong>Dan Schafer, GraphQL Co-Creator from Facebook as well as people from IBM, Microsoft, Tesco, Hasura and many more</strong>. All experience in using GraphQL in enterprise-grade products and ready to share their thought on different aspects of it and its ecosystem.</p>
<h2>The talks</h2>
<p>The talks schedule looks quite impressive and anyone should find topics they are interested in. Most of them will be held in English but there are also some in different languages including Japanese, Mandarin or Vietnamese. During the conference, you will learn more on topics like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GraphQL Error Handling</strong> - which still seems to be one of the pains of every GraphQL project will be covered by <a href="https://graphql.asia/talks/graphql-error-handling-done-right/">Kewei Qu</a> from Facebook. Kewei will go over the challenges her team discovered with GraphQL reliability and how they tackled them at Facebook,</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent Caching with GraphQL Gateway</strong> - you will learn from <a href="https://graphql.asia/talks/intelligent-caching-with-graphql-gateway-using-cdc/">Roshan Alexander</a> how they build in Pratilipi an intelligent caching layer over GraphQL gateway to serve data to millions of their users keeping infrastructure cost low,</li>
<li><strong>Schema Stitching in 2021</strong> - <a href="https://graphql.asia/talks/intelligent-caching-with-graphql-gateway-using-cdc/">Greg MacWilliam</a> will bring you closer to the revitalized concept of the Schema Stitching which’s the previous iteration that was famously abandoned by Apollo and now is going through second life,</li>
<li><strong>Client-side migration from REST to GraphQL</strong> - <a href="https://graphql.asia/talks/client-side-migration-strategy-from-rest-to-graphql/">Zhifan Li</a> will cover the most important aspects of migration from REST API to GraphQL in React apps including clues on how to structure your React app’s statement management for GraphQL, simultaneously handling feature development and migration as well as present you examples of key GraphQL client libraries integrations.</li>
</ul>
<p>… and many more! </p>
<h2>Workshops</h2>
<p>Well, that’s not all folks! The conference also offers a series of workshops helping you to master your GraphQL skills including classes on:</p>
<ul>
<li>implementation Server-side Authentication in GraphQL</li>
<li>using GraphQL in the Jamstack</li>
<li>building Type-safe GraphQL apps with TypeScript</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Law enforcement and judicial authorities worldwide have this week disrupted one of most significant botnets of the past decade: EMOTET. Investigators have now taken control of its infrastructure in an international coordinated action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This operation is the result of a collaborative effort between authorities in the Netherlands, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Lithuania, Canada and Ukraine, with international activity coordinated by Europol and <a href="https://www.eurojust.europa.eu/">Eurojust</a>. This operation was carried out in the framework of the<a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/empact"> European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EMOTET has been one of the most professional and long lasting cybercrime services out there. First discovered as a banking Trojan in 2014, the malware evolved into the go-to solution for cybercriminals over the years. The EMOTET infrastructure essentially acted as a primary door opener for computer systems on a global scale. Once this unauthorised access was established, these were sold to other top-level criminal groups to deploy further illicit activities such data theft and extortion through ransomware.</p>
<h3>Spread via Word documents&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The EMOTET group managed to take email as an attack vector to a next level. Through a fully automated process, EMOTET malware was delivered to the victims’ computers via infected e-mail attachments. &nbsp;A variety of different lures were used to trick unsuspecting users into opening these malicious attachments. In the past, EMOTET email campaigns have also been presented as invoices, shipping notices and information about COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All these emails contained malicious Word documents, either attached to the email itself or downloadable by clicking on a link within the email itself. Once a user opened one of these documents, they could be prompted to “enable macros” so that the malicious code hidden in the Word file could run and install EMOTET malware on a victim’s computer.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Attacks for hire&nbsp;</h3>
<p>EMOTET was much more than just a malware. What made EMOTET so dangerous is that the malware was offered for hire to other cybercriminals to install other types of malware, such as banking Trojans or ransomwares, onto a victim’s computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This type of attack is called a ‘loader’ operation, and EMOTET is said to be one of the biggest players in the cybercrime world as other malware operators like TrickBot and Ryuk have benefited from it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its unique way of infecting networks by spreading the threat laterally after gaining access to just a few devices in the network made it one of the most resilient malware in the wild.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Disruption of EMOTET’s infrastructure</h3>
<p>The infrastructure that was used by EMOTET involved several hundreds of servers located across the world, all of these having different functionalities in order to manage the computers of the infected victims, to spread to new ones, to serve other criminal groups, and to ultimately make the network more resilient against takedown attempts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To severely disrupt the EMOTET infrastructure, law enforcement teamed up together to create an effective operational strategy. It resulted in this week’s action whereby law enforcement and judicial authorities gained control of the infrastructure and took it down from the inside. The infected machines of victims have been redirected towards this law enforcement-controlled infrastructure. &nbsp;This is a unique and new approach to effectively disrupt the activities of the facilitators of cybercrime.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How to protect oneself against loaders&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Many botnets like EMOTET are polymorphic in nature. This means that the malware changes its code each time it is called up. Since many antivirus programmes scan the computer for known malware codes, a code change may cause difficulties for its detection, allowing the infection to go initially undetected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A combination of both updated cybersecurity tools (antivirus and operating systems) and cybersecurity awareness is essential to avoid falling victim to sophisticated botnets like EMOTET. Users should carefully check their email and avoid opening messages and especially attachments from unknown senders. If a message seems too good to be true, it likely is and emails that implore a sense of urgency should be avoided at all costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the criminal investigation conducted by the Dutch National Police into EMOTET, a database containing e-mail addresses, usernames and passwords stolen by EMOTET was discovered. You can <a href="http://www.politie.nl/emocheck" target="_blank">check if your e-mail address has been compromised.</a> &nbsp;As part of the global remediation strategy, in order to initiate the notification of those affected and the cleaning up of the systems, information was distributed worldwide via the network of so-called Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs).</p>

        <strong>Deutsche Ermittler haben die Infrastruktur der weltweit als am gefährlichsten geltenden Schadsoftware "Emotet" übernommen und zerschlagen. Die Software hatte auch die IT-Infrastruktur von Behörden und Kliniken angegriffen.</strong>
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        Sie gilt als weltweit gefährlichste Schadsoftware: Deutsche Ermittler haben die Infrastruktur von "Emotet" übernommen und zerschlagen. Dies sei am Dienstag im Rahmen einer internationalen Aktion gelungen, teilten das BKA und die Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Frankfurt am Main mit. 
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    

    




    
        
        
            
            
            
            
            
            
                
    
    

        
    

            
            
            
            
            
        
    

                
                    

    
    

    

    <h2>Angriffe auf Behörden, Kliniken und Privatpersonen</h2>



    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        Das Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) hatte "Emotet" schon 2018 als gefährlichste Schadsoftware der Welt bezeichnet, weil sie zahlreiche Angriffsmöglichkeiten bot und den Angreifern so etwa Lösegelderpressung zur Herausgabe von Daten ermöglichte.&nbsp;
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        BSI-Präsident Arne Schönbohm verwies auf die lange Liste der Geschädigten durch "Emotet": "Krankenhäuser mussten ihren medizinischen Betrieb einstellen, Gerichte und Stadtverwaltungen wurden lahmgelegt, unzählige Unternehmen hatten keinen Zugriff auf ihre wichtigen Geschäftsdaten und digitalen Prozesse." Dazu seien bei "Zehntausenden" Privatleuten die Rechner attackiert worden, sodass etwa Onlinebanking manipuliert wurde oder Passwörter ausspioniert wurden.
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        "Emotet" hatte am Kammergericht Berlin zu einem Totalschaden der IT geführt. Das Gericht musste vom Berliner Landesnetz getrennt werden. Auch beim Klinikum Fürth und bei der Stadtverwaltung Frankfurt am Main verursachte "Emotet" erhebliche Schäden, dazu den Ermittlern zufolge auf den Computern Zehntausender Privatpersonen.
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        Nach Einschätzung der Ermittler entstand allein in Deutschland ein Schaden in Höhe von mindestens 14,5 Millionen Euro.
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    

    




    
        
        
            
            
            
            
            
                
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
    

                
                    

    
    

    

    <h2>"Türöffner" für Computersysteme weltweit</h2>



    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        Europol nannte die Software "eines der gefährlichsten Instrumente für Cyber-Attacken der letzten Jahre". 2014 war "Emotet" zunächst als sogenannter Trojaner aufgetaucht. 
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        "Die 'Emotet'-Infrastruktur funktionierte im Kern wie ein erster Türöffner in Computer-Systeme auf weltweiter Ebene", so die Behörde. "Das System konnte auf einzigartige Weise ganze Netzwerke infizieren, nur durch den Zugang zu ein paar wenigen Apparaten." Über ein Word-Dokument, häufig getarnt als harmlos wirkender Anhang einer E-Mail oder auch als Link, wurde in das System eingebrochen, schilderte Europol.
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        Sobald der illegale Zugang gelungen war, wurde dieser an Cyber-Kriminelle verkauft. Diese konnten wiederum eigene Trojaner einschleusen, um etwa an Bankdaten zu gelangen, erbeutete Daten weiterzuverkaufen oder aber Lösegeld für blockierte Daten zu erpressen. 
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    

    




    
        
        
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
    

                
                    

    
    

    

    <h2>Internationale Ermittlungen seit 2018</h2>



    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        Die Zerschlagung sei zusammen mit den Strafverfolgungsbehörden der Niederlande, der Ukraine, Litauens, Frankreichs, Großbritanniens, Kanadas und den USA erfolgt, so das BKA. 
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        Die ukrainische Staatsanwaltschaft teilte in Kiew mit, dass dort mehrere Personen festgenommen worden seien. Der Gesamtschaden in den betroffenen Ländern wurde auf 2,5 Milliarden US-Dollar beziffert, umgerechnet etwa 2,1 Milliarden Euro. In Deutschland wurden laut BKA 17 Server beschlagnahmt.
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        Die Ermittlungen wegen des Verdachts des gemeinschaftlichen gewerbsmäßigen Computerbetrugs und anderer Straftaten liefen demnach bereits seit August 2018. Die Zerschlagung bedeute "eine wesentliche Verbesserung" der Cybersicherheit in Deutschland.
    </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                                                
<p>Have you ever wondered which pages people look at once they have landed on your site? How do they navigate? The same questions go for designing a new digital product. How do people click through your prototype? How do they navigate and interact with the designed solution? </p>



<p>If you are conducting a UX study, you can turn to <strong>Useberry </strong>for answers!</p>



<p>In this post, I want to show you a very cool feature called <strong>User Flow.</strong></p>



<p>With Useberry’s <strong>User Flow</strong> report you can learn about the path a visitor takes before reaching its destination while you are in the prototype phase of the design.</p>



<p>But, first things first.<br></p>



<h3>What is User Flow?</h3>



<p>User Flow visualizes the path a user follows from one screen to the next. It helps you understand the behavior of your users, how they interact with your prototype, and create a conversion funnel for it.</p>



<p>In other words, it is a graphical representation of which screens users utilize to complete a specific task, how they move around your prototype, and, most importantly, which screens they’re on when they decide to leave.</p>



<p>Let’s say a user lands on the “Home” screen, goes to the “About” screen, and then to “Contact Us” before leaving.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>The user path would then be <strong>Home -&gt; About -&gt; Contact Us.</strong></p></div>



<h3>Why is this important?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The User Flow report can indicate specific points where testers remained longer or got stuck perhaps and help you make changes to enhance the user experience. The easier testers can navigate through your prototype and complete your task, the happier visitors to your final product they’ll become.</p>



<p>Gaining a deeper understanding of how testers are interacting with your prototype can help you optimize your screens for maximum conversions.</p>



<p>This means that you’ll be able to see if there are any specific screens that made users leave your test/prototype. Once these screens have been recognized and then altered with more appropriate or engaging content, you can go back to the User Flow report to check if the number of drop-offs has declined.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>You know what you want and like, but to be effective in the UX industry you need to understand the desires of your prospective users.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Understanding the preferences of your target audience is the first step in optimizing your design for conversions. Your aim is to make it easy for your target audience to find and purchase your products and services.<br></p>



<p>Here are just a few of the user behaviors you can learn about with the User Flow report:</p>



<ul><li>Which paths do your testers favor?&nbsp;</li><li>Which screens have the highest drop-off rate?</li></ul>







<h2>What do they look like?</h2>



<p>If you are familiar with the Google Analytics User Flows then you have an idea of how complex (or simple) a User Flow might look.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>A simple user-flow on useberry that shows the path for 10 different users</figcaption></figure>



<hr>



<h2>How to use User Flow Report in Useberry</h2>



<p>Now that you know what User Flow is and why it’s important, let’s see how you can find and use the report in Useberry and in your designs.</p>



<p>The best way to explain something is with an <strong>example</strong>.</p>



<p>So, let’s create a simple prototype of a music app and monitor how our potential users interact with/navigate through it in order to complete a simple task.</p>



<p>In the following example, we have a “simple” scenario.</p>



<p>We asked 10 testers to “<strong>Add a track to their wish list</strong>”.</p>



<p>The path that the users “should” take and where they “should” click in order to complete the task appears in the screenshot.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-1024x267.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-1024x267.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-300x78.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-768x200.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Expected path users must follow to complete the task</figcaption></figure>



<p>The whole prototype that we are using appears in the following screenshot:</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-1024x573.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-1024x573.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-300x168.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>For the purposes of this example, we created the prototype with <strong>Figma</strong> for which we used the <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Useberry plugin (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/788799088384104964/Useberry" target="_blank">Useberry plugin</a></strong>.<br></p>



<p><strong>Let’s start our test:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Task</strong>: Add a track to your favorites list&nbsp;<br><strong>Instructions</strong>: Navigate through the prototype and add a track to your wish list.<br><strong>Type of test:</strong> Single task<br><strong>Number of blocks used in Useberry</strong>: 2 (Single Task, Thank you)<br><strong>Audience</strong>: People from a Facebook group of music fans<br><strong>Number of testers</strong>: 10<br><strong>Time to get back results:</strong> 4 minutes<br><strong>Link to the test</strong>: <a href="https://app.useberry.com/preview/XT84tChQ/">https://app.useberry.com/preview/XT84tChQ/</a><br></p>



<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results.png 865w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results-300x162.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results-768x415.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px"></a></figure></div>



<p>OK, we have 60% success in the single task which means that 4 of our users couldn’t complete the task successfully.</p>



<p><strong>But WHY is this the case? </strong></p>



<p><strong>It was so obvious what they had to do, you might think.<br></strong></p>



<p>Let’s focus on the single task now and look at the results:<br></p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results.png 872w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results-300x243.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results-768x623.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px"></a></figure>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats.png 891w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats-300x106.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats-768x272.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Ok, we can see that 4 users skipped the task.<br></p>



<p>Now, we have 2 options:</p>



<ul><li>Filter the results and watch the session recording of the specific users</li><li>View the user flow and find the pain area </li></ul>



<p>With 10 testers it’s easy to monitor the session recording of 4 users but <strong>on a larger scale</strong> – what would happen if we had more than 100 users?</p>



<p>So, let’s examine the User Flow in order to better understand what happened.</p>



<p>And the results are…</p>



<p>Lines and Curves.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Useberry’s User Flow of the test</figcaption></figure>



<p>This looks a bit complex (or not!) but let’s analyze it anyhow.</p>



<p>Let’s <strong>zoom in</strong> a little bit and explain what we can see here.</p>



<figure><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-1024x713.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-1024x713.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-300x209.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-768x535.png 768w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM.png 1106w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Think of the User Flow as a table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every <strong>cell</strong> is an <strong>incremental navigation</strong> <strong>step</strong> and every <strong>row</strong> is a <strong>screen that appeared</strong> on the specific navigation step.</p>



<p>We then <strong>group unique screens with unique navigation steps</strong> and we create the User Flow.</p>



<p>Next to every screen, you will notice a number, and some screens may have a colored number below them. </p>



<p>The number next to the screen is the number of unique users who landed on the specific screen and the number below the screen is an event. </p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation.png 662w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation-300x235.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Here at Useberry, we capture 3 different events:</p>



<p><strong>Yellow event (Skip):</strong> Number of users who skipped the task on the specific step.<br><strong>Blue event (Success):</strong> Number of users who completed the task on the specific step.<br><strong>Red event (Drop-off):</strong> Number of users who dropped-off (totally closed) the test on the specific step.</p>







<p>Now, let’s go back to our example and the results that we have obtained.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Click the image to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p>In our User Flow example, we can see that we have <strong>multiple paths</strong> that users followed to complete their task.</p>



<p>(In this specific example, we don’t have users that closed the test before it ended which is why we don’t have red events.)</p>



<p>If we look carefully at the User Flow, we realize that we have 4 different screens that have events under them, which means that we have 4 different flows.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>click image to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Optimal Path</strong></p>



<p>Clicking the”Optimal path” button we can see the most common flow that users took in order to complete their task.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-1024x495.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-1024x495.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-300x145.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-768x371.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Optimal path</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Oh, wait…</strong></p>



<p>Those are the users that skipped the task!</p>



<blockquote><p>The “top path” is the most common user flow. It’s the series of screens seen by your typical tester. Every app has one. But not every designer knows what it is.</p></blockquote>



<p>Namely,  4 users took the <strong>exact specific path</strong> and these users skipped the task after they landed on a specific screen.</p>



<p>Bearing in mind the expected path and seeing that the optimal path is not the same as the expected path, we can <strong>quickly</strong> figure out that we need to modify our design in order to increase the success of the test.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s go a little deeper, though</strong>.</p>



<p>If we look carefully at the screen where testers split, we can see that that’s where we need to focus.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles.png 668w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles-274x300.png 274w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px"></a><figcaption>Click on the image to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p>We have 8 users who landed on <strong>screen A</strong> and 2 users who landed on <strong>screen B</strong>. On our expected path, the <strong>screen B</strong> is the “expected” screen. The users <strong>MUST</strong> go there in order to complete the task. </p>



<p>So, we have two options – change our design in order to lead these 8 users to <strong>screen B</strong> or design “something” on <strong>screen A</strong> to satisfy our users.</p>



<p>Now let’s see where the users clicked and <strong>why they split</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>How?</strong> </p>



<p>Just click “View Heatmaps” on the specific screen.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/splitted-heatmaps-2.png" alt="" width="603" height="680" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/splitted-heatmaps-2.png 603w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/splitted-heatmaps-2-266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"><figcaption><br>By clicking heatmaps on a screen you will see where the users clicked when they were on the specific screen and the specific path step</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>And the results are…</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1.png 400w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1-156x300.png 156w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a></figure></div>



<p><strong>Aha… Interesting! </strong></p>



<p>It seems that our testers and our potential users, in order to add a track to their wish list, first navigate through the specific track. (makes sense!)</p>



<p>Well, a possible solution to this is to satisfy our users when they land on <strong>screen B</strong>. That’s why we changed the design and added a bar with the “add to wishlist” button on the specific screen and run a new test again.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-1024x851.png" alt="" width="580" height="482" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-1024x851.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-300x249.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-768x638.png 768w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution.png 1063w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"></a><figcaption>Before – After</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Task</strong>: Add a track to your favorite list&nbsp;<br><strong>Instructions</strong>: Navigate through the prototype and add a track to your wish list.<br><strong>Type of test:</strong> Single task<br><strong>Number of blocks used in useberry</strong>: 2 (Single Task, Thank you)<br><strong>Audience</strong>: From a Facebook group of music fans<br><strong>Number of testers</strong>: 10<br><strong>Time to get back results:</strong> 4 minutes<br><strong>Link to the test</strong>: <a href="https://app.useberry.com/preview/hbtk48wW/">https://app.useberry.com/preview/hbtk48wW/</a></p>



<p>And the results of the <strong>new </strong>test are…</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results.png 866w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results-300x249.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results-768x637.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 866px) 100vw, 866px"></a></figure></div>



<figure><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-user-flow-1024x493.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-user-flow-1024x493.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-user-flow-300x144.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-user-flow-768x370.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p><strong>Amazing!</strong> We actually increased our conversions!</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>We managed to find an issue in something we thought was obvious and we resolved it quickly with the help of the user-flows. </p>



<p>Running tests in the design phase helps you save time and effort and solve UX issues that never even occurred to you before.</p>



<p>Maybe the results of the test are obvious but this is just a demo and an example in order to explain what user-flow looks like and how it can help you resolve UX issues.</p>



<p>With more complex prototypes and more testers, the user-flow becomes more complex, too, but we are trying to add features to make it as friendly as we possibly can – it’s up to you if you want to dig into it.</p>



<p>So, happy designing and feel free to come forward with any suggestions!</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>A bonus tip – Highlight traffic through here.<br></strong>If you want to see the path that users took in order to land on a specific screen on the user-flow, just click the “highlight traffic through here” button!</p>

                    <li><strong>Lower costs.</strong> Our provider charges us for each request made to its servers. With this system, we only call them 74 times a day, instead of 1 time for each user for each page refresh.</li>

<p>A realistic look at Python web frameworks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take a look around the blogosphere at various benchmarks for Python web frameworks, you might start to feel pretty bad about your own setup. Or, alternatively, super-hyped about the possibilities.</p><p>Consider, for instance, the incredible work of the guys at <a href="https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/">magic stack</a>, getting <strong>100,000 requests per second</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop">uvloop</a> in a single thread. This is on par with compiled language like Go's performance.</p><p>But that benchmark doesn't really cover a fully fleshed out web framework, right? We need a lot more functionality and structure from our frameworks than reading and writing bytes. What about fully fleshed-out web-frameworks in python?</p><p>One such framework is <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a>, which again has been shown to have similar performance: <strong>100,000</strong> requests per-second. Or there's <a href="https://vibora.io/">Vibora</a>. Not only does this claim to be a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, but it also has its own templating engine. And it handles <strong>350,000 requests per second</strong>!</p><p>Even more mind-blowing is <a href="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto">Japronto</a> which claims an insane <strong>1.2 million requests per-second</strong> in a single thread 🤯 trouncing the performance of other languages and frameworks:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squeaky-pl/japronto/master/benchmarks/results.png" alt="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto"></p><p>Recently we've been doing a lot of work improving the performance of our Python APIs. Currently we're running <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, and we initially had a single question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread? </em>But looking at these benchmarks had us asking more:</p><ol><li>Can we meaningfully compare them to our setup?</li><li>How realistic are they for a full production application?</li><li>Would we be better using one of these frameworks over Flask?</li></ol><p>In other words, how much should we trust these benchmarks? And to what extent should they influence our choice of technology?</p><p>In order to answer these questions, in this post, I benchmark a realistic Flask application along with it's <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a> equivalent. I'm going to guess that most readers come from a background with one of the more "traditional" Python frameworks (<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>), and it's certainly more relevant to devs here at Suade Labs. For this reason, I run the Flask app in a number of different ways, to see what the best bang for our buck is: how performant can we make our application with (almost) zero changes to the code? Along the way we'll pick up some tips for the original question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread?</em></p><p><strong>Sidenote: </strong>if you're new to Python's web frameworks, or its asynchronous libraries, take a look at [1] from the addenda at the bottom of this post for a quick explainer. This post mostly assumes you know these things.</p><h2 id="the-baseline">The baseline</h2><p>First let's run some simple "Hello, World!" benchmarks on our system to get a meaningful baseline for comparison. For reference, the Flask benchmarks on <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;l=zijzen-f">techempower</a> give 25,000 requests per second.</p><p>Here's our Flask app:</p><pre><code>app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def hello():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return "Hello, World!"

    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    try:
        return "Hello, {id}".format(**data)
    except KeyError:
        return "Missing required parameter 'id'", 400</code></pre><p>I ran it under a variety of conditions. First "raw" via <code>python app.py</code>, and then under <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> with a single <code>sync</code> worker via <code>gunicorn -k sync app:app</code> and finally Gunicorn with a single <a href="https://github.com/gevent/gevent">gevent</a> worker via <code>gunicorn -k gevent app:app</code>. In theory Gunicorn should handle concurrency and dropped connections much better than the raw python, and using the gevent worker should allow us to do asynchronous IO without changing our code [2a]. We also ran these benchmarks under <a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, which in theory should speed up any CPU-bound code without making any changes (if you haven't heard of PyPy see [2b] in the addenda below for a quick explanation and some terminology).</p><p>And what about Sanic? Well, here's the "rewrite" of our app:</p><pre><code>app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def hello(request):
    if request.method == "GET":
        return text("Hello, World!")

    data = request.json
    try:
        return text("Hello, {id}".format(**data))
    except KeyError:
        raise InvalidUsage("Missing required parameter 'id'")</code></pre><p>And here are the results:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1000w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1161w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>Some technical details: I used Python 3.7 with the regular CPython interpreter and Python 3.6 with PyPy 7.3.3. At the time of writing, running 3.6 is the latest PyPy interpreter, and their Python 2.7 interpreter is faster in some edge cases, but as Python 2 is <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">officially dead</a>, I don't believe it productive to benchmark. My system details are available in the addenda [3]. I used <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> to actually execute the benchmarks.</p><p>I'll break the results down in two parts. First: Sanic dominates, with 23,000 requests a second, although running our Flask app under Guncorn + gevent and PyPy does a pretty good job at keeping up. Second: what's going on with the performance range for our Flask app?</p></div><p>Under CPython, we see that using Gunicorn quadruples the number of Flask requests per second from 1,000 to 4,000 and using a gevent worker adds a mild (sub 10%) speed boost to this. The PyPy results are more impressive. In the raw test, it is churning through 3,000 requests a second; it received the same 4x speed boost from Gunicorn, getting us to 12,000 requests a second; finally with the addition of gevent, it cranks up to 17,000 requests a second, 17x more than the raw CPython version without changing a single line of code.</p><p>I was quite struck by the fact that gevent had such little effect on the CPython process - probably this is because the CPU is maxed out at this point. On the other hand, it seems that PyPy's better speed means it is still spending time waiting on system calls / IO, even under Gunicorn. Adding gevent to the mix means that it switches between concurrent connections, processing them as fast as the CPU will let it.</p><p>To get a real sense of this, I ran the benchmark whilst monitoring CPU usage. Here's a short test against the raw app under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see that the program hops between CPU cores and rarely utilises 100% of a given core. On the other hand, here's part of a much longer test against the Gunicorn gevent worker under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now it's evident that there is no switching between CPU cores (the process has become "sticky") and the individual core is being utilised to a far higher degree.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>: Sanic wins. PyPy is fast. Run your "traditional" app under Gunicorn.</p><h2 id="realistic-benchmarks">Realistic benchmarks</h2><div><p>The benchmark above, while fun, is pretty meaningless for real-world applications. Let's add some more functionality to our app!</p><p>First, we'll allow users to actually store data in a database, which we'll retrieve via an ORM (in our case <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, the de-facto stand-alone ORM in python). Second, we'll add input-validation to make sure our users get meaningful error messages, and that we're not accepting junk that crashes our app. Finally we'll add a response marshaller to automate the process of converting our database object to JSON.</p></div><p>We'll write a simple book store app, for a publishing house. We have a number of authors each writing zero or more books in several genres. For simplicity, each book has only a single author, but can have multiple genres - for example we could have a book which is in both the "Existential Fiction" and "Beatnik Poetry" categories. We're going to add 1 million authors to our database and roughly 10 million books. [4]</p><p>Our SQLAlchemy models look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(UUIDType, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    ... # snip!

class Book(db.Model):
    author_id = db.Column(
        UUIDType, db.ForeignKey("author.id"), nullable=False, index=True
    )
    author = db.relationship("Author", backref="books")
    ... # snip!
</code></pre>
<p>To marshal these, we use <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a>, which is a popular Python marshalling library. Here's an example of the Marshmallow model for the Author overview:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(Schema):
    id = fields.Str(dump_only=True)
    name = fields.Str(required=True)
    country_code = EnumField(CountryCodes, required=True)
    email = fields.Str(required=True)
    phone = fields.Str(required=True)
    contact_address = fields.Str(required=True)
    contract_started = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_finished = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_value = fields.Integer()
</code></pre>
<p>In our endpoints these are used for validating input and returning results like so:</p>
<pre><code>@bp.route("/author", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def author():
    """View all authors, or create a new one."""

    if request.method == "GET":
        args = validate_get(marshallers.LimitOffsetSchema())
        limit = args["limit"]
        offset = args["offset"]

        authors = Author.query.limit(limit).offset(offset).all()
        return jsonify(marshallers.authors.dump(authors))

    if request.method == "POST":
        author = Author(**validate_post(marshallers.author))

        db.session.add(author)
        db.session.commit()

        return jsonify({"id": author.id})
</code></pre>
<p>The full source code can be viewed in the <a href="https://github.com/olliemath/async_python">GitHub repo</a>. Here, the thing to note is that <code>marshallers.foo</code> is an instance of a <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a> schema, which can be used both to validate a Foo input, for instance in a POST request, as well as to marshal Foo instances ready for returning as JSON.</p>
<p>In order to actually perform asynchronous database requests, some fancy footwork is required with patching libraries, which depends on which postgres connector you use. SQLAlchemy does not support this out of the box, and in fact its primary developer has a great post arguing that <a href="https://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/">an async ORM is not always a great idea</a>. Juicy technical details in addenda [5], but beware that just using a Gunicorn gevent worker will not necessarily get you what you want.</p><p>PyPy tends to suffer a performance hit when using C-extensions and libraries instead of pure python, conversely CPython should get a performance boost from the C-based libs. To take account of this I tested two different underlying database connectors: both <a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2">psycopg2</a> and a …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

    <div><div><p>The intensification of dairy farming has been a concern of ours for many years, so we’ve been working hard to come up with a different solution. Our big idea? A new method of dairy farming that keeps the calves with their mothers to suckle. Our <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/ethical-dairy-system">ethical dairy model</a> is based around treating the animals, the land, our environment and the people who work here with respect and kindness.</p></div></div>
<div>
  <div><div><div><div about="" typeof="">
  <div>
    <div><div><div><p>In traditional dairy farms calves are removed from their mothers within a few hours of their birth - the stress this places on the cow is clear. So we wanted to find a way to keep calves with the cows and still have a financially viable farm. Put simply, we don’t want to have to choose between doing what’s right and staying in business.</p>
<p>As an organic dairy farm for more than twenty years our cows have already benefitted from some of the highest welfare standards in the UK, but we knew we could do even better. We built a new dairy, specially designed to house calves with their mothers, and we trialled the full cow with calf system for the first time in 2012. It taught us a lot, but financially cost us an awful lot.</p>
<p><span>However, the impact it made on cow contentment was staggering. All the animals were noticeably calmer and far more confident. <span>&nbsp;</span>After two to three months the calves became like teenagers, they loved playing with their pals and really only came back to mum when they wanted food!</span></p>
<p><span></span>We are determined to make our radical new model of dairy farming work, and by purchasing cheese from The Ethical Dairy you are helping to support it.</p>

    <div><div><div><p>Since October 2016 our calves have stayed with their mothers for 5 to 6 months. We still milk them in that period, but only once a day.</p>
<p>We are still at the early stages of The Ethical Dairy project, but our new approach to dairy farming has already led to huge reductions in the use of <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/power-nature">antibiotics</a>, increases in <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/biodiversity-ethical-dairy">biodiversity</a> and <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/healthier-winter">healthier</a>, happier cows. Compared to an average dairy farm, already The Ethical Dairy has:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than half</li>
<li>Reduced <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/coo-poo-power">energy</a> use by more than half</li>
<li>Cut <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/power-nature">antibiotic</a> use by 90%</li>
<li>Cut agro-chemical use by 90%</li>
<li>Doubled the productive life of cows</li>
<li>Increased our farm <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/biodiversity-ethical-dairy">biodiversity</a> five-fold</li>
<li>Increased the net amount of food in our <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/politics-food-production">food system</a> by 80%</li>
<li>Exceeded the highest standards of animal welfare</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ethical Dairy has been supported in its journey by many individuals through our crowdfunding campaign in the autumn of 2018, and by public funding, such as Dumfries and Galloway LEADER which is helping us to attend trade shows, events, and to market and promote our products. We are also grateful for support from the Food Processing, Manufacturing and Cooperation grant which has supported the development of our new cheese dairy.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><a href="https://console.dev/">Console</a> is starting as a free weekly newsletter highlighting the best tools for developers. We want to know how our list is performing, which means keeping an eye on some key metrics like active subscribers and unsubscribe rates. We can log into Mailchimp to see this data, but I wanted to get a quick daily update rather than forming a habit of constantly logging in.</p><p>We <a href="https://basecamp.com/guides/group-chat-problems">default to asynchronous communication</a> and use the chat room built into <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> for informal socialising or posting non-critical links and comments. I check it each morning, so it seemed like a good place to post a status update.</p><p>Like most chat products <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/bc3-api/blob/master/sections/chatbots.md#create-a-line">Basecamp has a bot API</a> to send arbitrary messages into the chat. It is therefore easy to use <a href="https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/docs/fundamentals/">the Mailchimp API</a> to <a href="https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/lists/get-list-info/">pull the stats</a> and post them into Basecamp. This code just needs to run every morning.</p><p>Keeping <a href="https://blog.console.dev/console-tech-stack-2021/">our tech stack</a> as simple as possible is a priority. We don't have a complex product and dealing with servers, OS updates, database replication, etc is something we will put off as long as possible! However, a chat bot has to run somewhere. This is the perfect use-case for a serverless function - just write the code and let the platform deal with the infrastructure maintenance.</p><h2 id="azure-vs-google-vs-aws">Azure vs Google vs AWS</h2><p>I have <a href="https://davidmytton.blog/who-has-the-best-serverless-platform/">tried AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions</a>, and have several personal utility functions running on both Google and Azure. Whilst I have been impressed with Google Cloud's database products, they are still behind when it comes to the breadth of functionality in their serverless functions product. Google doesn't support Rust and has no concept of custom runtimes like AWS and Azure do.</p><p>This meant it was down to AWS vs Azure. Both have excellent documentation, lots of language SDKs, and a large ecosystem of developers. However, I prefer the Azure web portal, like how they build in public on GitHub, and <a href="https://davidmytton.blog/fighting-over-who-has-the-greenest-public-cloud/">rate them best for environmental sustainability</a>. AWS is the more popular platform and Lambda/Azure Functions are competitive.

With some extra time, particularly in the quiet period between Christmas and New Year, I ended up spending several days playing around with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p><p>Although it has been around since 2010, Rust has become particularly popular in the last few years. <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">Stack Overflow have listed it as the most loved language</a> since 2016.</p><p>I won't go into the standard Rust pitch of "better safety, concurrency, performance" - you can find detailed Rust <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03382-2">vs</a> Language X <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2015/5/27/rust-for-pythonistas/">posts</a> <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/rust-vs-go">elsewhere</a> - but I did want to write up my experience as a Rust newbie.</p><h3 id="reason-1-fun-and-interesting">Reason 1: Fun and interesting</h3><p>My main reason for porting from Python to Rust was that it was fun and interesting! I like Python (which sits at #3 in the "most loved" 2020 ranking) because it is easy to start writing code and you can get things done quickly. It also enforces a particular coding style which means more consistent layout, spacing, indenting, etc.</p><p>Python doesn't make you think about concepts like static typing and memory management because it handles it for you. Rust is very different. It forces you to consider types, ensure all return cases are handled consistently, understand scoping, and many other things which are absent in Python. This is by design because it makes the resulting code much more robust.</p><p>Rust uses the concept of "<a href="https://sled.rs/errors">correctness</a>". It's not that Rust is "right" and Python is "wrong", but forcing you think about these concepts, and enforcing them before code will compile, helps to avoid errors:</p><blockquote>almost all (92%) of the catastrophic system failures are the result of incorrect handling of non-fatal errors explicitly signaled in software.<p>- <a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~yuan/papers/failure_analysis_osdi14.pdf">Simple Testing Can Prevent Most Critical Failures: An Analysis of Production Failures in Distributed Data-intensive Systems</a></p></blockquote><p>The number of times I have found bugs in my Python code due to silly mistakes like typos or not handling a particular error case makes me appreciate Rust's approach. Better to invest more time in development rather than finding bugs and errors once code has been shipped to production. </p><p>I still need to write more extensive unit tests and mock the external API calls but tests are a core language feature. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html">Developers are encourged</a> to write tests inside the source that is being tested, with integration tests in a "tests" directory.</p><h3 id="reason-2-portability">Reason 2: Portability</h3><p>Neither AWS Lambda nor Azure Functions have native support for Rust, but they both support Custom <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html">Runtimes</a>/<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-other">Handlers</a>. This allows you to build a generic web endpoint which, if it can handle to standard HTTP requests and return a standard HTTP response, can be executed by the platform.</p><p>(This is true for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-custom-handlers#http-only-function">an HTTP triggered function on Azure</a>. Getting into more platform-specific function types, like a Timer or Queue trigger, means relying more on the platform features. This makes it more difficult to port away, but not impossible).</p><p>All languages have a range of frameworks that help building web endpoints, often with an embedded web server. Rust has <a href="https://actix.rs/">Actix</a> and <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket</a>, <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-07-04-choosing-a-rust-web-framework-2020-edition/">amongst others</a>. By creating generic HTTP endpoints, the application can be run anywhere. AWS Lambda has <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime">some experimental Rust language bindings</a>, but creating a set of generic web endpoints is better because it is not then tied to a specific platform.</p><p>This is not unique to Rust. Python has <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a> (or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, for a more "batteries included" approach). However, Rust differs because it is a statically compiled language. This means the output is a binary that runs entirely independently, only requiring the system libc implementation. If you <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/platform-and-target-support/musl-support-for-fully-static-binaries.html">compile it with a musl target</a> it becomes 100% static and will therefore run on any Linux OS. </p><p>Statically compiled binaries have all their dependencies included executable. This means the binary should continue to run "forever", even if the platform changes. Indeed, because the application is completely isolated and separate from the platform, there is no reliance on specific system-installed packages. Both can be updated independent of each other. This can be partly achieved using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html">Python Virtual Environments</a>, but they are complex and have developer overhead (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/">PEP-0582</a> aims to fix that). Static compilation is a more robust approach.</p><p>It is currently convenient to run this bot on Azure, but it would be trivial to move it to AWS or a generic web server. Using <a href="https://upx.github.io/">upx</a> to <a href="https://github.com/svenstaro/upx-action">compress the executable</a> means the final binary with a full embedded web server is just 2.5MB. This application is so lightweight it could even run on a Raspberry Pi in the office - I'd just need to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">compile it for ARM</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/compressed-binary.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/compressed-binary.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/compressed-binary.png 670w"><figcaption>The final 100% static, upx compressed binary. Only 2.5MB.</figcaption></figure><p>This is definitely overkill for a chatbot project. There is no tangible benefit to statically compiling a few hundred lines of Rust vs deploying the same length Python code to Azure Functions. There are only a couple of dependencies! </p><p>But this is a great test project to learn how it works (see Reason #1 above). Internal tools tend to be built quickly and with less polish than software you intend to ship to customers. Yet they often last the longest in production because of how widely used they become. In some organizations it can be hard to justify spending expensive developer time on such projects, so investing in maintainabilty upfront is worth it.</p><h3 id="reason-3-developer-tooling">Reason 3: Developer tooling</h3><p>The overall experience of writing Rust is made much more enjoyable because of the developer tooling. Everything revolves around <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">Cargo</a> which makes documentation, dependency management, linting, testing, and builds all part of the core language. Installing Rust using the standard rustup command also includes Cargo and there are several useful extras like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RustSec/cargo-audit">Audit</a>.</p><p>This is a big win for developers because everything you need is available out of the box. Third-party packages can be found in the <a href="https://crates.io/">Crate registry</a>. The equivalent in Python, <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> and <a href="https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#pip">pip</a>, does not feel as slick and wasn't even included with Python when I first started coding it (when setuptools/easy_install were the primary method of package management). You also have to be careful to use a Python virtual environment if you have a system managed installation of Python, otherwise you will end up installing system-level dependencies.</p><p>I'm a vim user so the official <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim">rust.vim plugin</a> gives me autocomplete and in-editor checks, but the output from Cargo (warnings and errors) is very helpful and pinpointing problems. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">rust-clippy</a> is fun, too.</p><p>Where Python has an advantage is the number of libraries. PyPI has over 280,000 packages whereas Cargo has 53,000. Quantity is not an indication of quality, and Python has been stable longer, but it is reasonable to expect vendors to provide official Python SDKs. That is less common with Rust.</p><h2 id="challenges-learning-rust">Challenges learning Rust</h2><p>I wrote the Python bot in a few hours but it took me several days to get the Rust port working. This would be hard to justify if it wasn't a learning project, but everyone gets faster with experience. I had to learn not just a new language but also how to properly cross-compile for a different platform. Here are my notes on some of those challenges:</p><h3 id="language-challenges">Language challenges</h3><p>There are several features which make Rust robust, safe, and correct, but require a shift in mindset if you're used to other languages. For example, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html">the …</a></p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

			<p>GameStop Corp (GME) continues to rally today and is now up over +370% in 2021. GME shorts and longs are in a knockout battle being waged in the stock market as well asocial media platforms. Both sides are holding their ground with strong conviction, but in the end, one side will be the outright winner, and in the later rounds of this prize fight the long shareholders are way ahead on points.</p>
<p>GME short interest is $5.51 billion; 71.79 million shares shorted; 139.57% SI % Float; 58.26% S3 SI % Float; 31% stock borrow fee on existing shorts and new shorts are paying over 80% fee.</p>
<p>GME has now climbed to #12 in the short interest league table:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-9.png" alt="" width="641" height="465" srcset="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-9.png 641w, https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-9-585x424.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px"></p>
<p>A year ago, GME short interest was $276 million; 63.98 million shares shorted (stock price was $4.32); 104.01% SI % Float; 50.98% S3 SI % Float. While shares shorted only increased by +12%, total dollars as risk have risen by +1,900%. A scarcity in stock borrow availability has limited the increase in shares shorted, but even as mark-to market losses we are not seeing a decrease in overall shares shorted. In fact, GME has the highest level of SI % Float for any equity worldwide (with short interest over $100 million).</p>
<p>GME is #1 in highest Short Interest % of Float:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-10.png" alt="" width="640" height="254" srcset="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-10.png 640w, https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-10-585x232.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p>GME’s SI % of float is over 100%, which is illogical as you cannot get five quarts of milk out of a gallon jug. In actuality, GME’s short interest is 58.26% if we include the “synthetic longs” that are created by short sales in the float calculation. A portion of these “synthetic longs” become lendable shares as they settle in&nbsp; lending programs (mutual funds and ETF providers), marginable retail accounts and rehypothicatable hedge fund accounts. Short selling therefore not only provides added daily trading liquidity but also stock loan liquidity which supports not only the ability to execute Alpha generating short trades but also liquidity for portfolio hedging strategies and derivative (option\swap) hedging.</p>
<p>Over the last 30 days we saw shares shorted increase by +1.53 million shares, worth $117 million, an increase of +2.18% as its stock price rose +281%. Over the last 7 days we saw shares shorted increase by +900 thousand shares, worth $69 million, an increase of +1.27% as its stock price rose +116%.</p>
<p>We are still seeing a short squeeze on existing older shorts, with these more value-based short sellers trimming or closing their positions due to large mark-to-market losses. But, for every short position that is closed, and stock borrow returned we are seeing extremely strong demand from new short sellers looking to initiate new short positions and capitalize on an Icarus like fall for a stock price that has soared too high. Brokers and Prime Brokers are looking into every nook and cranny to satisfy short selling demand.</p>
<p>Shorting GME has not been a profitable trade for short sellers. Shorts were down -$968 million in net-of-financing mark-to-market losses in 2020 and are already down -$5.05 billion in 2021, which includes a loss of -$876 million on today’s +16% intraday move (stock price $89.00).</p>
<p>At the moment, the prize fight is between momentum longs and momentum shorts, with the longs way ahead on points but shorts are looking for a knock-out in the later rounds. While long buyers are continuing to throw punches by continuing to bid up stock prices, short sellers do not have many haymakers left to throw as stock borrow supply curtails new short selling activity in size.</p>

<p>If GME’s stock price remains at these levels or continues to rise, both value and momentum shorts will be squeezed out of their positions and GME’s stock price will get the added boost of short buy-to-covers standing shoulder to shoulder with long buyers in driving up GME’s stock price. But if GME’s stock price faulters, shorts will hold on to their positions and scramble for any slivers of stock loan borrows they can garner as long buyers begin exiting their positions in order to lock in their recent outsized mark-to-market profits. If long shareholders do begin selling, there may be an avalanche of long sellers hitting the tape since no-one wants to see their mark-to-market profits melt away and be the last ones holding the bag. Either way, this is a heavy weight fight worth watching.</p>

    <p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/hermetic_world.jpg" alt="The world description from an hermetic point of view was always convoluted and full of retrospective to enforce meaning" loading="lazy"></p>

<p><em>The year of the Linux desktop is coming</em>, and it looks like a piñata of
micro-services. Let’s break it and see the candies inside.</p>

<ul>
  <li>systemd core — the building block framework abstracting basic functionalities</li>
  <li>A universal package manager with a single reposotiry where anyone can push</li>
  <li>flatpak/appimage/snap — containarized applications</li>
  <li>polkit and apparmor — granular security</li>
  <li>systemd-homed — movable home with an immutable base system</li>
  <li>wayland compositors — the graphical environment</li>
  <li>pipewire — media pipeline</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re bored you can leave now, that’s it. Otherwise, let me get more
ideas out, but nothing surprising to anyone that has been following RedHat,
the freedesktop.org, and systemd.</p>

<p>The key innovation of the picture I lay above is that every
layer in the system is now isolated and communicate with one
another through d-bus services. D-bus is <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/07/06/dbus-polkit.html">fantastic in its own
right</a> and good at
abstracting functionalities.</p>

<p>All of these pieces need one another. Wayland compositors need pipewire
to be able to access media hardware, and pipewire needs polkit (or
similar mechanism) to select who can do that. Similarly, containarized
applications access the rest of the system through systemd services,
polkit, and pipewire.</p>

<p>What this leads to is a base system that is stable, a solid framework
to build on. The home is transportable inside a systemd-homed, along
with the containarized apps, proprietary or not.</p>

<p>The deep secret insider info I got tells me that this is a giant scheme
to get us all in a vendor lock-in. I can lie, this is the internet.<br>
Or better (or worse?), this is a new Android ecosystem.</p>

<p>Who’s going to nag when this is all done in the open; when the open
source movers are the implementers of the de-facto implementations;
when they keep piling the standards until nobody can follow them.</p>

<p>I believe the direction the Linux desktop is going towards will
bring more incentives for investments. Distributions uniqueness
won’t matter anymore as they’ll be centralized around a “store”
where devs will push directly. (<a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/03/29/distro-pkgs.html">see previous post about distros
roles</a>)</p>

<p>Leave a comment if you weren’t aware of this vision of how distros will
look in the future.</p>

</p>
<p>This is an update of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/28.html">the popular 2018 FAQ</a>.  Details
have changed, but the spirit of the project is the same.  If you've already
read this, see <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's post</a> for more color.</p>
<p>Whenever I announce a new <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-release#oil-release">Oil release</a>, some readers are confused
by the project.</p>
<p>This post explains the project's motivation from several perspectives.  Because
Unix shell is an old and successful technology, there are many ways of looking
at it.</p>
 
<a name="introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Before explaining <em>why</em> I created Oil, let's review <em>what</em> it is.  You can
think of a Unix shell in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a text-based <strong>user interface</strong>.  You communicate with the operating
system by typing commands.</li>
<li>As a <strong>language</strong>.  It has variables, functions, and loops.  Shell programs
are text files that start with <code>#!/bin/sh</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this document, we'll think of Unix shells as languages.  The Oil project
actually has <strong>two languages</strong>: OSH and Oil.  Let's define these terms, along with
two others for context:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-shell-spec#posix-shell-spec">POSIX shell</a> is a language defined by a standards body.
For example, Debian Linux and FreeBSD are both Unix operating systems that
provide POSIX shells.  Nearly all shells are POSIX-compatible: <code>bash</code>,
<code>dash</code>, <code>ksh</code>, etc.</li>
<li>GNU <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> is the most popular shell implementation in the world.
It was first released in 1989, and implements the POSIX standard plus many
extensions.  It's the default shell on most Linux distributions, runs on BSD
Unix variants, <a href="https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh/">used to ship on Mac OS X</a>, and <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/">runs on
Windows</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is a shell implementation that's part of the Oil project.
It's compatible with both POSIX and <code>bash</code>.  The goal is to run <strong>existing
shell scripts</strong>.  It's done so <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">since January 2018</a>, and has matured
in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/releases.html">many regular releases</a> since then.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> is a brand new, incompatible, shell
language.  The idea is to fix more than four decades of accumulated warts in
the Unix shell.  Many Unix users are angry that shell is so difficult, and
Oil aims to fix that.  (Example: Why is <code>x=1</code> different than <code>x = 1</code>?)</li>
</ul>
<p>More about the Oil language:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compared to POSIX shell and bash, Oil is <strong>easier to learn, write, and
debug</strong>.  It's designed for programmers who know Python, JavaScript, or Ruby,
but avoid shell.</li>
<li>Oil will do everything bash can, <strong>and more</strong>.  For example, it will have
dynamic types and structured data, not just strings.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/simplest-explanation.html">The Simplest Explanation of Oil</a>
shows examples of the language.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language Idioms</a> compares
old shell code and new Oil code.  Importantly, the same interpreter runs both
styles.  It's useful to think of OSH and Oil separately, but there's a
<strong>gradual transition</strong> between the two.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>This section paraphrases questions I've received and summarizes the answers.
In most cases, I link to the original comment thread, which you can read for
details.</p>
<a name="how-is-oil-different-than-bash-or-zsh"></a>
<h3>How is Oil different than <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code>?</h3>
<p>Oil is taking shell seriously as a <strong>programming language</strong>, rather than
treating it as a text-based UI that can be abused to write programs.</p>
<p>To see why this is valuable, consider these two groups of shell users:</p>
<ol>
<li>People who use shell to type a few commands here and there.</li>
<li>People who write scripts, which may get into the hundreds or even thousands
of lines.</li>
</ol>
<p>Oil is aimed at group 2.  If you're in group 1, there's admittedly <strong>no
reason</strong> to use it right now.</p>
<p>However, group 2 writes scripts for group 1 to use!  So I believe the benefits
of Oil will eventually bubble up.</p>
<p>In other words, I'm building a <strong>solid foundation</strong> for a few more decades of
shell usage.</p>

<a name="i-dont-understand-why-not-use-a-different-a-programming-language"></a>
<h3>I don't understand.  Why not use a different a programming language?</h3>
<p>It's important to be compatible with existing code.  You might not personally
use shell as a programming language, but all Unix users still rely on big shell
programs.  It's often used at build time, but it's still used at runtime too,
e.g. on embedded Linux devices.</p>
<p>Some of this code is old, but much of it is <strong>new</strong>.  It's not a small amount
of code, either.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, a popular cluster manager from Google (released around 2014),
has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/cloud/kubernetes/index.html">48,000+ lines</a> of shell in its repo.</li>
<li>Many distros use the <a href="https://github.com/scop/bash-completion">bash-completion</a> project for interactive completions,
and it has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/shell/bash-completion/index.html">26,000 lines</a> of shell.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7lsajn/oil_shell_03_release/drom6q4/">Original question and answer</a> (reddit.com)</p>
<a name="shouldnt-we-discourage-people-from-writing-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't we discourage people from writing shell scripts?</h3>
<p>There are three problems with that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It won't work</strong>.  It would be like trying to convince people who are paid
to write PHP not to write PHP.  Many people have wasted breath on that, but
important sites like Wikipedia are still written in <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">hundreds of thousands
of lines of PHP</a>.</li>
<li>Even if a new line of shell never gets written, there will still be a <strong>huge
installed base</strong> of shell scripts that you may need to understand (e.g. when
they don't work).</li>
<li>Shell is <strong>still the best tool</strong> for many jobs.  Most new "cloud" projects
rely on Linux system images, in VMs or containers, and shell is the ideal
language for creating such images.   Even if you use a framework like Chef
or Docker, you're still using bits of shell.</li>
</ol>
<a name="shouldnt-scripts-over-100-lines-be-rewritten-in-python-or-ruby"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't scripts over 100 lines be rewritten in Python or Ruby?</h3>
<p>That's a reasonable choice in some circumstances.  If everyone on your dev team
knows Python, maintaining a shell script can be more costly than maintaining a
Python script.</p>
<p>However, Python and Ruby aren't good shell replacements in general.  Shell is a
domain-specific language for dealing with <strong>concurrent processes</strong> and the
<strong>file system</strong>.  But Python and Ruby have too much abstraction over these
concepts, sometimes in the name of portability (e.g. to Windows).  They hide
what's really going on.</p>
<p>I encountered a nice blog post, <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/bashing-the-bash-replacing-shell-scripts-with-python-d8d201bc0989">Replacing Shell Scripts with
Python</a>, which, in my opinion, inadvertently proves the
opposite point.  The Python version is longer and has more dependencies.  In
other words, it's more difficult to write and maintain.</p>
<p>Also see the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html#the-biggest-misconception-shell-xor-python">The Biggest Misconception: Shell XOR Python</a> in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's
post</a>.</p>

<a name="are-you-reinventing-perl"></a>
<h3>Are you reinventing Perl?</h3>
<p>It's true that Perl is closer to shell than Python and Ruby are.  For example,
the <code>perl -pie</code> idiom can take the place of <code>awk</code> and <code>sed</code>.  However, Perl isn't
an acceptable shell either:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't have true pipelines (of processes).  I believe you have to "shell
out" for this.</li>
<li>It doesn't have a concept of file descriptor state.  How do you write the
equivalent of <code>my_shell_func 2&gt; err.txt</code>, where <code>my_shell_func</code> can invoke
both functions and external commands?</li>
<li>Perl has a function called <code>grep()</code>, but the real <code>grep</code> is better for many
problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perl has been around for more than 30 years, and hasn't replaced shell.  It
hasn't replaced <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> either.</li>
<li>Perl 6 and Python 3 are both less-suited to shell-like problems than their
predecessors.  In other words, we still need a new shell.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it's true that, in some respects, Oil is retreading the same ground as
Perl.  But Oil is more faithful to shell, and its syntax uses fewer punctuation
characters.  In other words, it's less like "line noise".</p>

</ul>
<a name="im-still-angry-and-i-dont-want-you-to-create-a-new-shell"></a>
<h3>I'm still angry, and I don't want you to create a new shell.</h3>
<p>You might be angry because you had to maintain a nasty shell script written by
a coworker.</p>
<p>If that's the case, you should be helping Oil succeed!  The only way to "kill
bash" is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reimplement it, then</li>
<li>Gradually migrate away from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is analogous to how Facebook is moving away from PHP by developing a
similar, but cleaner, language called <a href="http://hacklang.org/">Hack</a>.</p>
<p>Perl, Python, and Ruby have all existed for over 25 years, but they haven't
replaced shell.  New shell scripts are being written every day.</p>

</ul>
<p>(Oil also has some similarity to <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, which smoothed over some of
JavaScript's rough edges and added syntactic sugar, but didn't stray from its
core execution model.  CoffeeScript was a success because it influenced
subsequent versions of JavaScript.)</p>
<a name="should-i-limit-myself-to-posix-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3 id="limit-to-posix">Should I limit myself to POSIX shell scripts?</h3>
<p>I've seen this suggestion a lot, and there are entire books devoted to it.  If
your script is <strong>small</strong>, it may be a reasonable goal.</p>
<p>For bigger programs, limiting yourself to POSIX is not just inconvenient, it's
also an ill-defined and virtually untestable concept.  Evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Debian project created a minimal shell variant called <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, which
replaced <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  However, <code>dash</code> and the <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#scripts">Debian Policy on Shell
Scripts</a> both allow non-POSIX features, like <code>local</code>.  Local
variables are essential for writing maintainable shell scripts, but POSIX
doesn't mention them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most shells <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00000.html">parse assignment builtins differently than other
builtins</a>, but the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-grammar#posix-grammar">POSIX shell grammar</a>
has no notion of an assignment.  This issue surfaced as early as 2010, but as
of 2018, it's not in a published spec.</p>
<p>This issue <strong>isn't theoretical</strong> — <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a> differ in
practice, but POSIX doesn't specify which is correct.</p>
<p>In other words, POSIX is incomplete and out of date.  (However, I've
discovered that shells are highly conformant with respect to things the
standard <strong>does</strong> specify.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As of 2021, I believe that OSH is a "better POSIX".  POSIX is a <strong>descriptive</strong>
specification and not a <strong>normative</strong> one. That means that it's an observation
of how popular shells like <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=ksh#ksh">ksh</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> happened to behave at a certain
time.  In other words, it's a compromise.</p>
<p>Similarly, OSH is based on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/06/22.html">extensive testing</a> of the behavior of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>,
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mksh#mksh">mksh</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zsh#zsh">zsh</a>, and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=busybox#busybox">busybox</a> <code>ash</code>.  That is, it uses the
same philosophy as POSIX, but it specifies more of the language.  Roughly
speaking, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=spec-test#spec-test">spec tests</a> are an <strong>executable specification</strong>.</p>
<ul>

POSIX is silent.</li>

<a name="how-can-you-design-a-good-language-on-top-of-shell"></a>
<h3>How can you design a good language on top of shell?</h3>
<p>POSIX shell has global options that affect parsing and execution like <code>set -o noglob</code>.  And <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> extends them with options like <code>shopt -s lastpipe</code>.</p>
<p>Oil continues in the same vein, adding several shell options under <code>s…</code></p></div>

            The Culture War: Iain M. Banks’s Billionaire Fans    </h3>                    
<h4><strong>Why Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos love Iain M. Banks’ anarcho-communist space opera</strong>.</h4>



<p><strong>by Kurt Schiller</strong></p>



<p>Explicitly ideological fiction is as old as fiction itself. From ancient steles that boasted unconvincingly of the glorious defeat of the Sea Peoples to the biased histories of that ancient greek fabulist Herodotus, humans have always had a tendency to entangle ideology and entertainment.</p>



<p>And if anything, the last hundred years have only seen this tendency grow. Fiction—whether the written word or newer mediums—has remained a popular standard-bearer for ideologies as diverse as technocratic liberalism (<em>The West Wing</em>), free market right-libertarianism (<em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, <em>The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</em>), socialism (<em>The Jungle</em>, <em>The Iron Heel</em>), and even violent white supremacy (<em>The Turner Diaries</em>, <em>The Camp of the Saints</em>). And in the 21st century, the ideological implications of media consumption have become as micro-targeted as the media themselves: if you are a “true American patriot”, you might consume such jingoistic potboilers as <em>13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi </em>or the suburbs-vs-antifa thriller <em>The Reliant</em>. If you are a god-fearing evangelical, perhaps <em>Assassin 33 A.D.</em> or the Kevin Sorbo-fronted <em>God’s Not Dead </em>series are more your speed. Seeking to seize the means? Perhaps you can first seize a controller and dig into <em>Tonight We Riot</em> or Disco Elysium.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="460" height="276" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg 460w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></figure></div>



<p>Meanwhile, the reverse has also become true: “If a particular piece of media reeks of ideological impurity,” the conventional wisdom seems to go, “why bother? Why would you let those toxic ideas into your head?”</p>



<p>For all that these notions of ideological contagion and symbology are hilariously overblown, there’s some truth to the matter. At times, reading or watching long-form fiction from someone to whom you are ideologically opposed can feel exhausting, draining, aggravating, and ultimately a bit futile—like being at a party where you simply don’t like anyone, don’t care about the discussions, and are annoyed at the food. There’s much to be gained by engaging with our rhetorical opponents… but, frankly, only up to a point.</p>



<p>What then are we to take from the distinct and quite public fascination of the two richest men in the world—Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, together worth more than $375 billion—with the sci-fi works of Iain M. Banks, an avowedly socialist author who set his far-future fiction in what might best be described as a post-scarcity, anarcho-communist utopia; a world where your Bezoses and your Musks are not just irrelevant, but actively sought out and disempowered by a society comprised of property-less workers and all-caring, mostly-benevolent A.I.s?</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>Iain M. Banks’s <em>Culture </em>series—consisting of 10 largely standalone novels and a handful of short stories published between 1987 and the author’s death in 2013—charts the intrigues, impacts, and subterfuges of a group of space-faring, far-future transhumans called The Culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some ways, it’s an almost archetypal space opera. Tough-as-nails soldiers and shady sci-fi diplomats wage war across a variety of fantastical planets and megastructures. Massive, high-tech ships piloted by ultra-powerful self-aware A.I. called Minds have super-science duels among the stars. There are assassinations, revolutions, mass battles with hundreds of ships that play out on a grand scale (while taking only a fraction of a second in objective time).</p>



<p>At first glance, it seems like exactly what you’re imagining when you hear the phrase “space opera,” and so of course two super-wealthy spaceflight-and-sci-fi aficionados would be fans, right? After all, both men own private spaceflight contractors (Musk’s SpaceX and Bezos’s Blue Origin) and speak often of mankind’s future among the stars, with Musk <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/"><strong>proposing a mission to Mars</strong></a> and Bezos <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/11/18564655/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-moon-new-glenn"><strong>pitching a return to the moon and other intrasystem exploration</strong></a>. Seeking the stars seems to be in their blood (assuming it hasn’t been completely replaced with <a href="https://bloodknife.com/buy-happiness-here/"><strong>Soylent and whatever nootropics billionaires get</strong></a>).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM.png" alt="" width="438" height="576" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM.png 536w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM-228x300.png 228w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px"></figure></div>



<p>Both men have found ways to conspicuously show their fandom: Musk by <a href="https://www.tor.com/2015/01/23/elon-musk-iain-m-banks-just-read-the-instructions/"><strong>naming SpaceX rockets after Banks’s tongue-in-cheek Culture ships</strong></a> (“Just Read The Instructions,” “Of Course I Still Love You”) and a “brain interface” loosely patterned after the Culture’s neural laces; Bezos by attempting to bankroll a big-budget TV series based on the books, although this latter effort was unceremoniously canceled after Banks’s estate abruptly backed out. (Probably a wise decision, given both the challenge of adapting the material and the absurdity of one of the most exploitative corporations in the world attempting to adapt proudly far-left sci-fi.)</p>



<p>Apart from official projects, both men have made public references to Banks’s work as well—not much, but enough to know that they either really have read it, or that they were well-briefed by their PR teams.</p>



<p>“The Culture series is certainly, in terms of more modern science fiction, one of my absolute favorites,” Jeff Bezos <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/jeff-bezos-isdc-space-vision/"><strong>told GeekWire in 2018</strong></a>, when asked about his love for the series. ”We’re not quite at that level technologically, we’ve a lot of work to do before we get there, but there’s a utopian element to it that I find very attractive.”</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>There are ultimately two things that set the <em>Culture </em>series apart from many of its peers.</p>



<p>The first is the literary bent of the prose. Space opera (and genre fiction in general) has never <em>actually</em> looked like the “lasers and explosions” stereotype it was saddled with, but it’s worth emphasizing the depth of Banks’s characterization and strange depictions of an uncanny future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Characters grapple with trauma, identity, and crisis, and they do so without losing sight of the visceral and pulpy thrill of space opera’s inherent adventure and intrigue. Moments of quiet contemplation and deep metaphysical quandaries abound, coupled with strange literary pretensions that wouldn’t seem out of place in magical realism or literary fiction—a vast machine the size of a planet made of interlocking, nested globes, each holding a separate society; a grief-sick partner who holds their pregnancy in stasis for the better part of a century in a strange act of penance and passive-aggression; a vast extra-dimensional object that resists all attempts to analyze, communicate, or attack it, nearly sparking an interstellar war. The stories of the Culture simultaneously have a very real sense of strangeness and a deep, complex humanist bent, as if picking the best bit from multiple genres without losing the sense and feel of each constituent part.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Perhaps this savvy genre-bending should come as no surprise, considering Banks was an established author of literary fiction before he broke through as a sci-fi writer. While he had always dreamed of writing sci-fi (and indeed wrote at least one Culture novel before breaking through as a lit-fic author), it wasn’t until his break-out literary novel <em>The Wasp Factory</em> (1984) that he was able to start selling his sci-fi manuscripts, eventually settling into a rhythm where he danced more-or-less annually between mind-bending literary fiction published under the name Iain Banks and epic sci-fi novels published under the name “Iain <em>M.</em> Banks.” (His family, Banks explained, was offended he hadn’t used his middle name—Menzies—on <em>The Wasp Factory</em>.)</p>



<p>The other thing that sets both Banks and his <em>Culture </em>books apart is their overt and uncompromising politics.</p>



<p>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist. He was a member of the Scottish Socialist Party and a frequent interviewee for magazines like <em>Socialist Worker</em>, as well as an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War who campaigned for the impeachment of Tony Blair and, when that failed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/25/hayfestival2007.hayfestival"><strong>shredded his passport and mailed the remains to 10 Downing Street</strong>.</a> He spoke openly, and passionately, about labor exploitation, anti-imperialism, the environment, and a host of other now-popular issues, most of which still languished on the edge of the discourse when Banks first hit the scene.</p>



<p>He was also never shy about intermingling his politics and his work. Indeed, he saw them as being one and the same. Nowhere is this more clear than in a <a href="http://www.vavatch.co.uk/books/banks/cultnote.htm"><strong>1994 essay titled “A Few Notes on the Culture,”</strong></a> which Banks posted to the Usenet group rec.arts.sf.written. The sprawling document is both an overview of the Culture and an exegesis on Banks’s own worldview; between paragraphs delving into the society’s naming conventions, technology, and democratic apparatuses, Banks waxed poetic about the deleterious moral impact of capitalism and market forces:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“The market, for all its (profoundly inelegant) complexities, remains a crude and essentially blind system, and is – without the sort of drastic amendments liable to cripple the economic efficacy which is its greatest claimed asset – intrinsically incapable of distinguishing between simple non-use of matter resulting from processal superfluity and the acute, prolonged and wide-spread suffering of conscious beings.</em></p><p><em>It is, arguably, in the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic (and in that sense perversely innocent) system to a position above all other moral, philosophical and political values and considerations that humankind displays most convincingly both its present intellectual [immaturity and] – through grossly pursued selfishness rather than the applied hatred of others – a kind of synthetic evil.”</em></p><cite>Iain M. Banks, “A Few Notes on the Culture”</cite></blockquote>



<p>These same politics have been front and center in Banks’s conception of the Culture, a group he affectionately described as “hippie commies with hyper-weapons and a deep distrust of both Marketolatry and Greedism.”</p></div></div>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>What are amulets? How are they situated in the larger narrative of European healing? Varied and complex objects, amulets present both challenges and opportunities for historians and museums alike. Yet an examination of these often-overlooked items within a medical context can provide significant information about cure and protection over different times and geographies. This article analyses ten amulets from the Science Museum collections, and asks what we can learn from exploring these objects’ material features and varying functions. It argues for a re-consideration of amulets from their categorisation by nineteenth- and twentieth-century collectors and classification by modern museums, to their recognition as a significant part of the history of healing.</p>

<h2>Introduction – a hare’s foot and a Billiken</h2>


<p>On his way home from running errands one morning in January 1665, Samuel Pepys stopped to buy a hare. Pepys was a Member of Parliament and administrator of the Navy, and is perhaps most famous for keeping a diary for almost a decade during his younger life. A few weeks earlier, despite ‘very cold weather’ he had celebrated a phase of good health, unsure whether to attribute it to his daily pill of turpentine, the fact that he had ‘left off the wearing of a gowne’, or simply his ‘hare’s foote’. Yet this good health did not last. The new year brought burning, pimples and pricks, bladder problems, headaches and ‘a great deal of pain’ to Pepys’ body (<a href="#reference-60">Pepys; Wheatley (ed), 1893</a>).<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> On this January morning, however, he had run into an acquaintance at Westminster Hall – Sir William Batten, Member of Parliament and surveyor to the Navy (<a href="#reference-59">Pepys, Latham (ed), 2003, p xlv</a>).<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> Batten had given Pepys medical advice regarding his latest ailment, a most painful bout of colic, for which he showed Pepys the mistake he had made with the hare’s foot and guaranteed the perfect modification to his remedy. Originally, the foot had not been cut properly, and ‘hath not the joynt to it’; this was where the problem lay.<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> Eager to try anything to alleviate his swollen belly and ‘grudgings of wind’, Pepys handled Batten’s correctly cut hare’s foot, and noted in wonder:</p>
<p>[Batten] assures me he never had his cholique since he carried it about him: and it is a strange thing how fancy works, for I no sooner almost handled his foote but my belly began to be loose and to break wind, and whereas I was in some pain yesterday and t’other day and in fear of more to-day, I became very well, and so continue.<a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The next day, having obtained a new animal and taken Batten’s advice, Pepys was finally convinced: ‘To my office till past 12, and then home to supper and to bed, being now mighty well, and truly I cannot but impute it to my fresh hare’s foote.’<a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a> One thing was clear; the hare’s foot had worked. Pepys was cured of colic.</p>

        <p>Amulet One – Hare’s foot, object number A666124</p>
        
    
    
</section>
<p>This object is not unfamiliar to us. This particular hare’s foot, which forms part of the Science Museum’s amulet collection, is originally from Norfolk and dated 1870–1920, but hares’ and rabbits’ feet can still be bought as ‘lucky charms’ and are widely available on the internet.<a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>&nbsp; Populist literature similarly continues to reference the use of these items; <em>Scientific American</em> published an article on ‘What Makes a Rabbit’s Foot Lucky’ in 2011 (<a href="#reference-19">D’Costa, 2011</a>). Such objects remain a part of popular culture – that is, part of recognised cultural traditions – over three hundred years after being employed by Pepys. Yet we can observe a shift in function. In Pepys’ world, the various elements that constituted sickness and health were broad and wide-ranging. Illness, like health, could be affected by an extensive range of things from an imbalance of the bodily humours, environmental factors such as sleep, food, emotions and exercise, supernatural or preternatural forces, and even the stars.<a href="#footnote-7">[7]</a> Whilst Pepys sometimes consulted learned medical practitioners, the variety of people from whom he could seek counsel was extensive. In this case, he took the advice of his friend Sir William Batten.<a href="#footnote-8">[8]</a> Pepys’ story is part of a larger narrative of healing in which learned medicine, religion, astrology, magic, fate and fortune all played a role. As part of healing, objects could be invested with power from any one or more of these various sources, and employed to cure or protect. These objects have often been called amulets, both historically and today, although our interpretation of them has changed over time. The healing potency of amulets has not always been entirely understood, and their means of operation often hidden from comprehension. Yet within their own contexts, this functional complexity has not detracted from the items’ curative or protective effects. The narrative of healing that included amulets continued throughout the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and only when modern medicine necessitated ‘scientific’, empiric evidence of the mechanisms of objects’ efficacy did this change. In other words, amulets were relegated from the domain of authorised healing once it became a requirement to know and explain <em>how</em> cures worked, not just that they <em>did</em> work.</p>
<div><p>The word ‘amulet’ originates from the Latin ‘amulētum’, and was used by Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE) to denote an item worn on the body for therapeutic, apotropaic or exorcistic benefit (Skemer, 2006, pp 6–7). Whilst many have noted the belief that the word can be traced back to Arabic, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) has refuted this (<a href="#reference-56">OED, 2018, ‘amulet’</a>). Whilst definitions vary, ‘charm’ is often used synonymously with ‘amulet’, whilst ‘talisman’ features less frequently. For instance, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford has implied a semantic similarity between ‘amulets’ and ‘charms’, noting that an amulet is defined by the OED as: ‘Anything worn about the person as a charm preventative against evil, mischief, disease, witchcraft, etc.’, whilst a charm is described as ‘Anything worn about the person to avert evil or ensure prosperity’ – ‘though a charm may also be a spell or incantation believed to have a magical power’ (<a href="#reference-61">Pitt Rivers Museum, 2017</a>). ‘Amulets’ and ‘charms’ are also used synonymously by the Horniman Museum in London, and the Oxford English Dictionary’s definitions further allude to this; one entry noting that a charm is ‘Anything worn about the person to avert evil or ensure prosperity; an amulet’ (<a href="#reference-39">Horniman Museum, 2017</a>).<a href="#footnote-9">[9]</a></p><p>Evidently, amulets cannot be easily and simply defined, in part because the ways in which they have been used and understood have changed from antiquity to today. What, then, is the defining feature which makes an object an amulet? The answer to this is, its power. In the most basic and fundamental way, amulets are invested with the potency to heal. Healing centres around cure and protection, but where once these two actions were closely related, now they are more distinct. Historically, healing has not been monolithic and has taken many forms, relating to and deriving from faculties of fortune, fate, astrology, religion, magic, luck and more. Healing could therefore constitute anything from curing a specific disease, to averting a malevolent force, or fostering good fortune. This functional variation is valuable, as it can tell us a great deal about the practices and cultures in which objects are situated, as well as the objects themselves. For instance, around 250 years after Pepys cured his colic with our first amulet, the hare’s foot, an amusement park opened in Paris. As part of their brand <em>Luna Park</em> adopted a mascot known as a ‘Billiken’, a creature devised by an American artist who reportedly saw the mysterious figure in a dream and patented it in 1908. The Billiken, known as ‘God of Things as They Ought To Be’ was said to bring the customer luck, indicated by the inscription upon our second object, the park’s token: <em>Si tu me gardes je te porterai bonheur</em> (‘If you keep me I will bring you good luck/happiness’) / ‘I smile at you bad luck can’t harm you’.<a href="#footnote-10">[10]</a> This amulet offered protection and generated auspicious effects to the person who possessed it. Evidently, it had been considered important enough to be kept. Thus whilst culturally, temporally and materially distinct, the hare’s foot and the Luna Park Billiken are nevertheless united by their curative and protective potency, and demonstrate the wide spectrum of healing.</p></div>

</section>
<div><p>Yet where once healing and amulets went hand in hand, modern discussions tend to treat them as distinct. Labelling certain objects as ‘amulets’ questions their power to work, and when these items and their potency are challenged, they are ‘othered’, relegated and disassociated from the realms of healing. The hare’s foot provides an example of this. Whether situated in museum collections or referred to in common parlance, this amulet is not commonly recognised today as a curative object, nor regarded as an effective remedy for the colic. Instead, the feet of rabbits and hares are now bought, used and regarded often merely as ‘lucky’ items. This hare’s foot from the Science Museum’s collections is recorded as an amulet employed ‘for protection against cramp’.<a href="#footnote-11">[11]</a> To label something as prophylactic, an item ‘against’ a particular affliction exemplifies …</p></div></div></section></article></div>

<p>I like poker, but I’m better at chess.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png" alt="Poker vs chess" width="499" height="451" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-347x314.png 347w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-694x628.png 694w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-768x695.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-1536x1389.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></a></p>
<p>Poker can be a lot of fun if you have a witty enough group of friends and a generous snack budget. There’s nothing worse than playing poker with a bunch of serious gamblers who think conversation and choice of hot wing spiciness are potential tells.</p>
<p>I like chess because nothing is hidden. I don’t like leaving things to chance, and I’m often foolish enough to believe I can figure out how to win if I have all the information.</p>
<p>In chess, there are no missing pieces. There isn’t a sneaky queen that your opponent can place on the board when you least expect it. Everything is in the open. The strategy and tactics are entirely determined by what is sitting in front of you in plain sight.</p>
<p>If I try to play poker the way I play chess, I’m going to lose. I can’t see all the cards. Information is hidden from me, and it’s information I need to make the right decisions.</p>
<p>If you can’t stand the uncertainty of poker, don’t do a startup. Don’t do an innovation project.</p>
<p>Innovation is like poker.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png" alt="A group of people playing poker" width="599" height="441" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>

<h2>The Rules of Startup Poker</h2>
<p>This is not an ordinary game of poker. (So don’t worry if you’re not a poker player, this will still make sense.) I will stretch the analogy of Texas Hold ‘Em as far as I can in this special variation of Startup Poker.</p>
<p>Each player needs to pay the ante to play. This is a cheap game, so we’ll keep the ante at $1. Those are the costs of running an innovation project.</p>
<p>Each player gets dealt two cards that they can keep hidden. These cards represent the organization’s unique capabilities and business model — what they already have when they start.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png" alt="A group of people playing poker part 2" width="599" height="450" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-418x314.png 418w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-836x628.png 836w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-768x577.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-1536x1154.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>As a normal Texas Hold ‘Em game progresses, the dealer will turn over additional cards in the middle of the table, which each player can use as part of their hand. First there are the three cards called “the Flop,” which are turned over at the same time. Then a fourth card is turned, which is called “Fourth Street” or “The Turn.” The last card is “the River.” Players can place bets before each of these rounds, trying to raise the stakes and force other players to fold.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png" alt="Texas Hold ‘Em startup poker" width="484" height="817" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png 1184w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-186x314.png 186w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-372x628.png 372w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-768x1297.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-910x1536.png 910w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px"></a></p>
<p>In Startup Poker, all these shared cards represent the Market. The first three cards are “the Early Adopters.” The fourth card is “the Early Majority” and the last is “the Late Majority.” As the game goes on, the Market matures and players discover if they hold the winning hand.</p>
<p>The winner of the game is the person who has the best fit between the cards in their hand (which represents their business model) and the cards on the table (the Market). We can think of this as Product / Market fit or Business Model / Market fit.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png" alt="Market vs business model" width="599" height="472" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-399x314.png 399w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-797x628.png 797w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-768x605.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-1536x1210.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>The basic setup is the same, but remember, we are not playing regular Texas Hold ‘Em. Our rules are a bit different.</p>
<h2>Information Costs Money</h2>
<p>In Startup Poker, players have to ante another $1 every round to stay in. This is the cost of product development. (For our purposes, we are eliminating the standard Hold’em practice of “blinds,” which is a form of uneven antes.).</p>
<p>Additionally, instead of every round beginning by flipping over Market cards, players can get a preview by paying an additional $1 for each card. (In real poker, everyone sees the flipped card, but in our version you’re paying for a sneak peek.)</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png" alt="A poker player peeking at a flipped card" width="699" height="514" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>This is the equivalent of funding an <a href="https://kromatic.com/workshops/building-and-resourcing-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="innovation team" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">innovation team</a> to gather Market information. This investment isn’t really just money, it’s blood, sweat, and tears. But since people * time = money, we’ll just use our poker chips to represent this investment. The team is really going out into the real world, talking to customers, putting up a landing page, or running some other form of experiment or research to gather information.</p>
<p>At that point, they have the option to kill the idea (fold) or persevere before a round of betting.</p>
<p>Should we go straight ahead and bet on our hand? Or should we buy a peek at the Market first?</p>
<h2>Bet It All in Waterfall</h2>
<p>We could just close our eyes and bet it all on our pair of jacks. This is the equivalent of <a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/lean-startup-in-the-enterprise-anti-pattern-the-lean-waterfall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall development</a>, where we place our bets and literally let the cards fall where they may.</p>
<p>We believe our cards are the correct ones for the Market, despite having not seen a single card from that Market. So we are placing a lot of faith in our business model and capabilities — our pair of jacks — and to be fair, that is a formidable hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png" alt="A player risking it all to bet in a poker game" width="599" height="405" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-465x314.png 465w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-929x628.png 929w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-768x519.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-1536x1038.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>But we’ve invested for the long hall, so we push it all in and check the snack bar while the hand plays out. But the Market isn’t kind. Our opponent starts with a 2 and a 4, but winds up closing a 2-6 straight with the 3, 5 and 6 from the Market. We lose to a weaker starting hand that ended up being better for that Market. We end up sitting in the corner binging on Pringles and lukewarm beer for the rest of the night while everyone else keeps playing, but that’s a risk of Waterfall.</p>
<h2>Information Has Value</h2>
<p>So instead of going all-in based on our business model and capabilities, should we buy that peek at the Market if we’re holding a pair of jacks?</p>
<p>The answer here is yes. Obviously so.</p>
<p>If everyone is sneaking a peek at the next card except you, you are at a huge disadvantage. Now they are playing chess because they can see more of the board. Meanwhile, you think you are still playing poker.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png" alt="A player playing chess blindfolded" width="512" height="565" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png 1812w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-285x314.png 285w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-569x628.png 569w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-768x847.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-1392x1536.png 1392w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p>
<p>True, they still can’t see their opponents’ hole cards, so they don’t have all the information, but they have more than you.</p>
<p>So should you pay for the peek no matter what you are holding in your hand? Well, that depends on the cost.</p>
<h2>Don’t Play Every Hand</h2>
<p>If you start the game with a 2 of spades and a 9 of hearts, you have a bad hand. It’s not worth getting Market information because you are woefully unprepared for any Market. You might get lucky and find three twos on the board, but that’s a longshot. The odds are that someone else has a better hand. Just fold and play the next hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png" alt="2 Of spades and 9 of hearts" width="399" height="354" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-354x314.png 354w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-708x628.png 708w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-768x682.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-1536x1363.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px"></a></p>
<p>For large organizations, this is the equivalent of having an idea that is fundamentally mismatched with the company.</p>
<p>“Let’s make vegan hamburgers,” says the mining company.</p>
<p>This makes no sense. It is the 2/9 offsuit of business ideas. Let’s skip this idea and work on something with a little more promise.</p>
<h2>Pivoting</h2>
<p>In the real world, startups aren’t stuck with the cards that they are dealt. If something isn’t working with their business model, they can pivot.</p>
<p>You can also alter your product in Startup Poker, because after you peek at the cards on the board, we let you trade the cards in your hand — for a price. Each round, each player has the opportunity to trade in one card at a cost of $1. It’s an option to change your product / business model after you’ve gotten a taste of the market.</p>
<p>So let’s say you start with a pair of twos — one heart and one spade. You pay $3 to peek at three cards. They are the three, four, and five of hearts.</p>
<p>You might want to trade in your two of spades and get a new card from the deck, giving yourself a shot at a flush, a straight, or a straight flush.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png" alt="Early adopters vs business model" width="599" height="585" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-321x314.png 321w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-643x628.png 643w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-768x750.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-1536x1501.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>You are exercising an option to find a better fit with the Market. It’s only the information that you’ve gained by buying a peek at the Market that makes this pivot worthwhile.</p>
<h2>Arrogance</h2>
<p>Let’s face it, arrogance never helps in chess or in poker. Everytime I get cocky in chess, I lose.</p>
<p>Chess rankings are highly visible when playing. So when I relax for my lunchtime game and see that I’m playing someone with a rating 200 points below me, I know I’m going to win. Which is of course exactly when I’m going to lose.</p>
<p>I’m so confident in winning that I start checking my Slack messages while playing. Then I draft an email. Then I make some tea. I get distracted, forget my plan, and generally make a stupid mistake.</p>
<p>“Bad luck!” But there is no luck in chess — this is the folly of arrogance.</p>
<p>If we really wanted to make Startup Poker realistic, every player would be forced to drink 5 shots of bourbon before playing, then when they look at the two cards in their hand they’ll be convinced they have three of a kind. Every entrepreneur thinks they are the second coming of Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Confidence is great. Good entrepreneurs don’t go into a market without some level of confidence. But arrogance allows your confidence to overrule your judgement.</p>
<h2>The Size of the Pot</h2>
<p>There’s another oddity to Startup Poker in that no one knows exactly how big the pot is. It is somewhat determined by the antes that people are paying in and the bets being made, but mostly it’s determined by the Market.</p>
<p>Of course, people can bet up the pot and force players to invest more to keep up. It’s the same as startups competing against each other. When one buys advertising, the others better match it or have a better strategy.</p>
<p>To calculate the value of the Market, we add up the value of the cards to determine the size of the pot (numbered cards are worth their face value, royal cards are worth $10, and aces are worth $15). So this makes buying Market information even more important.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png" alt="The size of the pot" width="699" height="356" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-600x306.png 600w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1200x612.png 1200w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-768x391.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1536x783.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>Don’t waste your money and time playing for a small pot.</p>
<h2>Crowded Markets</h2>
<p>Lastly, look at who is competing. It can be very compelling to play in a game with fewer people. Remember, the size of the prize is mostly determined by the Market, not the amount of competition. Unfortunately, in Startup Poker, players can join the game at any time.</p>
<p>When the dealer starts turning over Market cards, players who have not anteed up to that point can opt in. Of course at first they are at a disadvantage. They have missed at least one opportunity to get advanced information, and they’ve lost at least one opportunity to pivot. But they can still get into the Market — a Market that you’ve already invested in.</p>
<p>So if the first two cards the Market shows are a King and Jack, that’s $20 already in the pot. That might attract some latecomers to the game, and the competition might increase quickly.</p>

<p>Players who find themselves alone in a game at the early stages should still take advantage of the opportunity to get more information early, and to pivot if necessary. Even if …</p></div></div>

<p>A realistic look at Python web frameworks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take a look around the blogosphere at various benchmarks for Python web frameworks, you might start to feel pretty bad about your own setup. Or, alternatively, super-hyped about the possibilities.</p><p>Consider, for instance, the incredible work of the guys at <a href="https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/">magic stack</a>, getting <strong>100,000 requests per second</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop">uvloop</a> in a single thread. This is on par with compiled language like Go's performance.</p><p>But that benchmark doesn't really cover a fully fleshed out web framework, right? We need a lot more functionality and structure from our frameworks than reading and writing bytes. What about fully fleshed-out web-frameworks in python?</p><p>One such framework is <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a>, which again has been shown to have similar performance: <strong>100,000</strong> requests per-second. Or there's <a href="https://vibora.io/">Vibora</a>. Not only does this claim to be a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, but it also has its own templating engine. And it handles <strong>350,000 requests per second</strong>!</p><p>Even more mind-blowing is <a href="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto">Japronto</a> which claims an insane <strong>1.2 million requests per-second</strong> in a single thread 🤯 trouncing the performance of other languages and frameworks:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squeaky-pl/japronto/master/benchmarks/results.png" alt="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto"></p><p>Recently we've been doing a lot of work improving the performance of our Python APIs. Currently we're running <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, and we initially had a single question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread? </em>But looking at these benchmarks had us asking more:</p><ol><li>Can we meaningfully compare them to our setup?</li><li>How realistic are they for a full production application?</li><li>Would we be better using one of these frameworks over Flask?</li></ol><p>In other words, how much should we trust these benchmarks? And to what extent should they influence our choice of technology?</p><p>In order to answer these questions, in this post, I benchmark a realistic Flask application along with it's <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a> equivalent. I'm going to guess that most readers come from a background with one of the more "traditional" Python frameworks (<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>), and it's certainly more relevant to devs here at Suade Labs. For this reason, I run the Flask app in a number of different ways, to see what the best bang for our buck is: how performant can we make our application with (almost) zero changes to the code? Along the way we'll pick up some tips for the original question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread?</em></p><p><strong>Sidenote: </strong>if you're new to Python's web frameworks, or its asynchronous libraries, take a look at [1] from the addenda at the bottom of this post for a quick explainer. This post mostly assumes you know these things.</p><h2 id="the-baseline">The baseline</h2><p>First let's run some simple "Hello, World!" benchmarks on our system to get a meaningful baseline for comparison. For reference, the Flask benchmarks on <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;l=zijzen-f">techempower</a> give 25,000 requests per second.</p><p>Here's our Flask app:</p><pre><code>app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def hello():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return "Hello, World!"

    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    try:
        return "Hello, {id}".format(**data)
    except KeyError:
        return "Missing required parameter 'id'", 400</code></pre><p>I ran it under a variety of conditions. First "raw" via <code>python app.py</code>, and then under <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> with a single <code>sync</code> worker via <code>gunicorn -k sync app:app</code> and finally Gunicorn with a single <a href="https://github.com/gevent/gevent">gevent</a> worker via <code>gunicorn -k gevent app:app</code>. In theory Gunicorn should handle concurrency and dropped connections much better than the raw python, and using the gevent worker should allow us to do asynchronous IO without changing our code [2a]. We also ran these benchmarks under <a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, which in theory should speed up any CPU-bound code without making any changes (if you haven't heard of PyPy see [2b] in the addenda below for a quick explanation and some terminology).</p><p>And what about Sanic? Well, here's the "rewrite" of our app:</p><pre><code>app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def hello(request):
    if request.method == "GET":
        return text("Hello, World!")

    data = request.json
    try:
        return text("Hello, {id}".format(**data))
    except KeyError:
        raise InvalidUsage("Missing required parameter 'id'")</code></pre><p>And here are the results:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1000w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1161w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>Some technical details: I used Python 3.7 with the regular CPython interpreter and Python 3.6 with PyPy 7.3.3. At the time of writing, running 3.6 is the latest PyPy interpreter, and their Python 2.7 interpreter is faster in some edge cases, but as Python 2 is <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">officially dead</a>, I don't believe it productive to benchmark. My system details are available in the addenda [3]. I used <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> to actually execute the benchmarks.</p><p>I'll break the results down in two parts. First: Sanic dominates, with 23,000 requests a second, although running our Flask app under Guncorn + gevent and PyPy does a pretty good job at keeping up. Second: what's going on with the performance range for our Flask app?</p></div><p>Under CPython, we see that using Gunicorn quadruples the number of Flask requests per second from 1,000 to 4,000 and using a gevent worker adds a mild (sub 10%) speed boost to this. The PyPy results are more impressive. In the raw test, it is churning through 3,000 requests a second; it received the same 4x speed boost from Gunicorn, getting us to 12,000 requests a second; finally with the addition of gevent, it cranks up to 17,000 requests a second, 17x more than the raw CPython version without changing a single line of code.</p><p>I was quite struck by the fact that gevent had such little effect on the CPython process - probably this is because the CPU is maxed out at this point. On the other hand, it seems that PyPy's better speed means it is still spending time waiting on system calls / IO, even under Gunicorn. Adding gevent to the mix means that it switches between concurrent connections, processing them as fast as the CPU will let it.</p><p>To get a real sense of this, I ran the benchmark whilst monitoring CPU usage. Here's a short test against the raw app under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see that the program hops between CPU cores and rarely utilises 100% of a given core. On the other hand, here's part of a much longer test against the Gunicorn gevent worker under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now it's evident that there is no switching between CPU cores (the process has become "sticky") and the individual core is being utilised to a far higher degree.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>: Sanic wins. PyPy is fast. Run your "traditional" app under Gunicorn.</p><h2 id="realistic-benchmarks">Realistic benchmarks</h2><div><p>The benchmark above, while fun, is pretty meaningless for real-world applications. Let's add some more functionality to our app!</p><p>First, we'll allow users to actually store data in a database, which we'll retrieve via an ORM (in our case <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, the de-facto stand-alone ORM in python). Second, we'll add input-validation to make sure our users get meaningful error messages, and that we're not accepting junk that crashes our app. Finally we'll add a response marshaller to automate the process of converting our database object to JSON.</p></div><p>We'll write a simple book store app, for a publishing house. We have a number of authors each writing zero or more books in several genres. For simplicity, each book has only a single author, but can have multiple genres - for example we could have a book which is in both the "Existential Fiction" and "Beatnik Poetry" categories. We're going to add 1 million authors to our database and roughly 10 million books. [4]</p><p>Our SQLAlchemy models look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(UUIDType, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    ... # snip!

class Book(db.Model):
    author_id = db.Column(
        UUIDType, db.ForeignKey("author.id"), nullable=False, index=True
    )
    author = db.relationship("Author", backref="books")
    ... # snip!
</code></pre>
<p>To marshal these, we use <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a>, which is a popular Python marshalling library. Here's an example of the Marshmallow model for the Author overview:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(Schema):
    id = fields.Str(dump_only=True)
    name = fields.Str(required=True)
    country_code = EnumField(CountryCodes, required=True)
    email = fields.Str(required=True)
    phone = fields.Str(required=True)
    contact_address = fields.Str(required=True)
    contract_started = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_finished = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_value = fields.Integer()
</code></pre>
<p>In our endpoints these are used for validating input and returning results like so:</p>

<p>In order to actually perform asynchronous database requests, some fancy footwork is required with patching libraries, which depends on which postgres connector you use.

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>I’ll admit it—I’m a bit of a sex toy elitist. Both in starting this blog and in my own bedroom, I tend toward stronger, fancier, longer-lasting toys with price tags to match. If I’m going to buy something, I’d rather wait to save up than make compromises—which is why Womanizer’s “The One” and Satisfyer’s “One Night Stand” pulsating air toys caught me off-guard. These very similar toys cost only ten dollars each and are positioned as tasters, giving users a chance to try this relatively new type of stimulation without shelling out the roughly $60+ for a fully-featured model.</p>
<p>The catch? They’re completely disposable, with the Satisfyer lasting 90 minutes and the Womanizer tapping out after a mere half hour. That’s it. There’s no recharging or replacing batteries unless you can hack the device (read on…). Both toys are programmed to brick themselves after the allotted time, even before the sealed AAA batteries are completely dead.</p>
<p>This seems like a bad idea. Let’s give it a go!</p>
<figure><ul><li><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="748" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-1024x748.jpg" alt="" data-id="139" data-full-url="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-scaled.jpg" data-link="https://insidesextoys.com/2021/01/disposable-waves/packaging-1/" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-1024x748.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-300x219.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-768x561.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-1536x1122.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-2048x1495.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-1200x876.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></figure></li></ul><figcaption>From left to right, the strikingly similar packaging for the Satisfyer One Night Stand and Womanizer The One</figcaption></figure>
<p>When the toys arrived (in suspiciously similar packaging), I enlisted my girlfriend, an established pulse toy fan, to lend me a hand in testing them out. While both feel robust for their price point, we agreed that the Satisfier distinguished itself with a slightly more solid and streamlined feeling in the hand. Only the Womanizer’s removable silicone head makes it possible to clean between sessions or users, if that matters given its 30-minutes service life. Initial impressions made, we started a timer, set both toys on their most powerful settings, and settled in for some playtime.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with air pulse toys, they basically use a small, oscillating silicone cup to stimulate through light, pulsing suction, usually on the clit. They create a sensation slightly different from a traditional vibrator, and they can often be much quieter.</p>
<p>The Womanizer feels rumblier, while the Satisfier is buzzier and more powerful, as if the Satisfier has a higher pulse frequency but the Womanizer has a slightly greater amplitude. Especially when used on my frenulum, the Womanizer’s protruding, soft silicone head makes it easier to create a comfortable suction seal for strong, focused stimulation where the Satisfyer’s more plastic-y head cannot. Both toys fit to my girlfriend’s clit well and created nice gentle stimulation, especially when stronger settings were paired with a bit of lube to enhance the seal. We both would have preferred more intense stimulation from both toys, and the finer control offered by the Satisfyer’s four power settings compared to the Womanizer’s three didn’t make much difference.</p>
<p>While neither toy is quite as strong or comfortable in the hand as their multi-use siblings like the Satisfyer Pro 2, my girlfriend and I agreed that they are generally pleasant to use. They stayed true to their stated time limits with no noticeable change in power, diligently shutting off at exactly 30 and 90 minutes, respectively.</p>
<p>But, when the Satisfyer shut itself off and the dust settled, neither of us had even gotten close to cumming.</p>
<p>Both toys disappoint for one simple reason: it’s hard to get off when you can’t stop watching the clock. Even with the Satisfyer’s more generous 90-minute timer, knowing that your sex toy is counting down the seconds to oblivion like a masturbatory time-bomb is just not sexy, a flaw only exacerbated by the fact that, unlike vibrating dildos, air pulse toys are truly useless without their powered functions. These factors combine to create a sense of designed hostility; these toys are literally designed to let you down.</p>
<p>And that’s not even the worst part.</p>
<p>To put it mildly, selling an item designed to turn itself into e-waste in the course of an evening is wildly unethical, especially without so much as a recycling program or pay-to-unlock system to lessen the environmental impact. Both the Satisfyer and Womanizer utilize a sealed clamshell design and mix of plastics that will make them hard for electronics recyclers to deal with, and, as shown in the Teardown section of this post, the disposable nature of both toys is purely profit- rather than design-driven. Womanizer’s parent Wow Tech and Satisfyer should seriously reconsider this product category.</p>

<p><strong>Teardown</strong></p>

<p>Now that both toys’ timers have run out, it’s time to dive in, see what makes them tick, and find out if we can hack our way around that pesky self-bricking “feature.”</p>

<p>Beginning with the Satisfyer, pulling the rather beefy two-piece ABS clamshell apart reveals the mysteries within. The injection-molded halves of the case are impressively designed, with neat alignment pins to keep the two sections together and tight tolerances on interior features that hold components in place with a friction fit. Often a surprisingly hard thing to get right, this mold has clearly been made with care.</p>

<p>Near the bottom of the device sits a lone, small PCB with control circuitry powered by two standard AAA batteries, which largely account for the toy’s weight and robust feeling. Towards the top left sits a small DC motor, which rotates a lubricated semi-flexible linkage to oscillate the toy’s silicone diaphragm and create air pulses. Even after 90 minutes of use, the batteries were far from flat, and the diaphragm linkage assembly rotated smoothly, confirming my suspicion that the toy’s time limit is enforced in firmware rather than the result of some hardware limitation.</p>

<p>A closer look at the two-layer PCB doesn’t reveal much. The circuit consists of just one unmarked IC, two ceramic capacitors, a diode, a resistor, and a pushbutton for user input. The IC is almost certainly a very simple microcontroller, but, without any further clues as to its provenance or an immediately responsive reset pin, I decided to save my hacking efforts for the Womanizer.</p>

<p>The Womanizer’s ABS case stubbornly resists prying, but cutting some of its internal pins with a rotary tool allows for easy access. While this toy’s outer ABS case is slightly simpler, it contains two other plastic parts that clip the components together.</p>

<p>The toy operates on the same principle as the Satisfier, using a small DC motor to oscillate a silicone diaphragm, this time with a slightly tighter, better-made linkage. However, the Womanizer uses just one AAA battery and is controlled by a significantly more complicated circuit.</p>

<p>The two-layer PCB has a discrete transistor that switches current to the motor, a four-position DIP switch for user input, a bunch of passives, and four IC’s. Voltage regulators boost the single battery’s voltage to a suitable level for driving the motor while another small microcontroller, this time an A262AFB, provides the brains of the operation. I couldn’t find any information on this particular chip, but the board’s silkscreen provides some clues. Most notably, the via marked “CLEAR” creates the tantalizing suggestion of a way to reset the chip, hopefully allowing for another 30 minutes of play time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after significant experimenting and poking around, it does not seem that either of vias near the “CLEAR” label is a true reset line, although all is not lost. Connecting both via’s simultaneously to the base of transistor T1 often (though not always) seems to glitch and reset the device. Just like that, the Womanizer is back in action for another 30 minutes.</p>

<p>A small switch between these two points allows for easy glitching by rapidly disconnecting and reconnecting them, and it even conveniently fits into the little access hole I cut to open the Womanizer in the first place. Now I can glitch the microcontroller for effectively unlimited 30-minute cycles.</p>
<p>Sketchy? Yes! Beautiful? Also yes!</p>
<p>All things considered, both the Womanizer’s The One and the Satisfyer One Night Stand are examples of good technical design applied to a terrible product strategy. They feel good in the hand, are mechanically solid enough to survive a few drops and run far longer than their intended service life, and create air pulse stimulation that, while far from earth-shattering, is impressive for their $10 price point. Without the lines of code make them useless after little more than one play session, I’d be buying them as gifts and recommending them to everyone I know. </p>
<p>Sometimes, hackable sex toys are fun, encouraging me to explore and think up quirky new features to make them truly feel like <em>mine</em>. But the fact remains that very few people have the tools, skills, or time to cut and solder a bricked Womanizer into a real, semi-usable sex toy. Instead, both The One and The One Night Stand leave me with a bad taste in my mouth, teasing the nice, affordable products they <em>could have been</em> before being undermined by environmentally ruinous programmed disposability.</p>

    <div>
        <p>LONDON. <strong>Mr Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca, why hasn't AstraZeneca been more specific on detailing the supply problem detected on its European plants? What exactly is the problem? &nbsp;</strong></p>

<div><p>“I think we have been relatively specific with the information. Of course, we are all very disappointed. We would like to produce more. I think we will deliver up to Europe in the month of February a reasonable quantity actually, very similar to what others have delivered on a monthly basis. But of course, it's less than expected and also because our vaccine is easy to use people expected more so we could scale up.&nbsp;Our team is working 24/7 to fix the very much issues of production of the vaccine itself. You have two steps in the production of a vaccine: one is you produce the vaccine itself. We call it a drug substance, the vaccine. Then, when we are finished with it, we move this into different plants where we put the vaccine into vials and we call that the drug product, the final product.&nbsp;For Europe the drugs substance is essentially produced in two plants, one in the Netherlands, one in Belgium. The drug product is actually produced in Italy and Germany. So from a drug product viewpoint, we have full capacity. We have zero problem. The current problems have to do with manufacturing the drugs substance”. &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
“So maybe I need to give you a little bit of explanation as to how we manufacture those vaccines. Essentially, we have cell cultures, big batches, 1000-litre or 2000-litre batches. We have cell cultures inside those batches and we inject them with the virus, the vaccine, if you will. Then those cells produce the vaccine, it’s a biotechnology protection. Now, some of those batches have very high yield and others have low yield. Particularly in Europe, we had one site with large capacity that experienced yield issues. So it's essentially a question of when you scale up to the level we are scaling up to - &nbsp;something like this that's never been done. We are scaling up to hundreds of millions, billions of doses of vaccines at a very high speed".</p></div>

<div><p>“A year ago, we didn't have a vaccine. When you do that, you have glitches, you have scale-up problems. Therefore, the yield varies from one to three, by the factor of three. The best site we have produces three times more vaccine out of a batch than the lowest producing site. We do this with a series of partners: in the US, those partners are actually approved by BARDA, the US administration, the group that manages those things and manages the capacity”.</p></div><p>
"In the US, we also have issues of yield and essentially our engineers have worked with our partners to identify what the issues are. We believe we have sorted out the issues now. The issues are different, for instance, in Belgium: we believe it was more a question of downstream filtering because when you finish making the vaccine, you have to filter it. When you filter it, you put it into vials.&nbsp;Our partner in Australia for instance also had yield issues. And they have been in the vaccine business for 20 years. But it's complicated, especially in the early phase where you have to really kind of sort out all sorts of issues. We believe we've sorted out those issues, but we are basically two months behind where we wanted to be. We've had also teething issues like this in the UK supply chain.&nbsp;But the UK contract was signed three months before the European vaccine deal. So with the UK we have&nbsp; had an extra three months to fix all the glitches we experienced. As for Europe, we are three months behind in fixing those glitches. Would I like to do better? Of course. But, you know, if we deliver in February what we are planning to deliver, it's not a small volume. We are planning to deliver millions of doses to Europe, it is not small”.</p>

<div><p><strong>You say that EU is going to receive a reasonable quantity of doses by February. Could you please quantify this?</strong><br>
"First of all, as soon as we get an approval by EMA, in the next few days, we will be shipping at least three million doses immediately to Europe, then we'll have another shipment about a week later and then the third or fourth week of February. And the target is to deliver 17 million doses by February. So, I am just estimating roughly, that would mean like about 3 million doses for Germany, probably 2,5 million for Italy and something like 2 million for Spain. I don't know exactly what the precise allocation is, but it's based on the population of each country. If you're in Germany, you can vaccinate three million people in one month. It's actually not so bad especially for the people who are the most exposed and most at risk. That's not a small proportion. And if you apply the three month regimen, then in March, you can do the same again or more potentially because we are working hard to increase our goals. It's not as good as we would like to, but it's really it's not so bad”.</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>So Europe signed the contract too late, instead of the UK?</strong><br>
“I will not pass judgment on this. But I can only tell you the facts and the facts are that we basically signed an agreement with the UK three months before we did have it with Europe. Now, part of this can be easily explained. When we entered the agreement with Oxford, they had already been working with the UK government on this. So they had a head start. We were able to quite quickly take the UK supply chain and improve it. We had to modify the formula in the process, because Oxford gave us a process that needed to be modified to enable manufacturing at scale.&nbsp;Just think about, we've done all of this in months. Usually, it takes years. We got a manufacturing process that Oxford gave us, which was producing a good vaccine, but not at an industrial scale. It was just able to produce quantities for clinical trials. So then we had to modify the process to turn it into a process that could manufacture billions of doses. At a cost that is reasonable and at a speed that is reasonable".</p><p>
&nbsp;
"We had to change all of these. Then we had to do what we call technology transfer. So we go to each partner and we train them on the process. We train them on how to manufacture. And then, you know, some people are new to this process. It's like they learn the process. They don't know how to make the vaccine and they're not as efficient as others".</p><p>
&nbsp;
"So you may have lower productivity. That's why we have a productivity going from one to three. And so, unfortunately, it's really bad luck. Actually, there's nothing mysterious about it. But look, the sites that have the lowest productivity in the network are the sites that are supplying Europe. And quite honestly, I mean, we're not doing it on purpose. I'm European, I have Europe at heart. Our chairman is Swedish, is European. Our CFO is European. Many people in the management are European. So we want to treat Europe as best we can. You know, we do this at no profit, remember? We didn't go into this to try and make money or whatever. We would like to treat Europe as good as possible. I actually do believe we treated Europe fairly". &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
"Now, let me give you another number. Our total capacity globally now is about 100 million doses a month.&nbsp;From February onwards we are able to make 100 million doses a month, that's not small. Most vaccines have 100 million doses a year, that already takes us on a 1,2 billion pace per year. We are going to keep growing. Of course, we are ramping up production and Europe is getting 17 percent of this global production in February for a population that is 5 percent of the world population.&nbsp; Now, from the beginning we took very seriously the approach that Europe took, which we thought was fair and we all took. In fact, the US didn't say that Europe said that. Europe said the vaccine is common good and everybody needs to get access at the same time globally. That's what we are doing. Europe is getting 17 percent of our global supply for a month for 5 percent of the world population. The problem is: 100 million doses is a lot, but we have 7,5 billion people in the world".</p><p>
&nbsp;
"We are in the ramp-up phase and basically it will improve, but it takes time. Having said all of this, I'm not looking for excuses, honestly.&nbsp; We take accountability. We want to do better and we're working day and night. Our people in manufacturing, we have hundreds of people, thousands of people now. Many of them didn't take any Christmas vacation. I'm not asking you feel sorry for us but you know, we're doing our very best. But it's a very complicated process and a big scale”. &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>After the explanation you just gave at the same time it is striking the aggressive way which the EU has responded, even threatning to impose a new control on exports of activity out of Europe. Some are suggesting that you're selling your product to some other countries.&nbsp; </strong><br>
“The suggestion we sell to other countries to make more money is not right because we make no profit everywhere.That's the approach we took and we agreed on that. That’s the agreement we have with Oxford University.&nbsp;It's actually even written in a contract we have with Oxford University: that we will be at no profit. We have slightly different prices from one geographic to the other because the cost of goods may be different. We have a supply chain in Brazil, we have another one in Latin America, another one in South Asia. We have one in Japan. Of course, you know, local costs are different. So you've got slight variations, but more or less, it's about three to four dollars, more or less everywhere.&nbsp;It makes no difference. Zero difference. I understand we all want to be vaccinated. I think the populations of Europe, like everywhere else in the world, have been under so much stress with this pandemic for so long now, for a year or so, that people are tired. And I think the people who didn't want to be vaccinated maybe …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Clean code is like clean garbage – it’s only truly clean if it doesn’t exist. In other words, the only clean code is <a aria-label="no code (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no code</a>. Let’s start with an acknowledgment that a perfectly clean (empty) codebase is useless. With that in mind, our pursuit of clean code will necessarily consist of tradeoffs. We’ll trade usefulness for cleanliness, complexity for speed, ownership for ease of development, and abstractions for reusability.</p>
<p>DRY (don’t repeat yourself) code is often held aloft as an ideal in the quest for clean code. Before we jump in too deep, let me shamelessly plug my new computer science learning platform <a href="https://qvault.io/">Qvault</a>, check it out if you like CS and like to write code. With that over with, let’s explore why I think DRY can be a good <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/11/30/examples-of-heuristics-in-computer-science/">heuristic</a>, but far from an absolute.</p>
<h2>What is DRY Code?</h2>
<p>According to <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Don’t repeat yourself</strong>&nbsp;is a principle aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,&nbsp;replacing it with abstractions or using&nbsp;data normalization&nbsp;to avoid redundancy. Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this definition is fairly exhaustive, what I’ve found people <em>usually</em> mean when they say “DRY code” is that when you find yourself repeating pieces of logic you should instead create a reusable function, interface, class, etc, so that you only have to maintain one copy of it. For example, take the following API calls:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<p>You may have noticed, but the beginning of those two API calls are nearly identical – they handle some basic logic that checks to see if the user is properly authenticated and sends that authentication in the request. This might not be a big deal with just two API calls, but what if we have 30? Or maybe 1000? Instead, we can DRY up this code by writing a simple <code>fetchWithAuth</code> function that will centralize all the client’s authentication logic in a single place:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">async function fetchWithAuth(url, params){
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  if (!params.headers){
    params.headers = {};
  }
  params.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  return await fetch(url, params);
}

export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<h2>Why wouldn’t you DRY out your code?</h2>
<p>Seems like a good idea to reduce code duplication right? Well, yes, in general it is. That said, lets look at some of the drawbacks that come along with too much centralization.</p>
<h3>1. Too many abstractions</h3>
<p>Sometimes code is the same at a given point in time, but later on, it becomes distinct in some way. It’s really hard to guarantee that duplicate code will remain perfect copies of each other forever. A hypothetical example of this would be if the Facebook and Instagram APIs had the exact same way to create a social post. Just because they’re <em>coincidentally</em> the same, probably doesn’t mean that the logic should only be written once.</p>
<p>The solution is likely to remain disciplined about splitting out code that, while it may be similar, is only <em>coincidentally</em> similar. Try to only merge code that’s <em>fundamentally</em> the same. A great example would be a math function like <code>log2</code>. That function should work for every case that you need to calculate a logarithm – each call is fundamentally the same.</p>
<h3>2. External dependency creation</h3>
<p>If two different projects share the same logic, it can often make sense to centralize it in a library package. While this is often a great idea, it can add overhead and can end up being more trouble than it’s worth. For example, even if the abstraction makes sense, you’re definitely adding at least the following complexity to the project:</p>
<ul><li>Management of the dependencies versions and running updates regularly</li><li>Requires multi-project updates in order to get a new change to a specific dependent</li><li>Often involves more remote infrastructure like NPM or PyPy</li><li>Gets harder to make “breaking” changes to the libraries core functions – requires a higher standard of code quality and architecture</li></ul>
<h3>3. Localization complexity</h3>
<p>When debugging or reading code, it would be easiest if the flow of logic started at the top of a file and flowed in a linear path. For example:</p>
<pre><code>START PROGRAM
INSTRUCTION 0
INSTRUCTION 1
INSTRUCTION 2
INSTRUCTION 3
END PROGRAM</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, in useful programs, we need functions, classes, methods, type definitions, etc. that force us to read and write code in a non-linear way. The goal should be to keep everything as linear as possible and sacrifice linearity and simplicity for reusability and separation of concerns as necessary. Every time we extract a chunk of code from a larger function into a smaller more encapsulated one, the code becomes just a little bit harder to follow.</p>
<p>With a highly compartmentalized project, when we see a function called <code>getUser</code>, if we want to <em>really</em> know what’s going on we have to peek into that function and remember the current context because we’re now looking at a different file. Obviously, the cognitive burden becomes greater and greater the more definitions you need to jump through.</p>
<h2>Takeaways – Code smells and hueristics</h2>
<p>Since no code is perfect, we can need to make use of some heuristics (rules of thumb), to try to work towards a cleaner codebase.</p>
<h3>1. WET code, or the rule of three</h3>
<p>WET is a better rule of thumb in my opinion than DRY.</p>
<p>WET stands for “write everything twice”, and forces you to think a bit harder about whether or not a piece of logic deserves an abstraction. The rule of three is an alternative that says you should even wait until you’ve written something three times before breaking it out.</p>
<h3>2. Is it testable?</h3>
<p>Most functions should be predictable and testable. They should behave like math functions or <a aria-label="pure functions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://qvault.io/2020/09/07/how-to-make-pure-functions-in-go/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Pure%20Function,of%20data%20outside%20the%20function)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pure functions</a> – given a set of inputs you’ll always receive the same outputs, and the state of the program isn’t mutated. If the code you’re thinking about condensing into a function can be a pure function, then it’s likely a better idea than if it were an impure function.</p>
<p>Pure functions are really easy to write good unit tests for – if your abstraction is easily testable it’s more likely to be a good abstraction.</p>
<h3>3. Are there special cases or arguments only used by a fraction of callers?</h3>
<p>Take a look at the following example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a great function! Its very simple, and obviously can be used to calculate the area of any shape. Here’s a bad example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width, isTriangle){
  if (isTriangle){
    return (height * width) / 2
  }
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Special cases are bad news – I’m trying to be too abstract. Instead I should just create two separate functions:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getTriangleArea(height, width){
  return (height * width) / 2
}

function getRectangleArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Have any more ideas for good rules of thumb? Let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane" target="_blank" aria-label="Twitter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>! I’d love to update and improve this article.</p>

    <p>Turing machine programs are sometimes represented as directed graphs. The vertices of the graph are the program’s states and the edges are transitions between states. The program’s print and shift instructions are relegated to being labels for the edges. Here’s an example:</p>

<p><img src="https://nickdrozd.github.io/assets/2021-01-26-spaghetti-code-conjecture/green-graph.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>Suppose you have a Turing machine diagram, but you don’t have access to the print and shift instructions. All you have is the graph of the states and their transitions. I don’t know why you don’t have the prints and shifts, but you don’t. Maybe you’re looking at the diagram on an overhead projection and you forgot your glasses. Maybe the diagram was drawn on a whiteboard and somebody walked past and bumped into it and wiped away the instructions. Maybe you had the program on a deck of punch cards but you dropped them and the cards got out of order and now all you can recover are the state transitions. Way to go, you klutz. Try a rubber band next time.</p>

<p>What can you tell about a program given only its state transitions? Certainly it isn’t possible to figure out exactly what the progam does. There’s no way to tell how the machine will interact with the tape. But the program’s logical structure can be discerned. Look at the example above. States 1 and 2 do some kind of initialization for state 3. States 3, 4 and 5 form a loop. States 5, 6 and 7 form another loop. The 3-4-5 can, based on a decision made at state 5, extend to include 5-6-7 loop.</p>

<p>Why was 6 afraid of 7? Becase 7 ate 9. Neden 4 5 korkuyor? Çünkü 5 6 yedi. The one-two-three cat made it across the river, but the un-deux-trois cat sank.</p>

<p>Busy Beaver programs have state transition graphs too. What do you think they would look like in general? What kinds of properties would you expect a Busy Beaver graph to have?</p>

<p>As far as I know, this question was first posed by Joshua Zelinsky <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4916#comment-1850560">in a blog comment</a>. It seems like an obvious question when you hear it, but I haven’t seen any evidence that anyone had ever thought much about Busy Beaver graphs before that. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.03184.pdf">James Harland</a> pointed out that Busy Beaver graphs can’t be <em>disconnected</em> (that is, that there can’t be two nodes between which there is no undirected path), but didn’t go any further. <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/147554934.pdf">Ludewig, Schult, and Wankmüller</a> compiled an appendix of 100 long-running 5-state programs, each accompanied by a hand-drawn state transition diagram. Look at these nice graphs:</p>

<p><img src="https://nickdrozd.github.io/assets/2021-01-26-spaghetti-code-conjecture/uwe-graphs.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>They went to all the trouble of drawing all those diagrams, but their report doesn’t mention the graphs at all. Why not?<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Zelinsky conjectured that all Busy Beavers graphs are <em>strongly connected</em> (that is, that for any two nodes, there is a directed route from one to the other). Call this the <strong>strongly connected graph conjecture</strong>. <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/bb.pdf">Scott Aaronson</a> made a broader and vaguer proposal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A related intuition, though harder to formalize, is that Busy Beavers shouldn’t be “cleanly factorizable” into main routines and subroutines – but rather, that the way to maximize runtime should be via “spaghetti code,” or a single n-state amorphous mass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the <strong>Spaghetti Code Conjecture</strong>. On top of spaghetti, all covered with cheese, is the longest-running program of some fixed length. Like Aaronson says, it isn’t a formal statement. It’s a stand-in for a set of formal statements. It implies the strongly connected graph conjecture, for instance, and other statements too. Which statements? That’s a research program. Or maybe it’s a research programme.</p>

<p>I’ll say more about the Spaghetti Code Conjecture, but before that I want to look at an application. And before <em>that</em> I want to say something about the nature of “spaghetti code”.</p>

<p>It’s sometimes defined as code that uses <code>goto</code> statements. But that isn’t right. <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.103.6084&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Donald Knuth</a> uses <code>goto</code> in his programs, and he doesn’t write spaghetti code. “Spaghetti” is a logical property, not a syntactical one. It means that the code’s control flow is <em>convoluted</em> or <em>unduly complex</em>. It’s not enough for the control flow to be just <em>complex</em>, it has to be <em>unduly</em> complex. If the code is modeling something that is complex using control flow that is simple, it’s probably wrong. Spaghetti code has a control flow that is more complex than it needs to be.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, a lot of code that is written by professional programmers is spaghetti. Shocking, I know, but true. Spaghetti code is often not created intentionally. It can result from carelessness, or even a lack of taste. Here are two ways of setting a variable to some conditionally chosen value:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>## ternary expression ##################
</span>
<span>var</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>()</span> <span>if</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>else</span> <span>that</span><span>()</span>

<span>## if / else ###########################
</span>
<span>if</span> <span>test</span><span>():</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>()</span>
<span>else</span><span>:</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>=</span> <span>that</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The ternary expression is obviously the better choice here. It has a simpler control flow. One assign statement, one path. The if-else block has two assign statements, each executed on a separate path. It’s spaghetti-er than the ternary. It’s also much more common. Is that a coincidence? A general lack of taste would explain the correlation. It could explain some other things too.</p>

<p>It really isn’t accurate to describe a Busy Beaver program as “spaghetti”. Spaghetti has a flimsy structure, great for slurping. You wouldn’t want to eat something with the structure of a Busy Beaver program. It would be unpleasant going down and unpleasant coming back up. And make no mistake, it would come back up.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to the application of the Spaghetti Code Conjecture. A program can be converted to a state transition graph by ignoring its print and shift instructions and considering only the states. Now go the other direction. Given an <em>n</em>-state <em>k</em>-color state transition graph, how many concrete programs correspond to it? In other words, how many ways are there to decorate the graph with print and shift instructions? There are <em>nk</em> transitions. Ignoring <a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2020/10/04/turing-machine-notation-and-normal-form.html">normalization</a>, each transition gets a left or right shift and one of the <em>k</em> colors. That makes <em>2k</em> decorations per transition, and so <em>2nk<sup>2</sup></em> programs per graph. Is that right? I hope so. That means 40 programs per graph in the ❺② case, and 54 programs per graph in the ❸③ case.</p>

<p>This fact can be applied to Busy Beaver searching. The naive search method generates all <em>n</em>-state <em>k</em>-color programs and then searches them. But the total number of programs gets out of hand fast, growing on the order of <em>O((nk)<sup>nk</sup>)</em>. A better way to do it is to generate the possible graphs first and then decorate them with instructions. The Spaghetti Code Conjecture can then be used at graph-generation time to discard graphs that seem unsuitable. (How many program graphs are strongly connected? I have no idea. That’s a sophisticated calculation, and I don’t know what I’m doing.) Discarding a few graphs means discarding a whole swath of programs. It can’t be overemphasized how many programs there are. Discarding them is like bailing water out of a ship. There is no choice but to get rid of a lot of them, and as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>This isn’t just idle speculation. I used the <em>graph decoration</em> technique along with Zelinsky’s strongly connected graph conjecture to find <a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2020/10/09/beeping-busy-beaver-results.html">the reigning ❹② Beeping Busy Beaver champion</a>. The conjecture has predictive power! So as far as <em>I’m</em> concerned, its value has already been proved.</p>

<p>Wait, did somebody say “proved”? Like, the conjecture has been formally proved? No, of course not. I doubt it can be proved at all. It might even be provably unprovable. But it could nevertheless be true. Busy Beaver searchers are interested in establishing lower bounds, not upper bounds. If a conjecture leads to better lower bounds, that’s good enough.</p>

<p>How much wood would a woodchuck chuck? Would a beaver eat spaghetti? Raccoons sure do love rummaging through my trash, I can tell you that.</p>

<p>Here’s an argument that the strongly connected graph conjecture is true. It’s not a real proof, just a suggestive argument. Argument by induction on the number states, with fixed <em>k</em> colors. 0- or 1-state programs are trivial and/or degenerate, so start with the base case of 2 states, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. Busy Beaver programs run on the blank tape, so the program starts in transition <code>A0</code>. If it stays in state <code>A</code>, then it will remain on transition <code>A0</code> forever, and is therefore junk. So <code>A0</code> must transition to <code>B</code>. Does <code>B</code> have any connections to <code>A</code>? If it doesn’t, then the program will spend the rest of its execution time in its <em>k</em> <code>B</code> transitions, and won’t be able to use the full <em>2k</em> transitions available. But surely such a program can’t be the ❷ⓚ Busy Beaver. Kinda QED on the base case. Next, the induction step. The <em>n</em>-state Busy Beaver is strongly connected. What about the <em>n+1</em>-state Busy Beaver? Suppose it isn’t strongly connected. For simplicity, suppose also that <em>n+1</em> is the least number of states for a Busy Beaver program whose state graph is not strongly connected. Every Busy Beaver program through <em>n</em> states is strongly connected spaghetti, but then some kind of structure gets introduced at <em>n+1</em>? Why? What kind of structure? Why <em>n+1</em>, and not earlier or later? It seems unlikely. The inductive step is kinda done, and that takes care of the loosey-goosey informal argument.</p>

<p>So we think that Busy Beaver program graphs should be strongly connected. What other properties should they have? I’m now going to enter into the territory of rank speculation and propose a few properties that seem like they should hold. Some caveats:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Busy Beaver programs need to halt, and that means they need to include a halt state (exactly one, in fact). Inclusion of the halt state makes for a lot of exceptions to otherwise general statements. I don’t feel like making that explicit, so just assume that the exception is there. This doesn’t apply to Beeping Busy Beaver programs, because <a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2021/01/14/halt-quasihalt-recur.html">they don’t indicate program termination in such a clumsy fashion</a>. In general, <a href="https://oeis.org/A337025">halt-free programs</a> will have a more pleasing graph structure than programs with a halt instruction.</li>
  <li>These conjectures are meant to apply <em>n</em>-state programs where <em>n</em> is “sufficiently large”. This is great for the conjecturer, as it …</li></ol></div></article></div></div></div>

<p><em>“Out of every hundred men, ten shouldn’t be there, eighty are just targets”</em></p>

<p><em>Heraclitus 535 - 475 BC.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>My posts on <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/winning-systems--security-practitioners-2.-preparation/">Winning Systems for Cyber Security Practitioners</a> are my most popular. In them, I attempt to change your perspective on the relative importance of products and <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/forget-solving-the-cyber-security-skills-shortage/">skills</a> in securing what’s precious to you. I make the case for using systems <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/winning-systems--security-practitioners-1.-introduction/">(in the broadest sense of the word)</a> not goals. Systems aren’t new. They pre-date the product-era of today. From infrastructure to code, you can count on them. Products and vendors come and go. Skills are irregular and scarce. It is systems that are eternal and universal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’ve taken my advice, you’ve factored default-deny, responsiveness, robustness, and resilience into your thinking. This post is about minimising your attack surface. In it, I explain what this means and why it may be our best hope for reducing vulnerability in practice. Finally, I’ll tell you what the world might look like if we took this winning system to its ultimate logical conclusion. Before we get there let’s begin at the beginning.</p>

<h4 id="the-problem">The Problem</h4>

<h5 id="1-codebase-size-quality">1: Codebase Size &amp; Quality</h5>

<p>According to the Software Engineering Institute, software developed in the USA has about 6000 defects per million lines of source code (MLOC)<sup id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> for high-level languages like Java and C#. High-quality code has 600 to 1000 defects per MLOC. Code of exceptional quality developed with the highest levels of assurance exhibits defects below 600 per MLOC. Between 1% and 5% of those defects are thought to be security vulnerabilities<sup id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Let’s apply that research to some well-known codebases and see what the numbers look like.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Software</th>
<th>MLOC</th>
<th>Vulns. (high est.)</th>
<th>Vulns. (low est.)</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>FreeBSD</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>2700</td>
<td>54</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Oracle<sup id="fnref:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></td>
<td>25</td>
<td>4500</td>
<td>90</td>

<tr>

<td>50</td>
<td>9000</td>
<td>180</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Facebook</td>
<td>65</td>
<td>19500</td>
<td>390</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The low estimates don’t look bad. There’s no chance they apply here. Even the high rate may be too conservative for contemporary Internet-based applications. Most technology companies optimise for the shortest time to market, because they have competition. They optimise for flexibility, because they don’t know what they’re building until they find product/market fit. Security, stability, and ease of maintenance (the conventional measures of software quality) are not high on the list of priorities.</p>

<h5 id="2-tractability-distributedness">2: Tractability &amp; Distributedness</h5>

<p>MLOC is a simplistic measure. Modern Internet applications consist of a mixture of software from a long and complex supply chain. Partly Open Source. Partly licensed. Partly offshore. Partly of unknown origin. Some code recent. Some ancient. Some developed with great care. Some slapdash. Modern web applications draw upon software in the form of services from a dozen places. Your application may be partly distributed even though you think of it as centralised.</p>

<p>Consider this <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/the-stack/">blog</a>. It has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx">web server</a> and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD">Operating System</a>. It uses cosmetic client-side javascript. It has an external comment section. Fonts and cookies come from Google. I should say something about SSL and DNS services. Without these, the site wouldn’t function. All this attack surface for some static text that looks much as it would have in the 1980s. Its puny code is distributed and diverse. It doesn’t even offer an application in the conventional sense. The simplest things have a larger attack surface than you think. Some numbers:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Software</th>
<th>MLOC</th>
<th>Vulns. (high est.)</th>
<th>Vulns. (low est.)</th>
<th>CVEs To Date</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>OpenSSHd</td>
<td>0.020</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>NGINX</td>
<td>0.165</td>
<td>50</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>23</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>OpenSSL<sup id="fnref:4"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></td>
<td>0.536</td>

<td>3</td>
<td>194</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>LibreSSL</td>
<td>0.344</td>
<td>104</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<blockquote>
<p>For OpenSSL nobody believes 194 CVEs represent anything other than a small fraction of the actual vulnerabilities. OpenSSL is mature and supposedly security-critical. It has a highly exposed codebase. It has a single design-purpose. What do you think the vulnerability rate is like for the average piece of software? Our high estimates don’t look high after all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="3-informal-methods">3: Informal Methods</h5>

<p>Some vulnerabilities are design weaknesses or logic errors. Not buffer overruns. Not input validation problems. Not statistical errors. Not side-channel attacks. They are precedence bugs, off-by-one bugs, or errant state machine misbehaviour. Not the kind of flaw that static analysis is good at spotting. Not the kind of flaw you can easily patch away.</p>

<h5 id="4-unintended-consequences">4: Unintended Consequences</h5>

<p>I’ve said nothing about deployment practices, configuration, or administration. Even if you aren’t a developer, there’s no shortage of ways you can expose or create vulnerability as a consequence of individual configuration choices. Software has many layers and many settings. Unintended consequences arise from interactions between these settings and layers. Defaults are frequently a poor choice. Even documentation is sometimes misleading in a way that jeopardises security.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As code breadth, depth, diversity, and distributedness increases, so does scope for errors and vulnerability. These four problems are the reason why software is insecure.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="good-news-bad-news-luck-judgement">Good News Bad News, Luck &amp; Judgement</h4>

<p>The news isn’t all bad. Some part of the odds falls in our favour.</p>

<ul>
<li>Not all vulnerabilities are exposed by default.</li>
<li>Not all exposed vulnerabilities are exposed to unprivileged users.</li>
<li>Not all exposed unprivileged user vulnerabilities end in system compromise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Experience tells us we can’t draw comfort from this. There are many winning systems but luck is not one of them.</p>

<ul>
<li>What was hidden from exposure can be inadvertently revealed.</li>
<li>What was inaccessible to unprivileged users can slip within their reach.</li>
<li>What looked like a tiny hole, turns out to be a secret passage into the castle.</li>
</ul>

<p>What about judgement? The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) improves software quality and with it security. However, it provides only a marginal reduction in total vulnerability once we consider the sum of a deepening stack, spiralling dependencies, and increasing distributedness and diversity of code within real applications. If software quality is order and flaws are disorder, disorder is still increasing at a faster rate than order can be imposed. This isn’t an argument against S-SDLC, DevSecOps, Formal Methods, or any other software quality initiative. It’s an observation that these things are not an adequate braking force. We continue to roll downhill towards greater overall vulnerability.</p>

<p>Consider “as a service” providers. They carry their own vulnerable software, which they may improve. They also carry the vulnerable “genes” of all the other components, products, and 3rd party services they build upon. They have no meaningful control over this inheritance and only partial influence over whether those genes are “expressed” in their particular formulation of an architecture or service. Soon software will be everywhere, inside everything. Much of it vulnerable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The winning system is, therefore, the relentless limitation of attack surface. Whether it be by design, development, or deployment. Preferably all three. Don’t wait for software quality to improve. Count on it remaining lousy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="reducing-attack-surface-in-practice">Reducing Attack Surface In Practice</h5>

<p>This series is for practitioners, but it talks of systems. It does so because practices co-evolve with technology and technology becomes obsolete, invalidating practices with it. You can watch this happen in real-time. Professionals, products, and  companies struggle to stay relevant when customers move from traditional physical infrastructure to cloud to serverless.</p>

<p>Winning systems are eternal. They transcend the tech-de-jour. The IT industry hasn’t grasped this. That’s why job descriptions are still packed with vendor and product names. It’s why product companies fail to talk a language that business understands. It’s why I still think a classical Computer Science and Software Engineering background helps. It separates pristine theory from messy, proprietary, and perishable practice.</p>

<p>So let’s start with the pristine theory first before getting dirty with practices:</p>

<ul>
<li>For software which you must expose, expose only a small part.</li>
<li>For that small part:

<ul>
<li>Expose it only to a constrained group of users.</li>
<li>Expose only a necessary subset of its functionality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For that subset:

<ul>
<li>Eliminate complexity, making it as simple as possible.</li>
<li>Apply the winning systems of least-privilege and default-deny.</li>
<li>If a given function can be achieved in a less risky way, take it.</li>
<li>Where complexity is unavoidable, treat that software with suspicion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Remove unused or vestigial elements, they are a liability.</li>
</ul>

<p>The practical extent to which one can limit attack surface is case-specific. It depends upon the level of control you have over the software in question and the environment within which it runs. However, everyone can do something to limit their attack surface, even if your control is limited to that of a network or systems administrator.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the part where we risk a little obsolescence by talking in more detail about practices.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="shedding-vulnerabilities">Shedding Vulnerabilities</h5>

<ul>
<li>Deactivate non-essential modules/plugins. Apply universally from applications to kernels.</li>
<li>Remove unused functionality from code or Operating Systems.</li>
<li>Deactivate non-essential network services.</li>
<li>Better still, don’t install or activate them in the first place.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="restricting-vulnerabilities">Restricting Vulnerabilities</h5>

<ul>
<li>Don’t expose networked applications to traffic which is:

<ul>
<li>Not yet authenticated.</li>
<li>Not yet validated in some way.</li>
<li>From non-paying users/agents (business model permitting).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="shielding-vulnerabilities">Shielding Vulnerabilities</h5>

<ul>
<li>Where services are only used from within your network (or within a host), prevent them being accessed from other points of origin.</li>
<li>If services can be bound to individual IP addresses or interfaces, bind them.</li>
<li>Remove unused network protocol stacks.
<br></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="designing-out-vulnerability">Designing Out Vulnerability</h5>

<p>Now the hard part. If you are designing or building software, you have a golden opportunity to avoid whole classes of vulnerability. Doing so may mean changing how your application or group of applications work together to provide the user with a capability. There will be a trade-off and that trade-off will be specific to your situation. Choose wisely.</p>

===================================================================</p>
<p><strong>Everything from this point down is out of date as of: 3-30-2020</strong></p>
<p>This was my initial “netflix on the raspberry pi 4 development” blog post. Leaving it on here due to the comments, initial work, info for those interested, but I highly recommend using the easy method above (linked).</p>
<p>Last libwidevine extract: 3-29-2020 – v.4.10.1610.6 of libwidevine – EVERYTHING CONFIRMED WORKING</p>
<p><em><br>
Chromium has made substantial changes the way libwidevine (and a few major things around DRM) are loaded/used/etc. They have also made changes to the setting and reading of the user-agent propagation. For some time (~2 months or so) — the combination of this badly broke Netflix. It seems they have undone the lib loading in the last couple of versions, and user @Spartacuss discovered the user-agent fix.</em></p><p><em>The instructions here (as of 3-29-2020) work for: Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Pandora, and many others.</em></p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 4 model with 4GB of RAM is the first cheap hardware that can provide a real “desktop-like” experience when browsing the web/watching Netflix/etc. However, if you have tried to run Netflix on the Pi, you have quickly entered the disgusting mess that exists around DRM, WideVine (Netflix being one example of something that needs it), and Chromium.</p>
<p>After hours and hours of effort, I finally discovered a quick and elegant solution that lets you use the <strong>latest default provided Chromium browser</strong>, without having to recompile anything in order to watch any WideVine/DRM (Netflix, Spotify, etc) content.</p>
<h2>Background and the DRM Problem</h2>
<p>If you are not familiar with this, the short version is that Netflix (and many others, ex: Spotify) use the WideVine “Content Protection System” – aka DRM, and if you want to watch Netflix or something else that uses it, you need to have a WideVine plugin+browse supported integration. Chrome, Firefox, and Safari make it available for x86/amd64 systems, but not for ARM since technically they don’t have ARM builds.</p>
<p>Chromium, the project Chrome is based on, does have an ARM build, but it does not include any DRM support, and technically it does not include widevine support by default (*caveat here, which helps us later)<br>
So long story short, the question becomes “how do you enable DRM/WideVine support in Chromium?”.</p>
<p>It seems there are two main solutions out there: use an old (v51, 55, 56, 60) version of Chromium which has been “patched” with widevine support (kusti8’s version seems to be the most popular one – except since the new Netflix changes, that also does not work), which requires uninstalling the latest Chromium available, installing the old/patched one, and dropping in older widevine plugins; the second option is to use Vivaldi – a proprietary fork of Opera which also has been “sort of patched”, but it still needs a valid libwidevinecdm plugin (see bellow) and it has it’s own issues (and also…it’s Opera…in 2019…who uses Opera?)</p>
<p>After a lot of research and trial and error, I discovered a much more elegant solution – use the extracted ChromeOS (armv7l – yay) binaries and insert them into Chromium + make everything think it’s ChromeOS (user agent)</p>
<h2>Netflix/Hulu/Spotify with the Default Raspberry Pi Chromium Browser</h2>

<p><strong>Enough theory – let’s do this in 2 quick steps!</strong><br>
0.) If you have tried Netflix/etc already, open Chromium and clear your browser history + cookies. Otherwise it will cache the “failed” DRM components.</p>
<p><strong>1.) Download the latest extracted ChromeOS <a href="http://blog.vpetkov.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/libwidevinecdm.so_.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libwidevine</a> binary and extract it:</strong></p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<p><strong>2.) Completely QUIT all Chromium windows.</strong><br>
Start Chromium with the new Application Menu under “Internet”: <strong>Chromium (Media Edition)</strong><br>
<del datetime="2020-03-30T00:52:10+00:00">Open a new tab, and go to: https://bitmovin.com/demos/drm You should be able to see the movie on the left. </del>(While this still works, it will show “No DRM” unless you set the Chromium user-agent from within the app – which breaks Netflix. BitMoving unfortunately looks for that first. Just go to Netflix/Your media source directly.)<br>
You can now play Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Spotify, Pandora, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and many others!</p>
<p>Please note that If you can see the video on the left, this means the DRM plugin has worked! From this point on, anything that does not work (ex: Netflix sometimes breaks after a browser update) is due to the site specifically filtering User Agents/doing other “tricks”. So for example, if Netflix does not work, Spotify, Pandora, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO, etc will still work. <del datetime="2020-03-30T00:52:10+00:00">The BitMovin website is the “real” test on wether the DRM plugin has worked.</del>(While still technically true, if your Chromium user-agent is not set from within the app itself, which breaks Netflix, BitMovin will show “No DRM” even though the DRM decryption works)</p>

<p>It seems the Pi’s raw CPU frequency is still not powerful enough for decoding 100% of the time. While 97-98% of the time is good enough, you will get the occasional “screen tearing” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing), especially in scenes with fast motion.</p>
<p><del datetime="2020-04-07T04:18:34+00:00">Users Otaku, DM (and thanks to Luca for testing/extra info!) have found a solution which was mentioned on https://lb.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=246179 by user Greysvandir.<br>
I had to add a few more things and I created a compressed and slightly automated 😉 version:<br>
# sudo apt install -f compton<br>
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi<br>
$ cd ~/.config &amp;&amp; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dastorm/Compton-xfce-config/master/compton.conf<br>
$ cp -f /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
$ echo “@usr/bin/compton –backend glx” &gt;&gt; ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
$ echo “xrandr –output HDMI-1 –mode 1280×720” &gt;&gt; ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
The result is no tearing with 1080p@60fps video.<br>

<p><strong>(OPTIONAL) Get libwidevinecdm version</strong><br>
If you want to check your *actual* libwidevinecdm version, the easiest and quickest way is using user VMX’s elegant python solution:</p>

January 26, 2021 | https://blog.tara.ai/a-2020-of-sprints/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.tara.ai/a-2020-of-sprints/">archive.org</a>

<p>Launching is hard. The product is never polished “enough”. There are always a hundred more tasks to be completed, and in the midst of a pandemic, it can seem impossible to get a product to the finish line.<br></p>
<p>Yet, we persevered.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>We set a deadline of April 30th 2020 for our <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tara-ai-1-0">v1.0</a>, and were all cylinders go, with dozens of completed sprints and pull requests from our team and 50 other teams in our early alpha. Best case scenario: my co-founder Syed and I expected a hundred other teams to sign up within a few weeks. Instead, post launch, thousands of workspaces were activated. In short, we were completely blown away by the response.<br></p>
<br>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dx44N4Jx3MeU-ccCvlLrdVZC79artXQ-ORaLC_l5q287H8w1bUvHZLHRkORWcbfdPEjk6B5aJhSJDmkv_moWoJ2hQufI-mas3TJrhN5gIXowR4rINJ0nd4oBaingIQ-dmErRs72M" alt=""></figure></div>

<p>Quickly, Tara AI went to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23033387">page 1 of Hacker News</a> and the outpouring of love and support began. We realized how large of a problem we had truly set to solve, and in 8 months, 20,000 of you worked with Tara to deliver:&nbsp;<br></p>
<ul><li>100,000 tasks</li><li>25,000 sprints</li><li>15,000 product requirements and</li><li>7,000 Github connections</li></ul>

<p>We heard from so many of you how you switched from the “clunk” of Jira, the “mess” of Asana, and how a tool that was built by engineers (for engineers) became your team’s “superpower” to develop and release faster.&nbsp;<br></p>
<br>
<div><figure><img src="https://blog.tara.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Hunt-Feedback-1024x597.png" alt="Developer feedback" width="768" height="448" srcset="https://blog.tara.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Hunt-Feedback-1024x597.png 1024w, https://blog.tara.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Hunt-Feedback-300x175.png 300w, https://blog.tara.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Hunt-Feedback-768x448.png 768w, https://blog.tara.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Hunt-Feedback-1536x896.png 1536w, https://blog.tara.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Hunt-Feedback-2048x1195.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></figure></div>

<p>Consider this a promise to you, our power user:&nbsp;<br></p>
<p><strong>Tara will always have simplicity at its core.</strong> Simplicity is beautiful, and we promise to continue to maintain an easy to use interface. We persevere to add value with powerful functionality, and you will never require a full-time “administrator” to use the tool. This is a decade-old concept that needs to end, 1- click is all it should take to start and run a sprint, or connect your project management software to source control.<br></p>
<p><strong>Tara will provide visibility and speed </strong>as you move quickly to deliver software. You should be able to zoom in/out within different concepts in your product delivery assembly line, and the tool should get out of your way as you deliver software.<br></p>
<p><strong>Tara should add predictability</strong> to your workflow. Predictably helping your team deliver on their tasks, sprints or pull requests, and providing indicators to do so. Continually delivering on your sprints, helps you deliver on your team’s monthly product milestones, which adds up to delivery on annual business goals for your organizations. In short, predictability in effort completed, and estimating effort, becomes integral to delivering on release timelines.</p>

<p><strong>So what’s next?</strong><br></p>
<p>In 2020, we received over 520 feature requests from a highly active community of power users via Intercom, email and our slack group. And, we saw sprints being created in just over 15 different languages. In 2021, we’re delivering:<br></p>
<p><strong>A smarter Tara.</strong>&nbsp;Developers have to manually change statuses and constantly provide updates to the rest of their team, to move tasks across the development pipeline. We’re building automation that works intuitively with your source control and development workflow, so that your tasks flow from branch creation (TODO) to merged pull requests (DONE). Teams will be able to provide their DOD (definition of done) and automatically move tasks in the hand-off from development to QA, from one engineer to the next.</p>
<p><strong>An improved interface. </strong>We’re making it even easier to search and filter through the platform with smart labels, to help prioritize your work. We’re also working on a new navigation that makes it faster to create tasks, product requirements or sprints, at any level, as your team delivers software from specification to release.<br></p>
<p><strong>Larger teams. </strong>Today, Tara is optimized for workspaces and teams of up to 30 developers. We’ve mindfully crafted the experience for small teams, yet we continue to hear from larger teams that are anxiously waiting to make the switch to Tara. Moving forward, we’re building functionality to support access controls and user management, along with reporting and quarterly/monthly milestone setting. Our mobile experience is also a part of this roadmap.<br></p>
<p><strong>More integrations. </strong>We’ve shipped several updates to our Github integration, alongside a new Gitlab integration. Next up, we’re working on more source control connections, to welcome teams from Bitbucket and other platforms. We’re also releasing our full-fledged Slack app, with reporting functionality and task creation, directly from Slack.</p>
<br>

<p>And, there’s more. We have an even larger roster of updates planned for 2021. To deliver on this ambitious roadmap, <a href="https://tara.ai/about/careers/">we’re hiring</a> engineers, designers and scientists looking to change productivity for developers.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>We’re excited to see what you will continue to build with Tara. Here’s to our customers.</p>
<p>Onwards and upwards.</p>

			<p>The station’s atmosphere is maintained at pressure comfortable for the crew members, and a tiny bit of that air leaks over time, requiring routine repressurization from nitrogen tanks delivered on cargo resupply missions. In September 2019, NASA and its international partners first saw indications of a slight increase above the standard cabin air leak rate. The leak has presented no immediate danger to the crew or the space station. The crew isolated sections of the station to monitor pressure changes to find and repair this air leak starting in August 2020.</p>
<p>The Distran Ultra Pro acoustic camera displays the leak location and estimates equivalent pinhole leakage rates and limit of detection in real-time. This Swiss-made technology detects ultrasounds emitted by air flow as it rushes through small holes, seams, and cracks. The acoustic imaging is overlaid on an optical image in real time, offering clear pinpointing of leaks. Ultra Pro records vacuum and jetting ultrasounds emitted by any type of leak (steam, CO2, CH4, H2, etc.) offering a wide range of applications.</p>
<p>Tests have shown that Ultra Pro’s leak detection abilities are not impaired when the frequencies of noise-source energy are sufficiently far from the test frequency. Not all leaks produce ultrasound at the same frequency, and user selection of frequencies from 10-55 kHz is facilitated by an integrated, real-time spectrogram display. The Ultra Pro can potentially locate partially obstructed, hard-to-reach, or hidden leaks, potentially providing a great advantage as the ISS modules are filled with equipment racks, piping, cables, and experiment payloads.</p>
<p>Distran technology has been in use since 2013, mostly in the oil &amp; gas industry, chemical manufacturing, and power plants. This versatile device, which can also pinpoint partial discharges, saves time and gas or electric consumable costs as well as it provides a safe manner to check for leaks from a distance.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>When you develop a Python project, you need to install the project's dependencies. For a long time, tutorials and articles have told you to use a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies. This way you don't contaminate the working set of other projects, or the global interpreter, to avoid possible version conflicts. We usually have to do these things:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ python3 -m venv venv  
$ <span>.</span> venv/bin/activate   
<span>(</span>venv<span>)</span> $ pip <span>install</span> -r requirements.txt  </code></pre></div>
<p>There are also workflow tools that simplify this process, such as <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/">Pipenv</a> and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>. They create virtual environments for you without perception and then install dependencies into them. They are used by a wide range of users. A virtual environment contains a Python interpreter and has the same directory structure as a normal installation so that it can be used as if it were a standalone Python installation.</p>
<h2 id="the-problems-with-virtual-environments"><a href="#the-problems-with-virtual-environments" aria-label="the problems with virtual environments permalink"></a>The problems with virtual environments</h2>
<p>Virtualenvs help us isolate project dependencies, but things get tricky when it comes to nested venvs: One installs the virtualenv manager(like Pipenv or Poetry) using a venv encapsulated Python, and creates more venvs using the tool which is based on an encapsulated Python. One day a minor release of Python is out and one has to check all those venvs and upgrade them if required before they can safely delete the out-dated Python version.</p>
<p>Another scenario is global tools. There are many tools that are not tied to any specific virtualenv and are supposed to work with each of them. Examples are profiling tools and third-party REPLs. We also wish them to be installed in their own isolated environments. It's impossible to make them work with virtualenv, even if you have activated the virtualenv of the target project you want to work on because the tool is lying in its own virtualenv and it can only see the libraries installed in it. So we have to install the tool for each project.</p>
<p>I've been maintaining the Pipenv project as a collaborator for the past two years and became a member of PyPA in early 2020. I am always thinking if the virtual environment is really a must-to-have for Python projects, just like <code>npm</code>, it doesn't need a cloned <code>node</code> binary, but just a <code>node_modules</code> directory that is unique for each project.</p>
<h2 id="pep-582----python-local-packages-directory"><a href="#pep-582----python-local-packages-directory" aria-label="pep 582    python local packages directory permalink"></a>PEP 582 -- Python local packages directory</h2>
<p>The solution has been existing for a long time. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/">PEP 582</a> was originated in 2018 and is still a draft proposal till the time I wrote this article, but I found out it is exactly what <code>node_modules</code> are in Python.</p>
<p>Say you have a project with the following structure:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>.
├── __pypackages__
│   └── 3.8
│       └── lib
└── my_script.py</code></pre></div>
<p>As specified in the PEP 582, if you run <code>python3.8 /path/to/my_script.py</code>, <code>__pypackages__/3.8/lib</code> will be added to <code>sys.path</code>, and the libraries inside will become import-able in <code>my_script.py</code>.</p>
<p>Now let's review the two problems I mentioned in the last section and see how they change with the power of PEP 582. For the first problem, the main cause is that the virtual environment is bound to a cloned Python interpreter on which the subsequent library searching based. It takes advantage of Python's existing mechanisms without any other complex changes but makes the entire virtual environment to become unavailable when the Python interpreter is stale. With the local packages directory, you don't have a Python interpreter any more, the library path is directly appended to <code>sys.path</code>, so you can freely move and copy it.</p>
<p>For the second, once again, you just call the tool against the project you want to analyze, and the <code>__pypackages__</code> sitting inside the project will be loaded automatically. This way you only need to keep one copy of the global tool and make it work with multiple projects.</p>

<p>Starting from the PEP, I made <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/">PDM</a>, a new Python package manager and workflow tool that leverages PEP 582 to get rid of virtualenv entirely. It installs dependencies into the local package directory <code>__package__</code> and makes Python interpreters aware of it with <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/#enable-pep-582-globally">a very simple setup</a>. It is not only an implementation of PEP 582 but also the only package manager that supports <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/">PEP 621</a>, a new metadata format based on <code>pyproject.toml</code> which becomes the standard recently. It is foreseen that pip will also gradually support this format. Besides, PDM uses the same dependency resolver as pip and has a full-featured plugin system, allowing for community-contributed plugins to enhance the functionalities.</p>
<p>In PDM, PEP 582 is not mandatory, you can also stick with virtualenv. PDM can detect <strong>existing</strong> venvs but not create new ones.</p>
<p>Another thing that is noteworthy is its dependency resolution mechanism -- it tries to lock versions that are compatible with the <code>requires-python</code> value of the project. Say your project requires Python 2.7 or 3.6 upper and you want to add <code>pytest</code> as a development dependency, in Pipenv(ver. <code>2020.11.15</code>) you have to pin <code>pytest = "&lt;5"</code> manually in <code>Pipfile</code>. And in Poetry(ver. <code>1.1.4</code>) if you run <code>poetry add -D pytest</code> you will get:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>The current project's Python requirement <span>(</span><span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span> <span>||</span> <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>4.0</span><span>)</span> is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:
    - pytest requires Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>, so it will not be satisfied <span>for</span> Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Yes, it tells you to upgrade your Python requires version. However, in PDM, you can lock successfully:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❯ pdm <span>add</span> -d pytest
Adding packages to dev dependencies: pytest
✔ 🔒 Lock successful
Changes are written to pdm.lock.
Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
Synchronizing working <span>set</span> with lock file: <span>11</span> to add, <span>0</span> to update, <span>0</span> to remove

  ✔ Install atomicwrites <span>1.4</span>.0 successful
  ✔ Install colorama <span>0.4</span>.4 successful

  ✔ Install pytest <span>4.6</span>.11 successful
  ✔ Install six <span>1.15</span>.0 successful
  ✔ Install wcwidth <span>0.2</span>.5 successful

🎉 All complete<span>!</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, <code>pytest</code> is pinned to <code>4.*</code> that is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6+.</p>
<p>For more features and demos, please refer to the <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/">PDM's website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/frostming/pdm">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="some-random-words"><a href="#some-random-words" aria-label="some random words permalink"></a>Some random words</h2>
<p>You may have seen this <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">comic</a> before, there are already so many package managers in Python's world, do we need a new one? No, I think. Gladly we have seen many improvements in the Python packaging ecosystem and the official installer pip, such as <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/">PEP 517</a>/<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/">PEP 518</a>, and the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/announcement-pip-20-2-release/4863">new dependency resolver</a>, more to come in the future. But before the day comes, why not try something different from the traditional, why not make something new that makes at least myself happy. If you think so, PDM should be an option, hopefully.</p></div></div>]]>

          <p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2500/4432/files/redorange1.jpg?v=1509458655" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>“We have a war between two food systems, a traditional diet of real food and ultra-processed food“</blockquote>
<p><br>…<a href="https://twitter.com/RobertLustigMD/status/909205874098397184">tweeted</a>&nbsp;Dr. Robert Lustig, a fellow Professor at UCSF School of Medicine. He’s right. But I&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/DrSepah/status/909240257270267904">replied</a>&nbsp;with the inconvenient truth few are willing to admit: “processed foods have won the war.” That isn’t to say we should be hopeless about the obesity epidemic, but we must soberingly admit our current strategy for curbing it is doomed. But there is another way. When other strategies fail, clinicians sometimes use “<a href="http://www.uncommon-knowledge.co.uk/articles/uncommon-hypnosis/problems-paradoxes.html">paradoxical interventions</a>” where the problem is prescribed as the cure. So this is a radical manifesto about how processed foods have not only caused the obesity epidemic, but can also cure it. To paraphrase Robert Frost:</p>
<blockquote>“The only way out is through.”</blockquote>
<h2><strong>S.A.D.! The Standard American Diet is 2/3 Processed Foods</strong></h2>
<p>Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, Dean of the Tufts School of Nutrition, and colleagues published one of the most eye-opening <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/3/e009892">studies</a> on the Standard American Diet (or what I humorously like to call “S.A.D.!”). Astonishingly, they showed that only 1/3 of calories come from ‘unprocessed’ (whole) foods anymore. The other 2/3 of calories come 10% from ‘minimally-processed’ foods (like cheese, which one could potentially make in a kitchen) and a staggering 57% from ‘ultra-processed’ foods (like Cheeze-It crackers, which can only be manufactured in a factory).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2500/4432/files/SADgraphic_grande.png?v=1510353917" alt=""></p>
<p>The evidence is clear. By a 2:1 margin, processed foods have dominated whole foods in America like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7TjFqCDrDs&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3B8MFT53a8TtCwx8jXcL1LLw%3D%3D">Mayweather over McGregor</a>. It’s no wonder, processed foods are widely perceived as cheaper, tastier, and more convenient than whole foods. But what people don’t fully realize is that processed foods are actually a dominant technology developed by a multi-trillion dollar food industry, and we are never, ever going back to the pre-industrial way things were. We live in a world of transformative technologies, and in a nation where <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2016/millennials-are-top-smartphone-users.html">98% of Millennials</a> own ‘smart’ phones, our society will clearly never go back to ‘dumb’ phones and pagers. So why do we expect any differently with food?</p>
<h2><strong>What Works for Some, Does Not Work for Most</strong></h2>
<p>For an individual, it is obviously possible to eat 100% whole foods. There are lots of great success stories of people who transformed their entire diets, lost 100 lbs., got off of their medications, etc. But just because “it worked for me”, doesn’t mean it will work for everyone else, because not everyone can “just do what I did.” Any clinician who has actually worked with thousands of patients know that different people have different levels of readiness to change, will require different approaches, and as a result, some will simply do better than others. This is not to downplay the importance of individual responsibility. As I tell my own patients:</p>
<blockquote>“It’s not your fault that you came into my office, but it is your responsibility to walk out better.”</blockquote>
<p><br>Thus, we must balance individual responsibility with acknowledging the data that most don’t succeed on their own. Educating the majority of Americans to only eat whole foods, without addressing how to manage processed foods, is like teaching “abstinence only” sex education, and expecting most people to never engage in sexual activity until marriage. Educational strategies that don’t acknowledge human behavior are hopelessly ineffective. We must acknowledge people indulge, and teach them how to reduce harm when they do so.</p>
<h2><strong>Convenience is King, and is More Sustainable Long-Term.</strong></h2>
<p>The science suggests that though doctors admonish their patients to “eat right and exercise”, this advice alone generally fails to work. In fact, in the placebo/control group (designed to show no effect) of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1351026/">Diabetes Prevention Program clinical trial</a>, patients were counterintuitively instructed to lose 5-10% of their body weight. That’s because researchers knew they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3135022/figure/F2/">wouldn’t lose any weight</a> anyway! Even the lifestyle (intensive counseling) and metformin (medication) groups, which did lose weight initially and significantly slow the onset of diabetes, eventually regained all the weight lost they lost after a decade.&nbsp;The temporary weight loss was still beneficial (reduced diabetes risk by 34% over 10 years), but would have been more powerful if the weight loss was maintained:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2500/4432/files/metformin_grande.gif?v=1510353972" alt=""></p>
<p>That’s because the law of inertia suggests any clinical treatment for obesity that expects patients to significantly do more work, instead of less, will eventually fail for most people in the long-term. Eating 100% whole foods was only sustainable for a society in a pre-industrial farming era, where the only foods we could eat were the whole foods we hunt, picked, and planted ourselves (that’s the real Omnivore’s Dilemma. Sorry, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/magazine/the-modern-huntergatherer.html">Michael Pollan</a>).</p>
<p>But most people no longer have the time, energy, or resources to eat three home-cooked meals per day. Modern households are no longer inter-generational, with fewer grandparents or stay-at-home spouses to bear the responsibility of communal food preparation. Even when TV dinners were introduced in the 1950s, they “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=vP99yWtfovYC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">came as a great relief</a> for housewives burdened with baby-boom offspring.” Convenience is king. But it’s not just because we don’t have time to prepare whole foods, it’s because processed foods are so behaviorally irresistible.</p>
<h2><strong>Obesity is More of a Behavioral than a Biological Problem.</strong></h2>
<p>In the medical community, obesity is considered a symptom of a larger ‘metabolic syndrome’, which shows up externally, as belly fat, but also internally as high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood fats. But these are actually symptoms of the root problem. While obesity is a complex, biopsychosocial issue with no easy explanation, the explosion in obesity rates suggest there’s something radical going on. &nbsp;If you look at this CDC time lapse of obesity rates from 1985-2010, most states went from &lt;10% obesity to &gt;30% obesity in the span of only 25 years!</p>
<p><iframe width="744" height="419" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ihSeSToXOw" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So what’s going on? The main driver is that the way we eat has changed dramatically: with people cooking less, eating out more, and relying more on processed, carbohydrate-rich foods that drive insulin resistance. Thus, this data suggests that obesity is more of a behavioral problem than a biological problem. These foods also serve a psychological need. Despite the current opioid crisis, eating is actually America’s favorite narcotic: with <a href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2013/eating.aspx">38% of adults</a> reporting “they have overeaten or eaten unhealthy foods in the past month because of stress.”</p>
<h2><strong>Most Ultra-Processed Foods Are ‘Designer Drugs’. We’re Hooked.</strong></h2>
<p>Americans are victims of an ‘obesogenic’ environment that has them hopelessly hooked to the most irresistible designer drug the world has ever known: ultra-processed foods. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Waistland-evolutionary-Weight-Fitness-Crisis-ebook/dp/B000W7KNDK/ref=pd_sim_351_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=0KHF98P7DGDENXB3A6CS">Waistland: A (R)evolutionary View of Our Weight and Fitness Crisis</a>, psychologist Deirdre Barrett argues out that human beings evolved to crave certain stimuli: fats, salts, and sweets, to help us survive and thrive through harsh times. “Big Food” companies exploited these natural cravings by designing processed foods that are far fattier, sweeter, and saltier than anything that normally exists in nature. Thus, processed foods are “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0034N7JI6/">supernormal stimuli</a>” purposefully designed to be addictive, and effectively outcompete whole foods on our tricked taste buds.</p>
<p>Lest you think this is a conspiracy theory — Big Food industry scientists have admitted they use such principles to create addictive foods. A New York Times article, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html">The Extraordinary Science of Addictive Junk Food</a>”, revealed that companies like Frito-Lay use $30 million R&amp;D budgets to hire research staffs of 500+ scientists to create ‘frankenfoods’ like Cheetos. Cheetos include technologies like “vanishing caloric density,” which make them melt in your mouth so quickly “your brain thinks that there’s no calories in it . . . you can just keep eating it forever.” In light of such irresistible foods, why do we actually expect people to exercise self-control and just “<a href="https://vimeo.com/97370236">stop it</a>”?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2500/4432/files/cheetos_large.jpg?v=1510354062" alt=""></p>
<h3><strong></strong></h3>
<h2><strong>All Drugs Aren’t Bad. All Processed Foods Aren’t Either.</strong></h2>
<p>In the modern era, we treat addiction as a disease, and often replace addictive and impure street drugs like heroin, with prescription opioid medications like methadone that are purified and better controlled to prevent deadly withdrawals and carefully wean people off. Street drugs and prescription drugs are both “drugs”, but can hardly be equated since the former often takes lives, while the latter can often give it back if properly prescribed and used.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can’t lump all processed foods together as being “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh7l8dx-h8M">bad, m’kay</a>?” Minimally-processed foods like yogurt, butter, and cheese, have been made at home for millennia and also ultra-processed in factories more recently. Studies show dairy consumption is associated with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28318689">lower risk</a> of type 2 diabetes. The devil is always in the details though, and a ball of handmade mozzarella cheese is hardly the same thing as processed cheese slices that have so little actual cheese in them the FDA requires legally labeling them as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processed_cheese#Legal_definitions">cheese product</a>.”</p>
<h2><strong>Intentions Matter: Processing for Health vs. Wealth.</strong></h2>
<p>So we should just avoid ultra-processed foods by avoiding all those chemical sounding ingredients we can’t pronounce, right? While this ‘chemophobia’ can be a helpful shortcut, it’s also not always accurate. If you analyze any whole food like a Kiwi, it’s technically made up of a lot of ‘chemicals’ that naturally exist in nature:</p>
<p>Just because a food is ultra-processed or fortified with added ingredients doesn’t inherently make it unhealthy. While the <a href="http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/exclusive_breastfeeding/en/">World Health Organization</a> educates mothers that breastfeeding for the first 6 months is the “optimal way of feeding infants”, it also acknowledges that infant formula can play an essential or supplementary role in keeping infants alive and healthy when mothers cannot breastfeed regularly. Thus, some ultra-processed foods are optimized for health more than cost or taste, due to tighter government regulations and more selectivity by consumers.</p>

it is secure."><div><p>We explain how CryFS works and why it is secure.</p><p>The description can be a bit technical in some points. If you're rather interested in using CryFS, take a look at the <a>CryFS Tutorial</a>.</p></div></section><section><div><h2>Storing data</h2><div><p><img src="https://www.cryfs.org/_next/static/images/storingdata-6e5ee2b5bc550e4d8be92cbcd80b9011.png" alt="Your files, metadata and directory structure are stored as a set of same-size blocks, encrypted, and stored in the cloud."></p><div><p>The goal of CryFS is not only to keep file contents, but also file sizes, metadata and directory structure confidential.</p><p>To hide file sizes, CryFS splits the content of a file into same-size blocks and encrypts these blocks individually.
A tree structure is used to remember how the blocks belong together to form a file.
This tree structure has very little overhead and itself is also stored using encrypted same-size blocks.
To hide file metadata and directory structure, they are also represented using encrypted same-size blocks.</p><p>Each encrypted block is stored as a file in the base directory, using a random ID as filename.
The base directory can then be set up to be synchronized with a cloud provider like Dropbox.
An attacker with access to the base directory can only see a set of same-size ciphertext blocks and can't see
contents, file sizes, metadata or directory structure of your data.</p><p>The blocks are encrypted using a block cipher chosen by the user. A random encryption key is generated when the filesystem is created.
This key is stored in a configuration file, which is then encrypted using the password chosen by the user.
Since it is encrypted, it can be stored together with the ciphertext blocks in the cloud, which is the default.
If you want to use an insecure (e.g. empty) password or don't trust the scrypt algorithm used for encrypting the configuration file, you can also keep the configuration file locally.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div><h2>Configuration File</h2><p>The base directory also contains a configuration file with the information CryFS needs to decrypt it.
This configuration file is encrypted and integrity-checked using the password chosen by the user, so an attacker cannot read or modify it.</p><p>The information stored in the configuration file includes the following.</p><ul><li><strong>[Cipher]</strong>: The cipher used (e.g. <var>aes-256-gcm</var>)</li><li><strong>[Encryption Key]</strong>: The encryption key used for encrypting blocks</li><li><strong>[Root Block ID]</strong>: The block ID for the block storing the root directory (entry point for the filesystem)</li></ul><div><div><p>The configuration file is encrypted twice, once with <var>aes-256-gcm</var> and once with the cipher chosen by the user.
This way, if the user doesn't trust <var>aes-256-gcm</var> for some reason,
they can choose another cipher and still be secure.
The keys for both encryption layers are generated from the user-chosen password using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">scrypt</a>.</p><p>In detail, CryFS generates two keys <var>outer_key</var> and <var>inner_key</var> using scrypt and the user password.
It encrypts the configuration file using the user cipher and <var>inner_key</var>.
To the ciphertext, it prepends the name of the user cipher (so it knows how to decrypt it later) and encrypts
the result using <var>aes-256-gcm</var> and <var>outer_key</var>. This way, an attacker cannot see or manipulate which cipher is used.
As a last step, the scrypt configuration parameters are prepended, so CryFS knows how to configure scrypt when
decrypting the filesystem.
When decrypting the configuration file, CryFS first reads the scrypt parameters and regenerates both keys from the user password.
Then, it decrypts the first layer and reads the cipher chosen by the user.
Using this cipher, it decrypts the second layer and reads the configuration values.</p></div><p><img src="https://www.cryfs.org/_next/static/images/configfileencryption-3ae7bd61acfdd365aab16b721dbbcfad.png" alt="Configuration File Encryption Layers"></p></div><p>The integrity of the configuration file depends on <var>aes-256-gcm</var>.
This cipher is a standard cipher and believed to be very secure.
If, however, you don't trust the integrity of <var>aes-256-gcm</var> and want to use another cipher instead,
we recommend adding the <kbd>--cipher xxx</kbd> parameter each time you mount the filesystem.
This way, CryFS can check that the cipher used by the filesystem is the one you actually specified
and you don't have to rely on the <var>aes-256-gcm</var> integrity verification step.</p><p>Alternatively, you can store the configuration file outside of the base directory and not upload it into the cloud.<br>
This is possible using the <kbd>--config</kbd> parameter when calling CryFS.</p></div></section><section><div><h2>Security Analysis</h2><p>The security of CryFS has been proven in a <a href="https://www.cryfs.org/cryfs_mathesis.pdf">master's thesis</a>
and in a <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61176-1_23">scientific paper published at DBSec 2017</a>
(<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/773.pdf">PDF</a>) using a game-based security approach.
The works also contain a detailed description of the inner workings of CryFS.</p><p>The current version meets all security goals regarding confidentiality of file contents, size, metadata and directory structure.
The integrity goals mentioned in the thesis are also implemented as of version 0.10.0.
The 0.9.x versions protect the encrypted blocks from being modified by an attacker,
since they use an authenticated encryption scheme like <var>aes-256-gcm</var>,
but they don't prevent an attacker from rolling back the filesystem by replacing blocks with an earlier valid version of the same block yet.</p></div></section><section></section> <section></section></div></div>]]>

As it's the NAT or firewall that opens the destination port, this bypasses any browser-based port restrictions.</p><p>This attack takes advantage of arbitrary control of the data portion of some TCP and UDP packets <i>without</i> including HTTP or other headers; the attack performs this new packet injection technique across all major modern (and older) browsers, and is a modernized version to my original <a target="_blank" href="https://samy.pl/natpin/">NAT Pinning technique from 2010</a> (presented at DEFCON 18 + Black Hat 2010). Additionally, new techniques for local IP address discovery are included.</p><p>This attack requires the NAT/firewall to support ALG (Application Level Gateways), which are mandatory for protocols that can use multiple ports (control channel + data channel) such as SIP and H323 (VoIP protocols), FTP, IRC DCC, etc.</p><div>

  <li>non-malicious usage: this technique essentially gives browsers full TCP and UDP socket capability to communicate to any protocol locally on the system; the connection can be abstracted through a cloud server that connects back but the browser just talks to the cloud server as if it's the socket and makes browsers much more powerful to communicate on non-web-friendly protocols</li>
  <li>if testing in a virtual machine (VM) using shared networking (used to protect a host from attacks by routing it through the host, not letting it directly onto the network), if the packets make it out, the parent host machine is where the ports end up getting opened, not the VM ;)</li>
  <li>IP fragmentation allows full control of all data in the IP data section, meaning full control of the <b>UDP header</b>, including source/dest ports in the overflowed packet...what else could this abuse?</li>

<h2 id="network-address-translation-nat">Network Address Translation (NAT)</h2>

<p>We use NATs (Network Address Translation) for several reasons. The most useful feature of NAT is that it allows a single public IP address to be shared among multiple systems. It does this by creating a local network, providing local IP addresses to all machines that connect, and when one of those systems reaches out to the Internet, it rewrites packets going out to use the public IP so responses come back to the NAT, and vice versa, rewriting destination IP to specific client's IP. </p>

<p>It's the responsibility of the NAT to differentiate connections to the same addresses/ports (google.com:443) from internal hosts as ultimately their outbound port, destination ip and source ip will all be the same. If two different internal peers attempt to connect from the same source port, modern NATs will alter one of the source ports (some networks do this to all TCP/UDP source ports).</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samyk/slipstream/main/img/lan.png" alt="NAT"></p>

<h3 id="connection-tracking">Connection Tracking</h3>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Netfilter">Wikipedia à la Wikiwand</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>One of the important features built on top of the Netfilter 
framework is connection tracking. Connection tracking 
allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network 
connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets
which may make up that connection. NAT relies on this 
information to translate all related packets in the same way, 
and iptables can use this information to act as a stateful 
firewall.</code></pre></div>

<p>If a machine behind your NAT sends a packet out and your router expects the remote host may respond, it keeps track of information, specifically the source and destination ports, source and destination IP addresses, and your internal IP, then returns any packets matching it back to your internal IP.</p>

<p>If another host on your LAN attempts to make the same connection with the same source and destination ports + IPs, your NAT wouldn't be able to discriminate it (the source IPs are different on your LAN but are rewritten to the same public IP on the WAN side), so it alters the source port, but rewrites it when sending back to you.</p>

<h3 id="application-level-gateway">Application Level Gateway</h3>

<p>ALGs allow NAT to track a multi-port protocol like FTP to go out from your system to an FTP server, then track when you request a file to be sent to your internal IP on a specific port, the ALG can rewrite the packet to include your public IP, then forward the FTP's server connection back to you. Had it not rewritten your IP, the FTP server would try to connect back to you on your internal IP (or not try at all if it expects the source IP to be the same as the signaling connection).</p>

<h3>Release Date:</h3><p>
January 26, 2021
</p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>
A serious heap-based buffer overflow has been discovered in sudo
that is exploitable by any local user. It has been given the name
<em>Baron Samedit</em> by its discoverer. The bug can be leveraged
to elevate privileges to root, even if the user is not listed in
the sudoers file. User authentication is not required to exploit
the bug.
</p><h3>Sudo versions affected:</h3><p>
Sudo versions 1.8.2 through 1.8.31p2 and 1.9.0 through 1.9.5p1 are
affected.
</p><h3>CVE ID:</h3><p>
This vulnerability has been assigned <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156" onclick="getOutboundLink('http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156');">CVE-2021-3156</a>
in the <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/" onclick="getOutboundLink('http://cve.mitre.org/');">Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures</a> database.
</p><h3>Details:</h3><p>
When sudo runs a command in <em>shell</em> mode, either via the
<strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-i</strong> command line option, it
escapes special characters in the command's arguments with a backslash.
The sudoers policy plugin will then remove the escape characters from
the arguments before evaluating the sudoers policy (which doesn't
expect the escape characters) if the command is being run in shell
mode.
</p><p>
A bug in the code that removes the escape characters will read
beyond the last character of a string if it ends with an unescaped
backslash character. Under normal circumstances, this bug would
be harmless since sudo has escaped all the backslashes in the
command's arguments. However, due to a different bug, this time
in the command line parsing code, it is possible to run <tt>sudoedit</tt>
with either the <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-i</strong> options,
setting a flag that indicates shell mode is enabled. Because a
command is not actually being run, sudo does <strong>not</strong>
escape special characters. Finally, the code that decides whether
to remove the escape characters did not check whether a command is
actually being run, just that the shell flag is set. This inconsistency
is what makes the bug exploitable.
</p><p>
To test whether your version of sudo is vulnerable, the following
command can be used:
</p><pre>sudoedit -s '\' `perl -e 'print "A" x 65536'`
</pre><p>
If you receive a usage or error message, sudo is not vulnerable.
If the result is a <strong>Segmentation fault</strong>, sudo is
vulnerable.
</p><p>

</p><h3>Impact:</h3><p>
A local user may be able to exploit sudo to elevate privileges to
root as long as the sudoers file (usually /etc/sudoers) is present.
</p><h3>Workaround:</h3><p>
None. Sudo version 1.9.5p2 or a patched vendor-supported version
must be installed.
</p><h3>Fix:</h3><p>
The bug is fixed in sudo 1.9.5p2.
</p><h3>Credit:</h3><p>
Thanks to the Qualys Security Advisory team for their detailed bug
report and explanation of its implications.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Fear and panic could destroy the city as much as plague itself. Many of the doctors fled, along with the rich and powerful; quacks preyed on the poor with their neverfail miracle drugs. Neighbours informed against each other. People lied to each other – and to themselves. Worse – there were stories of infected people deliberately concealing their telltale ‘tokens’ and going out into the streets trying to infect others.</p><p>-Daniel Defoe, <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em> (1722)</p></blockquote><h5>Zeynep Tüfekçi is a force of nature whose intellectual range encompasses everything from academic sociology to the impact of social media on society to (more recently) the COVID mask and lockdown debates. Her book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3hibL21">Twitter and Tear Gas</a></em> is a now-classic study of Internet-fueled protest, and she continues to write prolifically for <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/zeynep-tufekci">The New York Times</a> </em> and <em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/zeynep-tufekci/">The Atlantic</a>. </em>In our lengthy interview—I completely ignored Substack warnings about email length—I unveil the jocular coinage ‘zeynepping’ to describe this unique blend of contrarian and wide-ranging embroilment in the burning issues of the day. She and I have had a year-long DM thread where we agree on basically nothing, except perhaps that McLuhan was right about the fundamentally oral dynamics of modern digital media (which we only mention in passing here, because of course we spent most of our time bickering). She agreed to publicize some of our disagreement in the longest <em>Pull Request</em> interview yet. Tüfekçi also recently started <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/">her own Substack </a><em><a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/">Insight</a></em>.</h5><p><strong>From what you’ve told me, you started your career as a programmer but then you ended up doing a master's degree and PhD. But your claim to fame was the book on Twitter and the Middle East and its various convulsions, is that right?</strong></p><p>My first claim to fame was when Facebook started. It was just seen as a little college thing, and I started writing that it would scramble our understanding of privacy. It was just collapsing a lot of geographic boundaries, and since I was a college teacher, I could see it in the students’ experience; their mental model of what Facebook was and what it actually did to their experience of space and time. I remember one incident: I used to teach intro to sociology and it's a big lecture class, because that's how those things work. So I would assign little group assignments to break up the lecture. What if you were born a different gender? Or what if you were in a different family? Just very simple, simple stuff for students. And they got a passing grade so long as they turned in something. </p><p>So my TA at one point notices that a bunch of them have the same handwriting. Why on earth are they cheating, what is going on? So I called the group into my office, and they say: <em>What a coincidence we all have the same handwriting!</em> And I ask: <em>Do you know each other?</em> <em>No, we don't know each other</em>, they say. And I did something that I don't ever do: I looked them up on Facebook. And of course, they were all friends with each other, so I just showed them Facebook and I said: <em>Look, you're lying to me, you're all friends with each other</em>. They almost fainted in my office because the idea that their friendship could be documented and be visible to the outside world and that Facebook would be a vehicle for this was a completely alien and incomprehensible thing to these kids.</p><p>The most interesting thing to me was how could they not imagine the obvious thing that this is going to scramble their visibility and ruin their denial. They just had no idea. So I started doing some studies…</p><p><strong>What year was this?</strong></p><p>This was before the Arab Spring, I think my first studies where 2007 or 2008-ish?</p><p>I started saying stuff like: <em>Facebook, they're going to scramble privacy, they are changing how we understand primary and secondary social contacts and their visibility</em>. I started arguing that in some ways—and this is something you and I talk about a lot—this is taking people back to a more intrinsically human way of living, in which you don't lose contact with people. This idea that you've graduated from middle school, and then high school, and then go to a different city and never see those people again, that's kind of a weird 20th-century blip: that's not how humans have mostly lived. But at a scale that is not the same as your village or hunter-gatherer experience. It's got a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and it's going to scramble everything. I kept saying this is going to change the fabric of society, these tools are not these things that just sit outside of society. </p><p>And when the Arab Spring hit, then all of a sudden, because I’m from the Middle East, all of a sudden, people were like: <em>Oh, wait, there was somebody talking about this</em>, and everybody wanted an explanation. That’s when I started being able to do my current work as until then universities would hire me because I could do stats and math. The rest has been a blur.</p><p><strong>I recall first reading your work in the wake of the Arab Spring. The Western vibe at the time was definitely: </strong><em><strong>Isn't this just great and amazing?</strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>Twitter is central to this entire social turmoil</strong></em><strong>! Though in retrospect, it might not have had the centrality that Westerners imagined, in terms of the bigger picture…</strong></p><p>But it actually was really important. What's really funny is that a lot of these people are also my friends and people I had known because of the Middle Eastern democracy and dissident crowds. They got so sick of Western journalists asking them about Twitter and Facebook every day, they would just lie, and say: <em>It had nothing to do with any saying. Stop this bullshit. You know, we don't really use those tools</em>.</p><p>They would literally say that, and then they would be on the backchannel saying:<em> Wait, I think the Twitter trending algorithm changed,</em> because they were disassembling it, and they thought about it a lot. But they got so sick of the navel gazing about it because the West could only relate to them as Twitter users. So I wouldn't say it didn't play a key role: I think it played a major role in the upheaval. But it got framed in the West as a stupid question. You know, <em>was it Twitter or was it the people?</em> I felt like stabbing my eyes out when people ask those kinds of questions, so that's when I start writing about it.</p><h4>We have the same narrative about social media in the West now: When it's destabilizing to the people that the chattering classes don't like, it's great. And when it's destabilizing to the chattering classes, then it's terrible: we don't do <em>that</em> to <em>them.</em></h4><p><strong>Right. So the two claims are: This Twitter/Facebook thing is absolutely central. Again, the only way we can relate to these people is via their Twitter usage, otherwise, the local politics are not of vital interest from the Western perspective. And then secondly, that this was all a magnificent thing.</strong></p><p><strong>But as soon as those same disruptions visit the West in the form of Trump, Brexit, the </strong><em><strong>gilets jaunes</strong></em><strong>, etc. Suddenly: </strong><em><strong>Have we questioned whether overthrowing the state of affairs is actually such a great thing??</strong></em><strong> It's interesting to see the contrast between that sort of narrative and the one in 2016.</strong></p><p>We have the same narrative about social media in the West now: When it's destabilizing the people that the chattering classes don't like, it's great. And when it's destabilizing the chattering classes, then it's terrible: we don't do <em>that</em> to <em>them.</em></p><p>When Obama won in 2012, there were I don't know how many articles talking about how great his use of technology and data was. Which is why I started saying: <em>wait, wait, it's not about your candidate, this might not be that great, and there are all these problems</em>. Interestingly, when I started saying that—<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/opinion/beware-the-big-data-campaign.html">I wrote that </a><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/opinion/beware-the-big-data-campaign.html">Times </a></em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/opinion/beware-the-big-data-campaign.html">op-ed</a>, which caused so much grief for me—I heard from so many tech people, from Obama people and big data people and Silicon Valley people, who told me that these tools were necessarily going to only be used by smart people, which were of course them, right? I mean, the whole tech world was completely convinced that the other side, so to speak, would never be smart like them. Really high level people in both the Obama administration and in Silicon Valley just thought: <em>you know, this is ours, this will always be ours, and it will always do our bidding.</em> And of course, anybody who knows history is jumping up and down saying <em>it doesn't do your bidding like that!</em> It's not your little pony that's gonna just destabilize things you happen to dislike at the moment and leave you alone. So here we are.</p><h4>I heard from so many tech people, from Obama people and big data people and Silicon Valley people, who told me that these tools were necessarily going to only be used by smart people, which were of course them, right?

Really high level people in both the Obama administration and in Silicon Valley just thought: <em>you know, this is ours, this will always be ours, and it will always do our bidding.</em></h4><p><strong>You and I both have the same hang ups, because we've had these conversations before, such as the conflict between literacy and orality, the weird warping of geography that social media causes, which to me is one of the biggest things I can't get my head around. </strong></p><p><strong>But just before we leave the topic of the Middle East: One thing <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/the-prophet-of-the-revolt">I asked Martin Gurri about</a> is how is it that a lot of these movements, unlike previous revolutionary movements, didn't quite congeal into any sort of lasting institutional change. The classic example is Occupy Wall Street and to a lesser extent the </strong><em><strong>Gilets Jaunes</strong></em><strong> which haven't really done anything in the political space. Arguably the only counter example is Spain with Podemos…</strong></p><p>In Spain, the group just broke off. They just said, we're gonna form a political party. And that's it. </p><p>If you skimmed my book, my theory there is that these movements look like past movements, in that they have these big massive street marches.

                    <p>250+ Developers, SREs, DevOps, Architects and Product Managers have spoken: they struggle with releasing microservices into production. It remains a costly, manual, error-prone and nail-biting task for software teams. In our report we dive into challenges, trends and opportunities for improvement when it comes to releasing and validating software in production. </p><p>The survey spotlights the stark challenges SMBs and enterprises are facing as they pursue their cloud, Kubernetes and microservices journey. The need for release automation increases as systems become more complex (dependencies, highly distributed, different release frequencies) and the pressure from the business to release software faster (and more frequently) is higher than ever.</p><h3 id="kubernetes-and-microservices-have-become-mainstream">Kubernetes and Microservices Have Become Mainstream</h3><p>72% of participants say that they are using Kubernetes in production today and 16% says that they are evaluating or planning to use Kubernetes. Microservices are even more popular. 81% of participants say that they are using microservices in production today and 14% says they have plans to use microservices.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png 1000w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png 1001w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://vamp.io/state-of-cloud-native-release-orchestration-2021"><strong>Download the full report State of Cloud-Native Release Orchestration here.</strong></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="majority-is-still-using-high-risk-release-strategies">Majority Is Still Using High-Risk Release Strategies</h3><p>Releasing in production is the process of taking running code and making it “live” and accessible to users, in a predictable and repeatable way. It's about paying particular attention to ensure that releasing a new version doesn’t result in a worse experience for your users. 86% of participants are still using high-risk release strategies such as rolling update, blue-green and big-bang releases. There is a strong lack of canary releasing capabilities with only 9% of participants using this low-risk release strategy. Canary releasing limits the number of users exposed to a bad release (known as limiting the blast radius) by gradually rolling out a new version of a service to a small, representative subgroup of <em><em>real</em></em> user traffic before rolling it out to the entire user base.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/release-strategy-image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/release-strategy-image.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/release-strategy-image.png 723w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="release-validation-and-rollbacks-remain-a-manual-time-consuming-task">Release Validation and Rollbacks Remain A Manual, Time-Consuming Task</h3><p>Release validation is the process of making sure that released software that’s running in production is meeting the requirements in terms of performance, quality, customer experience and business KPIs. On average it takes 2.2 hours with 4 people engaged during the release validation process.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/image-blog.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-blog.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/image-blog.png 723w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Rollbacks are a critical part of your release strategy. When implemented right, it creates a safety net to protect your software teams and minimize the impact on the customer experience when issues are starting to occur. 53% of rollbacks are done manually with an average time to rollback of 45 minutes.</p><h3 id="dependency-management-is-the-biggest-challenge-when-it-comes-to-releasing-microservices">Dependency Management Is The Biggest Challenge When It Comes To Releasing Microservices</h3><p>The report revealed that dependency management is the biggest challenge when it comes to releasing microservices in production. Twenty percent of respondents struggle with dependency management, 14% struggle with internal processes and communication, and 10% find validating changing and testing microservices a challenge.</p><h3 id="the-state-of-cloud-native-release-orchestration-2021">The State of Cloud-Native Release Orchestration 2021</h3><p>This blog only scratches the surface of The State of Cloud-Native Release Orchestration, which dives into further topics including release metrics, business drivers to go Cloud-Native, most used monitoring tools and where companies are focussing on when it comes to improvements across the software delivery process in 2021. <a href="https://vamp.io/state-of-cloud-native-release-orchestration-2021">Download the full research report for free</a> and share with interested colleagues.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/Group-70-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Group-70-1.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Group-70-1.png 1000w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/Group-70-1.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://vamp.io/state-of-cloud-native-release-orchestration-2021"><strong>Download the full research report for free here.</strong></a></figcaption></figure>

		<p>It should come as no surprise that we here at Plex are media lovers. Consummate curators of all that streamy goodness. Voracious imbibers at the fount of all content. Okay, gross, but you get the point. Anyway, every so often an armchair Reddit philosopher comes forth to question some basic truths: “What exactly is the nature of ‘Media’?” they ask. And “How can Plex help us media lovers more fully consummate our curationship?” Okay, sorry, gross again. But it’s a fair question, and one that deserves a little more attention.</p>
<p>Not to date ourselves, but quite a few of us are products of the ‘80s and ‘90s. And when we think about the media that shaped our childhoods and young adult lives, there was one thing that defined us and made it clear that even though we were weird, at the very least we weren’t weird alone. That’s right: <em>stamp collections!</em></p>
<p>Oh wait. We meant VIDEO GAMES.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SYepu_5oSOc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>In the beginning…</h3>
<p>The genesis of Plex saw us casting a disdainful eye over shelves of CDs, DVDs, and random files strewn over hard drives; we knew there had to be a better way to centrally organize and curate our media collections. A safe haven free from scratches and <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bewaring-of-the-green/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">green markers</a>. A place where we could Marie Kondo until every last poster and background was perfect, and then explore and play from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>But there was one category left on that media shelf, gathering dust. It was the old plastic cartridges for our beloved gaming consoles of yore. After all, in the years since our youth, fellow curators have managed to amass rich archives of gorgeous metadata for games, and the retro gaming community truly does run deep. It’s a fantastic movement, and after some soul searching and spiritual walkabouts, the answer arrived: this media belongs inside Plex!</p>
<p>We’ve actually kicked the idea around for years, and given that over the last year we’ve been looking for new ways to entertain and distract ourselves, we decided to finally make it happen. And we gotta say, the results are super cool! It’s so fun to see a collection of ROMs rendered as a Plex library with all the power of filtering, searching, and beautiful details pages, but of course that’s only half the picture…</p>

<h3>Let there be light!</h3>
<p>Video and audio streaming have always been our specialty. We’re blessed with some amazing engineers (among the best in the world!) working on this, and in general we’ve been laser focused on making that experience better.</p>
<p>However, over time we’ve seen some truly impressive developments in interactive game streaming tech. Please allow us to introduce our new partner <a href="https://parsec.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parsec</a>: With their underlying low-latency streaming technology, it was suddenly possible to offer <em>fully playable</em> game libraries within Plex.</p>
<h3>Let the library teem with games</h3>




<p>We’ve also partnered with the most hallowed name in retro games: Atari. With them on board as a partner we’re able to fully license a catalog of classic titles right out of the box. We’re talking Centipede. We’re talking Lunar Lander. We’re talking Motor Psycho!</p>

<p>On account of these partnerships and the licensing involved, Plex Arcade will be a separate subscription for <span data-pp-price-feature="arcade"></span> per month if you have a Plex Pass (and <span data-pp-price-feature="arcade"></span> per month if you haven’t made the leap to Plex Pass yet). Don’t know if you’ll like it? <a href="https://www.plex.tv/arcade/checkout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Try it free for 7 days</strong></a> (that’s a whole week among friends), no strings attached, and let us know what you think.</p>
<h3>Be fruitful</h3>
<p>Look. This effort is real, but if we’re honest it was conceived by a few passionate Plex Labs rats over scorpion bowls at <a href="https://www.mamasfishhouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mama’s</a>. For now, we’ve convinced the powers-that-be to let us run with it, but we know it’s far from done and we see it as a kind of internal Kickstarter-type project.

<p>There are a few limitations you should be aware of: For now, the server only works on Windows and macOS (sorry, Parsec doesn’t offer their libraries on Linux or other platforms currently, meaning it is not available for servers running on Linux, NAS devices, or NVIDIA SHIELD); and gameplay is restricted to Android (mobile and TV), iOS, tvOS, and the Chrome web browser.</p>
<p>To get started, grab the latest Plex Media Server, and create a new Games library, just like you would for any of your existing media types. We’re working on relaxing these limitations, but for now they’re real.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><a href="https://samy.pl/slipstream/">NAT Slipstreaming</a> allows an attacker to remotely access any TCP/UDP service bound to <b>any system</b> behind a victim's NAT, bypassing the victim's NAT/firewall (remote arbitrary firewall pinhole control), just by the victim visiting a website.</p><p><em>animation generated with my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/samyk/drawio">fork</a> of <a target="_blank" href="https://draw.io/">draw.io</a>, allowing exportable edge context flow &amp; control in animations</em></p><p>NAT Slipstreaming exploits the user's browser in conjunction with the Application Level Gateway (ALG) connection tracking mechanism built into NATs, routers, and firewalls by chaining internal IP extraction via timing attack or WebRTC, automated remote MTU and IP fragmentation discovery, TCP packet size massaging, TURN authentication misuse, precise packet boundary control, and protocol confusion through browser abuse. As it's the NAT or firewall that opens the destination port, this bypasses any browser-based port restrictions.</p><p>This attack takes advantage of arbitrary control of the data portion of some TCP and UDP packets <i>without</i> including HTTP or other headers; the attack performs this new packet injection technique across all major modern (and older) browsers, and is a modernized version to my original <a target="_blank" href="https://samy.pl/natpin/">NAT Pinning technique from 2010</a> (presented at DEFCON 18 + Black Hat 2010). Additionally, new techniques for local IP address discovery are included.</p><p>This attack requires the NAT/firewall to support ALG (Application Level Gateways), which are mandatory for protocols that can use multiple ports (control channel + data channel) such as SIP and H323 (VoIP protocols), FTP, IRC DCC, etc.</p><div>
  <li>victim visits malicious site (or site with malicious advertisement)<!-- eg <a target=_blank href="https://samy.pl/slipstream/server">https://samy.pl/slipstream/server</a>--></li>
<li>internal IP of victim first must be extracted by browser and sent to server

<ul>
<li>internal IP attempted to be extracted via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/">WebRTC</a> data channel over https</li>
<ul>
<li>some browsers (Chrome) only divulge the local IP via WebRTC over HTTPS but some of our attacks require HTTP so we first redirect to the HTTPS version of the attack software to extract the local IP</li>
<li>we then redirect to the HTTP version with the local IP included in the URL if we were able to obtain it to bypass other cross-origin protection mechanisms (the <code>.local</code> mDNS/Bonjour address presented will not be useful for the attack)</li>
</ul>
<li>if internal IP not divulged by WebRTC (Safari) or no WebRTC (&lt;= IE11), <strong>web-based TCP timing attack performed</strong>

<ul>
<li>hidden <code>img</code> tags to all common gateways (eg <code>192.168.0.1</code>) are loaded in background</li>
<li><code>onerror/onsuccess</code> events attached to <code>img</code> tags</li>
<li>if any TCP RST (onerror) returned by gateway, or SYN + HTTP response (onsuccess), within a few seconds (before TCP timeout triggers onerror), we've detected valid subnet</li>
<li>re-perform timing attack across all IPs on detected subnets (/24), measuring time to onerror/onsuccess firing</li>
<li>fastest response is likely internal IP, though all responses are considered victim internal IP candidates and attacked</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>large TCP beacon sent via hidden form and automatic HTTP POST to attacker "HTTP server" bound to a non-standard port to force TCP segmentation and maximum MTU size discovery of the victim's IP stack
<ul>
<li>attacker TCP server sends <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.1">Maximum Segment Size</a> TCP Option to massage victim outbound packet sizes (<a target="_blank" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.1">RFC 793 x3.1</a>), allowing control of how large browser TCP packets will be</li>
</ul></li>
<li>large UDP beacon sent from browser via WebRTC TURN authentication mechanism to non-standard port to attacker's server to force IP fragmentation with TURN <code>username</code> field stuffed
<ul>
<li>we perform a similar attack as our TCP segmentation, but over UDP as IP fragmentation will occur and provide different values than TCP segmentation</li>
<li>victim MTU size, IP header size, IP packet size, TCP header size, TCP segment sizes detected by server and sent back to victim's browser, used later for packet stuffing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(v1) "SIP packet" in new hidden form generated, containing internal IP to trigger Application Level Gateway connection tracking
<ul>
<li>"HTTP POST" to server on TCP port 5060 (SIP port) initiated, avoiding <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/samyk/chromium/blob/2d57e5b8afc6d01b344a8d95d3470d46b35845c5/net/base/port_util.cc#L20-L90">restricted browser ports</a></li>
<li>POST data is "stuffed" to exact TCP segment size / packet boundary, then “SIP packet” appended and posted via web form</li>
<li><b>victim IP stack breaks the POST into multiple TCP packets, leaving the "SIP packet" (as part of POST data) in its own TCP packet without any accompanying HTTP headers</b></li>
<li>if browser alters size of multipart/form boundary (Firefox) or packet size changes for any other reason, size change is communicated back to client and client auto-resends with new size</li>
<li>when opening UDP port, SIP packet is sent over TURN protocol inside specially crafted <code>username</code> field forcing IP fragmentation and precise boundary control</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(v2) "H.323 packet" using TCP-based STUN (bypassing patches for v1 and browser port restrictions) connection generated, containing internal IP to trigger Application Level Gateway connection tracking, but forcing a redirect to <strong>any other host on the network</strong> in a "call forwarding" packet
<ul>
<li>"H.323 call forward" to server on TCP port 1720 (H.323 port) initiated, avoiding <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/samyk/chromium/blob/2d57e5b8afc6d01b344a8d95d3470d46b35845c5/net/base/port_util.cc#L20-L90">restricted browser ports</a>, despite the port being blocked -- port evasion performed by using WebRTC STUN feature which does not respect the restricted port list</li>
<li><code>username</code> field is "stuffed" to exact TCP segment size / packet boundary, then “H.323 packet” appended and posted via web form</li>
<li><b>victim IP stack breaks the POST into multiple TCP packets, leaving the "H.323 packet" (as part of STUN data) in its own TCP packet without any accompanying HTTP headers</b></li>
<li>if browser alters size of multipart/form boundary (Firefox) or packet size changes for any other reason, size change is communicated back to client and client auto-resends with new size</li>
</ul></li>
<li>victim NAT sees proper SIP REGISTER packet on SIP port or proper H.323 call forward packet (with no HTTP data), triggering ALG to open any TCP/UDP port defined in packet back to any victim host on the network
<ul>
<li>victim NAT rewrites SIP or H.323 packet, replacing internal IP with public IP, hinting to attacker exploit was successful</li>
<li>(v2) as H.323 call forwarding can direct to any other IP, packet can contain any internal IP of any other host on the victim's network, triggering the NAT to port forward to any system on the network</li>
<li>even if victim NAT normally rewrites source ports, the ALG will still be forced to port forward to the attacker's port of choice as it believes victim machine (or other machine on the network, entirely determined by attacker) opened that port and attacker sees new source port in arriving SIP/H.323 packet </li>
<li><b>attacker can now bypass victim NAT and connect directly back to any port on any machine on the network, exposing previously protected/hidden services and systems</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>to investigate...perhaps by you?</i>
<ul>
  <li>non-malicious usage: this technique essentially gives browsers full TCP and UDP socket capability to communicate to any protocol locally on the system; the connection can be abstracted through a cloud server that connects back but the browser just talks to the cloud server as if it's the socket and makes browsers much more powerful to communicate on non-web-friendly protocols</li>
  <li>if testing in a virtual machine (VM) using shared networking (used to protect a host from attacks by routing it through the host, not letting it directly onto the network), if the packets make it out, the parent host machine is where the ports end up getting opened, not the VM ;)</li>
  <li>IP fragmentation allows full control of all data in the IP data section, meaning full control of the <b>UDP header</b>, including source/dest ports in the overflowed packet...what else could this abuse?</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="network-address-translation-nat">Network Address Translation (NAT)</h2>

<p>We use NATs (Network Address Translation) for several reasons. The most useful feature of NAT is that it allows a single public IP address to be shared among multiple systems. It does this by creating a local network, providing local IP addresses to all machines that connect, and when one of those systems reaches out to the Internet, it rewrites packets going out to use the public IP so responses come back to the NAT, and vice versa, rewriting destination IP to specific client's IP. </p>

<p>It's the responsibility of the NAT to differentiate connections to the same addresses/ports (google.com:443) from internal hosts as ultimately their outbound port, destination ip and source ip will all be the same. If two different internal peers attempt to connect from the same source port, modern NATs will alter one of the source ports (some networks do this to all TCP/UDP source ports).</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samyk/slipstream/main/img/lan.png" alt="NAT"></p>

<h3 id="connection-tracking">Connection Tracking</h3>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Netfilter">Wikipedia à la Wikiwand</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>One of the important features built on top of the Netfilter 
framework is connection tracking. Connection tracking 
allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network 
connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets
which may make up that connection. NAT relies on this 
information to translate all related packets in the same way, 
and iptables can use this information to act as a stateful 
firewall.</code></pre></div>

<p>If a machine behind your NAT sends a packet out and your router expects the remote host may respond, it keeps track of information, specifically the source and destination ports, source and destination IP addresses, and your internal IP, then returns any packets matching it back to your internal IP.</p>

<p>If another host on your LAN attempts to make the same connection with the same source and destination ports + IPs, your NAT wouldn't be able to discriminate it (the source IPs are different on your LAN but are rewritten to the same public IP on the WAN side), so it alters the source port, but rewrites it when sending back to you.</p>

<h3 id="application-level-gateway">Application Level Gateway</h3>

<p>ALGs allow NAT to track a multi-port protocol like FTP to go out from your system to an FTP server, then track when you request a file to be sent to your internal IP on a specific port, the ALG can rewrite the packet to include your public IP, then forward the FTP's server connection back to you. Had it not rewritten your IP, the FTP server would try to connect back to you on your internal IP (or not try at all if it expects the source IP to be the same as the signaling connection).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>New research gives patients with <span>PTSD</span> the power to restore their own patterns of brain activity</p><div>
    <div>
          <div property="content:encoded"><p><strong>LHSC: University Hospital&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In a new study at Lawson Health Research Institute (Lawson) and the University of Geneva, researchers showed that a technique called brain training can be used to restore patterns of brain activity and reduce symptoms of hyperarousal in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (<span>PTSD</span>).</p>
<p>Individuals with <span>PTSD</span> often experience more random patterns of brain activity. A leading symptom of <span>PTSD</span> is hyperarousal, which is associated with defensive responses to stress or triggers. A technique to restore patterns of brain activity to a more balanced order and reduce hyperarousal therefore holds promise as a potential treatment.</p>
<p>With the brain training technique, also called neurofeedback, patients exercise their own brain activity through a circular neurofeedback loop, which acts as a mirror to display brain activity. This is done through a brain-computer interface that records brain signals through sensors on the scalp. Since brain activity is displayed on screen, users can complete brain training exercises in ways similar to a gym workout.</p>
<p>In this study, led by Lawson’s Dr. Ruth Lanius, the goal was for patients with <span>PTSD</span> to reduce the intensity of the brain’s dominant brain wave - the alpha rhythm. Patients used neurofeedback to visualize their brain activity as they played a simple video training game. The 30-minute game consisted of a space ship displayed on a starry background. When patients were successful in reducing their alpha rhythm, the space ship moved forward.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Patients reported reducing the dominant brain wave by concentrating their attention towards the visuals on screen. This seemed to propel the spaceship forward,” said Dr. Ruth Lanius, a scientist at Lawson and a psychiatrist at London Health Sciences Centre. “This is consistent with prior research that suggests the alpha rhythm is reduced with increased processing of attention.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers were surprised to find the reduction in alpha rhythm resulted in lasting changes. After the initial reduction, the alpha rhythm rebounded, or increased, to levels matching those found in healthy individuals. Patterns of brain activity were restored to a more proportional balance that is associated with healthy brain function.</p>
<p>Following&nbsp;these sessions, patients experienced a decrease in hyperarousal. “This is very significant. Neurofeedback may give patients the power to restore their patterns of brain activity and improve symptoms of psychiatric illness,” said Dr. Lanius, who is also a professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Western University’s Schulich School of Medicine <span>&amp;</span> Dentistry. “This means that existing mechanisms of the human brain may be harnessed for therapy, providing an alternative to pharmaceutical and brain stimulation therapies.”</p>
<p>Dr. Lanius and her collaborators are currently continuing this research with a larger group of patients with <span>PTSD</span>. Patients in this study will complete multiple sessions of brain training to determine whether positive effects can be sustained long-term.</p>
<p>The study, “<a href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/09/12/cercor.bhw285.abstract" rel="nofollow">Neurofeedback tunes scale-free dynamics in spontaneous brain activity</a>”, was published in the journal <em>Cerebral Cortex</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>20,000 had died as a result of the tsunami by the time I spoke with Joi. Three reactor cores had melted. Unknown to most at the time, sixteen radioactive <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49379-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plumes</a> were sweeping across the Fukushima countryside. Families across the nation, some being <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK253930/table/tab_6-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relocated</a> and all glued to the news, were asking: Are we safe? Should we stay indoors? Can our children drink the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3701991/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">milk</a>?</p>
<p>There were no clear answers, but there was plenty of speculation. Datasets available to the government and power company were withheld from the public. Scientists across the world, eager to evaluate the situation, were left guessing.</p>
<p>That day in March 2011, Joi told me that he and a small cast of characters had assembled a rough plan for <em>Open Global Sensing</em>. I’d just left Microsoft where, in my role as Chief Software Architect, I’d started and nurtured a new product called <em>Azure</em>. “We could use your cloud and data expertise. Will you join us?</p>

<p>A few weeks later 15 of us <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/seanbonner/5629245498/in/album-72157626383390989/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">met</a> in Tokyo, came together around a mission, and set off to Akihabara. Within days, a volunteer’s car had been <a href="https://safecast.org/2011/04/first-safecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">armed</a> with a laptop, a GPS, and a high-quality Geiger counter. The team began mapping radiation levels and uploading them as CC0-licensed data for all the world to see. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0434-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citizens became scientists</a>, and <a href="https://safecast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safecast</a> was born.</p>

<p>Over 10 years, using more than two thousand sensors, more than ten thousand volunteers have worked to gather a <a href="https://map.safecast.org/?y=37.28&amp;x=139.7&amp;z=8&amp;l=0&amp;m=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rapidly growing dataset and map</a> of hundreds of millions of data points. During that time, the team has used commercial IoT technology to create <a href="https://safecast.org/devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ten generations of sensors</a> – some fixed, some mobile. Some measuring radiation, some air quality. Some hard-wired, some solar powered. With support of several <a href="https://safecast.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generous benefactors</a>, Safecast’s citizen scientist volunteers have managed to build one of the largest open environmental datasets in existence.</p>
<figure><a href="https://map.safecast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <img src="https://blues.io/blog/images/safecast-map.png" alt="Screenshot the live map at Safecast.org"> </a><figcaption><a href="https://map.safecast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But gathering that data was far, far too difficult. If we’re to benefit from a world of devices that are cloud-connected from birth, IoT needs a new soul.</p>
<h2 id="surfing-the-public-airwaves">Surfing the Public Airwaves</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I came to believe that the only viable business model for large-scale cellular IoT is the <em>Kindle’s Whispernet</em> model, where the lifetime cost of cellular is simply embedded into the cost of the product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Low data-rate applications don’t need the complexity of Linux, containers, or edge computing. For these solutions, AI/ML is best done in the cloud, with microcontroller-based device design focused on simplicity, reliability, low power, and low cost.</p>
<p>The earliest Safecast devices recorded their data onto SD cards. We embraced Bluetooth for mobile phone-based upload, and then <a href="https://www.semtech.com/lora/what-is-lora" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoRa</a> and <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoRaWAN</a> for fixed location backhaul. LoRa is an amazing technology, and we came close to becoming addicted due to its low power and low cost. But being a global project with a low density of devices, each time we deployed a sensor we ended up needing to build our own network – a consuming undertaking that was greatly complicated by the fact that LoRa chips and concentrators and spectrum rules vary around the world.</p>
<p>The answer, of course, was to use the globally-harmonized public airwaves of cellular.</p>
<p>But what a nightmare! Cellular has huge power draw; it’s a significant challenge for hardware developers to build battery-powered cellular devices. Cellular modems have arcane interfaces and are extremely awkward for developers to deal with. Carriers and cloud providers now (rightfully) require device certificates, TLS, and firmware update, adding even more complexity to the simple task of uploading just a little bit of data.</p>
<p>What’s more, the cellular business model of charging “per month per device” is fundamentally flawed for narrowband cellular IoT, where devices are very high-volume, low-cost, and may even be discarded. Charge the user? Charge the vendor? Charge even when it’s broken? I came to believe that the only viable business model for large-scale cellular IoT is the <em>Kindle’s Whispernet</em> model, where the lifetime cost of cellular is simply embedded into the cost of the product. For the user, <em>it just works</em>.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-data-pump">A Simple Data Pump</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re counting on you software folks to solve that problem, Ray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For many applications – including Safecasts’s – all you need is a simple <em>data pump</em>. Take a little bit of data, perhaps hourly or daily, format it in a simple way, like JSON, and deliver it securely to a cloud-based app via REST. Is that too much to ask?</p>
<p>Before investing more time and energy on this problem at Safecast, I began to talk to others in the industry. Does anybody have a simple way of dealing with low-power cellular from a developer perspective? No one did.</p>
<p>Next, I decided to talk with a number of the thousands of commercial and industrial customers I’ve met with over the years. I heard horror stories about how they tried cellular and gave up. Stories of how they tried Wi-Fi, and now want to bail because it’s a complete <a href="https://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/a-smart-refrigerator-can-take-down-your-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cesspool</a>. To a customer, they were all stories of frustration.</p>
<p>I happen to be very close to the leadership of a few cellular carriers, and so I pressed them: How are you (as an industry) going to realize the promise of cellular if it’s so difficult for developers to use?</p>
<p>Their answer? “We’re counting on you software folks to solve that problem, Ray.”</p>
<p>And so began another journey.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Today’s opportunity is not just about improving our own interactions, but in learning how best to collaborate <em>with machines</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In building Lotus Notes, Groove, and Talko, I’ve spent decades of my career building software in the field of <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/computer-supported-cooperative-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer-Supported Cooperative Work</a>. In the soul of that software was the aspiration to improve outcomes by qualitatively improving interactions among co-workers.</p>
<p>Today’s opportunity is not just about improving our own interactions, but in learning how best to collaborate <em>with machines</em>. Distributed networks of sensors can enable us to know what’s happening in our environment; in our fleets; in our patients; in the COVID vaccination delivery chain; in our food supply; in our HVAC systems; at the entrances to our offices.</p>
<p>Sensors and controls will be ubiquitous in business. They should give us greater <em>situational awareness</em> and should empower us to work together more effectively and serve customers more effectively.</p>
<p>In starting and leading Blues Wireless, my objective is to make it possible for every organization to be able to collaborate with machines to improve their business and improve the world, through visibility, transparency, and control.</p>
<p>We’ve built a few new components – the <a href="https://blues.io/products/"><em>Notecard</em></a> and the <a href="https://notehub.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Notehub</em></a> – that have the potential to fundamentally change the game in the cellular world. With its Safecast roots, simplicity and <em>IoT for good</em> are at the soul of the Notecard.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blues.io/blog/images/notecard.png" alt="Close-up photo of the Notecard."> <figcaption>
            <p>Our first product, the Notecard.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But with my own roots being in the commercial world, they’re packaged it in a form that you can use to embed this <em>cloud data pump</em> in your product. Your machine.</p>
<p>Perhaps something that notifies you when a rodent trap or dumpster needs to be emptied, to keep our alleys clean. Or something that sends an alert when the power goes out on a fridge full of medication. Or something that takes action when a low-income tenant’s home gets too cold.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with fancy expensive devices that do edge computing and local AI, but we love dumb old devices at Blues. We love ‘brownfield’ and we love retrofits. The simpler, the cheaper, the broader, the better.</p>
<p>Because it’s our dream that by monitoring the environment at a personal, grassroots level, we can be better educated and in touch with our earth. We’re committed to help make that happen.</p>
<p>But it’s also our dream that by adding simple inexpensive monitors for our food, our fuel, our fridges, our health, that the benefits of the ‘cloud’ and the ‘edge’ can extend to everyone, including the old, the disadvantaged, and the under-served.</p>
<p>It’s our dream that once you see how easy it is to make your product <em>cloud connected from birth</em>, that this little cloud data pump – the Notecard – might <em>itself</em> turn out to be the soul of a new machine: yours.</p>

<p>At the start of December, I switched jobs to a new games company. While I really enjoyed being a lead programmer at my previous company, I found it difficult to combine both my leadership and programming responsibilities. I ended up feeling like I wasn’t doing my best work on either. My calendar often looked like Swiss cheese, with small meetings interspersed throughout my day. I’ve taken a step back on my leadership responsibilities now, so I can focus more on writing code.</p>



<p>But since my new job didn’t start for another six weeks, I decided to run an experiment on myself. I’ve always been curious about whether an 8-hour workday was actually optimal for me. Now that I had no boss to report to and no coworkers to keep in the loop, why not try cutting my work hours in half? My hope was that I would be able to achieve some kind of momentum on my personal project. I’m happy to report this was definitely the case and that I’ve learned a lot, more than can fit in a single blog post!</p>

<p>My game <em>Up There They Love</em> has been in production in some shape or form for almost three years now. While I had always intended for it to be a “forever project”, something that I could always return to when inspiration struck, it also felt kind of stuck in development hell. Games are meant to be played and I never got to the point where players could actually do that.</p>



<p>To explain it briefly, <em>Up There They Love</em> is an adult visual novel combined with a character management sim and a sexy card game. I designed all of the mechanics, programmed the whole game myself, and have done most of the writing. While friends have helped out over the years, this has always been a solo project. And yes, I’m <a href="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/programming/building-a-tech-stack-for-my-visual-novel/">building my own engine</a>.</p>



<p>The state of the game in early December last year was that the character management sim had been (mostly) implemented already, but the visual novel had not received a lot of love and the card game was just an idea; it hadn’t been designed at all.</p>



<p>So now that I had some time between work assignments, I wanted to see how much I could get done on my game if I fully committed to it. Would I be able to implement the core loop of my game and finally get something playable?</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In this three-part series, I will explain some of the strategies I employed during this period and how effective they were for my productivity.</p>







<p>This experiment did not form in a vacuum. I had recently read the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time">Make Time</a> and I felt highly inspired to try it out. What makes this book so great is that it isn’t about applying One Neat Trick that will instantly fix your entire life but instead asks you to pick a few things that suit your style of working from a list of 80 different tactics.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-1024x768.jpg" data-src="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-1024x768.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px" srcset="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime.jpg 1280w"></a></figure>



<p>There were a number of tips that I implemented immediately, but I also wanted to try out a few ideas of my own. Specifically, I wanted to see how far I could get by working very intensely on my game, but for only four hours a day.</p>



<p>I wanted to do all of my work between 8 AM and noon, have lunch, and then do something else for the rest of the day. The idea being that I could get a lot done on my game while also having more time for other activities that bring me joy, like lazily watching my shows on the couch.</p>



<p>I’m happy to report that this experiment was a resounding success. I was able to make <em>incredible </em>progress on my game while also streaming a season and a half of the brilliant superhero drama <em>The Boys</em>.</p>



<p>So how did I do all that?</p>







<p>One of the recommendations from <em>Make Time</em> is to turn off all notifications on your phone and other devices except those that you explicitly <em>want</em> to be interrupted by. The default on your phone is to interrupt you whenever, it’s high time to challenge that notion!</p>



<p>I decided to turn off all notifications except Google Calendar (meetings), LoseIt (diet tracking reminders), and WhatsApp (family &amp; friends). I also explicitly logged out of Twitter in the morning, which added some friction to wasting time on that website.</p>



<p>Next, I wanted to meticulously plan my mornings. I’m a morning person and get up at 6 AM every day, but I’m not always spending that time wisely. I decided to map out the two hours between 6 AM and 8 AM to an exact schedule:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png" data-src="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-300x169.png 300w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-768x432.png 768w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine.png 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px" srcset="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-300x169.png 300w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-768x432.png 768w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine.png 1280w"></a></figure>



<p>I’m able to do this is that I don’t have any children, I no longer have a commute, and my wife likes to sleep in until at least 8:30 AM. I’m therefore able to perfectly control my schedule in the morning, which definitely makes me an outlier. So don’t feel bad if you cannot apply this type of schedule to your own mornings!</p>



<p>My morning routine acknowledges my Twitter addiction, but I also explicitly block out time for planning my day. This does not always work out <em>perfectly</em>, but it does give me a much better chance of having a productive day.</p>







<p>Even though I no longer had any teammates to interrupt me, I still blocked out the time between 8 AM and noon in my calendar every day for doing focused work. This ensured that I would be in the right headspace and allow me to focus on getting stuff done. I would clear the notification from my phone when I started working, which helped me to get in the groove.</p>



<p>I stuck to this schedule for six weeks while waiting for my new job to begin. And the main thing I found is that I had to unlearn a lot of bad habits. It turns out that a lot of time at work is usually <a href="https://nesslabs.com/illusion-of-productivity">spent on busywork</a>! When I’m stuck on a problem at work, I tend to distract myself with e-mails or checking Twitter. But when your workday is only four hours, you really can’t afford to do that!</p>



<p>That’s why adding a bit of friction to Twitter was really useful. When I got stuck on a problem in one area, I would instead switch contexts to another area of my game. For example, I would work on the UI design when I was stuck on a coding problem and work on making temp art when I couldn’t figure out the game design.</p>



<p>Because I have ADHD, I find it very easy to slip into what the ADHD community calls “hyperfocus”. This is a mental state in which the whole world fades away and nothing becomes more important than the work in front of you. Getting into hyperfocus is in fact so easy for me to do that my main issue has always been getting <em>out</em> of this mental state. Setting a strict deadline helps with that: I can use my hyperfocus to get a lot done and I stop working when it’s time for lunch.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I did not always follow my own advice. There were definitely days that I worked beyond my four-hour limit. And I just want to put it in writing: <em>every time I did that was a mistake</em>. I did not get more done and instead just made myself jittery and anxious for no good reason. Hyperfocus is an extremely tiring mental state, it’s not possible to sustain it for more than a few hours without a serious crash the next day.</p>







<p>Working four hours a day for six week gave me 120 hours of time devoted to my game, or three full-time weeks. But I feel I got more done than that would imply. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Some of my accomplishments:</p>



<ul><li>All major gameplay systems implemented!</li><li>Implemented card game prototype in the actual game</li><li>Closed the gameplay loop from placement to night gameplay and back again</li><li>Created new temp art for 2 / 3 characters</li><li>Added code generation for widgets, screens, and Sass files</li><li>Converted most CSS to use <a href="https://css-tricks.com/abem-useful-adaptation-bem/">ABEM</a> naming scheme</li><li>Fixed not being able to use <a href="http://blog.bahraniapps.com/gifcam/">GifCam</a> to capture footage</li><li>Added base widget class that renders itself when internal state changes (future blog post material!)</li><li>Converted all widgets and screens in the game to use new base class</li><li>Added localization system and used it for all new screens in the game</li><li>Perfected nightly build system using <a href="http://www.buildout.org/en/latest/">buildout</a></li><li>Added animations to <a href="https://twitter.com/mrhands31/status/1349311128468398083">night gameplay</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mrhands31/status/1352583568262914049">task outcome</a> screens</li></ul>







<p>It’s clear to me that I can get a lot done if I focus on reducing distractions and focus my efforts where it matters. Now that I’m gainfully employed again, I don’t think it will be acceptable for me to tell my boss that I would like to do all of my work in four hours yet get paid for eight. But I will definitely carry some of the learnings from this experiment with me.</p>



<p>What I intend to do now is roughly divide my workday in two: mornings are for <strong>focused </strong>work like coding and solving technical problems, while afternoons are for <strong>collaborative </strong>work like writing documentation and doing code reviews. But since I’ll be working from home in the foreseeable future, I will definitely be sticking to my morning routine!</p>



<p>In the next parts of this series, I will discuss how I figure out my task priorities and how I used public accountability to keep myself motivated.</p>

        <p><strong>Hi! Dan and Nathan here.</strong> Early in 2020, we launched the Everything Bundle, a Substack devoted to productivity and business strategy. We started with two newsletters, Superorganizers and Divinations, written and produced by just us. Almost twelve months later, we now have eight newsletters in the bundle, written by some of the smartest, most accomplished practitioners in tech and startups: Li Jin, Tiago Forte, Nat Eliason, Jerry Colonna, and Sherrell Dorsey.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The response has been far better than we ever anticipated: the Everything Bundle has been read by over 750,000 people, it has almost 2,400 paid subscribers, and has cracked the top 10 on Substackâ€™s paid newsletter leaderboard. To us, the signal is clear that there is value in a bundle like this. Readers want access to a place that consistently delivers business writing from a variety of perspectivesâ€”for one subscription price.</p>

        <p>Weâ€™re proud of what weâ€™ve built so far, but we think itâ€™s just the start. Today we want to share where weâ€™re going, what we stand for, and why we exist. But first, a few announcements:</p>

        <h5>The Everything Bundle is now Every.</h5> 
        <p>We started by covering productivity and strategy, and our hope is to cover every industry and job role, every broad theme and niche interest. Weâ€™ve picked the name Every as one that reflects that scope.&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>Weâ€™re structured as a writer collectiveâ€”a new model for a media company.</h5>
        <p>Weâ€™ve been doing it for almost a year, and now weâ€™re ready to talk about it. A writer collective is a way to write thatâ€™s somewhere between starting a Substack and working for <em>The New York Times</em>. We give our writers financial upside in the work they do and the freedom to build their own creative vision, but we also support them with distribution to an audience, editorial support, and an advance on their subscription revenue if they need it. Weâ€™re excited to see ideas like this becoming <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/business/media/brick-house-journalism-cooperative.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">part</a> of the <a href="https://www.axios.com/forbes-paid-newsletter-subscriptions-ab423ae1-0b90-4863-acad-40a373adce80.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">zeitgeist</a>: we believe it is the best structure to support diverse voices, uncover undercovered topics, and create quality writing that can help our readers think differently about business and solve real-world problems.</p>

        <h5>Weâ€™ve moved onto our own homegrown platform.</h5> 
        <p>Our business wouldnâ€™t exist without Substack, and we think the world of them, but weâ€™re excited to announce that Every will be run on a platform we built ourselves. Weâ€™re technology people. And as weâ€™ve grown, we keep coming up with ideas to make our product and business better. So we decided to build our own CMS, one that works differently from anything that already exists, and gives us the freedom to evolve it however we want as we seek new ways to meet the needs of our audience.&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>Weâ€™ve raised a pre-seed round from Eric Stromberg at Bedrock and a group of ambitious angels.</h5>
        <p>Weâ€™ve known Eric for many years, and because heâ€™s a former founder in the space and a&nbsp; current investor in The Athletic, Cameo, and Dipsea, we think heâ€™s the perfect person to help us build our vision.</p>

        <p>Weâ€™re building Every because we believe there is someone in every industryâ€”from wealth management to waste managementâ€”whose eyes sparkle when they talk about their work. These people are ambitious, and they are curious. They think of business as a subject that is intellectually interesting, and as an activity that can be pursued not just for personal gain, but also as an expression of soul. They care deeply about what they do because they see how it connects to the lives of the people they serve: they can tell you how everything in the world depends on their job getting done.</p>

        <p>You have never heard of most of these people, but they are out there. We hope to find them and bring them to our readersâ€”by writing about them, and by writing with them. We believe by doing so, we can help build a better world: the stories told today become the businesses built tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Weâ€™ve dedicated ourselves to this mission because we believe great business writing is currently too rare. Weâ€™d love to walk you why we think itâ€™s rare, and how a writer collective can help make more of it.</p>

        <h2>Why is great business writing rare?&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>There is more business writing on the internet than a single mind can fathom. Much of it is amazing, but as we all sadly know, thereâ€™s a lot that isâ€¦ not. Weâ€™re all burned and burdened by the glut of â€œthink pieces,â€� advertorials, and hastily composed posts that donâ€™t reach for nuance or complexity.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>We think this happens for three primary reasons.</p>
        <h4>1 - Great business writing requires multiple skills</h4>
        <p>To write something great about business, you have to know something worth writing about, and you need to be able to write about it in a compelling way. Unfortunately, the number of people who can do both is vanishingly small.</p>
        
        <p>        
          <img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/static/rare-venn.jpg">
        </p>

        <p>Most of the people who know what theyâ€™re talking about donâ€™t write. Writing is hard, itâ€™s time consuming, and, honestly, itâ€™s agonizing. You canâ€™t take a magic pill and suddenly wake up as a compelling writerâ€”you just have to spend years and years doing it. Itâ€™s a craft.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>On the other hand, there are many skilled writers who donâ€™t have enough business knowledge. Or they simply donâ€™t have the time to dive deeply enough into their subject to do it justice. Which brings us to our second point.</p>

        <h4>2 - Writers are pressured to publish too often</h4>
        <p>Great writing takes time. Yes, thereâ€™s the time it takes to write and edit. But it also takes time to experience things worth writing about, to reflect, and to learn. Thereâ€™s no shortcut or trick that can solve this constraint. Thatâ€™s why the best writing, often found in books and magazines, develops over months, if not years.</p>

        <p>Of course that timescale is rare on the internet. Writers who work for ad-supported digital publications often need to produce daily, if not multiple times a day. Solo paid newsletters need to publish at least weekly, if not 2-3 times a week. Weâ€™ve done this ourselves, and some of our favorite writers do it with a level of quality and consistency that boggles the mindâ€”but itâ€™s grueling. You get burned out. We did.</p>

        <p>When youâ€™re burned out, you forget what inspired you to start writing in the first place. You scroll through Twitter â€œlooking for ideasâ€� and contemplate a career change to carpentry, until, defeated, you curl into a nap. You realize that your sense of curiosity, rather than driving your work, is currently in hidingâ€”which brings us to our third point.</p>

        <h4>3 - Most writing is chasing clout, rather than insight</h4>
        <p>Every writer wants clout. But when you prioritize clout over curiosity, the work suffers. You try to play up popular narratives. You worry about keeping up.&nbsp; You look at what everyone else is writing about, and you try to write the same thingâ€”but better. You opine on every trending topicâ€”even when you donâ€™t have anything new to add to the conversation. You say dumb things to get attention. (Okay, to be fair, we have <a href="https://every.to/divinations/quibi-will-be-a-multi-billion-dollar-355585" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">done that</a> ourselves, but at least hopefully in an interesting way ðŸ™ˆ.)</p>

        <p>This strategy can attract attention, but it leaves readers unsatisfied, and doesnâ€™t age well. Itâ€™s like blowing counterclockwise into a hurricane and claiming credit when it reaches a Category 5. Aiming directly for clout is all about profiting from trends, rather than creating them. Itâ€™s about answering questions that have already been asked, not about asking new questions.</p>

        <p>When you put all of these forces togetherâ€”an arena that requires multiple skills to succeed, the incessant pressure to publish, and the human tendency to chase cloutâ€”you end up with a lot of writing thatâ€™s kind of like cotton candy. It tastes good at first, but it gives you a stomachache after a while. Worse, it creates a narrative ecosystem that rewards folks who already have money and an audience, rather than reflecting the best of what our community knowsâ€”and wants to knowâ€”about the world.</p>

        <p>So, what to do? Write together, rather than alone.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>How writing together solves these problems</h2>
        <p>Writing together isnâ€™t trending right now, but itâ€™s actually pretty great.&nbsp;</p>

        <ol>
         <li>When you write together, you donâ€™t need one person to have both business knowledge and writing talent. You can find one person who has business knowledge and another person who has writing skill, and then create systems that support them writing together. Now youâ€™ve unlocked both business experience and writing talent in a way that wasnâ€™t possible before.</li>
         <li>When you write together, you donâ€™t have to publish so often that you risk burning out. Instead, the group can share the load. That means each writer has time to produce higher quality work, but readers still get content on a consistent schedule.</li>
  
         <li>And finally, when you write together, you can form a culture that pushes you to write from a genuine sense of curiosity, expertise, and interest, rather than clout-chasing. You can hold each other accountable to this when you veer away from it, and you can encourage each other to pursue the fragile little sparks of inspiration that turn into the best pieces. You start to care more about the respect of the community youâ€™re part of than about mindlessly moving numbers.&nbsp;</li>
       </ol>

       <p>Of course, weâ€™re not the first people to discover the merits of writing in groupsâ€¦&nbsp;</p>

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The decision of whether to use a monorepo or a polyrepo structure for your source code can be a very emotional (maybe even religious!) battle. On its surface, it's not much different than "tabs vs spaces" or "vim vs emacs". Or is it?</p>
<p>In the following, I will attempt to draw objective, logical arguments for both approaches and also throw in a very popular third option: the hybrid.</p>
<h2 id="quickintro">Quick intro</h2>
<p>The <strong>monorepo layout</strong> consists of a single code repository where multiple projects coexist in a hierarchical directory structure. For example:</p>
<pre><code>├── lib
|   ├── lib
|   └── lib
├── lib
├── lib
├── lib
├── app
|   ├── lib
|   └── lib
|       ├── lib
|       └── lib
├── app
|   └── lib
└── big-project
|   ├── lib
|   ├── app
|   |   ├── lib
|   |   └── lib
|   └── app
|       └── lib
└── big-project
    ├── lib
    ├── lib
    ├── app
    |   └── lib
    └── app
        ├── lib
        └── lib
</code></pre>
<p>Each <code>lib</code> and each <code>app</code> would contain various other sub-directories to house the source code itself, depending on the language it is written in. You get the idea.</p>
<p>In <strong>polyrepo layout</strong> (sometimes also called <strong>multirepo layout</strong>), on the other hand, the code is spread across... well multiple repositories. The degree to which the separation between logical pieces of code can vary from language to language and from style to style. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Here's an example possible structure.</p>
<pre><code>github.com/myorg/app1
├── docs
├── examples
├── src
└── tests

github.com/myorg/app2
├── docs
└── src

github.com/myorg/app3
├── lib
|   └── src
├── lib
|   └── src
└── lib
    └── src

github.com/myorg/lib1
└── src
</code></pre>
<p>Each repository is focused on specific functionality. The structure of the repository is usually heavily influenced by the best practices of the language they host.</p>
<p>A third alternative that some people use is the <strong>hybrid repository layout</strong>, whereby some components coexist in one or more monorepos, while others are separated in their own isolated, smaller repositories. Deciding which component goes where may be influenced by team ownership, the language of the code, whether the component is open or closed source, and other factors.</p>
<h2 id="judgingcriteria">Judging criteria</h2>
<p>The structure of your source code empowers or impedes various engineering processes. It is the lifeblood of your technical product and it needs to account for all the possible ways it can be used. To avoid boiling the ocean with this article, however, we will focus on the most popular use-cases and characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of importing</li>
<li>Ease of contributing within and across projects</li>
<li>Viewing diffs</li>
<li>Structure of releases</li>
<li>Builds and CI</li>
<li>Open vs closed source</li>
<li>Issue tracking</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, we will make certain assumptions about the underlying technologies used: for example, we will assume that you are using GitHub for the repositories and the issue tracking. The considerations typically apply to most other setups that do not necessarily use these technologies. They work similarly.</p>
<h2 id="letstakealook">Let's take a look</h2>
<h3 id="imports">Imports</h3>
<!-- ![Containers seen from above](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/chuttersnap-kyCNGGKCvyw-unsplash.jpg) -->
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/chuttersnap-kyCNGGKCvyw-unsplash.jpg" alt="Shipping containers seen from above"></p><p>You can't talk about the code layout, without looking primarily at how code can be imported and reused. Different languages can vary wildly in the way code can be imported.</p>
<p>For example, in Go, you have the freedom to reference just about any package (directory) in any repository with ease. There are mechanisms to automatically download any remote code and use it, via the new <a href="https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules">modules features</a>. For Go, it is just as easy to use monorepos or polyrepos for code imports.</p>
<p>In Java, on the other hand, you cannot simply import a GitHub repository - you have to first publish a JAR to an artifactory, and then reference that JAR in your Java-specific build file. So it becomes far easier to reference a package in the same repository than across repositories setup-wise. But the code can become unwieldy. For this reason, some Java monorepo layouts tend to stick with segmenting the code across separate modules, each possibly producing separate artifacts. See for example <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-modules.html">multi-module Maven builds</a>.</p>
<p>JavaScript tends to be spread across multiple repositories typically. To use a package from one repository to another, however, the package needs to be published to NPM. It's less popular to use a monorepo layout with JavaScript, however, if you would like to experiment, there are a number of tools to help out with the directory organization, such that each project gets its own separate <code>package.json</code>. <a href="https://github.com/lerna/lerna">Lerna</a> is one such tool.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: It depends heavily on the language. Even if the language requires an artifactory or a package repository in the middle when referencing code across repositories, it still seems like polyrepos are more popular. When using a monorepo layout, it's often preferable to create distinct modules of each project and some communities have developed tools to help with that.</p>
<h3 id="contributionswithinthesameproject">Contributions within the same project</h3>
<!-- ![Software engineers collaborating](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/cowomen-cKQkMFzXHAI-unsplash.jpg) -->
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/cowomen-cKQkMFzXHAI-unsplash.jpg" alt="Software engineers collaborating"></p><p>Making changes to source code can be isolated to one specific area, or it can span multiple functional concerns and thus need to cross-project boundaries. The developer experience may vary depending on how the code is laid out.</p>
<p>When viewing changes to a single project, it is easier to visualize the history of changes in GitHub in a polyrepo setup, by simply navigating the list of pull requests. In a monorepo setup, however, all the pull requests are mixed together; your best bet, in that case, is to first open the specific sub-directory you are interested in and then clicking the <strong>History</strong> link. If you have squash merges enabled, you can easily navigate the PR from the commit message.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/history.png" alt="history"></p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Managing contributions within the same project is easier with a polyrepo layout, as it is easier to track the history of changes per-repository rather than per-directory.</p>
<h3 id="contributionsacrossprojects">Contributions across projects</h3>
<!-- ![Whiteboard collaboration](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/kaleidico-26MJGnCM0Wc-unsplash.jpg) -->
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/kaleidico-26MJGnCM0Wc-unsplash.jpg" alt="Whiteboard collaboration"></p><p>When making contributions across multiple projects, there is a significant distinction. Arguably, this is one of the main reasons to use the monorepo layout. When everything is in a single repository, many cross-cutting concerns can be modified and submitted as a single, atomic PR. For example, you could write code for a new feature and make adjustments end-to-end: UI, backend, API, DB schema migration, documentation, etc. The simplicity of the dev-test and contribution process really shines in monorepos, when done right <sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. Atomic PRs also help to visualize changes for review. It is easier to see a feature take shape when the changes across projects are visible in one place.</p>
<p>In polyrepos, cross-cutting changes need to be performed as separate distinct PRs. Although it is more work to open separate PRs, it's sometimes useful to create the mindfulness that the components are landing asynchronously in production (for example, if these are separate microservices talking to each other).</p>
<p>One of the challenging aspects of contributing across multiple repositories is that the dependencies are often referenced as a pinned version number. If you change project B on the <code>main</code> branch and it is referenced by project A as <code>v1.2.3</code>, then you will need to work out a way to test project A with the latest of project B for development, or, as a workaround, perform a release of project B and update project A to now point to <code>v1.2.4</code>. This creates possible significant hurdles for the developer to go through and for this reason, developers get discouraged to contribute to other team's codebases unless they really have to.</p>
<p>Another possible side-effect of dependency version pinning is what I call <em>delayed integration breaking</em>: the <code>main</code> branch of project B no longer works with project A due to some change performed in the past. Project A has been pointing to <code>v1.2.3</code> for a long time, while project B has been evolving independently. The first time this is discovered is when a developer attempts to make a change to B, which is needed in A. This, again, contributes to the hurdles developers face when contributing across repositories and creates hidden technical debt.</p>
<p>Dependency version pinning is not a bad thing in and of itself. If the two projects are well separated and the team maintaining the dependency is aware of maintaining compatibility (and enforces this with proper testing), then this is often preferred. After all, the way we typically consume open-source software relies on this model and it is very successful. However, if two projects need to evolve together tightly, then a possible alternative might be always referencing the <code>main</code> branch version (in Java, this is known as the <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/maven/maven_snapshots.htm"><code>SNAPSHOT</code> version</a>) as the dependency and thus being able to catch integration regressions much more quickly. During a release, all <code>SNAPSHOT</code> references would need to be updated to pinned versions, however.</p>
<p>Another option might be to use a bot that regularly updates dependencies. The support for such a bot may be language-specific, however. Here's an <a href="https://github.com/tenable/Kastle/pull/165">example of Scala Steward in action</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, in polyrepo setups developers have the option to use staggered dependency upgrades: the ability to update a dependency gradually across other projects and thus control the way a change is rolled out. In a monorepo setup, this would be achieved through other means, such as <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html">feature flagging</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Managing contributions across projects is usually easier in a monorepo layout, as PRs can make changes across several components at the same time and there is no need to constantly update the referenced version of dependencies. In addition, integration breakages are obvious immediately.</p>
<h3 id="releases">Releases</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/vidar-nordli-mathisen-y8TMoCzw87E-unsplash.jpg" alt="A loaded cargo ship"></p><p>One of the key deciding factors of the source code layout is the structure of the releases. Depending on the deliverable type (library, app), the release might have multiple forms: an artifact, a language-specific package, a Docker image, an installer, etc.</p>
<p>For polyrepo layouts, you typically have one deliverable per repository. Whether that's a repository for microservice (e.g. deliverable: Docker image) or a library to perform some reusable functionality (e.g. deliverable: artifact), you …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

Load balancing is the activity of effectively distributing traffic load across multiple servers.</p><p>This is how we achieve highly available applications that help us achieve scaling effectively.</p><h2>What is load-balancing?</h2><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>Since nobody can afford a web server overload, we scale out our backend servers to multiple machines. The aim is to have a distributed architecture and to avoid having all users connecting to a single server and choke it up. Therefore we distribute the incoming traffic by making use of a load balancer.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-1024x582.png" alt="load balancing" width="762" height="433" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-1024x582.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-300x170.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-768x436.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-696x395.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing.png 1070w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px"></figure><p>The load balancer thus becomes a key component in our architecture, diverting traffic based on different techniques that we will discuss later in this post. Its main responsibility is to avoid convergence of traffic and thus avoiding choking of the system.</p><p>Load balancers thus become the first point of contact for the client requests.</p><p>There can be multiple load balancers in a system as well. One each for various tiers of the application. This would help handle the separate application tiers more effectively and also scale them independently if needed.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-1024x472.png" alt="load balancing multiple tiers" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-1024x472.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-300x138.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-768x354.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-696x321.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers.png 1276w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>It is also important to mention that when a load balancer redirects to a particular location, it might not hit an application server. It might hit another load balancer that is implemented at a location-based cluster in a data center if we were scaling globally.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>If a server goes down, the load balancer also ensures that no traffic is directed to that server until it is back up and running. This is done by performing health checks that ensure the load balancer is only sending traffic to servers that are online.</p><p>But how do we decide which machine the user will land upon?</p><h2>Types of load balancing</h2><p>There are three types of load balancing:</p><ol><li>DNS load balancing</li><li>Hardware-based load balancing</li><li>Software-based load balancing</li></ol><p>As with everything, there are pros and cons to either of the approaches. Let us discuss them in detail.</p><h2>DNS load balancing</h2><p>DNS load balancing is the most commonly used technique for load balancing. Instead of having dedicated hardware for resolving which server to redirect to, a nameserver is responsible for managing traffic.</p><p>The nameserver has a list of IP addresses that correspond to the various servers that can be routed to. Every time someone queries for a particular domain, the nameserver returns this list of IP addresses and changes the order of the addresses. The reordering is done in a round-robin fashion. Thus, every new request is routed to a different machine in a round-robin order And the load gets distributed among different servers.</p><p>The reason a list of IP addresses is returned and not a single IP address is to have a failover strategy. If the first IP address does not respond in a stipulated amount of time, the client can call the next IP address in the list.</p><p>Though this is a popular strategy, it has its limitations too. What the strategy does not factor in is the existing load on the server, the processing time of the server, their online status, etc.</p><p>Another limitation of this technique is that IP addresses are cached on the client machine’s DNS resolver. This can be mitigated by setting a low TTL (time to live, or how long to store the mapping for). But it is a tradeoff since longer TTL means clients do not know about changes and shorter TTL may improve accuracy but increases DNS processing and DNS caching was implemented to mitigate that in the first place. Also, the client might choose to disregard your TTL value altogether. So it is not guaranteed.</p><p>Another limitation is of possibly routing to a machine that is not functional will exist. Though most cloud services these days do provide health checks along with DNS balancing these days, but it might not be true for all services.</p><p>The most common use case for this type of load balancing is for distributing traffic across multiple data centers, possibly in different regions. It is also preferred by companies because it is a cost-effective solution and easy to deploy.</p><h2>Hardware-based load balancing</h2><p>As the name suggests, we use physical appliances as a load balancer. They sit in front of the application servers and handle the distribution of traffic.</p><p>These are highly performant pieces of hardware that factor in the number of open connections, how much compute is being utilized and several other parameters to decide where to route the traffic to.</p><p>Having dedicated hardware to take care of load balancing is highly performant. It also is efficient since a dedicated machine is responsible for evaluating load distribution. The throughput is fast because of the specialized processors. It also provides the benefit of increased security since physical access to the hardware can be limited by the organization.</p><p>But hardware is expensive to purchase, to set up and it requires maintenance and regular updates. It can also require network specialists since it can be a lot of work to do for a developer.</p><p>Another disadvantage is that we have to factor in the scenarios where there is extreme peak traffic and plan for purchasing hardware accordingly. This is not the case for software-based load balancers.</p><h2>Software-based load balancing</h2><p>Software-based load balancing is the process of installing load balancing software on cost-effective hardware and VMs. They are cheaper and provide more flexibility than the hardware ones. They can also be provisioned and upgraded easily.</p><p>The major benefit of software-based load balancers over DNS load balancers is the flexibility and the advanced configuration options. We can configure load balancing on the basis of multiple parameters like cookies, HTTP headers, CPU utilization, memory consumption, network load, etc. We will discuss the different algorithms that can be implemented in detail later.</p><p>A benefit of the software-based approach over the hardware one is that we can scale beyond the initial capacity by just adding more VM based instances. No need to buy additional specialized hardware. We also would have to plan ahead of time for peak traffic if we were buying specialized hardware to manage it. In the cloud, there are no hardware balancers, and you purchase more virtual machines to fulfill your needs. This ends up being cheaper.</p><p>There are many “software-balancers as a service” services out there that allow us to use them without any configuration of our own. Or we can install the software from one of the open-sourced versions ourselves. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HAProxy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nginx/nginx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nginx</a> are fairly common ones that many enterprises use as well.</p><p>Since there are a lot of ways in which the software-based load balancers can be configured, we will discuss the major algorithms to do so next.</p><h3>Traffic routing algorithms used by software balancers</h3><p><strong>Round Robin: </strong>Similar to DNS based routing, a software uses a list of IP addresses and rotates through this list on every request. Nothing else is taken as a parameter.</p><p><strong>Weighted round-robin</strong>: A modified variation of the round-robin in which the traffic is routed in a weighted manner. The weights are determined by the server’s traffic capacity and compute capabilities. Thus, machines that can handle more traffic get more of it relative to those that can handle less.</p><p><strong>Least connections:</strong> Traffic is redirected to the machine that has the least amount of current network connections. Similar to the previous one, there are two approaches. One assumes that all requests to a server take equal server resources. The other takes into account the server’s traffic capacity and compute capabilities while making the decision of least open connections.<br>This approach is a good candidate for scenarios where the connections are long-term ones and stay open for larger durations, such as live streams or gaming applications.</p><p><strong>Random:</strong> The load balancer picks two servers randomly and then using the least connections mechanism, sends the request to the one that gets selected.</p><p><strong>Hash-based: </strong>A key is defined on the basis of which distribution takes place. The key could be the client IP address, or the request URL, or both. Hashing the IP ensures that the requests from an IP are always redirected to the same server. This is useful in cases where the server has some in-memory data/cache about the user’s information.</p><p><strong>Least time:</strong> This builds up on the least connections method. The traffic is redirected to the server with the fewest active connections and the lowest average response time.</p><p>And that is all there is to know about the basics of load balancing. Load balancing plays a prominent role in distributed architectures and helps in scaling our applications. It also helps improve responsiveness and achieve high availability.</p><p>If you have any queries, feel free to drop a comment below.</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p>We rendered the <a href="https://tranco-list.eu/">top 1 million pages</a> on the web, tracking every conceivable performance metric, logging every error, noting every requested URL. To our knowledge this produces the first dataset that connects performance, errors, and library use on the web. In this article we analyze what the data can tell us about creating high performance web sites.</p>
        <div>
            <p><b>1M </b> pages visited
            </p>
            <p><b>65</b> metrics per page
            </p>
            <p><b>21M</b> resource URLs requested
            </p>
            <p><b>383K</b> errors logged
            </p>
            <p><b>88M</b> global variables logged
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Can you do better than our analysis? We <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/indexhtml/web-performance-metrics">published the dataset to Kaggle</a>, so you can crunch the numbers yourself.</p>
        <h2>Why render a million web pages?</h2>
        <p>
            A common sentiment these days is that the web is somehow slower and buggier than it was 15 years ago. Because of an ever-growing pile of JavaScript and frameworks and webfonts and polyfills, we've eaten up all the gains that faster computers, networks and protocols have given us. Or so the argument goes. We wanted to check if this was actually true and try to find what common factors are causing slow and broken websites in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            The high level plan was simple: Scripting a web browser, having it render the root page of the top 1 million domains, and logging every conceivable metric: render times, request counts, repaints, JavaScript errors, libraries used, etc. With all this data, we can ask questions about how one factor correlates with another. What factors contribute most to slow render times? Which libraries are correlated with long time-to-interactive? What are the most common errors, and what's causing them?
        </p>
        <p>
            Gathering the data was a matter of writing a bit of code to use Puppeteer to script Chrome, firing up 200 EC2 instances, rendering a million web pages over the weekend, and praying that you've actually understood how AWS pricing works.
        </p>

        <h2>Overall numbers</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Protocol use for root HTML document</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 0.9 (0.003%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 1.0 (0.22%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 1.1 (40.7%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 2 (59%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 3 (0.08%)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>HTTP 2 is now more common than HTTP 1.1, but HTTP 3 is still rare. (Note: We're counting anything using the QUIC protocol as HTTP 3, even if Chrome sometimes reports this as HTTP 2 + QUIC.) This was for the root document, for linked resources the protocol numbers look a bit different.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Protocol use for linked resources</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 0.9 (0.0001%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 1.0 (0.015%)</li>

            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 2 (62.5%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 3 (8.6%)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For linked resources, HTTP 3 is about 100x more prevalent. How can this be true? Because all the sites are linking the same stuff:</p>

        <p>There's a handful of scripts that are linked on a large portion of web sites. This means we can expect these resources to be in cache, right? Not any more: Since Chrome 86, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning">resources requested from different domains will not share a cache</a>. Firefox is planning to implement the same. Safari has been splitting its cache like this for years.</p>

        <h2>What makes the web slow: Predicting time-to-interactive</h2>

        <p>
            Given this dataset of web pages and their load time metrics, it would be nice to learn something about what it is that makes web pages slow. We'll investigate the dominteractive metric, which is the time it takes before the document becomes interactive to the user. The simplest thing we could do is just to look at the correlation of each metric with dominteractive.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/dominteractive-correlation.png" alt="Correlations with dominteractive">
            </p><blockquote>Correlations of metrics with dominteractive</blockquote>
        
        <p>
            Essentially every metric is positively correlated with dominteractive, except the 0-1 variable indicating HTTP2 or greater. Many of these metrics are also positively correlated with each other. We need a more sophisticated approach to get at individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive.
        </p>

        <p>Some of the metrics are timings, measured in milliseconds. We can look at their box-plot to get an idea of where browsers are spending their time.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/timings-box-plot.png" alt="Box plot of web page timings"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of timing metrics. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>
            One way to get at the individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive is to do a linear regression, where we predict dominteractive from other metrics. That means we assign a weight to each metric and model the dominteractive time of a page as the weighted sum of the other metrics, plus some constant. An optimization algorithm sets the weights so as to minimize the prediction error over the whole dataset. The size of the weights found by the regression tells us something about how much each metric contributes to the slowness of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll exclude timing metrics from the regression. If we spend 500ms establishing a connection, that adds 500ms to dominteractive, but this is not a particularly interesting insight. Timing metrics are fundamentally <em>outcomes</em>. We want to learn what causes them.
        </p>

        
        <p id="full-di-expand"><a onclick="expandDi()">View regression code <span></span></a></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for metrics, predicting dominteractive</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>main_doc_is_http2_or_greater (-477.53)</li>

            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>redirect_count (354.27)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The numbers in parenthesis are the regression coefficients learned by the optimization algorithm. You can interpret these as having units of milliseconds. While the exact numbers should be taken with a grain of salt (see note below), it is interesting to see the scale assigned to each feature. For example, the model predicts a 354ms slow down for every redirect needed to deliver the main document. Whenever the main HTML document is delivered via HTTP2 or higher, the model predicts a 477ms lower time-to-interactive. For each request triggered by the document, it predicts an additional 16 ms. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When interpreting regression coefficients, we need to keep in mind that we're operating on a simplified model of reality. Time-to-interactive is not in fact determined by a weighted sum of these input metrics. There are clearly causal factors the model has no chance of discovering. Confounding variables is clearly an issue. As an example, if loading the main document with HTTP2 is correlated with loading <i>other</i> requests over HTTP2, then the model will bake this advantage into the weights for main_doc_is_http2_or_greater, even if the speed up comes from requests other than the main document. We need to be cautious when mapping what the model says onto conclusions about reality.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the effect of HTTP protocol version on dominteractive?</h3>
        <p>Here's a fun plot of dominteractive split by the HTTP protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/dominteractive-by-protocol.png" alt="Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version of the first request. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile. The percentages in parenthesis are the fraction of requests made with this protocol.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>There's a tiny number of sites still delivered over HTTP 0.9 and 1.0. And these sites happen to be fast. It seems we can't disentangle the fact that protocols have gotten faster with the effect that programmers will happily consume this speed-up by delivering more stuff to the browser.</p>

        <p>This is for the protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page. What if we look at the effect of the protocol for resources linked in that document? If we do a regression on number of requests by protocol version, we get the following.</p>

        
        <p id="full-rs-expand"><a onclick="expandRs()">View regression code <span></span></a></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for number of requests by protocol version, predicting dominteractive</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http2_requests (14.18)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http3_requests (22.05)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_1_requests (25.14)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_0_requests (61.18)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we were to believe this, we would conclude that moving requested resources from HTTP 1.1 to 2 gives a 1.8x speed-up, while going from HTTP 2 to 3 causes 0.6x slow down. Is it really true that HTTP 3 is a slower protocol? No: A more likely explanation is that HTTP 3 is rare, and that the few resources that are being sent over HTTP 3 (e.g. Google Analytics) are things that have a larger than average effect on dominteractive.</p>

        <h3>What is the effect of type of content on dominteractive?</h3>
        <p>Let's predict time-to-interactive from the number of bytes transferred, split by the type of data being transferred.</p>

</header>
<p>In the past four years, I wrote three eBooks about programming. It’s like an
addiction.</p>
<p>I would be terrible at talking about writing techniques, so I won’t. But the
content is not everything when you write an eBook. You have to care about
creating <strong>beautiful files to release</strong>: PDF, ePub, Kindle…</p>
<p>Here is the story of how I built my eBooks, especially
<a href="https://gum.co/use-hooks">the last one</a>. After some trial and errors, in the
end, I used the same recipe as the two previous ones, and it involves a
fantastic tool: <strong>Pandoc</strong>.</p>

<p>I wanted my last eBook to be a practical guide, not an academic manual. So I
imagined a very <strong>custom design</strong>, with a <strong>dark theme</strong> and many colors (it is
not designed to be printed).</p>
<p>Since it was about coding, I also wanted to include some source code examples
with <strong>syntax highlighting</strong>.</p>
<p>Bust most of all, I wanted an efficient workflow.</p>

<p>I intended to release a first version of the book ASAP, then iterate thanks to
readers’ feedback and new ideas I had. For this reason, I wanted to focus on the
content and on the appearance <strong>independently</strong>.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to spend time on the presentation each time I updated the content.
I’m a web developer; it wouldn’t occur to me to edit my CSS each time I update
the HTML content. Same here.</p>

<p>I thought: why not just use <strong>MS Word</strong> or its Apple version, <strong>Pages</strong>? Well, I
tried. It didn’t go well.</p>
<p>You can customize pretty much everything you want. Every color, font family,
font size… But it gets trickier when you want to include source code.</p>
<p>Since I wanted to have syntax highlighting, the <em>less bad</em> solution I found was
to copy and paste from VS Code. At first, it looked (kind of) okay, but as soon
as I wanted to modify it, it went terribly: the formatting was lost, spaces were
inserted where I didn’t want them…</p>
<p>Definitely, these tools are not made to write content with embedded source code.</p>
<p>I also tried <strong>Illustrator</strong> and its open-source alternative,
<a href="https://www.scribus.net/"><strong>Scribus</strong></a>.</p>
<p>It was worse.</p>
<p>I admire people able to use these applications. They seem to require a lot of
training and practice. Unfortunately, I intended to release my book in the next
two years, so I didn’t have time to learn them. 😉</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m used to writing content using <strong>Markdown</strong>. Or in <strong>Slack</strong>. Or in
<strong>Notion</strong> (for this blog post). Today, we have such perfect tools for
writing. I didn’t want to struggle each time I update some examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in the end, I relied on the tool I used for my previous books: <strong>Pandoc</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> is a command-line tool whose main feature is
converting some text (usually Markdown) to another format: HTML, ePub, PDF, etc.</p>
<p>I used it for my other books, and it’s perfect for “academic” work (thesis,
research articles). But I wasn’t sure that creating something a bit more
original, with shiny colors and such, was possible.</p>
<center>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I spent around 5 hours to write the content, and lost the same amount of time looking for a publishing software or Saas to generate beautiful PDF for developer-oriented content, with source code.

</center>
<p>To write the content, I could now write using Markdown, with the basic
formatting options I needed: titles, italic, source code… And the source code
was highlighted!</p>
<p>By the way, syntax highlighting is themeable, and I really wanted to use
<a href="https://draculatheme.com/">Dracula</a>, which I already used for my VSCode. So I
created
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-dracula-theme">a custom theme</a>
for it. 🙂</p>

<p>The only thing I find problematic with Pandoc is
<a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html">its documentation</a>. It contains a lot of
information, but it’s on one page.</p>
<p>One page!</p>
<p>So you scroll, then scroll, and scroll again. And when you want to find
something, you do Cmd/Ctrl+F, type “color”, oh cool, there is something. Then
you realize you’re in the section concerning the generation of some obscure and
unknown document format…</p>
<p>Anyway, you can usually find what you’re looking for. I’d just prefer if it used
something more modern, such as Gitbook or Docusaurus, to maintain the
documentation and make it easier to navigate.</p>

<p>Pandoc is very good at generating HTML or an ePub file. You can give it some CSS
to customize anything you want. It would be a dream if you were able to do the
same to generate a customized PDF.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is slightly more complicated…</p>

<p>To generate PDFs, Pandoc uses <em>pdflatex</em>, which relies on
<strong><a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a></strong>. The LaTeX language is used to write
documents with a powerful but unusual syntax. These documents are then converted
to PDF, Postscript, etc.</p>
<p>So, a little like Pandoc. But with a weird syntax instead of beautiful Markdown.</p>
<p>Long story short, if you want to customize the PDF rendered by Pandoc with
<em>pdflatex</em>, you don’t have a choice: you need to provide some LaTeX code, a bit
like CSS.</p>
<p>And I didn’t want to spend several months learning LaTeX—it’s truly fantastic,
you can do anything you want with it. So I did what every good developer hates
doing: search on Google and copy-paste pieces of code.</p>
<p>Here is, for example, how I managed to have the book title in the page footer:
(sorry if you are a LaTeX guru, it probably will hurt your eyes)</p>
<pre><code><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span><span>fancyhdr</span><span>}</span><br><span>\pagestyle</span><span>{</span>fancy<span>}</span><br><span>\fancyhf</span><span>{</span><span>}</span><br><span>\lfoot</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>\begin</span><span>{</span><span>tikzpicture</span><span>}</span><span>[</span>overlay,baseline=<span>{</span>(0,0)<span>}</span><span>]</span><br>  <span>\node</span><span>[</span>rectangle, outer sep=0pt, text=white, anchor=west <span>]</span><br>    (pageno)<br>    <span>{</span>A React Developer’s Guide to Hooks, © Sebastien Castiel<span>}</span>;<br>  <span>\draw</span><span>[</span>fill=comment, draw=comment<span>]</span><br>    (<span>[</span>xshift=-<span>\oddsidemargin</span>-1in<span>]</span>pageno.north west)<br>      rectangle<br>    (<span>[</span>yshift=1.5pt<span>]</span>pageno.south east);<br>  <span>\end</span><span>{</span><span>tikzpicture</span><span>}</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Well, to be fair, it would have been much more straightforward if I just wanted
the book title. But I wanted it in an indigo rectangle starting from the far
left of the page.</p>

<p>Still, most of the time, I was able to get what I wanted. It just took more time
than I wanted to spend on it.</p>
<p><em>You can find here
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-header-tex">the complete LaTeX header file</a>
I used for my book. I cleaned it a little and added some comments.</em></p>
<p>Although I didn’t interact with them, I’m sure the LaTeX community is fantastic
because you can find many resources on the Internet: answers on forums,
tutorials, manuals, etc.</p>

<p>I think the last time I used the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">GNU make</a> utility was like
ten years ago. I had this idea that it was only used by C or C++ projects.</p>
<p>If you never heard of <strong>GNU make</strong>, it’s a utility program to run specific
commands to generate files. It’s mostly used to compile and build programs, but
you can use it for any command.</p>
<p>My first intuition was to write a shell script to generate my book in several
formats. Quickly, I realized a <strong>Makefile</strong> would make more sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had <em>content</em> files and <em>resource</em> files (images, the LaTeX header, for
example)</li>
<li>I needed to generate intermediate files, such as the cover as a PDF from a PNG</li>
<li>Some formats (ePub) were used to create other formats (Kindle)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a Makefile, I regenerated only the needed parts, based on which files were
updated since the latest build. I could run <code>make pdf</code>, <code>make epub</code>,
<code>make mobi</code>, or just <code>make</code> to generate all formats.</p>
<p>Here is the portion of my Makefile used to generate the <em>ePub</em> and <em>mobi</em>
(Kindle) files:</p>
<pre><code>BOOK_TITLE <span>=</span> A\ React\ Developer’s\ Guide\ to\ Hooks\ -\ Sebastien\ Castiel<p><span>epub</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub<br>  <span>@</span>echo <span>'✅  ePub'</span></p><p><span>kindle</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.mobi<br>  <span>@</span>echo ‘✅  Kindle’</p><p><span>dist/<span>$</span>{BOOK_TITLE}.epub</span><span>:</span> dist content/*.md images/* resources/dracula.theme resources/metadata.xml resources/epub.css<br>  <span>@</span>pandoc content/foreword.md content/ch*.md content/resources.md \<br>  --output<span>=</span>dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub \<br>  --highlight-style resources/dracula.theme \<br>  --standalone \<br>  --epub-metadata<span>=</span>resources/metadata.xml \<br>  -c resources/epub.css \<br>  --epub-cover-image<span>=</span>cover.png \<br>  --toc --toc-depth<span>=</span>1 \<br>  --metadata title<span>=</span><span>"A React Developer’s Guide to Hooks"</span></p><p><span>dist/<span>$</span>{BOOK_TITLE}.mobi</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub<br>  <span>@</span>kindlegen dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub -o <span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.mobi &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</p></code></pre>
<p>Okay, maybe slightly overkill for my needs, but I felt so powerful! 💪🏻</p>
<p><em>You can find
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-makefile">here the complete Makefile</a>
for my book.</em></p>

<p>I embedded the examples’ source code in a small <strong>React</strong> application to run
them locally. The user can start it by running <code>yarn start</code> and navigate easily
through them.</p>
<p>Now, I feel a bit silly not to have thought of using

<p>I often design graphics using <strong><a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a></strong> (for
example, the banner for the <a href="https://gum.co/use-hooks">Gumroad page</a>), even if
at the end I manipulate and generate bitmap images. I know it’s not its first
purpose, but I find it easier to use than Gimp or commercial alternatives.</p>
<p>If you know a better choice, please please please tell me!</p>

<p>From the beginning, I really wanted a custom presentation with a dark theme.</p>
<p>Now, I realize this wish took me a lot of extra time. And I would have preferred
spending that time on the content. Plus, I don’t know if the readers actually
like this theme or not…</p>
<p>Also, it may have been better to focus first on the <strong>web support</strong>.
<a href="https://v2.docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a> could do an excellent job: readers could
navigate the sections, search for keywords, etc.</p>
<p>The PDF or ePub version would be secondary content: available, but maybe with a
generic appearance. So what?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end, if the user finds the content useful, shouldn’t it be all that
matters?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will probably consider this change soon. Plus, I’d like to create a <strong>course</strong>
(without video) from the book’s content…</p>
<p>Regarding the workflow with Pandoc, I’m quite satisfied with it. Writing using
Markdown is lovely to focus on the content without caring how it will render.
And since Markdown is text, it’s easy to keep track of the history using Git. 🙂</p>

<p>I like poker, but I’m better at chess.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png" alt="Poker vs chess" width="499" height="451" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-347x314.png 347w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-694x628.png 694w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-768x695.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-1536x1389.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></a></p>
<p>Poker can be a lot of fun if you have a witty enough group of friends and a generous snack budget. There’s nothing worse than playing poker with a bunch of serious gamblers who think conversation and choice of hot wing spiciness are potential tells.</p>
<p>I like chess because nothing is hidden. I don’t like leaving things to chance, and I’m often foolish enough to believe I can figure out how to win if I have all the information.</p>
<p>In chess, there are no missing pieces. There isn’t a sneaky queen that your opponent can place on the board when you least expect it. Everything is in the open. The strategy and tactics are entirely determined by what is sitting in front of you in plain sight.</p>
<p>If I try to play poker the way I play chess, I’m going to lose. I can’t see all the cards. Information is hidden from me, and it’s information I need to make the right decisions.</p>
<p>If you can’t stand the uncertainty of poker, don’t do a startup. Don’t do an innovation project.</p>
<p>Innovation is like poker.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png" alt="A group of people playing poker" width="599" height="441" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>

<h2>The Rules of Startup Poker</h2>
<p>This is not an ordinary game of poker. (So don’t worry if you’re not a poker player, this will still make sense.) I will stretch the analogy of Texas Hold ‘Em as far as I can in this special variation of Startup Poker.</p>
<p>Each player needs to pay the ante to play. This is a cheap game, so we’ll keep the ante at $1. Those are the costs of running an innovation project.</p>
<p>Each player gets dealt two cards that they can keep hidden. These cards represent the organization’s unique capabilities and business model — what they already have when they start.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png" alt="A group of people playing poker part 2" width="599" height="450" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-418x314.png 418w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-836x628.png 836w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-768x577.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-1536x1154.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>As a normal Texas Hold ‘Em game progresses, the dealer will turn over additional cards in the middle of the table, which each player can use as part of their hand. First there are the three cards called “the Flop,” which are turned over at the same time. Then a fourth card is turned, which is called “Fourth Street” or “The Turn.” The last card is “the River.” Players can place bets before each of these rounds, trying to raise the stakes and force other players to fold.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png" alt="Texas Hold ‘Em startup poker" width="484" height="817" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png 1184w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-186x314.png 186w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-372x628.png 372w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-768x1297.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-910x1536.png 910w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px"></a></p>
<p>In Startup Poker, all these shared cards represent the Market. The first three cards are “the Early Adopters.” The fourth card is “the Early Majority” and the last is “the Late Majority.” As the game goes on, the Market matures and players discover if they hold the winning hand.</p>
<p>The winner of the game is the person who has the best fit between the cards in their hand (which represents their business model) and the cards on the table (the Market). We can think of this as Product / Market fit or Business Model / Market fit.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png" alt="Market vs business model" width="599" height="472" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-399x314.png 399w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-797x628.png 797w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-768x605.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-1536x1210.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>The basic setup is the same, but remember, we are not playing regular Texas Hold ‘Em. Our rules are a bit different.</p>
<h2>Information Costs Money</h2>
<p>In Startup Poker, players have to ante another $1 every round to stay in. This is the cost of product development. (For our purposes, we are eliminating the standard Hold’em practice of “blinds,” which is a form of uneven antes.).</p>
<p>Additionally, instead of every round beginning by flipping over Market cards, players can get a preview by paying an additional $1 for each card. (In real poker, everyone sees the flipped card, but in our version you’re paying for a sneak peek.)</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png" alt="A poker player peeking at a flipped card" width="699" height="514" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>This is the equivalent of funding an <a href="https://kromatic.com/workshops/building-and-resourcing-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="innovation team" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">innovation team</a> to gather Market information. This investment isn’t really just money, it’s blood, sweat, and tears. But since people * time = money, we’ll just use our poker chips to represent this investment. The team is really going out into the real world, talking to customers, putting up a landing page, or running some other form of experiment or research to gather information.</p>
<p>At that point, they have the option to kill the idea (fold) or persevere before a round of betting.</p>
<p>Should we go straight ahead and bet on our hand? Or should we buy a peek at the Market first?</p>
<h2>Bet It All in Waterfall</h2>
<p>We could just close our eyes and bet it all on our pair of jacks. This is the equivalent of <a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/lean-startup-in-the-enterprise-anti-pattern-the-lean-waterfall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall development</a>, where we place our bets and literally let the cards fall where they may.</p>
<p>We believe our cards are the correct ones for the Market, despite having not seen a single card from that Market. So we are placing a lot of faith in our business model and capabilities — our pair of jacks — and to be fair, that is a formidable hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png" alt="A player risking it all to bet in a poker game" width="599" height="405" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-465x314.png 465w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-929x628.png 929w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-768x519.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-1536x1038.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>But we’ve invested for the long hall, so we push it all in and check the snack bar while the hand plays out. But the Market isn’t kind. Our opponent starts with a 2 and a 4, but winds up closing a 2-6 straight with the 3, 5 and 6 from the Market. We lose to a weaker starting hand that ended up being better for that Market. We end up sitting in the corner binging on Pringles and lukewarm beer for the rest of the night while everyone else keeps playing, but that’s a risk of Waterfall.</p>
<h2>Information Has Value</h2>
<p>So instead of going all-in based on our business model and capabilities, should we buy that peek at the Market if we’re holding a pair of jacks?</p>
<p>The answer here is yes. Obviously so.</p>
<p>If everyone is sneaking a peek at the next card except you, you are at a huge disadvantage. Now they are playing chess because they can see more of the board. Meanwhile, you think you are still playing poker.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png" alt="A player playing chess blindfolded" width="512" height="565" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png 1812w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-285x314.png 285w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-569x628.png 569w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-768x847.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-1392x1536.png 1392w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p>
<p>True, they still can’t see their opponents’ hole cards, so they don’t have all the information, but they have more than you.</p>
<p>So should you pay for the peek no matter what you are holding in your hand? Well, that depends on the cost.</p>
<h2>Don’t Play Every Hand</h2>
<p>If you start the game with a 2 of spades and a 9 of hearts, you have a bad hand. It’s not worth getting Market information because you are woefully unprepared for any Market. You might get lucky and find three twos on the board, but that’s a longshot. The odds are that someone else has a better hand. Just fold and play the next hand.</p>

<p>For large organizations, this is the equivalent of having an idea that is fundamentally mismatched with the company.</p>
<p>“Let’s make vegan hamburgers,” says the mining company.</p>
<p>This makes no sense. It is the 2/9 offsuit of business ideas. Let’s skip this idea and work on something with a little more promise.</p>
<h2>Pivoting</h2>
<p>In the real world, startups aren’t stuck with the cards that they are dealt. If something isn’t working with their business model, they can pivot.</p>
<p>You can also alter your product in Startup Poker, because after you peek at the cards on the board, we let you trade the cards in your hand — for a price. Each round, each player has the opportunity to trade in one card at a cost of $1. It’s an option to change your product / business model after you’ve gotten a taste of the market.</p>
<p>So let’s say you start with a pair of twos — one heart and one spade. You pay $3 to peek at three cards. They are the three, four, and five of hearts.</p>
<p>You might want to trade in your two of spades and get a new card from the deck, giving yourself a shot at a flush, a straight, or a straight flush.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png" alt="Early adopters vs business model" width="599" height="585" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-321x314.png 321w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-643x628.png 643w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-768x750.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-1536x1501.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>You are exercising an option to find a better fit with the Market. It’s only the information that you’ve gained by buying a peek at the Market that makes this pivot worthwhile.</p>
<h2>Arrogance</h2>
<p>Let’s face it, arrogance never helps in chess or in poker. Everytime I get cocky in chess, I lose.</p>
<p>Chess rankings are highly visible when playing. So when I relax for my lunchtime game and see that I’m playing someone with a rating 200 points below me, I know I’m going to win. Which is of course exactly when I’m going to lose.</p>
<p>I’m so confident in winning that I start checking my Slack messages while playing. Then I draft an email. Then I make some tea. I get distracted, forget my plan, and generally make a stupid mistake.</p>
<p>“Bad luck!” But there is no luck in chess — this is the folly of arrogance.</p>
<p>If we really wanted to make Startup Poker realistic, every player would be forced to drink 5 shots of bourbon before playing, then when they look at the two cards in their hand they’ll be convinced they have three of a kind. Every entrepreneur thinks they are the second coming of Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Confidence is great. Good entrepreneurs don’t go into a market without some level of confidence. But arrogance allows your confidence to overrule your judgement.</p>
<h2>The Size of the Pot</h2>
<p>There’s another oddity to Startup Poker in that no one knows exactly how big the pot is. It is somewhat determined by the antes that people are paying in and the bets being made, but mostly it’s determined by the Market.</p>
<p>Of course, people can bet up the pot and force players to invest more to keep up. It’s the same as startups competing against each other. When one buys advertising, the others better match it or have a better strategy.</p>
<p>To calculate the value of the Market, we add up the value of the cards to determine the size of the pot (numbered cards are worth their face value, royal cards are worth $10, and aces are worth $15). So this makes buying Market information even more important.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png" alt="The size of the pot" width="699" height="356" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-600x306.png 600w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1200x612.png 1200w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-768x391.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1536x783.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>Don’t waste your money and time playing for a small pot.</p>
<h2>Crowded Markets</h2>
<p>Lastly, look at who is competing. It can be very compelling to play in a game with fewer people. Remember, the size of the prize is mostly determined by the Market, not the amount of competition. Unfortunately, in Startup Poker, players can join the game at any time.</p>
<p>When the dealer starts turning over Market cards, players who have not anteed up to that point can opt in. Of course at first they are at a disadvantage. They have missed at least one opportunity to get advanced information, and they’ve lost at least one opportunity to pivot. But they can still get into the Market — a Market that you’ve already invested in.</p>
<p>So if the first two cards the Market shows are a King and Jack, that’s $20 already in the pot. That might attract some latecomers to the game, and the competition might increase quickly.</p>

<p>Players who find themselves alone in a game at the early stages should still take advantage of the opportunity to get more information early, and to pivot if necessary. Even if …</p></div></div>

The Dockerfile schema is quite lenient and allows users to set <code>Cmd</code> without <code>Entrypoint</code>, which means that the first argument in <code>Cmd</code> will be the executable to run. </p><p>Note: k8s uses a different naming convention for Docker <code>Entrypoint</code> and <code>Cmd</code>. In Kubernetes <code>command</code> is Docker <code>Entrypoint</code> and Kubernetes <code>args</code> is Docker <code>Cmd</code>. </p><div><table><thead><tr><td>Description</td><td>Docker field name</td><td>Kubernetes field name</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The command run by the container</td><td>Entrypoint</td><td>command</td></tr><tr><td>Arguments passed to the command</td><td>Cmd</td><td>args</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>There are a few tricks to understanding how the container you’re working with starts up. In order to get the startup command when you’re dealing with someone else’s container, we need to know the intended Docker <code>Entrypoint</code> and <code>Cmd</code> of the Docker image. If you have the Dockerfile that created the Docker image, then you likely already know the <code>Entrypoint</code> and <code>Cmd</code>, unless you aren’t defining them and inheriting from a base image that has them set.</p><p>When dealing with either off the shelf containers, using someone else’s container and you don’t have the Dockerfile, or you’re inheriting from a base image that you don’t have the Dockerfile for, you can use the following steps to get the values you need. First, we pull the container locally using <code>docker pull</code>, then we inspect the container image to get the <code>Entrypoint</code> and <code>Cmd</code>:</p><ul><li><code>docker pull &lt;image id&gt;</code></li><li><code>docker inspect &lt;image id&gt;</code></li></ul><p>Here we use <code>jq</code> to filter the JSON response from <code>docker inspect</code>:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>david@sega:~: docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.2</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>7.10.2: Pulling from elasticsearch/elasticsearch</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>ddf49b9115d7: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>e736878e27ad: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>7487c9dcefbe: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>9ccb7e6e1f0c: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>dcec6dec98db: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>8a10b4854661: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>1e595aee1b7d: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>06cc198dbf22: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>55b9b1b50ed8: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>Digest: sha256:d528cec81720266974fdfe7a0f12fee928dc02e5a2c754b45b9a84c84695bfd9</span></p><p><span>13</span><span>Status: Downloaded newer image for docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.2</span></p><p><span>14</span><span>docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.2</span></p><p><span>15</span><span>david@sega:~: docker inspect docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.2 | jq '.[0] .ContainerConfig .Entrypoint'</span></p><p><span>16</span><span>[</span></p><p><span>17</span><span>  "/tini",</span></p><p><span>18</span><span>  "--",</span></p><p><span>19</span><span>  "/usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh"</span></p><p><span>20</span><span>]</span></p><p><span>21</span><span>david@sega:~: docker inspect docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.2 | jq '.[0] .ContainerConfig .Cmd'</span></p><p><span>22</span><span>[</span></p><p><span>23</span><span>  "/bin/sh",</span></p><p><span>24</span><span>  "-c",</span></p><p><span>25</span><span>  "#(nop) ",</span></p><p><span>26</span><span>  "CMD [\"eswrapper\"]"</span></p><p><span>27</span><span>]</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="the-dreaded-crashloopbackoff">The Dreaded CrashLoopBackOff</h2><p>Now that you have all that background, let’s get to debugging the CrashLoopBackOff.</p><p>In order to understand what’s happening, it’s important to be able to inspect the container inside of k8s so the application has all the environment variables and dependent services.

Using the <code>Entrypoint</code> and <code>Cmd</code> you discovered earlier, you can execute the intended startup command and see how the application is failing.</p><p>Depending on the container you’re running, it may be missing many of the tools necessary to debug your problem like: curl, lsof, vim; and if it’s someone else’s code, you probably don’t know which version of linux was used to create the image. We typically try all of the common package managers until we find the right one. Most containers these days use Alpine Linux (apk package manager) or a Debian, Ubuntu (apt-get package manager) based image. In some cases we’ve seen Centos and Fedora, which both use the yum package manager.</p><p>One of the following commands should work depending on the operating system:</p><ul><li><code>apk</code></li><li><code>apt-get</code></li><li><code>yum</code></li></ul><p>Dockerfile maintainers often remove the cache from the package manager to shrink the size of the image, so you may also need to run one of the following:</p><ul><li><code>apk update</code></li><li><code>apt-get update</code></li><li><code>yum makecache</code> </li></ul><p>Now you need to add the necessary tools to help with debugging. Depending on the package manager you found, use one of the following commands to add useful debugging tools:</p><ul><li><code>apt-get install -y curl vim procps inetutils-tools net-tools lsof</code></li><li><code>apk add curl vim procps net-tools lsof</code></li><li><code>yum install curl vim procps lsof</code></li></ul><p>At this point, it’s up to you to figure out the problem. You can edit files using vim to tweak the container until you understand what’s going on. If you forget all of the files you’ve touched on the container, you can alway kill the pod and the container will restart without your changes. Always remember to write down the steps taken to get the container working.

<p>Client, executives, and business owners always have one question at the start of a software project:</p>



<h4><em>“When will it be done?”</em><em></em></h4>



<p>If you’ve been working in software development for more than a month, you know this question is a trap.</p>



<p>Software development isn’t an assembly line where each task is measured down to the second. You’re creating a product that’s literally never existed before. There will always be uncertainty about the timeline.</p>



<p>Even so, software development is a business, so we have to accommodate the people we build software for.</p>



<p>They need the best estimate we can give them, and we need to avoid promising something we can’t deliver.</p>



<p>Which brings me to the focus of this article:</p>



<h4><em>How can I create an estimated timeline that my stakeholders will accept—but won’t lead to unrealistic deadlines for me and my team?</em><em></em></h4>



<h2>Ideal Days vs. Story Points: Two Common Methods</h2>



<p>GRAPHIC</p>



<p>In the quest to create better project estimates, developers have come up with all kinds of systems.</p>



<p>Two very common ones are:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Ideal days (or similar time-based estimates)</li><li>Story points</li></ol>



<p>Both can be used to create project timelines, and both have their pros and cons.</p>



<p>One method is reliable, data-driven, and stable.</p>



<p>The other?</p>



<p>You can make it work. But it’s a bit more like crossing your fingers and hoping for the best.</p>



<h2>1. Ideal Days: Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1259" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-scaled.jpg" alt="Ideal Days: Advantages and Disadvantages" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-300x148.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-1024x504.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-768x378.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-1536x756.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-2048x1008.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></figure>



<p>Here’s a simple definition of for the ideal days method of estimating work:</p>



<h4><em>Ideal days is an estimate of the number of days your team would take to complete a project if they worked on nothing else and had no interruptions.</em><em></em></h4>



<p>In this context, “interruptions” means anything that causes the team to stop work on the project, including team meetings, training, other projects, illness, etc.</p>



<p>For example, a team of three developers might estimate a total of 45 ideal days to complete a project. If they had no interruptions and worked on nothing else, that would be an estimated timeline of 15 days.</p>



<p>No team exists without at least <em>some</em>&nbsp;interruptions.</p>



<p>For that reason, many teams might estimate somewhere between 20 and 30 days in this situation, depending on how optimistic (or realistic) they are.</p>



<h3>Pros of Ideal Days</h3>



<p>There are two main pros to the ideal days method:</p>



<ul><li>It’s concrete and intuitive</li><li>Clients and outside stakeholders understand it immediately</li></ul>



<p>When you tell a client, “this project should take 20 days,” you don’t have to educate them about the process you’re using or a new idea. They already understand the concept of time estimates expressed in hours, days, or months.</p>



<p>In most cases, clients and outside stakeholders will ask for an estimate given in days, weeks, or months—which is the main reason the ideal days method is so popular.</p>



<h3>Cons of Ideal Days</h3>



<p>There are three major problems with the ideal days method:</p>



<ul><li>Human beings are scientifically proven to be outrageously bad at estimating how long things will take;</li><li>Ideal days are often calculated based on the ideal case scenario, not a data-backed review of actual work completed on similar projects;</li><li>In practice, software teams often miss their promise date when using the ideal days method.</li></ul>



<p>This is not news to developers, of course. It’s no secret that we’re all bad at estimating time.</p>



<p>Despite these drawbacks, though, ideal days remain a popular method of estimating time. That brings us to the other most popular method: Story points.</p>



<h2>2. Story Points: Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1270" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-scaled.jpg" alt="Story Points: Advantages and Disadvantages" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-300x149.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-1024x508.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-768x381.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-1536x762.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-2048x1016.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></figure>



<p>Here’s a definition of story points:</p>



<h4><em>Story points are an estimate of the effort—not time—required to complete a task within a larger project.</em><em></em></h4>



<p>As you probably know if you’re reading this article, the term “story points” comes from the idea of user stories, a key idea within Scrum and Agile project management methodologies.</p>



<p>If you’re creating a new report for small business owners, for example, your user story might say:</p>



<p><em>As a small business owner, I want a daily report of my revenue for the previous day.</em><em></em></p>



<p>Story points are the estimates of the effort it will take to build all the features needed to create the experience described in the user story.</p>



<h3>Story Points Use a Relative Scale</h3>



<p>Story points are often assigned using the Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.) or some other relative scale.</p>



<p>We may not know <em>exactly</em>&nbsp;how big a task is, but we know that changing a background from blue to green might be a 1 while building a new drop-down menu might be a 3 by comparison.</p>



<h4><em>Importantly, you should </em><em>never, ever</em><em>&nbsp;mix story points with ideal days or any other time-based estimation method. That includes the common practice of pegging story points to a certain number of hours or days (e.g., “One story point = one day”).</em><em></em></h4>



<p>Doing so strips your team of the most powerful reason to use story points—increasing your velocity.</p>



<h2>Pros of Story Points</h2>



<p>High-performance software teams don’t operate at one speed.</p>



<p>Instead, as they work their way through a project, they find ways to do it better, faster, and with less waste.</p>



<p>That means two vitally important things for your team:</p>



<ul><li>After you’ve been through three sprints, you will have a <em>very</em>&nbsp;strong understanding of how fast the team is moving—its velocity;</li><li>The velocity will increase over time as the team finds new ways to complete the work faster and with less waste.</li></ul>



<p>For example, it may take your team five days to complete the first 100 points of a project.</p>



<p>If so, your <em>velocity</em>&nbsp;over that first week is 100.</p>



<h3>Story Points Example Estimate</h3>



<p>Say you’re using one-week sprints for a 1,000 point project.</p>



<p>After three sprints, the team completes 104, 109, and 117 story points, respectively.</p>



<p>That’s an average velocity of 110, which is very strong evidence of the team’s capacity for this particular project <em>even with</em>&nbsp;normal interruptions. This is in stark contrast to the ideal days method, which assumes no interruptions and no other priorities.</p>



<p>You can now go to your stakeholders and confidently report that the 1,000 point project should be complete in a total of nine weeks.</p>



<p>If your team is increasing its velocity as it works (as it should!) there is a very good chance you’ll be able to deliver the project <em>ahead</em>&nbsp;of your promised delivery date.</p>



<h2>The Cons of Story Points</h2>



<p>While story points have many advantages, there are a few downsides, including:</p>



<ul><li>Story points are abstract and difficult to understand;</li><li>You might not be able to make a good timeline estimate right at the outset of a new project;</li><li>You’ll have to work hard to educate clients about the method and communicate with them often about the team’s progress.</li></ul>



<p>The abstract nature of story points means you’ll have to work much harder at communicating with clients, executives, and outside stakeholders.</p>



<p>At the beginning of the project, they’ll want you to tell them <em>exactly</em>&nbsp;how long the project will take—along with how much it will cost.</p>



<p>And in truth, you won’t <em>really</em>&nbsp;have an accurate estimate for them. It will be three sprints before you have an accurate velocity number you can use to make a data-backed projection.</p>



<p>For that reason, your initial estimates will be more uncertain than your estimates once you get the team moving.</p>



<p>That issue will be a point of concern for many clients, salespeople, or executives. They’ll want a firm timeline <em>before</em>&nbsp;they approve the project.</p>



<p>Luckily, there’s a straightforward way to create high-quality initial estimates even before you have a data-backed velocity number.</p>



<h3>How to Create an Initial Delivery Estimate Using Story Points</h3>



<p>The good news is: initial estimates using the story point method aren’t any less uncertain than the ideal days method.</p>



<p>If your team has completed similar projects to the one being proposed, review the completed sprint boards, then use the velocity the team achieved on those projects as a starting point for your estimate.</p>



<p>This lets you create realistic, data-backed estimates for the timeline of your project, ones that will get more accurate as you begin the project and start completing the work.</p>



<p>As a bonus, if you review the completed sprint boards of similar projects with your client or stakeholders as you give them your initial estimate, it will make you look like you <em>really</em>&nbsp;know what you’re doing.</p>



<p>Data-driven methods have that effect on people. 🙂</p>



<h3>Story Points Create Better Outcomes</h3>



<p>Despite its downsides, we believe story points create better outcomes for everyone involved in software development, including:</p>



<ul><li>Fewer last-minute overtime or weekend work;</li><li>More on-time projects;</li><li>Happier clients;</li><li>Happier developers;</li><li>Less overtime and write-offs—which leads to more profitable projects.</li></ul>



<h2>Use Time Tracking with Story Points for Full Visibility Within Your Sprints</h2>



<p>Story points are awesome for scoping and planning work, and velocity (once you have a real number based on at least iterations) is the most accurate way we know to calculate project timelines.</p>



<p>Together, story points and velocity are the antidote to fussy clients who want to know: “How long will this take!?”</p>



<p>Internally, however, once you’re inside a sprint, story points leave a gap in your visibility to the work being completed.</p>



<p>For example, imagine your team sets 20 points of work for a two-week sprint.</p>



<p>In Scrum, you never move a task to “complete” until it’s fully complete—ready for the user to use.</p>



<p>Five days into a ten-day sprint, you might still have 20 points remaining as “unfinished” on the sprint board.</p>



<p>You’re halfway through the sprint, but you have no information about how it’s going. You have 20 points of work remaining, but will it take five days to complete as you planned? Three days? 15 days?</p>



<p>At this point in the sprint, you have no data to make that projection.</p>



<p>It’s a bit like waking up in the morning, looking at your clock, but the only data you see is the year. It’s useful to know what year we’re in, but it doesn’t tell you if you’re running …</p></div></div>

<h4>The GPD P2 Max is a hyper-powered cross between a palm pilot and an ultrabook - it's a cyberdeck by any other name...</h4>

<p>The early 1990s were a great time to be a kid. There was the ever present threat of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls">nuclear annihilation</a>, we were constantly being reminded that <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/">Greed was Good</a>, and it marked the advent of truly portable computing.</p>

<p>Sure, laptops had been <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/03/08/the-1978-xerox-notetaker-the-first-computer-to-be-used-on-a-commercial-flight-xerox-vintagecomputing-history/">available for a while by that point</a> - albeit at a price which would financial cripple small countries - but the first part of the final decade of the 20th century saw the arrival of computing devices which would actually fit in your pocket.</p>

<p>There was a kid in every school whose Dad had been given one by his work, decided it was too complex, and who <em>palm</em>ed it off to their offspring in the misguided belief it would help them organise their busy juvenile lives.</p>

<table>

<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_3">Psion 3</a> had a keyboard and a screen. It had an address book, database software, contact managers, calculators, agendas, and world clocks - everything the high-powered 80's corporate executive could ever need to organise his high-powered 80s executive life.</p>

<p>To adolescents in the schoolyard, it had limited practical utility beyond being cool as hell - it could be flipped shut, and it could fit in your pocket.
</p>
<p>
Granted, owning one of these bad boys would not grant an amazing degree of popularity to the possessor, and the technological gap between the home and office computers of the day and the popular palmtops, meant that it would only ever be of limited utility.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Regardless, the palmtop computers were so cool as to be ice cold, and I have long wanted one which could be genuinely useful, fill the gaps left wide open by even the best mobile phones, and perform as well as a desktop PC. I wanted a   <a href="https://cyberdeck.cafe/">cyberdeck.</a></p>

<p>This led to a spree of purchases of Linux-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook">netbooks</a> and EeePCs in the early to mid 2000s - all of which were abandoned as underpowered, locked-down limited-use-case wastes of money not long after.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>

<p>The dream of a cyberdeck died - or at least fell into a coma - until the Raspberry Pi came on the scene.</p>

<p>It was ultra-low power, tolerable performance, and cheap as chips. Pi-based Cyberdecks began appearing on reddit in the (incredibly long) run-up to the release of CDPR's <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p>
<p>I even made my <a href="https://www.cyberpunks.com/super-simple-dirt-cheap-diy-portable-raspberry-pi-laptop/">own, super cheap, super low-tech version</a> which was published on another site.</p>


</td>

<img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/ghetto_cyberdeck.png" alt="The most ghetto cyberdeck... IN THE WORLD!">
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>But the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Pi</a>, excellent though it is, is a little <em>too</em> low powered to be used as a daily driver. Yes, you can use it as your main machine, but you’ll soon feel that it’s lacking… something.</p>

<p>And so, up until yesterday, I was using a 14” Dell E7470 for my everyday work and play, and carrying a Linux powered Oneplus 3 as my phone and for my mobile computing needs. The Oneplus, running <a href="https://www.ubports.com/">Ubuntu Touch</a> is great if privacy is your main concern, but as pocket sized computing platform, it’s just not there.</p>

<p>And then yesterday morning I smashed the screen of my Dell. Disaster! I write for a living, I work from home and I have deadlines. The repair is going to cost around 80 quid if I do it myself, and I would be offline for over a week. If a similar disaster occurred under normal circumstances, I’d work from the local library, but due to the current pandemic, that isn’t really an option.</p>

<p>Chinese hardware company GPD advertises the <a href="https://amzn.to/3iOQEoH">P2 Max</a> as “The world’s smallest Ultrabook,” and it is. There was also one for sale less than a mile away from me.</p>

<p>Money changed hands (at a suitable social distance), and I took my new purchase home with me.</p>

<h4> What's in the box?</h4>

<p>It’s a hella small box, and in it is a hella small, gunmetal grey laptop. It’s of comparable size to one of the palmtops of old, and I can pretty much cover the whole thing with one of my hands.</p>

<p>Open the lid, and there is a keyboard will full-sized keys. Just not very many of them.</p>

<p>There’s the usual QWERTY layout, cursors, CAPS, and numericals - but there a few noticeable absences. Only one shift, Alt and Ctrl, for instance. This isn’t a big deal as one hand can easily span the entire keyboard. There are no function keys either. The mousepad is about as small as it can be while still being usable. Again that’s OK as this tiny GPD ‘ultrabook’ comes with a 10 point touchscreen, and most of the time I use a USB optical mouse anyway.</p>

<p><img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/gpd_P2_max_is_tiny.png" alt="Honestly, it's really small!"></p>

<p>The device is powered by a standard Type C USB of the same type I use to charge my mobile, and in return, offers two Type A USB ports (one on each side), a micro HDMI port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It’s not the most expansive array of ports, but it keeps the size and weight down.</p>

<p>The screen itself is a work of wonder. At 8.9 inches, it can support resolutions of up to 2560 x 1600 px. That’s insane. No-one on Earth has eyesight good enough to comfortably read text that small for an extended period. Yes, it’s just about do-able, and the text itself is perfectly formed, but eyestrain will quickly become an issue. After spending an evening at 1920 x 180, I eventually set it to an easy 1440 x 900 px.</p>

<p>So, it’s a teeny tiny laptop with a great screen and a good keyboard, but is it an ultrabook?</p>

<p>GPD certainly thinks so - it’s the machine’s headline selling point. Personally, I’m not even sure what an Ultrabook even <em>is</em>, apart from being a somewhat flexible marketing term.</p>

<h4>Specs matter</h4>

<p>Earlier, I mentioned the netbooks i previously owned. They failed as proto-cyberdecks because they were just not up to the task of everyday computing. They weren’t even really up to the task of basic web browsing.</p>

<p>The GPD P2 Max is different. The model I now own came with a 512GB SSD, and a solid 16GB of DDR4 RAM. That’s pretty solid. The processor is an eighth gen Intel. On paper at least, it’s similar to my currently unwell Dell.</p>

<p>Windows 10 Home edition booted to desktop in a few seconds -long enough for me to verify the specs before installing my OS of choice.</p>

<p>The Ubuntu Linux install took around 10 minutes, and i3 wnt quickly on top of that. I was able to retrieve the conf files from my old machine over SSH, and just like that, I was home.</p>

<p>Yes, it took a few minutes to get used to the keyboard, and I kept banging my fingers into the touchscreen and acidentally stealing focus, but meh. A person gets used to these things.</p>

<h4>Performance</h4>

<p>The best way of judging the performance is to tell you exactly how I’m using the machine at the moment, and how I’ve used it in the single day since it’s been in my house.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m writing this article in Atom on Workspace 5.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On workspace 1, I have three XFCE terminals open - running Bashtop, TaskWarrior, and an SSH to my Pi which is tailing my access logs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace two has a Firefox window with 27 open tabs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace three has another Firefox window with a dozen or so tabs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Workspaces one, two and three open automatically with their contents intact on boot.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace four has an incognito Firefox window, in which I’m doing research I probably won’t want to reference again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace six is running a <a href="https://thecrow.uk/why-does-this-site-look-like-crap-getting-used-to-life-with-jekyll/">Jekyll</a> local server in a terminal, automatically updating the preview of this article on workspace four.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace seven is running a script which periodically checks for comments on this blog and brings them to my attention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Workspace eight, I have <a href="https://thecrow.uk/freelancing-in-a-time-of-quarantine-and-why-rss-is-the-greatest/">QuiteRSS</a>, checking for writing jobs on my behalf.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In workspace nine, I’m conducting a war of attrition against Matthias Corvinus of the Hungarian Empire in <em>Civilization VI</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Is the GPD P2 Max capable? Hell yes. I’m using it exactly how I used my old laptop. I’ve been playing games through Steam. I’ve been  Windows games using WINE. I’ve been productive and I’ve been having fun.</p>

<p>And when I’ve finished, I can pick it up and put it in my pocket. Even better, the screen is covered with Gorilla Glass 4, so the accident which happened to my Dell can never happen again.</p>

<p>It’s a cyberdeck.</p>

January 26, 2021 | https://digitstodollars.com/2021/01/21/hardware-is-hard/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://digitstodollars.com/2021/01/21/hardware-is-hard/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>We have written a lot about the blind spot the US venture ecosystem has for <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2019/09/30/3042/">semiconductors</a> (<a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/08/10/not-a-drop-for-you/">and here</a>) and hardware more generally. We recently helped a venture firm conduct due diligence on an electronics company, which put us in the awkward position of having to walk in someone else’s shoes. Sympathy for the devil, and all that. In our posts we have attempted to be fair, pointing out that US VCs are making sensible economic decisions albeit on a short-sighted viewpoint. Investing in hardware is much more capital intensive and thus risky than investing in software. In this post, we want to work through some of the math behind that. </p>



<p>Let’s say we have a company, Unicorn Electronics, that wants to build The SmartHorn <sup>TM</sup>, a device that magically solves customers’ problems perfectly. How do we get the company to “escape velocity” – positive cashflow sufficient to fund the company’s immediate growth needs?</p>



<p>First, Unicorn needs to design the Horn. Depending on how complex the device is this can cost anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million, from a third party design shop. Some people can do this design themselves, others are going to need outside help. For our purposes, let’s say the Horn design costs $500,000. This amount gets the company the “blueprints” and a few prototypes.  </p>



<p>But most devices today are fairly complex. Even if the hard computation is done in the cloud or in the app, the device itself needs to be able to function, to be programmed and to communicate with the Internet. That means firmware. This is low-level software, and not only is their no standard “firmware” programming language or operating system, pretty much every chip company has its own instruction language. Hiring firmware engineers is not that expensive in dollars, but it can be very expensive in time. Here’s a typical scenario. The design shop hands the firmware designers some prototypes. The firmware team finds a bug that requires a new wire or capacitor. So the design firm has to build (by hand) a new prototype. The firmware team then finds that two of the chips are not speaking to each other – the Bluetooth and the temperature sensor for instance. Is the problem in one chip or the other or somewhere in the wiring in between? Often this will mean the design team needs to spin up yet another prototype. And since these teams are likely in different cities, if not different countries, every re-spin loses days in shipping and re-work. </p>



<p>So far, we have spent $500,000 and a month on the design, and $100,000 and four months on firmware.</p>



<p>Now we have to find a manufacturer. This company will need to create tools and molds as well as designing a manufacturing flow. They can do this fairly quickly, but as they are operating on expensive machine tools, they will have minimum quantity requirements. These can be as low as a few thousand units, but here is where the costs really start to add up. </p>



<p>Let’s say the SmartHorn costs $100 in parts and manufacturing, but the manufacturer requires a minimum of 5,000 units. Then the tricky part becomes sourcing parts. The global electronics supply chain is incredibly tight right now. <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/10/27/what-is-happening-to-the-supply-chain/">We wrote about this back in October</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/business/auto-factories-semiconductor-chips.html">New York Times was catching up last week</a>. Lead times for many parts can be several months, and frustratingly it is hard to predict with often some of the lowest value parts in the shortest supply. So add $500,000 (5,000 units X $100 BOM) and four months. </p>



<p>Then we enter into a whole sea of minutiae. The device will need various certifications UL, FCC, etc. Add $50,000, but fortunately this can be done while the manufacturing is ramping up. But there are bigger costs as well such as insurance. Most distributors (i.e. retail) and enterprise customers will want the company to maintain a range of insurance policies, tack on another $50,000 or so. Then we have to factor in shipping and customs and taxes, so maybe $20 per device. </p>



<p>Next up, the company has to factor in warranties and returns. The accountants have requirements for setting reserves for these, but a rough rule of thumb (sufficient for our purposes here only) is 10% of the costs of the materials needs to be set aside to cover the cost of returns and replacements. </p>



<p>Finally, the company has to contend with marketing. This amount can range from nothing to A Lot, depending on whether they are selling to consumers or to a single large enterprise customer. A basic PR budget and some content marketing runs about $50,000, plus or minus. </p>



<p>Adding this up we have the following budget:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Item</td><td>Amount</td><td data-align="center">Time</td></tr><tr><td>Design</td><td>$500,000</td><td data-align="center">1 Month</td></tr><tr><td>Firmware</td><td>$100,000</td><td data-align="center">4 Months</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacture</td><td>$500,000</td><td data-align="center">4 Months</td></tr><tr><td>Certification</td><td>$50,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Insurance</td><td>$50,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Shipping </td><td>$100,000</td><td data-align="center">1 Month</td></tr><tr><td>Marketing</td><td>$50,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Sub-total Cost of Goods Sold</td><td>$1,350,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Warranty Reserve</td><td>$135,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>TOTAL</strong></td><td><strong>$1,485,000</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>9 Months</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>All of this has to take place before the company can collect any revenue, unless they have done some form of crowdsourcing. So just to break even the company has to charge $297/unit, and to get a 50% gross margin the retail price would need to be $594. </p>



<p>We also need to factor in software costs. For this example, we will assume Unicorn Electronics does their own app and back-end software. The company could probably build all of the hardware and software with a team of ten people. If the average salary is $150,000 year (assume some expensive onshore talent and some less expensive offshore talent), the total comes out to $1.5 million for a year. </p>



<p>So $1.485 million in hardware costs and $1.5 million for headcount, for a total of $2.985 million. The company then sells 5,000 units for $594 a piece or $2.97 million in revenue and yielding a net <em><strong>loss</strong></em> of ($15,000). Hardware can be dispiriting.</p>



<p>The good news is that there is a heavy fixed costs component to this model, so tweaking a few variables can have a big impact. For instance, if they raise prices by $6/unit to an even $600, the net profit goes to $15,000 (positive). Sell an additional 1,000 units and the net profits are close to half a million dollars. If they sell 100,000 units then the company has a path to becoming a true Unicorn. There is a lot of leverage in the model, which is why people keep trying to build hardware. </p>



<p>That being said, the realities of hardware can be daunting. Take the $3 million the company needs to get a product out the door, a similarly sized team could build a software application that can potentially grow much faster and they would still have a million dollars to do customer acquisition. Compounding this, the software would come with a recurring revenue stream. The trouble with hardware is that for the company to grow, they have to come out with the Smart Horn 2 and the Smart Horn 3, and go through all of the above again, and again. </p>



<p>Hardware has immense financial leverage, but the upfront costs and more crucially the time required are daunting. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><figure><div></div></figure><section><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><a href="https://rudderstack.com/blog/the-complete-customer-data-stack/">Your data warehouse is the platform your customer data stack is built on</a>. It acts as a robust central system for driving critical business decisions while maintaining a unified source of truth for your entire organization. Businesses are constantly looking to improve their product or marketing strategies to get an extra edge over their competitors. Data warehouses help you get that competitive edge by serving analytical data to make fact-based decisions that drive innovation and business growth. While teams turn those analysis-driven insights into strategies and tactics, it’s tough to activate the warehouse’s actual data that the insights are based on.</p>
<p>To make it easier to utilize and activate all of the analytics your teams build, we’re launching a new feature called RudderStack Warehouse Actions. Warehouse Actions enables you to leverage processed customer data stored in your data warehouse and directly route this enriched information to your entire customer data stack.</p>
<p>In this post, we detail Warehouse Actions. We explain how configuring your warehouse as a data source can fully unlock your data’s value, how Warehouse Actions works, some of its benefits, and how to set it up in RudderStack.</p>
<div> <p> <iframe title="" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iafB9gyoWtc?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> </div>
<h2>Why Warehouse Actions?</h2>
<p>Data warehouses are an indispensable tool as they enable decision-makers to access data quickly through business intelligence tools, SQL clients, and other analytical applications. Without a data warehouse in place, you are forced to rely on the individual (siloed) applications you use and the raw data from each for analysis. </p>
<p>A warehouse helps guarantee that your data is unified, consistent, and high-quality by eliminating duplicate records, errors, and inconsistent information. It also enables your teams to perform deep analysis and modeling on your data, something that is nearly impossible without a warehouse.  Given the quality of the data in your warehouse and your teams’ can derive from it, it makes sense to use the customer data in your warehouse to activate your customer tools. </p>
<p>Warehouse Actions makes feeding customer insights into your customer data pipelines easy by turning tables into event streams that can trigger activation in your downstream customer tools. </p>

    </span><figcaption>Warehouse Actions Architecture</figcaption></figure>
<p>RudderStack makes it easy to collect data from different sources, event and non-event, and securely ingest them into your warehouse. Once data is successfully ingested, your teams can then apply advanced queries or models to generate valuable data composites (either tables or views) that are frequently materialized (aka written) as their tables and stored in your data warehouse. For example, <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a> can be used to transform data within your warehouses by simply writing select statements. dbt turns these select statements into tables and views.</p>
<p>With Warehouse Actions, any updates to the analytics-derived datasets that live in your warehouse can be collected by RudderStack and pushed as events to all of your customer tools.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Using a Warehouse Actions</h2>
<p>Even if collected and unified across multiple touchpoints, customer event data may lack the necessary information to build complete or enriched customer profiles. Event data alone doesn’t give context into any of the information stored in your customer master data, campaign data, or even your advertising data. When you have data from sources beyond events that could make your customer profiles better or enable deeper, more meaningful analysis, you need a data warehouse. Your warehouse is where you can combine all of these different types of customer data to define better customer profiles and derive more meaningful insights from more in-depth analysis. With Warehouse Actions, you can route the customer insights in your data warehouse to third-party tools for further activation. </p>
<p>For example, when running a new marketing campaign, you are often challenged with gathering the “right data” for personalized emails,  push notifications, or targeted audiences. This “right data” often starts with simple data, such as name and email address, and then expands to complex customer data, including behavioral traits, products viewed, subscriptions enrolled, and so on. All of the data you need to make the “right data” is either already in your data warehouse or easily could be. </p>
<p>Warehouse Actions lets you action on the “right data”, routing the outputs of your team’s analysis to all of your customer tools. As a result, it is significantly easier to help your marketing teams build and automate things like customized recommendations for campaigns. Also, it allows your product team to build win-back flows for users likely to churn. </p>
<h2>Setting up Warehouse Actions in RudderStack</h2>
<p>We will use a real-world example to walk through how to set up Warehouse Actions. Let’s say your company wants to use the number of log-ins over seven days to calculate a lead score for new users. Multiple log-ins will increase the lead score. </p>
<p>Let’s also say that because you use RudderStack Event Stream and RudderStack Cloud Extract, you have the log-in event data from your website, iOS app, and Android app, as well as the lead records from Salesforce in your warehouse. You can use SQL (or another method of querying the data) to build a simple model for calculating each lead score. The result is a table in your warehouse that lists Salesforce leads and their associated score. </p>
<p>In Snowflake, the query to calculate lead score and produce a table might look something like this: </p>

    </span><figcaption>Calculating the Lead Score</figcaption></figure>
<p>With Warehouse Actions, you can easily pull the updated lead profiles from the table in Snowflake back through RudderStack and send them to Salesforce, meaning your sales team will have the most up-to-date status on new signups. Because the table is translated into an event stream, you can also route it to any other tools that need the lead score, like marketing automation and customer experience platforms. </p>
<p>Configuring Warehouse Actions is simple and only takes a few minutes.</p>

<h2>Pachyderm Uses Warehouse Actions to Automate Their Onboarding E-mails</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.pachyderm.com/">Pachyderm</a>, an enterprise-grade, open-source data science platform, implemented Warehouse Actions for lead qualification. After creating an account, the first action Pachyderm wants their customers to do is create a workspace. They encourage users to do this in a series of drip emails sent through <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a>, but they don’t want these drip emails to go out to customers that have already created a workspace. This data is already in their data warehouse, and now, with Warehouse Actions, they can automatically exclude these customers from this drip email series.</p>

    <p>2021-01-26 08:59:23+00:00</p>
    <p><a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a> is the “new” (13 years old already) display server technology on Linux, which is supposed to replace
the antiquated X11. It promises better security, performance, portability, everything, compared to X11, and
it sure does deliver, provided that you’re not using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/">unsupported graphics cards</a>.
You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIctzAQOe44">this talk / rant about X11</a> to get an idea about how bad it is.</p>

<p>Some power users also haven’t switched to Wayland because their window manager doesn’t have a
Wayland equivalent (XMonad, Awesome, Bspwm and the others, all having their unique feature-set). Some may wonder “hmm maybe I can port it myself”. I wrote this post to make you (re)consider that.</p>

<p>One of the main ideas of Wayland is that it’s merely a specialised IPC protocol, and the communication is
strictly between the clients (applications on your screen mainly) and the server.</p>

<p>The server is what we are interested in now. Unlike X11, where the server is X.Org and the window manager
is just an X11 client with special privileges, on Wayland the window manager is also a server and a compositor. In fact, the correct terminology is “Wayland compositor”. This piece of software has the
task of doing everything it wants with the clients, which is usually among the lines of showing them
on the screen and giving them inputs events from your keyboards, mice, touchscreens etc. In fact, <a href="https://mir-server.io/">no one
stops you from leaving window management as an API</a>.</p>

<p>On my laptop, I prefer using GNOME under Wayland, because it has the most stable, fully-featured and “just works”
experience there is. However, I wanted a better way of organising windows on my screen than leaving them
shuffled around. Tiling was also not good, because every time you launch a new window, the others get
shrunk to fit, which is not good on a small laptop display.</p>

<p>Luckily I discovered <a href="https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM">PaperWM</a>. It’s perfect for laptops, instead of
shrinking your windows, it just renders them off-screen. To switch between one or the other you can just
flick three fingers on the touchpad. It’s great. It’s also “glossy” and polished and has great UI and animations.</p>

<p>It has some disadvantages though, mainly concerning its speed. I find it sluggish, and it’s no surprise that
like all other GNOME Shell extensions, it’s a JavaScript behemoth. PaperWM still uses the GNOME Tweener
framework for its animations, which is entirely written in JS. Because of that, it needs to communicate with the main
GNOME compositor process on each operation. And because we’re talking animations, said operations happen
for <em>every frame</em>. That means there is JS executed for every frame, 60 times a second. It’s horrible!</p>

<p>BTW nowadays GNOME uses animations implemented in C (since GNOME 3.34), the “GNOME runs JS on every frame” statement is for the most part false today.</p>

<p>Because of the inefficiency of PaperWM, it also means that it drains my battery quickly, which is bad for a laptop!</p>

<p>So, because I am a student with a lot of free time, together with <a href="https://alexge50.com/">Alex</a> we figured we shall develop a scrollable tiling (PaperWM-like) Wayland compositor. It’s called <a href="https://gitlab.com/cardboardwm/cardboard">Cardboard</a> (get it??). It also has the nicety of
being controlled and configured by a remote control program, like bspwm.
Neither Alex nor I had experience with any kind of Wayland development. However, I wrote <a href="https://tudorr.ro/software/windowchef/">an X11 window manager</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tudurom/disputils/">some XRandR querying utilities</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tudurom/ruler">a window rule daemon</a>. Alex has experience
with <a href="https://git.alexge50.com/a/gie">graphics programming</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alexge50/libwatchpoint">C++ devilry</a>.</p>

<p>Our “tech stack” was <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots">wlroots</a>, which is an exceptional Wayland compositor library (apart from its lack of documentation). The description from the README is spot on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About 50,000 lines of code you were going to write anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I (because I wrote most of the Wayland-interfacing code) realised soon that there is still a lot of boilerplate involved in writing a compositor, much more than for an X11 window manager,
namely setting up your own rendering code, registering and storing input devices and screens in your own data structures, passing input events to windows, calculating bounds for bars
and other overlays (courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlr-protocols/blob/master/unstable/wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1.xml"><code>layer-shell</code></a>) and others. X11 handles all of this for you,
the window manager just reacts to events regarding window inputs to establish its behaviour. With Wayland, you handle everything, even with wlroots. The upside is that if you don’t like the way X11 does something
(which is a given), not only that you can do it in your own way on Wayland, you are required to do so.</p>

<p>Because we weren’t really prepared for what writing a compositor involved, we thought that it must be approached like a “normal” program: split code into modules, each with their own responsibilities, call wlroots to do its thing, the usual stuff.
We are writing a program in our way and wlroots lets us “interface with Wayland”. Or so we thought.</p>

<p>We were as careful as possible to separate responsibilities into different structures / classes, yet we ended up with most functions taking a pointer to <code>Server</code> as their first parameter.
<code>Server</code> is a singleton holding all the other “sub-modules” in it. It represents the compositor itself. The reason most functions need <code>Server</code> is that everything is related to everything,
not because of a mistake in structuring the code, but by design. This is what a compositor requires, the problem of writing a compositor is somewhat complex because it has a great deal variables ranging
from input events, drawing on the screen, creating behaviours that the user leverages, reacting to application events. All of them can affect the other, you can not separate the thing into modules.
The best you can do is separate the code in different files and folders based on some criteria, like grouping data structures with related routines.</p>

<p>Excerpt from <code>Seat.h</code>:</p>

<p>As an example, let’s take damage tracking. For starters, because the compositor is also tasked with rendering the content and displaying it on the screen, we have some rendering code that runs on every frame.
Damage tracking is tracking which areas of the screen have changed in an amount of time. An example would
be typing a letter in the terminal. The place where the cursor is changes to the letter you typed, and the cursor advances.
If there is no change, the frame is not rendered, as it would look
exactly the same as the previous one, which would be a waste of processor time.
This way, instead of re-rendering everything 60 times a second (I assume that you use a common display), we can render and paint as little as possible to account for the changed region.
You can read <a href="https://emersion.fr/blog/2019/intro-to-damage-tracking/">an introduction to damage tracking</a> written by one of the main developers of wlroots.</p>

<p>I have just implemented the most basic form of damage tracking: do not render the frame if nothing on the screen changes.
It doesn’t track the damage itself, just that it exists.
To do this, I first added a <code>wlr_output_damage</code> object to my <code>Output</code> structure:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct Output {
</span>    struct wlr_output* wlr_output;
    struct wlr_output_damage* wlr_output_damage;
<span>+   struct wlr_box usable_area;
</span>    ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This structure tracks the damage accumulated per-output, as rendering is also per-output (this means that you can use screens of different refresh rates, yay!). However, to make this initial attempt at
damage tracking easier, I decided to trigger rendering for all attached outputs. I added a <code>set_dirty()</code> function to the <code>OutputManager</code> class that does just that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>OutputManager</span><span>::</span><span>set_dirty</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>output</span> <span>:</span> <span>outputs</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>wlr_output_damage_add_whole</span><span>(</span><span>output</span><span>.</span><span>wlr_output_damage</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This marks every output as entirely damaged, and as such triggers a render.</p>

<p>With this function set into place, I had to identify when does the “screen” change, namely when a window “commits” (changes its contents) and when a window is moved. The window move is one example
of the way everything is related to everything in the …</p></article></div>

    <p>You may have heard that TypeScript has been taking the web development space by storm in the <a href="https://2018.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/typescript/">last</a> <a href="https://2019.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/typescript/">few</a> <a href="https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/javascript-flavors/">years</a>, bringing to it static types. I believe the same thing is starting to happen in the world of Python, where type checkers like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>,  <a href="https://pyre-check.org/">Pyre</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/pyright">Pyright</a> are increasingly used, at least where Python is used by companies to write large systems.</p>

<p>For the last several releases of Python, there have been an increasing number of type checking features added to each release by various PEPs:</p>




<p>The traffic on <a href="https://mail.python.org/archives/list/typing-sig@python.org/">typing-sig</a>, the mailing list where most major new typing features are proposed and designed, has also been seeing increasing traffic year over year.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I personally have found type checking to be very useful when working on large Python applications<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It helps me find numerous small errors that are introduced during regular development<!-- such as import errors-->. Sure, most of these errors would be caught by the automated tests that I write for each new feature anyway<!-- TODO: footnote+link to TDD or similar practice? -->, but the type checker can find a whole bunch of errors all at once without even running the program, which decreases cycle times when adding new features:</p>

<p>Without type checking I tend to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a bunch of new code.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat 4-6 times, in rapid succession:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Run program to manually test.</li>
<li>Find basic error (like a missing import).</li>
<li>Fix basic error.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Debug/fix deeper errors in the new code.</li>
</ul>


<p>But <em>with</em> type checking I can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a bunch of new code.</li>
<li><strong>Run the type checker. Get a report of 4-6 basic errors. Fix basic errors immediately.</strong></li>
<li>Debug/fix deeper errors in the new code.</li>
</ul>


<p>I appreciate this increased productivity that type checking gives me when working on large programs. And I hope that more Python users try type checking for themselves, especially as Python gains an increasing number of related features in recent releases. It’s an exciting time to be a Python developer!</p>

Let’s dig in!</p><h2 id="web-development-frameworks-for-rust">Web development frameworks for Rust</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/t4/t4mp0qkr.1_(45)_(1).jpg" alt="Rust web development" loading="lazy"></p><p>Can you build a web app with Rust? Definitely!</p><p>Rust has multiple extremely fast web frameworks – Rocket, Actix Web, and Yew – and you can use the one that matches your needs and preferences.</p><h3 id="rocket">Rocket</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket">Rocket</a> is the most accessible web framework in the Rust ecosystem for beginners. It is highly customizable and helps you kickstart a new application quickly. At the same time, it avoids a lot of unnecessary boilerplate. Rocket also has many features included, which means that you won’t need to go far from the framework to build everything you need.</p><p>In contrast to Actix Web, the framework runs on nightly Rust – the “experimental” version of the language.</p><h3 id="actix-web">Actix Web</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/actix/actix-web">Actix Web</a> is usually thought to be more performant and stable than Rocket. Underneath, it works with the actor model used in <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-erlang#process-oriented">Erlang</a> and <a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/actors.html">Akka</a>.</p><p>In contrast to Rocket, it’s less “batteries included”, meaning that you will most likely need to use third-party libraries for extra functionality.</p><h3 id="yew">Yew</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/yewstack/yew">Yew</a> is a Rust framework for creating web apps with WebAssembly. Among its main benefits, it lists a component-based framework like in React and Elm, outstanding performance because of the multi-thread support, and JavaScript interoperability.</p><p>As of now, it is not production-ready but should be an excellent choice for side projects and internal tooling, especially if you want to work with WASM.</p><h3 id="zola">Zola</h3><p>If you need something quick and simple to serve a static website, <a href="https://github.com/getzola/zola">Zola</a> is a fantastic tool to create fast and scalable web pages without any other dependencies or JS bloat.</p><h3 id="warp">Warp</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp">Warp</a> is a web server framework written in Rust. In comparison to Rocket and Actix, it is rather slim for a web framework and will provide you only with basic functionality out of the box.</p><h2 id="game-development">Game development</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/cu/cubf89sc.2_(36)_(1).jpg" alt="Rust game development" loading="lazy"></p><p>Rust is exceptional for game development for the same reason that C++ is: it is predictably performant.

Among them, <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">Bevy</a> is the newer and cooler one. It is a simple, data-driven engine and can essentially be called Amethyst 2.0 since it is heavily inspired by it.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qjc0V58lB7A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>For more info on Bevy, you can check out the <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction/">Bevy book</a>.</p><h3 id="amethyst">Amethyst</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst">Amethyst</a> is the more mature one of the two and, because of that, has more features that you might need for a large-scale project and better integrations with 3rd party libraries. But, Bevy is catching up fast. If you are searching for an engine for your new project, I’d recommend looking at them both and seeing which one you like better.</p><h3 id="ggez">ggez</h3><p>If you are searching for something simple to start off, <a href="https://github.com/ggez/ggez">ggez</a> is a lightweight cross-platform game framework for making 2D games with minimal friction.</p><hr><p>If you want to read more on game development in Rust, check out <a href="https://arewegameyet.rs/">Are we game yet?</a></p><h2 id="operating-systems">Operating systems</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/zd/zdu35vif.3_(34)_(1).jpg" alt="Rust operating systems" loading="lazy"></p><p>Rust is an excellent alternative to C in operating system development since it offers the same level of performance while taking care of memory safety.

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607550167012_219370"><div><p>Today a lot of valuable digital construction data (BIM data and beyond) is locked up in closed proprietary data formats which are bound to aging software packages developed by a single software vendor. As a result, stakeholders in the construction process (e.g. contractors, sub-contractors, estimators, specification writers, owners, facility managers, etc.) are unable to fully leverage the BIM data to make better decisions or optimize their processes. Some of the negative results are miscommunication and misunderstanding between stakeholders, inaccurate estimation, change orders, scheduling and planning conflicts, errors in constructability, and so on.</p><p>Two decades ago, it was common practice for data formats to be only read and written by a single piece of software, on a single platform. This is no longer adequate.</p><p>As the internet has grown in importance, and as computing devices have become more specialized, well-designed open data exchange formats such as PDF, HTML, JPEG, MP3, MP4, and XML have become crucial to the effective exchange of data.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607550167012_228680"><div><p>So what is an open format, why is it good for the construction industry? First, according to Wikipedia:</p><blockquote><p><em>An open format is a file format for storing digital data, defined by a published specification usually maintained by a standards organization, and which can be used and implemented by anyone. For example, an open format can be implemented by both proprietary and free and open-source software, using the typical software licenses used by each. In contrast to open formats, closed formats are considered trade secrets.</em></p></blockquote></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606975570419_24188"><p><h3>Open Formats are Good for Customers</h3></p></div></div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607435564498_23818"><div><p><em>As a customer, it is risky to build a dependency on technology based on a single vendor’s closed format. </em>Users place themselves entirely at the mercy of one business: their pricing, tooling, and support. This has proven to be a real problem for customers that have their data locked up behind a walled garden that they must pay exorbitant amounts of money to have limited access to it.</p><p>This is a relic of an older business model from the time when most computing was done in isolation on a single machine. This model is extremely outdated. </p><p>Customers expect to be able to have contextual views of the same data across different platforms with varying capabilities.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606975833465_16265"><p><h3>Open Formats are Good for Businesses</h3></p></div></div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606975950758_13055"><div><p>Technology that is open is better. When a community of experts can examine and identify inconsistencies or ambiguities in a specification, it assures that the product is of better quality. As a result, open formats have more longevity, and will often evolve into something better.</p><p>Another benefit for us at VIM to develop an open format is that it encourages us internally to keep our own house clean. Knowing that everything we do is potentially up for scrutiny and has ramification for others. It encourages better software development practices.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606975950758_18076"><p><h2>Evaluating Existing Formats</h2></p></div></div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606975950758_21277"><p><h3>At VIM we started our journey with a business requirement to bring BIM models and data quickly into lower power Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality devices. We carefully evaluated many different file formats before starting our journey. The four primary contenders for 3D BIM interchange into real-time which we evaluated were: FBX, glTF, USD, and IFC.</h3></p></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976253291_13454"><p><a href="https://help.autodesk.com/view/FBX/2020/ENU/%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0"><strong>FBX</strong></a><strong> (FilmBox File Format)</strong> is a widely used file format originally from Kaydara and is now owned and maintained by Autodesk. It has become the default asset transmission format in the games industry. Even though FBX has a free SDK, it is not open format. Reading and writing FBX files requires the binary SDK and it cannot be ported to web-browsers. FBX was originally designed for animation data. It does not do a good job of conveying the semantics of BIM data and is inefficient at handling large geometry.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976375619_14778"><p><a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0"><strong>glTF</strong></a><strong> (GL Transmission Format)</strong> is an open data exchange format for 3D geometry and animation data that was designed specifically for WebGL. The glTF format is a difficult specification to fully support (for reading and writing) and requires custom extensions to support BIM data and geometry data channels beyond a limited initial set.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976477826_42054"><p><a href="https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/index.html%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0"><strong>USD</strong></a><strong> (Universal Scene Description)</strong> is a framework for authoring and rendering 3D scenes composed from multiple sources.

IFC was started in 1994 by a consortium of 12 companies led by <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/">Autodesk</a>.</p><p>IFC was designed to express parametric surfaces and solids and their associated BIM data. This means that to make a rendering, the parametric surfaces and solids must go through a very lengthy conversion process into a triangular representation appropriate for rendering by the GPU (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">Graphical Processing Unit</a>). The GPU specializes in drawing lists of triangles very quickly. The conversion of a parametric surface to a triangular format is called “triangulation” or “tessellation”.</p><p>The process of triangulating complex intersecting parametric surfaces is very time consuming for a computer, and hard to do correctly. It requires a specialized library, called a geometry kernel. With the goal of reducing the time required to display the geometry, this made IFC unacceptably inefficient for us.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976621178_36617"><p><h3>Our Findings Left Us Searching for More Answers</h3></p></div></div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976943187_17825"><p>We found that these formats required too much complexity to parse large scale BIM projects correctly and efficiently on low-power devices, and they had no built-in mechanism to carry the structured BIM data.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remote work is trending. But the remote revolution started long before the pandemic and will stay powerful even after the hype subsides. As with any change, how well you adapt and improve will determine whether you get the better of remote work or run back to offices once the external factors go away.</p> <p>I decided to go remote 3 years ago and I'm glad I did. My last workplace was BriteCore, a remote-first company based in the US. And tomorrow, I'll be joining Doist, a pioneer in the world of remote work. I have gone through a lot of interview processes in the recent years.</p> <p>This article is an attempt to answer the why, what and how of remote work. The intended primary audience are developers from developing countries like me (I'm from Bangladesh) who do not want to relocate right now but wants to work on exciting products and teams all over the world. The general ideas apply to all professions that can be carried out remotely and to professionals anywhere in the world.</p> <h2 id="why-remote"> Why Remote</h2> <h3 id="better-opportunities"> Better Opportunities</h3> <p>Going remote means your employment is not limited to your physical location anymore. That opens up a world of opportunities. You can work for your dream company or with the colleagues and experts that you cherish. And all of it while staying in the place you like with the people you love. If you are the nomad type, this gives you great flexibility.</p> <h3 id="better-financial-gain"> Better Financial Gain</h3> <p>💵 Remote work opens up much better opportunities with much better compensations if you're, like me, living in a developing country. The compensations are generally much better than the local industry.</p> <p>📈 The high exchange rates between the powerful currencies and the local ones allow you to leverage the asymmetry and save much more. In fact, you can end up with a higher net savings per month than someone earning more than you in expensive places like San Francisco or London for example.</p> <p>📉 Tax rates are also generally lower and most developing countries have generous rebates if you're bringing in foreign remittance.</p> <p>✅ Even if you're living in a developed country, remote work saves you a good amount from commute, lunch and everything in between that comes with showing up in an office.</p> <h3 id="better-self-actualization"> Better Self-actualization</h3> <p>Remote work allows you to do deep work and puts you in control of your routine and interruptions. In a world of constant connectivity, the option to go deep as needed can give you an unfair advantage in knowledge based work that reward craftsmanship and superior skills. Read the interesting book titled <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Work by Cal Newport</a> to learn more about this.</p> <h2 id="the-remote-skillset"> The Remote Skillset</h2> <p>Remote work comes with its share of challenges. You need to adapt and overcome these challenges to thrive in a remote work environment for the long term. And the process starts with adopting the remote skillset.</p> <p>I use a handy mnemonic  to summarise the skillset essential for remote work. I call it the <strong>IBM CI</strong>. IBM, as you probably know, is the name of a famous company and CI or <em>Continuous Integration</em> is a term developers are quite familiar with.</p> <p>The mnemonic comes from <strong>I</strong>ndependence, <strong>B</strong>alance, <strong>M</strong>astery, <strong>C</strong>ommunication and <strong>I</strong>mpact. I borrowed it from <a href="https://doist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doist</a>. So, all credit goes to the awesome team there. I just came up with the mnemonic to remember it better. You can find it in any of their job descriptions. Their <a href="https://blog.doist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> is chalk-full of great articles on remote work. Subscribe to the blog to get the best out of it.</p> <p>I'll only touch on two aspects that encompass everything else.</p> <p><strong>Manager of One</strong>: Going remote means you're unlikely to have colleagues by your side. If you're working from home, it can be quite a challenge to put a boundary between work and non-work time. You're in charge of yourself and your schedule. So, you need to be able to do it well if you want to succeed in remote work in the long term.</p> <p>I borrowed the term <em>Manager of One</em> from Basecamp, a pioneer and advocate of remote work. The ability to manage yourself is pivotal to a successful remote career. Read more about it on Basecamp's <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> on the topic.</p> <p><strong>Communication</strong>: Bulk of the communication in remote work happens in the written medium. You need to harness your ability to express your thoughts and ideas clearly in the written form to thrive in a remote setting. This is also going to be the primary mode of making connections with colleagues across the company. You don't need to become a literary genius though. Clear and concise technical writing goes a long way. <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1208930197702995968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This tweet </a>sums up a  lot of great points.</p> <p>The tone gets lost in transmission in written medium. It's always good to pay extra attention to not come off harsh. Warm your messages with emojis 😃</p> <p>Most remote settings will have a diverse workforce. It's important that you stay sensitive to cultural diversities and refrain from saying anything that may be acceptable in your culture but not in others. Avoid using swear or curse words in all settings even if you deem it to be informal. I have had a manager in the past who would use the f-word in meetings. Please don't!</p> <p>As for technical skills, I advice to work on-site when starting out if possible. Most remote jobs expect you to do your job with minimal supervision. It's easier to find jobs and perform better when you have some experience under your belt.</p>  <p>Remote work means managing yourself well. Most of your communication will happen online and it is expected that you'll be using a lot of collaboration tools. Here are some of my suggestions to organise yourself better and produce quality output.</p> <p>📝 Use a task management tool. Put all your tasks as they pop up in your list and plan them accordingly. I use <a href="https://todoist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Todoist</a> for this but any tool that you're comfortable with works, even pen and paper.</p> <p>📓 Use an app for writing and taking notes. I prefer <a href="https://ia.net/writer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iA writer</a> for long documents and <a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evernote</a> for quick notes synced across devices. But again, anything that you're comfortable with works fine.</p> <p>🛠 Familiarise yourself with communication tools like Slack, Teams, etc if not already. Most companies use one for communication. While there's not much of a learning curve, you should at least know that they exist. Same for project management tools like Jira, Trello and so on.</p> <h2 id="shades-of-remote"> Shades of Remote</h2> <p>This section is more focused on developer jobs. Remote work can mean a lot of things for a developer. It can be consulting, freelancing, working for steady clients or full time contracts with companies. I'll categorise them in 3 buckets and list some resources where you can find opportunities for that category.</p> <h3 id="freelancing-platforms"> Freelancing Platforms</h3> <p>You can freelance on projects remotely on freelancing platforms. Examples include Upwork, Freelancer, etc where you can join, create a profile and start bidding on projects.</p> <p>While this is a good option to work on projects you're interested in, I tend to prefer not working on them as a career choice. All clients are not the same, so it needs a lot of calibration every time you start a new project.</p> <p>Clients generally choose these platforms for cost optimisation. So, the engineering standards are generally a bit lower and the deadline pressures are more intense.</p> <p>This also means variable workload and variable income, which makes planning your time and life harder. But I have worked on projects intermittently on Upwork before and it can be a good path to pursue if it suits you.</p> <p>Here's a list of popular freelancing platforms:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.upwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upwork</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fiverr</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.freelancer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freelancer</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.guru.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guru</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.peopleperhour.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peopleperhour</a></li></ul> <h3 id="agency-platforms"> Agency Platforms</h3> <p>Some platforms employ a vetting process and only allow successful candidates on their platforms. For the lack of a better word, I call them agency platforms. These platforms are on the rise and I see new ones every now and then.</p> <p>Once you're on the platform, you may have to bid for projects again or you may be paired with companies depending on the type of the platform. But you'll be working as a member of the platform and the platform will take a cut off your earnings.</p> <p>One major downside of both these types of platforms is that you don't get any paid time offs (PTO). If you don't work, you don't get paid. You don't get any other perks or benefits either. But once you get yourself on these platforms, it may be easier to land clients or contracts (and better ones) than on platforms mentioned in the first category. Remember to check reviews before joining. Do not join if you don't like their practices.</p> <p>Here's a list of some platforms in this category:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.toptal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toptal</a></li> <li><a href="https://x-team.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-Team</a></li> <li><a href="https://turing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turing</a></li> <li><a href="https://triplebyte.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TripleByte</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.vettery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vettery</a></li> <li><a href="https://6nomads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6nomads</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.crossover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crossover</a></li></ul> <p>This list is not exhaustive and there's a lot of other platforms like these. I haven't worked on any of these, so do your review before you decide to join.</p> <h3 id="remote-companies"> Remote Companies</h3> <p>Remote-first or full-remote companies fall in this category. The number of such companies is increasing rapidly, thanks to the pandemic. You can apply to these companies directly from their job posts and work as independent contractors after you successfully complete their recruitment process.</p> <p>I prefer this category of remote work because you get to work for the company directly. Generally, the teams and cultures are better in companies who hire directly.</p> <p>Similarly, the compensations and benefits are better as well. Most of them will provide PTOs and have good practices around remote work.</p> <p>Some popular companies that hire remotely are:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://doist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doist</a></li> <li><a href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zapier</a></li> <li><a href="https://buffer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buffer</a></li> <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gitlab</a></li> <li><a href="https://automattic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automattic</a></li> <li><a href="https://basecamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basecamp</a></li></ul> <p>There are many job forums and aggregate websites that you can subscribe to for job openings in remote companies. You can create email subscriptions according to your choices. Here's a list of some popular remote job forums:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://weworkremotely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We Work Remotely</a></li> <li><a href="https://remoteok.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RemoteOK</a></li> <li><a href="https://angel.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AngelList</a></li> <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?r=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stack OverFlow jobs</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/remote-jobs-SRCH_KO0,6.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glass Door Jobs</a></li> <li><a href="https://remotecircle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RemoteCircle</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit Remote Jobs Forum</a></li> <li><a href="https://remotive.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remotive</a></li> <li><a href="https://jobs.underpin.company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Underpin</a></li> <li><a href="https://remote.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote.co</a></li> <li><a href="http://remote4me.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote4Me</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/remote-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn jobs</a></li> <li><a href="http://remotepython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote Python</a></li></ul> <p>These platforms are great for job search.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

											<div>
							<p>One of my favorite makefile debugging tricks is this rule for printing out the value of a variable:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">print-%:
        @echo '$*=$($*)'</span></pre>
<p>
Throw this into a GNU make makefile and then print any <span><span face="Courier New">make</span></span> variable you like by invoking targets like <span><span face="Courier New">print-MAKE_VERSION</span></span>:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">ericm@chester:/tmp$ gmake print-MAKE_VERSION
MAKE_VERSION=3.81</span></pre>
<p>
You can imagine how handy this is when diagnosing issues with your makefiles.  Here’s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li><span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> defines a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Pattern-Rules"><i>pattern rule</i></a> that matches any target that starts with the characters <span><span face="Courier New">print-</span></span>.</li>
<li>In the context of a pattern rule, the <span><span face="Courier New">$*</span></span> variable expands to the <i>stem</i> of the target, that part which matched the <span><span face="Courier New">%</span></span> in the pattern.  In my example above, that corresponds to <i>MAKE_VERSION</i>.</li>
<li>GNU make variable expansion rules allow for variable references <i>inside</i> variable names, so <span><span face="Courier New">$($*)</span></span> expands first to <span><span face="Courier New">$(MAKE_VERSION)</span></span>, and finally to the value of the <span><span face="Courier New">MAKE_VERSION</span></span> variable.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Makefile injection with <span face="Courier New">-f</span></h3>
<p>
The <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule is a slick hack, but it’s a nuisance to have to modify a makefile just to use it.  Worse, you might not even be able to modify the makefile.  Fortunately, there’s a solution:  the <span><span face="Courier New">-f</span></span> command-line option.  You’re probably familiar with it — that’s how you tell gmake to use a different makefile than the default <span><span face="Courier New">Makefile</span></span> when it starts.  For example, if you have a  makefile named <span><span face="Courier New">build.mak</span></span>:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">gmake -f build.mak</span></pre>
<p>
What you may not know is that you can use <i>multiple</i> <span><span face="Courier New">-f</span></span> options on the command line.  GNU make will read each file in turn, incorporating the contents of each just as if they were included with the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Include"><span><span face="Courier New">include</span></span></a> directive.  We can create a simple makefile called <span><span face="Courier New">printvar.mak</span></span> containing nothing but our <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule, then inject it into any makefile we want like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">gmake -f printvar.mak -f Makefile print-MAKE_VERSION</span></pre>
<h3>A shell script to save typing</h3>
<p>
The combination of the <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule and the <span><span face="Courier New">-f</span></span> command-line option is powerful, but it’s unwieldy — too many characters to type.  The solution is a shell script wrapper:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">#!/bin/bash

filename=""
if [ -f GNUmakefile ] ; then
  filename="GNUmakefile"
elif [ -f makefile ] ; then
  filename="makefile"
elif [ -f Makefile ] ; then
  filename="Makefile"
fi
if [ -n "$filename" ] ; then
  vars=""
  for n in $@ ; do
    vars="$vars print-$n"
  done
  gmake -f $filename -f printvar.mak $vars
else
  echo "No makefile found" 1&gt;&amp;2
  exit 1
fi</span></pre>
<p>
Save that in a file called <span><span face="Courier New">printvars</span></span> somewhere on your <span><span face="Courier New">PATH</span></span> and you can do things like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">ericm@chester:/tmp$ printvars MAKE_VERSION COMPILE.cc
MAKE_VERSION=3.81
COMPILE.cc=g++    -c</span></pre>
<h3>Advanced <span><span face="Courier New">make</span></span> variable diagnostics</h3>
<p>
Beyond simply printing the value of a variable, GNU make 3.81 has three built-in functions that allow introspection on variables, which you can add to the <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule for additional diagnostics.</p>
<p>
First is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Origin-Function"><span><span face="Courier New">$(origin)</span></span></a> function, which tells you how a variable was defined.  For example, if a variable <span><span face="Courier New">FOO</span></span> was inherited from the environment, <span><span face="Courier New">$(origin FOO)</span></span> will give the result <span><span face="Courier New">environment</span></span>.  Variables defined in a makefile will give the result <span><span face="Courier New">file</span></span>, and so forth.</p>
<p>
Next is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Flavor-Function"><span><span face="Courier New">$(flavor)</span></span></a> function, which tells you the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Flavors">flavor of the variable</a>, either <span><span face="Courier New">simple</span></span> or <span><span face="Courier New">recursive</span></span>.</p>
<p>
Finally is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Value-Function"><span><span face="Courier New">$(value)</span></span></a> function, which gives you the <i>unexpanded</i> value of the variable.  For example, if you have variables like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">FOO=123
BAR=$(FOO)</span></pre>
<p>
<span><span face="Courier New">$(value BAR)</span></span> will give the result <span><span face="Courier New">$(FOO)</span></span>, rather than the fully-expanded <span><span face="Courier New">123</span></span> that you might expect.</p>
<p>
With these additions, the <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule now looks like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">print-%:
	@echo '$*=$($*)'
	@echo '  origin = $(origin $*)'
	@echo '  flavor = $(flavor $*)'
	@echo '   value = $(value  $*)'</span></pre>
<p>
And here’s how it looks in action:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">ericm@chester:/tmp$ printvars MAKE_VERSION COMPILE.cc
MAKE_VERSION=3.81
  origin = default
  flavor = simple
   value = 3.81
COMPILE.cc=g++    -c

      <p>We’ve joined <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-twitter-a-better-home-for-writers.html?utm_campaign=The%20week%20in%20newsletters&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. This is big news for people who use Revue, people who will start using Revue and the whole team who built it. So in this email I wanted to go a little deeper than just this news. And that’s what email does better than any other platform. It lets you go deeper with a wide audience, both in your relationship and in your thinking. Add nuance, context, speak personally.</p><p>That experience inspired us to build the first version of Revue. We wanted to make sending an email newsletter as simple and enjoyable as Tweeting. That core goal has never changed, but the world around us sure has.</p><p>Email has become a much more important publishing platform. The publishing world is working even harder at its re-invention. And we’re proud to be part of that. Today, Revue makes it easy for a wide variety of creators and publishers to send a newsletter — and make money from it.</p><p>We help them find an audience, create a deep connection and grow without limits.</p><p>Today, we serve a spectrum of customers, from ambitious media upstarts like The Markup to independent creators like Scott Melker and even large legacy publishers like Germany’s Madsack. And while different, all of them come to Revue for one purpose: to transform how we share and absorb content.&nbsp;</p><p>They want to change the way publishing works. Who gets heard and who gets paid. And that’s what connects their goals to us, the people who build Revue.</p><p>The folks over at Twitter are amazing partners who believe in and add to our mission. Thanks to them we can invest more, build faster, and get better for you.</p><p>Thanks to our joining Twitter, we can make publishing on email even more accessible. As a first step, we’re excited to share some updates that will improve the way you can build and get paid for your content:</p><p>🤝 Starting a newsletter on Revue is now free</p><p>🤝 On paid newsletters, we only charge 5%</p><p>We’ve made these changes so that everyone can be a creator on Revue, with the opportunity to scale their newsletters and a paying audience without the added fees or obstacles that can limit growth.</p><p>One important element to our customers success is giving you full control. You own your audience, your content, your brand. You can send from your own domain. You can connect Revue to hundreds of other tools without coding. And of course we have an API for you to build on.</p><p>We are also building a version of Revue for larger creators and publications. They have even more control, This version offers features like fully custom designs and tools to help them manage their audience, cross-promote newsletters and include subscription offers.</p><p>For now, we’ll continue to operate as a standalone business. But expect to hear more about how we’re working with Twitter soon as we look at more ways to help you grow faster, be discovered more easily and build even deeper connections.</p><p>Our goal is to create the single best place in the world for media businesses of the future to start, to grow big and to innovate. There is a lot to do, so we’ll keep working on it — along with all the people who use Revue.</p><p>🧡</p><p>Martijn, Founder</p>

January 26, 2021 | https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/react-as-generator-engine | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/react-as-generator-engine">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/react-as-generator-engine.webp" alt="Post cover image"><p>React permanently changed the way how developers write web-apps. Personally, we love React and knew it would solve many pain points we faced with Nunjucks. Therefore in the last <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/shape-up-process/issues/1">cycle</a> we integrated it as a template rendering engine into our <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">Generator</a>. This post is a short introduction for developers who write or plan to write templates for AsyncAPI specification using React. It also includes a comparison with the default Nunjucks renderer.</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2><p>Your React template requires <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk">@asyncapi/generator-react-sdk</a> as a dependency. You need it to access the <strong>File</strong> component required as a root component responsible for rendering a file. Furthermore, it provides some common components to make your development easier, like <strong>Text</strong> or <strong>Indent</strong>.	</p><p>Let's consider a basic React template file as the one below called <strong>MyTemplate.js</strong>:</p><p>The exported default function returns the <strong>File</strong> component as a root component that the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">Generator</a> uses to figure out what file it should generate. In the example above, we overwrite the default functionality of saving the file as <strong>MyTemplate.js</strong>, and we set <strong>asyncapi.md</strong> as the filename. Using the <strong>Text</strong> component, we specify what content should be rendered inside the file. The content of the resulting file is: <code>Some text that should render as is\n</code>. Notice the <strong>\n</strong> character at the end. It is automatically added after the <strong>Text</strong> component.</p><blockquote><p>For further information about components and their props, see the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk">Generator React SDK</a>.	 </p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">Generator</a> doesn't use React renderer by default. You need to specify in the template configuration that your template is based on React. For that, change the <strong>renderer</strong> field of <strong>generator</strong> object inside the template's <strong>package.json</strong> file:</p><p>You can find more information about the Generator configuration <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/blob/master/docs/authoring.md#configuration-file">here</a>.	 </p><h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2><p>The process of creating content from React components consists of two steps: transpile and render.	 </p><p>The SDK has a custom transpiler which ensures that any directory in template's <strong>template</strong> folder are transpiled using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup">Rollup</a>. Rollup helps bundling all dependencies and transpile them into CommonJS modules. This is required because this library will be used through NodeJS (by AsyncAPI Generator) which does not understand these new modules natively and we do not want to limit the developer in which syntax they prefer nor how they want to separate code.</p><p>Also, SDK has its own reconciler. It traverses through each element in the template structure and transforms it into a pure string. Prop <code>children</code> is always converted to a regular string and stored in the <code>childrenContent</code> prop in each component. Check the below example, to see how it works. In addition, you can also see how to apply the composition to templates using components:</p><p>There are some restrictions:</p><ul><li>React hooks feature is not allowed.</li><li>HTML tags are not supported.</li><li>React internal components like <code>Fragments</code>, <code>Suspense</code>, and others are skipped.</li></ul><h2 id="comparison-with-nunjucks">Comparison with Nunjucks</h2><p>The AsyncAPI generator still uses <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a> as a default render engine. It's a templating language, heavily focused on string literals, filters (similar to bash pipes), and partials called macros.	</p><p>The next sections compare how you can accomplish certain things in Nunjucks and React. For more complex examples, see the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates">template-for-generator-templates</a> repository with examples based on React and compare those with <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates/tree/nunjucks">nunjucks</a> branch.</p><h3 id="creating-reusable-parts">Creating reusable parts</h3><p>It may sound obvious, but when writing any code, even a template, a programmer wants to create reusable parts that separate repeating logic.</p><p>In Nunjucks, you can reuse parts of the template using <strong>macros</strong>, in React, using <strong>components</strong>. Imagine that you are writing a template that produces Markdown content. You need to create a reusable macro/component that renders a list from an array of strings.</p><p>Using Nunjucks you can write the code below:</p><p>Using React you can write the code below:</p><p>Looking at both examples we see that in Nujucks we operate on string literals, it means that when passing data to a macro, you always need to know what type of data the macro takes. In React we operate on JS objects/variables. By this, your IDE should always inform you what value, of what type, you must pass to component. Additionally, you must place Nunjucks's macro inside the <strong>partials</strong> folder of the template. Using React, you can put your components wherever you want.</p><h3 id="using-third-party-packages">Using third party packages</h3><p>Using helper functions from third-party packages, in Nunjucks you must apply them as <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/blob/master/docs/authoring.md#filters">filters</a>. For example, you want to use one function from <a href="https://github.com/esamattis/underscore.string">Underscore.string</a> library like <strong>cleanDiacritics</strong>, which replaces diacritic characters with closest ASCII equivalents. To do this, you must create a function inside <strong>filters</strong> folder to convert the function to Nunjucks's filter:</p><p>And then you can use this function inside your template/macro:</p><p>The main problem with this solution is that it creates an unnecessary boilerplate - you must create a function in a separate file. Another problem is that you operate on the name of this helper function which means you must always remember what filters you have included in your template.</p><p>In opposite, in React you can use <code>Underscore.string</code> directly in your template:</p><p>It is worth mentioning that when using packages in this way, you always operate on the reference to the function, not on its name, so you know what functions you have in the file's scope.</p><h2 id="cons--pros">Cons &amp; Pros</h2><p>Like any solution, React has its advantages as well as disadvantages.</p><h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3><ul><li>Using React, you use JS directly. You don't need to learn custom Nunjuck's syntax, only how React works under the hood.</li><li>It provides better debugging functionality that is not possible with Nunjucks.</li><li>It provides better error stack traces.</li><li>Better tools support development. You write templates in JavaScript, you use a reference to functions/variables, and therefore your IDE can tell you what you can use in a given scope.	</li><li>Provides better support for separating code into more manageable chunks/components. You don't need to create <strong>partials</strong> folder. You can create React component wherever you want, also next to the template's source code.</li><li>You can easily test your components. It is difficult with Nunjucks. You can split template file into separate chunks and test them in separate test cases.</li></ul><h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3><ul><li>Common pain when writing templates with React is related to indentations and new lines. However, we have several helpers in SDK to make your life easier, like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/blob/master/src/components/Indent.tsx"><code>Indent</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/blob/master/src/components/Text.tsx"><code>Text</code></a> components.</li><li>Some people don't like to mix logic inside template files, so probably React won't be friendly for them.</li><li>HTML tags at the moment are not supported. The developer must write them as a string literal, like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates/blob/main/components/ListChannels.js#L18">here</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><p>We use React render engine already in three official AsyncAPI templates:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates">template-for-generator-templates</a> template showcases features of <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">the AsyncAPI Generator</a>, including the React renderer. It shows how to write templates, reusable parts (components), what are the recommended patterns. It has simple and complex examples. You can also check how the same things could be done using Nunjucks in <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates/tree/nunjucks">this</a> branch.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/markdown-template">markdown-template</a> is written using React. It generates documentation into a Markdown file.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/ts-nats-template/">ts-nats-template</a> is re-written using React to generate a TypeScript NATS client.</li></ul><p>If you want to check the source code of React renderer, go to the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk">official repository</a>.</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>There is a long way ahead of us to stabilize React as a render engine. We know about problems that make it unpleasant to write templates using React, such as indents or new lines, but we will work on that. Additionally, we have a couple of improvements on our list that will allow things like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/issues/10">File Templates</a> to be simplified in the Generator. We also plan to support <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/issues/3">TypeScript</a>.</p><p>We are waiting for your feedback.</p><p>Happy coding!</p><blockquote><p>Cover photo is from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080179/"><code>Drunken Master</code></a> movie.</p></blockquote></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611636833572/KkMic2coN.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div itemprop="text"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.appsmith.com/">Appsmith</a>  is an open-source low code platform for developers to build internal apps and workflows.</p>
<p>In Appsmith, our developer users define business logic by writing any JS code in between <code>{{ }}</code> dynamic bindings almost anywhere in the app. They can use this while creating SQL queries, APIs, or triggering actions.
This functionality lets you control how your app behaves with the least amount of configuration. Underneath the hood, the platform will evaluate all this code in an optimized manner to make sure the app remains performant yet responsive.</p>
<p>Let us take an example of binding a query response to a table widget.</p>
<p>It all starts with the binding brackets <code>{{ }}</code> . When the platform sees these brackets and some code in it, in a widget or action configuration, it will flag the field as a dynamic field so that our evaluator can pick it up later. In our example let us bind usersQuery to usersTable</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608182443695/gunous9nM.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_2.46.08_PM.png"></p>
<p>Since we have added this binding in our tableData field, we will flag this field and store it in our widget config</p>
<pre><code>
{
  <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        ...
        <span>"tableData"</span>: <span>"{{
            usersQuery.data
                .map(row =&gt; ({
                    name: row.name,
                    email: row.email
                }))
            }}"</span>,
        <span>"dynaminBindingPathList"</span>: [
            {<span>"key"</span>: <span>"tableData"</span>}
            ...
        ]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the background, our evaluation listener, always keeps a lookout for such events that would need an evaluation. For our example, this is a scenario that definitely needs an evaluation, so it kicks off our evaluator.</p>
<p>We pass on our current list of app data constructed in what we call as <code>DataTree</code> to the evaluator thread and patiently wait to hear back from it ⏱</p>
<pre><code>
{
    <span>"usersQuery"</span>: {
        <span>"config"</span>: {...},
        <span>"data"</span>: [...]
    },
    <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        <span>"tableData"</span>: <span>"{{
            usersQuery.data
                .map(row =&gt; ({
                    name: row.name,
                    email: row.email
                }))
            }}"</span>,
        <span>"dynaminBindingPathList"</span>: [{<span>"key"</span>: <span>"tableData"</span>}]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>For performance reasons, we run our evaluation process in a separate background thread with the help of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">web workers</a>. This ensures that evaluation cycles running longer than 16ms do not hang up the main thread giving the app bandwidth to always respond to user events.</p>
<p>Inside the thread, the event listener gets a wake-up call and gets to work. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Get differences</strong>: First it will calculate differences in the <code>DataTree</code> from the last time. This will ensure we only process changes and not the whole tree.</p>
<p>  In our example, we would see the <code>usersTable.tableData</code> has changed and <code>usersTable.dynamicBindingPathList</code> has a new entry.</p>
<p>  It takes each difference, filters any un-important changes, and processes the rest.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Get evaluation order with dependency map</strong>: It also maintains a <code>DependencyMap</code> between various entity properties. The evaluator will notice if any bindings have changed and recreate the sort order accordingly.</p>
<p>  For our example, we will infer that <code>usersTable.tableData</code> now depends on <code>usersQuery.data</code>. This means that the query response should always be evaluated before we can evaluate the table data and that whenever we see a change in the query response, we need to re-evaluate the table data as well</p>
<pre><code>  
  {
      ...
      <span>"usersTable.tableData"</span>: [<span>"usersQuery.data"</span>]
  }

  
  [
      <span>"usersQuery.data"</span>,
      <span>"usersTable.tableData"</span>
  ]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluate:</strong> After creating an optimized evaluation order, we will evaluate the update the tree, in that said order. Evaluation happens via a closed <code>eval</code> function with the whole <code>DataTree</code> acting as its global scope. This is why we can directly reference any object in our <code>DataTree</code> in our code.</p>
<pre><code>  

  <span>const</span> code = <span>`
    usersQuery.data.map(row =&gt; ({
      name: row.name,
      email: row.email
    }))
  `</span>;

  <span>const</span> scriptToEvaluate = <span>`
    function closedFunction () {
      const result = <span>${code}</span>;
      return result
    }
    closedFunction()
  `</span>;

  <span>const</span> result = <span>eval</span>(scriptToEvaluate);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Validate and parse:</strong> We always want to make sure the values returned after evaluation to be in the right data type that the widget expects. The ensures the widget always gets predictable data even if your code has returned some errors. This is also needed for any function down the line in the evaluation order, if it refers to this field, will always get a reasonable data type to work with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that completes it. At the end of this, we will have a fully evaluated <code>DataTree</code> that we can then send back to the main thread and start listening for any new event to do this whole process again.</p>
<pre><code>
{
    <span>"usersQuery"</span>: {
        <span>"data"</span>: [...] 
    }
    <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        <span>"tableData"</span>: [...]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Our main thread gets an event saying the evaluation is complete, with the new evaluated <code>DataTree</code> which it stores in the app redux state. From here, the widgets pick up their data and render it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608182466454/vym6oXaQG.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_2.46.22_PM.png"></p>
<h3 id="summarizing-our-philosophy">Summarizing our philosophy</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pull vs Push:</strong> While building a low code app builder for varied developers, we thought hard about how the written code works with the rest of the platform. We wanted configuration to be easy to start yet powerful when it needed to be. For this reason, we went with a Pull based architecture rather than Push.</p>
<p>  What this means is that in most places, you won't have to think about how the data will get to a field. You write code that pulls everything from the global <code>DataTree</code> and sets it to the field where you write it. This way the moment the underlying data changes, it get propagated to all the fields dependant on it and you as a developer do not have to orchestrate ui changes.</p>

<li><p><strong> One-way data flow:</strong> Since we are built on top React.js and Redux, we strongly embrace the one-way data flow model.</p>
<p>  What this means is that you cannot set a table's data directly to that field from some other part of the app. If you do need to update the table, you will have to trigger the query to run, which will then cause the table to re-render with the new data. This helps the code you write easy to reason about and bugs easy to find. It also encapsulates each widget's and action's logic in itself for good separation of concern.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Before we begin, I have an announcement to make regarding the future of this podcast. Beginning February 1st, <em>The Grant Williams Podcast</em> will become part of the copper membership tier of my new website, <a href="https://grant-williams.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grant-williams.com</a>. Now, the copper tier will include every future episode of the end game, the super terrific happy hour and the narrative game, as well as access to a series of special one-on-one conversations I’ll be having with a group of truly extraordinary people throughout the rest of this year, beginning with my dear friend and mentor, Anthony Deden of Edelweiss Holdings. At the site, you’ll also find a silver tier, which in addition to access to <em>The Grant Williams Podcast</em>, will include a year subscription to my monthly newsletter, <em>Things That Make You Go Hmmm…</em> But you can find out a lot more about all that by visiting <a href="https://grant-williams.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grant-williams.com</a>. And now on with the show.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Something that’s fascinated me over the last 12 months has been how keen people are to hear my views on cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin in particular. I’ve tried to lay out my position as clearly as I can over that year. And I’ll do the same again here. I understand the bull case for crypto very, very well. In many ways, it’s a similar case to the one I’ve been making myself over the years for gold. Because of that, I’ve been predisposed to be bullish on Bitcoin, but like anything I come across that looks interesting, I maintain what I view as a healthy level of skepticism until I’ve had any fears allayed. As far as Bitcoin goes, I’m just not quite there yet. There are things which concern me about its long-term viability. And so until I can have those questions answered to my satisfaction, Bitcoin, to me, remains a highly speculative asset.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>The difficulty I’ve found in getting my questions answered stems largely from the binary opinion set that I’ve found wherever I’ve searched for those answers. Bitcoin, it seems is either going to eat the world or it’s a complete Ponzi scheme. And finding a space between those two opinions where my possible answers might lie, has proven very difficult for me. Last week, an extremely negative article about Tether, the supposedly dollar-backed stablecoin, did the rounds and from the commentary and discussion around that article, the idea of a debate rose organically on FinTwit, a debate that I was asked to moderate. Needless to say in my own search for answers to my questions, I was happy to oblige. And so here we are.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Joining me today are Mike Green of Logica Funds, a man with a towering intellect and a decidedly negative view of Bitcoin (and Tether for that matter). And Nic Carter, co-founder of Castle Island Ventures &amp; CoinMetrics and another man in position of some serious intellectual firepower, but who sees Bitcoin in a completely different and extremely positive light. But the idea here is to offer both sides of the Bitcoin debate, a chance to speak and engage respectfully with the other, in the hopes of providing anybody listening with something to either challenge their own assumptions, answer nagging questions they might have, or simply provide them with some good old fashioned confirmation bias. The goal isn’t to change anybody’s mind about Bitcoin, although who knows, maybe that can actually happen in either direction, but rather to have a thoughtful, respectful conversation about what is… No matter which side of the debate you find yourself on the hottest topic in finance right now. So let’s get to it. A conversation with Mike Green and Nic Carter.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Gentlemen, welcome both of you to this special podcast that kind of arose organically. And I’m absolutely delighted that the two you were willing to take the time to come on and talk about this because there’s been so much said and written about Bitcoin, obviously, on both sides and right at the top of the show, I’m going to position myself and explain to everybody where I am because I think that’s important for the guy in the middle to understand. I like to refer myself as a ‘bit skeptic’. I understand the potential promise of Bitcoin. I’ve heard some very smart people say very smart things about… A lot of which resonates with me from my time in the precious metals space, but I have questions that I just don’t really… There are things that just don’t quite click with me.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>There are problems that I worry about and what I’ve found when I’ve been on the fringes of this space is that, it’s difficult to get thoughtful, considered answers that… Particularly on Twitter. Thoughtful, considered answers, that don’t just degenerate very quickly into a slanging match from both sides. So to have two thoughtful guys like you, join me on the podcast is a real treat for me. So thank you both for doing that.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>What we’re going to do, I think, is start talking about Bitcoin. And then as part of the conversation that I want to discuss, however, briefly, or however long it takes, the recent Tether piece, the doomsday piece, which got everybody’s in a flat a few days ago. So I think what I might do is start with you, Nic. And just to give us really your kind of introduction to Bitcoin and your thoughts on what it is and what it potentially could be. And perhaps any of the things that trouble you about it, if there is anything, in fact.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>Sure. Yeah. And thanks so much for moderating, Grant. I’m a big fan of your show. And Mike, thanks for agreeing to the debate as well. I’m really excited to talk with you. A fan of yours as well. So from my perspective, I’ve been sort of professionally involved in Bitcoin probably since about 2017. It was when I joined Fidelity as their Bitcoin analyst, right. So I was probably one of the first folks on Wall Street sort of be a dedicated Bitcoin guy. Prior to that, I was just an enthusiast, right. I was an amateur Bitcoiner. I mean, there wasn’t really a crypto industry before that, right. And now, my current affiliation is partner at a venture fund and we invest in startups building on public blockchains. So, I certainly believe in this stuff, putting my capital to work, and I believe in the vision of the future that includes cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>The way I see Bitcoin is, it’s kind of two things in one. It is a protocol for sending value through communications medium and encoding value and information. And it’s also an asset. It’s a monetary asset and I would compare it to commodity. So I would say it’s a non-state monetary commodity. It’s something that stores value over time and space. And it’s an independent system of property rights where rather it proposes a state independent system of property rights. So you don’t need an established legal system or a police force or the state to enforce the rights. The rights are enforced through cryptography. And so in that respect, it’s sort of contextually important. So in some cases where you have a functioning financial system, functioning legal system, that has no risk of expropriation, you have no need for Bitcoin, right.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>So in the US, that would characterize most people. They’re puzzled by it. They don’t really see the need for a Bitcoin because everything works great here for now, at least. In other countries where property rights are not really respected and you have inflation or devaluations, or just simply people’s funds, banks accounts get seized on a frequent basis, then maybe there is more of a need for a non-state system. So those are the countries where we’re seeing some adoption of Bitcoin. You also see plenty of Americans getting exposure to it, maybe an anticipation of a future time when it becomes super relevant or just out of the speculative mania too.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>But quite briefly, that’s how I see it. I think it’s important for there to be non-state monetary technologies. I think Bitcoin is extremely promising and it improves upon gold in some really critical respects, particularly along the domain of auditability, verifiability and taking physical settlement, which is where I think it really improves upon gold. But I think if you are positively disposed towards gold, you should probably take a look at Bitcoin because it’s really similar in some of its critical features. Although, of course, not the same thing by any means. So that’s my sort of very short description of Bitcoin.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Yeah. It’s really interesting. And I think my time spent in the precious metal space where my… I was originally exposed to Bitcoin, I saw the similarities between the Bitcoin proposition as it was then, and the things that gold has. I definitely have a few questions about those supposed improvements upon gold, which we’ll get into later on. But I want to turn it over to Mike. Mike, just if you can, your… Because, obviously, your view on Bitcoin is the polar opposite to Nic’s. And so I’m curious to get an overview of that and the things that concern you the most. And then we can perhaps dive into some of these things.</p><p>Mike Green:</p><p>So it’s interesting because I actually don’t think that we are necessarily polar opposites. I think that we have very strongly divergent opinions in terms of the value of it. So my introduction to Bitcoin happened back in 2012, my wife likes to point out that she expressed interest in buying it at $25 and wanted to put $10,000 in. And I said, “Well, why don’t we actually put money in that matters?” And so do $100,000. And she, of course, said that’s far too much and did nothing with it, right. Now, my view on Bitcoin for a very long time was get yourself to neutral. Own enough that it’s not going to make you crazy rich and own enough that you’re not sitting there with an incredible amount of FOMO as you watch others get rich around you.</p><p>Mike Green:</p><p>I changed that view in 2020 for a very, very simple reason, which is, as I began to see the dynamic of Americans express the view that Bitcoin was the solution to an overly aggressive central …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://github.com/micha-lmxt/descent-ripple">descent-ripple</a> package provides an easy way to add ripple animations to buttons and button-like UI elements. That means when you click on a button, or whatever UI-component you add this effect to, a short animation will start at the position of the click, which is bound by the borders of the button. This looks nice and also gives the user the feel of a responding UI. It is especially helpful for touch interfaces since it gives the user some feedback about the click position.
    </p>
<p><img alt="Volcano ripple example" src="https://gradientdescent.de/images/descent-ripple.gif">
    </p>
<h2 id="h2465289">Getting started
    </h2>

<blockquote>
      
    </blockquote>
<p>The package can be used with any javascript framework, or even without. Here I will show you how to use it with React, Svelte, or without Framework. The package is written using <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> and is already compiled and minimized, so there is no overhead or requirement.
    </p>
<p>You can import the library using:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>npm</span><span> </span><span>install</span><span> </span><span>descent</span><span>-</span><span>ripple</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>Then, depending on your framework, you can add the ripple:
    </p>

      <div id="Svelte36502">
<pre><p><code><span><span>// MyButton.svelte</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;script&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>    let rippleOptions = </span><span>{}</span><span>;</span></span>

<p>That's all you need to add the effect and all the examples below just adjust the <code><code>rippleOptions</code></code> object.
    </p>
<blockquote><div><p>&gt;</p>
        <p>The ripple function usually adds the needed CSS to your button. If the result is not well-positioned, it could be that your framework is overriding the style property of your button/component. Try to manually add "position:relative" to the style of your button, if the ripple is not in place, and "overflow:hidden", if the ripple draws out of boundaries.
    </p></div>

<h3 id="h3136629">nLines and nCircles
    </h3>

<p>The ripple animates lines and/or circles. With <code><code>nLines</code></code> you say, how many lines you want. Lines are spaced equally around the center. You can have both circles and lines. More than one circle will make sense later when we know how to use delay.

<h3 id="h3308172">lineProps and circleProps
    </h3>

<p>Lines and circles are svg-path and svg-circle elements. Colors are defined by the <code><code>stroke</code></code> and <code><code>fill</code></code> property. Other interesting attributes, especially for the lines, are <code><code>stroke-linecap</code></code>, <code><code>stroke-linejoin</code></code>, <code><code>stroke-miterlimit</code></code>, <code><code>stroke-opacity</code></code>, <code><code>stroke-width</code></code>. You can apply the same props to all circles and lines, or handle each individually. To do that, supply a function of the index:

<h3 id="h3677242">lineBreakDist and rotation
    </h3>

<p>Each path is split into several segments via lineBreakDist. A larger distance means fewer breaks. With <code><code>rotation</code></code>, you can make the lines bend circularly. You can supply a single value or a function on the line-break index. <code><code>rotation</code></code> is measured in degrees.

<h3 id="h3129929">Animation and AnimationProps
    </h3>

<p>By default descent-ripple supports the following animation types from <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/src/runtime/transition/index.ts">Svelte</a>:
<code><code>"draw"</code></code>, <code><code>"scale"</code></code>, <code><code>"fade"</code></code>, <code><code>"blur"</code></code> and <code><code>"fly"</code></code> plus <code><code>"draw-reverse"</code></code>. All these animations can take props, which typically include <code><code>{delay:number, duration:number, easing: (t:number)=&gt;number}</code></code>, you can look them up on <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/src/runtime/transition/index.ts">Svelte</a>. <code><code>"draw-reverse"</code></code> accepts the same props as <code><code>"draw"</code></code>. You can change in and out animations for circles and lines and the props can be passed as a function of the circle/line index.

<article id="content">
  

  <div>
    <p>I’ve been a contributor to GNU projects for many years, notably both GCC and GNU libc, and recently I led the effort to make the first release of Autoconf since 2012 (<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2020-12/msg00002.html">release announcement for Autoconf 2.70</a>). For background and context, see <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/834682/">the LWN article my colleague Sumana Harihareswara of Changeset Consulting wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Autoconf not having made a release in eight years is a symptom of a deeper problem. Many GNU projects, including all of the other components of the Autotools (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/">Automake</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/">Libtool</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/">Gnulib</a>, etc.) and the software they depend upon (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/">GNU M4</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a>, etc.) have seen a steady decline in both contributor enthusiasm and user base over the past decade. I include myself in the group of declining enthusiasts; I would not have done the work leading up to the Autoconf 2.70 release if I had not been paid to do it. (I would like to say thank you to the project funders: Bloomberg, Keith Bostic, and the GNU Toolchain Fund of the FSF.)</p>
<p>The Autotools are in particularly bad shape due to the decline in contributor enthusiasm. Preparation for the Autoconf 2.70 release took almost twice as long as anticipated; I made five beta releases between July and December 2020, and merged 157 patches, most of them bugfixes. On more than one occasion I was asked why I was going to the trouble—isn’t Autoconf (and the rest of the tools by implication) thoroughly obsolete? Why doesn’t everyone switch to something newer, like <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> or <a href="https://mesonbuild.com/">Meson</a>? (See the comments on Sumana’s LWN article for examples.)</p>
<p>I personally don’t think that the Autotools are obsolete, or even all that much more difficult to work with than some of the alternatives, but it <em>is</em> a fair question. Should development of the Autotools continue? If they are to continue, we need to find people who have the time and the inclination (and perhaps also the funding) to maintain them steadily, rather than in six-month release sprints every eight years. We also need a proper roadmap for where further development should take these projects. As a starting point for the conversation about whether the projects should continue, and what the roadmap should be, I was inspired by Sumana’s book in progress on open source project management (<a href="https://changeset.nyc/resources/getting-unstuck-sampler-offer.html">sample chapters are available from her website</a>) to write up a <q>strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats</q> analysis of Autotools.</p>
<p>This inventory can help us figure out how to build on new opportunities, using the Autotools’ substantial strengths, and where to invest to guard against threats and shore up current weaknesses.</p>
<p>Followup discussion should go to <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/autoconf">the Autoconf mailing list</a>.</p>

<h2 id="strengths">Strengths</h2>
<p>In summary: as the category leader for decades, the Autotools benefit from their architectural approach, interoperability, edge case coverage, standards adherence, user trust, and existing install base.</p>
<ul>
<li>Autoconf’s feature-based approach to compiled-code portability scales better than lists of system quirks.</li>
<li>The Autotools carry 30+ years’ worth of embedded knowledge about portability traps for C programs and shell-based build scripting on Unix (and to a lesser extent Windows and others), including variants of Unix that no other comparable configuration tool supports.</li>
<li>Autoconf and Automake support cross-compilation better than competing build systems.</li>
<li>Autoconf and Automake support software written in multiple languages better than some competing build systems (but see below).</li>
<li>Autoconf is very extensible, and there are lots of third-party <q>macros</q> available.</li>
<li>Tarball releases produced by Autotools have fewer build dependencies than tarball releases produced by competing tools.</li>
<li>Tarball releases produced by Autotools have a predictable, standardized (literally; it’s a key aspect of the <q><a href="https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/index.html">GNU Coding Standards</a></q>) interface for setting build-time options, building them, testing them, and installing them.</li>
<li>Automake tries very hard to generate Makefiles that will work with <em>any</em> Make implementation, not just GNU make, and not even just (GNU or BSD) make.</li>
<li>The Autotools have excellent reference-level documentation (better than CMake and Meson’s).</li>
<li>As they are GNU projects, users can have confidence that Autotools are and will always remain Free Software.</li>
<li>Relatedly, users can trust that architectural decisions are not driven by the needs of particular large corporations.</li>
<li>There is a large installed base, and switching to a competing build system is a lot of work.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h2>
<p>In summary: Autoconf’s core function is to solve a problem that software developers, working primarily in C, had in the 1990s/early 2000s (during the Unix wars). System programming interfaces have become much more standardized since then, and the shell environment, much less buggy. Developers of new code, today, looking at existing configure scripts and documentation, cannot easily determine which of the portability traps Autoconf knows about are still relevant to them. Similarly, maintainers of older programs have a hard time knowing which of their existing portability checks are still necessary. And weak coordination with other Autotools compounds the issue.</p>
<h3 id="autoconf">Autoconf</h3>
<ul>
<li>Autoconf (and the rest of the Autotools) are written in a combination of four old and difficult programming languages: Bourne shell, the portable subset of Make, Perl, and M4. Competing build systems tend to use newer, more ergonomic languages, which both makes it easier for them to get things done, and makes it easier for them to attract new developers.</li>
<li>All the supported languages except C and C++ are second-class citizens.</li>
<li>The set of languages that are supported has no particular rationale. Several new and increasingly popular compiled-code languages (e.g.&nbsp;Swift and Rust) are not supported, while oddities like Erlang are.</li>
<li>Much of that 30 years’ worth of embedded knowledge about portability traps is obsolete. There’s no systematic policy for deciding when some problem is too obsolete to worry about anymore.</li>
<li>Support for <em>newer</em> platforms, C standard editions, etc. is weaker than support for older things.</li>
<li>Autoconf’s extensibility is unsystematic; many of those third-party macros reach into its guts, and do things that create awkward compatibility constraints on core development. Same for existing <code>configure.ac</code>s.</li>
<li>The code quality of third-party macros varies widely; bad third-party macros reflect poorly on Autoconf proper.</li>
<li>Some of the ancillary tools distributed with Autoconf don’t work well; most importantly, autoupdate (which is <em>supposed</em> to patch a <code>configure.ac</code> to bring it in line with current Autoconf’s recommendations) is so limited and unreliable that it might be better not to have it at all.</li>
<li>Feature gaps in GNU M4 hold back development of Autoconf.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-autotools-as-a-whole">The Autotools as a whole</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are few active developers and no continuing funders.</li>
<li>GNU project status discourages new contributors because of the paperwork requirements and the perceived lack of executive-level leadership.</li>
<li>There is no continuous integration and no culture of code review. Test suites exist but are not comprehensive enough (and at the same time they’re very slow).</li>
<li>Bugs, feature requests, and submitted patches are not tracked systematically. (This is partially dependent on <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/sysadmin/the-fsf-tech-team-doing-more-for-free-software">FSF/GNU infrastructure improvements</a> which are indefinitely delayed.)</li>
<li>There’s a history of releases breaking compatibility, and thus people are hesitant to upgrade. At the same time, Linux distributions actively want to force-upgrade everything they ship to ensure architecture support, leading to upstream/downstream friction.</li>
<li>Guide-level documentation is superficial and outdated.</li>
<li>Building an Autotools-based project directly from its VCS checkout is often significantly harder than building it from a tarball release, and may involve tracking down and installing any number of unusual tools.</li>
<li>The Autotools depend on other GNU software that is not actively maintained, most importantly GNU M4, and to a lesser extent GNU Make.</li>
<li>Coordination among the Autotools is weak, even though the tools are tightly coupled to each other. There are portions of codebases that exist solely for interoperability with other tools in the toolchain, which leads to overlapping maintainer and reviewer responsibility, slow code review and inconvenient copyright assignment processes multiplying, and causing confusion and dropped balls. For instance, there is code shared among Autoconf, Automake, and/or Gnulib by copying files between source repositories; changes to these files are extra inconvenient. The lack of coordination also makes it harder for tool maintainers to deprecate old functionality, or to decouple interfaces to make things more extensible; maintainers do not negotiate policies with each other to help. For instance, Autoconf has trouble knowing when it is safe to remove internal kludges that old versions of Automake depend on, and certain shell commands (e.g.&nbsp;aclocal) are distributed with one package but abstractly belong to another.</li>
<li>Division of labor among the Autotools, and the sources of third-party macros, is ad-hoc and unclear. (Which macros should be part of Autoconf proper? Which should be part of Gnulib? Which should be part of the Autoconf Macro Archive? Which should be shipped with Automake? Which tools should autoreconf know how to run? Etc.)</li>
<li>Automake and Libtool are not nearly as extensible as Autoconf is.</li>
<li>Unlike several competitors, Automake <em>only</em> works with Make, not with newer build drivers (e.g.&nbsp;Ninja).</li>
<li>Because Automake tries to generate Makefiles that will work with <em>any</em> Make implementation, the Makefiles it generates are much more complicated and slow than they would be if they took advantage of GNU and/or BSD extensions.</li>
<li>Libtool is notoriously slow, brittle, and difficult to modify (even worse than Autoconf proper). This is partially due to technical debt and partially due to maintaining support for completely obsolete platforms (e.g.&nbsp;old versions of AIX).</li>
<li>Libtool has opinions about the proper way to manage shared libraries that Linux distributions actively disagree with, forcing them to kludge around its code during package builds.</li>
<li>Alternatives…</li></ul></div></article></div></div>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Artificial Bodies and the Promise of Abstraction:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>A conversation with Peter Wolfendale</span></span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></section><p><span><span><span><span><span>© Scott Eaton</span></span></span></span></span></p><div id="comp-kiemep60" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>Please can you start by saying a few things about the rise of embodiment within contemporary philosophy? It seems to me to be mainly used as a corrective against: 1) the Cartesian notion of an immaterial mind, and 2) the materialist tendency to place the mind in the brain. But what are the main positive claims that defenders of embodiment are making?&nbsp;</span></p>



<p>I think that the meaning of the term “embodiment” in philosophical circles is deceptively diverse, and that those who champion the concept are motivated by concerns that overlap less than is often appreciated. If they are unified by one thing, it is a rogues’ gallery of common enemies. Although Descartes is the most reviled of these, his errors are often traced back to some original sin perpetrated by Plato. However, in order to make sense of these conceptual crimes, it’s worth first distinguishing the <span>explanatory</span> concerns of cognitive science and artificial intelligence from the <span>normative </span>concerns of political and social theory, while acknowledging that both of these are downstream from more general <span>metaphysical</span> concerns regarding the difference and/or relation between matter and mind. So, though there are many purely metaphysical objections to the Platonic dualism of intelligible and sensible worlds, and the Cartesian dualism of mental and physical substances, what really unites the embodiment paradigm is their objection to the outsized role that Plato, Descartes, and their inheritors give to “the life of the mind” in explaining how we make our way in the world, and establishing which aspects of it we should value. For want of a better word, we might call this “intellectualism”.</p>



<p>This “life of the mind” is distinguished by the capacity for <span>abstract thought</span>. This is to say that it abstracts away from concrete features of the context in which thinking occurs: it is <span>theoretical</span>, or unconstrained by the practical problems posed by our bodily environment; and it is <span>contemplative</span>, or independent of the sensorimotor capacities through which we interact with this environment. Both Plato and Descartes take mathematics to exemplify this sort of thinking, and on that basis, thought <span>as such</span>. Mathematical theorems are not strictly about anything in our physical environment, and they can be verified even if they’re not applicable to it, in ways that needn’t involve interacting with it. This being said, what really distinguishes Descartes from Plato is his conviction that the physical world can be accurately <span>represented</span> by mathematical models, and thus that our experiences can be treated as internal representations akin to such models. There are other problematic aspects of the Cartesian picture, but this will do for now.</p></div><section id="comp-kiemep621"><div data-testid="columns"><div id="comp-kiemep64"><div data-mesh-id="comp-kiemep64inlineContent" data-testid="inline-content"><div data-mesh-id="comp-kiemep64inlineContent-gridContainer" data-testid="mesh-container-content"><p id="comp-kiemep661" data-testid="richTextElement"><h2><span>WHAT REALLY DISTINGUISHES DESCARTES FROM PLATO IS HIS CONVICTION THAT THE PHYSICAL WORLD CAN BE ACCURATELY REPRESENTED BY MATHEMATICAL MODELS</span></h2></p></div></div></div></div></section><div id="comp-kiemep68" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>So, what are the main explanatory objections to intellectualism?</span></p>



<p>There are two. On the one hand, its opponents claim that intellectualism ignores the vast majority of human cognition: most of our lives are spent carrying out tasks and navigating obstacles whose contours are determined by the way our body fits into its environment, rather than reasoning our way from premises to conclusions. Making a cup of tea in an unfamiliar kitchen is a more representative instance of our problem-solving capacity than demonstrating the infinity of primes. On the other, they claim that intellectualism has its priorities backwards: rather than treating this sort of “skilled coping” as a deficient form of abstract cognition, we can only understand the latter by showing how it emerges from the former. Even our ability to imagine complex geometric constructions has at some point been bootstrapped from a basic bodily grasp of orientation and gesture.</p>



<p>The most important targets of these complaints are the classical computational theory of mind in cognitive science and what gets called “good old-fashioned AI” (GOFAI). These see cognition as principally a matter of rule-governed symbol manipulation not unlike mathematical reasoning. They are opposed by a range of “4E perspectives”, so called because they emphasise some combination of the <span>embodied</span>, <span>embedded</span>, enactive, and <span>extended</span> dimensions of cognition. The extent to which these diverge from traditional views varies, but, in rough order, the points of contention are: 1) the extent to which cognition is dependent on features of the body outside of the brain (e.g., the structure of sensory organs), and features of the environment outside of the body (e.g., the availability of cognitive resources), 2) whether the concepts of computation and representation are irredeemably intellectualist (e.g., if they can account for pre-linguistic “meaning”), and 3) whether dependence implies constitution (e.g., if my notebook is part of my mind).</p>



<p><span>What about the normative objections?</span></p>



<p>Again, there are two. On the one hand, opponents claim that intellectualism reflects and reinforces implicit social hierarchies: those who have historically enjoyed the luxury of theoretical contemplation have done so because the practical problems and bodily processes it abstracts away from have been taken care of for them, often by groups who have been systematically <span>identified</span> with their bodies and bodily capacities, such as women, slaves, and colonised peoples. The disembodied Cartesian ego is an illusion engendered by ignorance and privilege. On the other, they claim that intellectualism devalues significant sources of human knowledge: there are forms of “lived experience” and “situated knowledge” that are valuable even if they aren’t (and possibly can’t be) articulated in a manner that divorces them from the embodied contexts in which they occur (e.g., their emotional valence). This Cartesian false-consciousness doesn’t simply impact the way we treat others, but even the way we treat ourselves, potentially disconnecting us from our embodied existence.</p>



<p>The idea that privileging the mind over the body is associated with other sorts of illicit privilege (e.g., economic, racial, sexual, etc.) is now fairly widespread in contemporary feminist and critical theory. However, there are a variety of philosophical frameworks drawn from the Continental tradition that get used to articulate, elaborate, and offer solutions to this problem. Roughly speaking, the main strands are Spinozist (Deleuze, Affect Theory, etc.), Nietzschean (Foucault, Butler, etc.), and phenomenological (Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, etc.), though there is much cross-pollination. The first is characterised by the metaphysical tenor of its critique, proposing some form of materialist monism as an alternative to the dualisms of Plato and Descartes. The second is characterised by its focus upon social dynamics, providing an analysis of the way bodies are “ensouled” by the internalisation of patterns of thought and action. But the last provides the greatest point of overlap with the explanatory concerns discussed above, as it provides a detailed introspective analysis of the body’s involvement in the constitution of experience. Phenomenology has had a marked influence on 4E approaches to cognition, and is responsible for the concept that straddles and sometimes connects all these varying concerns, namely, “the lived body”.</p></div><div id="comp-kiemep6b" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>The idea of the lived body suggests that the body is not just a causal bridge between ourselves and the world, but rather that the body is our engagement with the world in a way that serves as a condition for the emergence of our subjectivity. This suggests that only a “proper” body will be fit for this purpose – no ersatz or artificial alternative will do. Embodiment is in fact “real meat” embodiment. Is this a fair picture, both in phenomenology and in the other frameworks you discuss above?</span></p>



<p>Though not every proponent of embodiment will go so far as to insist on an essential link between mind and meat, I think it’s fair to say that this is where the rhetoric of embodiment leads. To some extent, this is because it aligns with other philosophical and political goals, such as undermining pernicious distinctions between human and animal or diagnosing dangerous fantasies implicit in the very suggestion that minds could be uploaded into computer simulations. However, there are some arguments for the claim, and I’ll try to tease out the general pattern of these as I see it. But first, it’s worth saying something more about the idea of the lived body.</p>



<p>The cornerstone of the phenomenological tradition is the idea that the<span> content</span> of explicitly articulated representations, such as declarative sentences or mathematical models, depends upon a more primitive form of <span>meaning</span> implicit in ordinary conscious experience. This gets formulated in slightly different ways by Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty, but they essentially agree that our many and varied representations are able to pick out the same <span>object</span> (e.g., galaxies, spleens, recessions) across changes in time, shifts in perspective, differences of opinion, and diverging interests, only because the referential frameworks they deploy (e.g., star charts, anatomy, econometrics), are so many layers arranged on top of those simple <span>unities</span> that tie together our everyday activities (e.g., places, obstacles, tools). My coffee cup is unified as something I can reach out and grasp, but this grasping is not a carefully planned sequence of muscle movements guided by a mechanical understanding of shapes and forces, it is a single fluid movement in which my fingers fit themselves to the cup’s contours without so much as a second thought. What distinguishes the “lived body” from the “biological body” is not simply that it is not yet an object of scientific representation, but rather that it is what ties everything together in the last instance. It is the <span>origin</span> of all intentional …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

This resulted in a decoupling of the two busbars in the Ernestinovo substation, which in turn separated North-West and south-east electric power flows in this substation. As shown in Figure 1 below, North-West bound lines which remained connected to one busbar, connect Ernestinovo to Zerjavinec (Croatia) and Pecs (Hungary), while South-East bound lines which remained connected to another busbar, connect Ernestinovo to Ugljevik (Bosnia-Herzegovina) and Sremska Mitrovica (Serbia).</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ca35232da145a366158c9b4df33d787e40d621c9/129ad/assets/graphics/uploads/system-separation-figure-2.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 1 - Decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo"></p><p><em>Figure 1 - Decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo</em></p><p>The separation of flows in the Ernestinovo substation, lead to the shifting of electric power flows to neighbouring lines which were subsequently overloaded.

At the same time, the frequency in the South-East Area initially increased up to 50.6 Hz before settling at a steady state frequency between 50.2 Hz and 50.3 Hz as illustrated in Figure 4 below:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/af53041f1f9915046a980de1662f685154376b5c/670b8/assets/graphics/uploads/forth.png" alt="" title="Figure 4 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 right after the disturbance and during resynchronisation"></p><p><em>Figure 4 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 right after the disturbance and during resynchronisation</em></p><p>Due to the low frequency in the North-West Area, contracted interruptible services in France and Italy (in total around 1.7 GW) were disconnected in order to reduce the frequency deviation. These services are provided by large customers who are contracted by the respective Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to be disconnected if frequency drops under a certain threshold. In addition, 420 MW and 60 MW of supportive power were automatically activated from the Nordic and Great Britain synchronous areas respectively. These countermeasures ensured that already at 14:09 CET the frequency deviation from the nominal value of 50 Hz was reduced to around 0.1 Hz in the North-West area (Figure 4).</p><p>In order to reduce the high frequency in the South-East Area, automatic and manual countermeasures were activated, including the reduction of generation output (Eg. automatic disconnection of a 975 MW generator in Turkey at 14:04:57). As a consequence, the frequency in the South-East Area returned to 50.2 Hz at 14:29 CET and remained within control limits (49.8 and 50.2 Hz) until the resynchronisation of the two separated areas took place at 15:07:31.6 CET.</p><p>Between 14:30 CET and 15:06 CET the frequency in the South-East area was fluctuating between 49.9 Hz and 50.2 Hz due to the rather small size of the South-East Area where also several production units were disconnected (Figure 5). During this period, the frequency in the North-West Area fluctuated far less and remained close to the nominal value, due to the rather large size of the North-West Area. This frequency behaviour is a subject of further detailed investigation.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/83de537eb517d8e18789e4116bb3561294bf39c8/a45a4/assets/graphics/uploads/graph_nw_se_03_1400h-1515h.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 5 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 for the complete duration "></p><p><em>Figure 5 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 for the complete duration</em></p><p>The automatic response and the coordinated actions taken by the TSOs in Continental Europe ensured that the situation was quickly restored close to normal operation. The contracted interruptible services in Italy and in France were reconnected at 14:47 CET and 14:48 CET respectively prior to the resynchronisation of the North-West and South-East areas at 15:08 CET.</p><p>ENTSO-E continues to keep the European Commission and the Electricity Coordination Group, composed of representatives of Member States, informed and updated with detailed results of the preliminary technical analyses.</p><p>Based on the preliminary technical analyses presented above, a formal investigation following the legal framework under the Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017 (System Operation Guideline) will be established, whereby National Regulatory Authorities and ACER are invited to join with TSOs in an Expert Investigation Panel.</p><p>In line with the provisions of the mentioned Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017, ENTSO-E will present the results of the investigation to the Electricity Coordination Group and will subsequently publish a report once the analysis is completed.</p><hr><p><strong>Note:</strong> All figures and details about the sequence of the events are still subject to final investigation and possible changes.</p><p><strong>Questions and answers</strong></p><p>What is a system separation?</p><p>The transmission grids of the countries of Continental Europe are electrically tied together to operate synchronously at the frequency of approximately 50 Hz. An event on 8 January 2021 caused the Continental Europe synchronous area to separate into two areas, with an area in the South-East of Europe being temporarily operating in separation from the rest of Continental Europe.</p><p>Is this the first time such an event happens in Continental Europe?</p><p>The Continental Europe synchronous area is one of the largest interconnected synchronous electricity systems in the world in terms of its size and number of supplied customers. Such a kind of event can happen in any electric power system. System resilience and preparedness of system operators in charge have a decisive impact on the consequences of such events. A separation of the synchronous area with a much larger disturbance and impacts on customers took place in Continental Europe on the 4 November 2006. This event was extensively analysed and led to a number of substantial developments, like the European Awareness System (EAS) which is a platform allowing TSOs to exchange operational information in real time, enabling them to react immediately in case of unusual system condition. The TSOs are therefore well prepared in order to coordinate and manage such events and limit the consequences. This preparedness and a permanent observation of the system frequency allowed to resynchronize the two separated areas in a very short period of time.</p><p>How are countermeasures coordinated in Continental Europe in case of frequency deviations?</p><p>In Continental Europe, procedures are in place to avoid system disturbances and especially large frequency deviations with the risk of uncoordinated disconnection of customers or generation. The TSOs Amprion (Germany) and Swissgrid (Switzerland) are responsible for these procedures in their role as synchronous area monitor (SAM) in Continental Europe. The SAM continuously monitors the system frequency. In case of large frequency deviations, they inform all TSOs via the European Awareness System (EAS) and launch an extraordinary procedure for frequency deviations to coordinate countermeasures in a fast and effective manner in order to stabilize the system. One step of this procedure is a telephone conference by Amprion, Swissgrid, RTE (France), Terna (Italy) and REE (Spain). This teleconference took place at 14:09 CET on 8 January 2021. In the telephone conference, the situation was evaluated, the TSOs informed about countermeasures which were already activated. The TSOs of the North-West and South-East Area also coordinated the actions for reconnection in order to reach one synchronous area in Continental Europe again.</p><p>Were end customers disconnected? Were there any other consequences?</p><p>Customers in the order of 70 MW in the North-East Area and in the order of 163 MW in the South-East Area were disconnected. Due to the high resilience of the interconnected network and the rapid response of European TSOs, the security of operation and electricity supply was not endangered further. An important contribution to stabilizing the system was delivered by the previously contracted interruptible services, which were activated in France and Italy. Such contracts which have been agreed with customers allow the TSO to temporarily and automatically reduce the electrical consumption depending on the situation with the electric power system in real-time.</p><p>What is an electrical busbar?</p><p>A busbar is an electrical junction in a substation, which connects overhead lines, cables and transformers through electrical switches. Usually, there are several busbars in a substation, which can be connected by a busbar coupler. Are there special devices protecting the equipment in a substation? Various devices protect the equipment in a substation. One of them is an overcurrent protection relay, disconnecting automatically the equipment (Eg. overhead line or cable) if the electrical …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Most of the 300,000 + plant species have leaves, and the function of all of them is to perform photosynthesis.&nbsp; They are the ultimate source for all of the oxygen and food for the rest of the food chain and help regulate the global carbon and water cycles.&nbsp; They are also nutrition superstars.&nbsp; To figure out why greens are good for you and whether all leaves are equal in this regard, we need to take quick look at global leaf structural variability and broad evolutionary patterns in the species that make their way onto our tables.<span id="more-937"></span></p>

<p>Across the global flora leaves are extraordinarily structurally variable.&nbsp; They vary in size from a tiny duckweed leaf to a huge palm frond, and in thickness from a thin lettuce leaf to a thick leaf of a succulent aloe or pine needle.&nbsp; We don’t fully understand yet why leaves are so structurally variable across species. My colleagues and I <a title="Osnas et al. Science 2013" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2013/03/27/science.1231574" target="_blank">recently published a paper</a> demonstrating that across the global flora leaf nutrient concentrations and physiological rates of maximum photosynthetic carbon gain and respiratory carbon loss change in proportion to leaf area more strongly than they change in proportion to leaf mass.&nbsp; We demonstrate the consequences of this area-proportionality of leaf traits for how we measure, analyze and use these leaf traits in models of the global carbon cycle.</p>

<p>Of relevance here, however, is that the high area-proportionality of leaf traits simply means that the parts of the leaf that are most beneficial for humans (digestible protein, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, digestible fiber) are likely proportional in many species to the leaf’s photosynthetic apparatus, which is clustered in a relatively thin band of cells beneath the epidermis (see image). &nbsp;Adding thickness to a leaf doesn’t necessarily add nutritious tissue and might instead add mostly fibrous, indigestible structural material (see agave photo below). &nbsp;This does not mean that the thinner the leaf, the more nutritious it is; this is just a general tendency across all plants. &nbsp;Scaled up to the level of the whole plant, though, we see that leaves have the highest ratio of nutritious material (digestible protein, vitamins and minerals, fiber) to indigestible material (for most species). &nbsp;Some fruits probably come close, but fruit is rare, and leaves are abundant.</p>

<p>One of the key variables modulating area- vs mass-proportionality of leaf traits is leaf mass per unit leaf area (LMA), which increases with leaf thickness and density. &nbsp;Lettuce leaves have very low LMA, pine needles and holly leaves have high LMA.&nbsp; Although there is very little data on the subject, the leaves that we eat tend to fall on the low end of the global LMA spectrum, shown here for a global dataset of more than 2500 wild species.</p>

<p>Leaf tenderness—reducing LMA–is certainly a trait that has undergone selection in cultivated varieties.&nbsp; In species with varietals that have undergone selection on different structures, the varieties in which selection has been directed at the leaves invariably have more tender, less bitter, and larger leaves than do varieties in which selection has been directed at different structures, such as the roots.&nbsp; For example, chard has larger and more tender greens than do beets (both <i>Beta vulgaris</i>, Caryophyllales); celery grown for stalks and leaves is more tender than the aboveground portion of the celery varietal grown for its root (both <i>Apium graveolens</i>, Apiales); and Siberian kale varieties have more tender leaves than do rutabaga varieties (both <i>Brassica napus</i>, Brassicales).</p>

<p>Kale and collards, grown for their leaves, have leaves that are more tender than those of conspecific <i>Brassica oleracea</i> grown primarily for other structures:&nbsp; kohlrabi, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts (and for those of you keeping track at home, in the <a title="The extraordinary diversity of Brassica&nbsp;oleracea" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/the-extraordinary-diversity-of-brassica-oleracea/" target="_blank"><i>B. oleracea</i></a>, <a title="Thanksgiving turnips and the diversity of the genus&nbsp;Brassica" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/598/" target="_blank"><i>Brassica</i></a>, and<a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/" target="_blank"> Brassicaceae posts</a>,<i> </i>I erroneously lumped all kales into <i>Brassica oleracea</i>—<a title="Brassica napus kales" href="http://seedambassadors.org/Mainpages/still/napuskale/napuskale.htm" target="_blank">some of them are <i>B. napus</i></a>, including my favorite variety: Red Russian kale).&nbsp; Don’t dare throw out your beet, celeriac, rutabaga or <i>B. oleracea </i>greens, though, if you’re lucky enough to get them—they need a bit more cooking or tenderizing, but they’re still delicious and nutritious.&nbsp; At least put your celery root greens in stock.&nbsp; LMA also varies within a varietal based on growing conditions.&nbsp; Leaves grown in sun have higher LMA than leaves grown in shade.&nbsp; The impact of growing conditions within species, however, will have to wait for another time.</p>
<p>LMA is hardly the only determinant of which species make it onto our plates.&nbsp; Otherwise, we’d have our pick of hundreds of species on the low-LMA end of the global curve.&nbsp; Instead, we can put most of our greens species on a fairly legible phylogenetic tree in need of only a few disclaimer paragraphs of omissions.</p>

<p>Like many phylogenetic trees of more than a handful of species, this tree of our “greens species” commits sins of both commission and omission in the interest of producing a readable image. Omission because the species on the tree do not comprise an exhaustive list of species whose leaves people around the globe regularly consume. Commission because I included a few unusual items, such as sweet potato leaves (<i>Ipomoea</i>, Solanales), and pea shoots (Fabales), and a few taxa are single representatives of a large group.&nbsp; Sister to sweet potato on the tree, for example, is the entire family Lamiaceae, the mints.</p>

<p>We mostly use leaves from the mints as herbs and spices:&nbsp; peppermint and spearmint (<i>Mentha </i>sp.), basil (<i>Ocimum</i> sp.), thyme (<i>Thymus</i> sp.), oregano and marjoram (<i>Origanum</i> sp.), rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus</i> sp.), lemon balm (<i>Melissa</i> sp.), lavender (<i>Lavandula</i> sp.), shiso (<i>Perilla frutescens</i>), bee balm (<i>Monarda</i> sp.), and mountain mint (<i>Pycnanthemum</i> sp.).&nbsp; Also, scallions are the only representatives on the tree from the genus <i>Allium</i> in the monocot order Asparagles, which includes many edible species, the leaves of some of which are regularly employed:&nbsp; garlic, <a title="A look at&nbsp;leeks" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2013/03/03/a-look-at-leeks/" target="_blank">leeks</a>, ramps, and onions.</p>
<p>I included some of the more exotic greens in the greens tree both to avoid rousing the ire of their champions and because I was a bit shocked that some large, charismatic orders that feature prominently in the diet at large are reduced to single entries on the greens tree or are gone altogether, meaning we primarily use roots, stems, fruits or seeds from these clades, not leaves.&nbsp; Granted, this “greens tree” is mostly a tree of “greens obtained from Whole Foods and summer farmer’s markets in the continental United States.”</p>

<p>I’ve included a few weedy, wild things that I pick regularly and that one can actually occasionally pay money for at the farmer’s market:&nbsp; nettle (<i>Urtica dioica</i>, Rosales), chickweed (<i>Stellaria media</i>, Caryophyllales), miner’s lettuce (<i>Claytonia perfoliata</i>, Caryophyllales), purslane (<i>Portulaca oleracea</i>, Caryophyllales), and dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>, Asterales).&nbsp; Largely, however, I’ve omitted species whose leaves are technically edible, at least in small doses at some point in their life cycle, but that are reduced to curiosities at the modern American table, not staples.&nbsp; Therefore, please hold your fire if you’re shaking your fist at the tree because it omits the young beech (<i>Fagus grandifolia</i>, Fagales), sassafras (<i>Sassafras albidum</i>, Laureles), or violet (<i>Viola odorata</i>, Malpighiales) leaves you like to nibble on when you hike east of the Mississippi. Fern fiddlehead (assorted Polypodiales) enthusiasts, too, forgive me. &nbsp;We use some leaves to prepare other food: &nbsp;banana leaves and corn husks to wrap&nbsp;<em>tamales</em>, and palm fronds and fig leaves to wrap fish for baking or grilling. &nbsp;I salute these leaves, but they’re not on the tree. &nbsp;Some are gone simply because I didn’t have room, such as many of the <a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/">crucifer greens</a>, and asterids chrysanthemum, borage and comfrey (although those last two haven’t been placed to order yet and would therefore have been difficult to place within the asterids anyway).</p>

                    <p>An alarm clock for the rest of us</p><p>It’s a brand new year, which means I should really start writing a new post.
I’ve been wanting to for a while, but we’ve been in lockdown for two months now and Google Analytics is the only indication that I’m not alone on the planet, and most of that is bots anyway.
I’ve decided to take a page out of the book of my friend, <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/">James Stanley</a>, who both does cool things <em>and</em> actually writes about them, so I’m starting to document all my projects again.</p>
<p>Given my non-frenetic, slow-paced lifestyle, I’ve long had a non-burning need.
I don’t use an alarm to wake up, as I start work late, but I still want to know what time it is when I wake up, just to see if it’s way too early and I can go to sleep again.
A few days a week I have tennis and need to get up early, but if it’s windy or rainy or very cold, the practice gets canceled and I want to know before I’m awake enough to not be able to go to sleep again.</p>
<p>To accommodate this lifestyle, I’ve traditionally turned to my mobile phone, but that has some disadvantages.
Namely, the screen is too bright and wakes me up when I check the time, and I’m too obsessive to not check all my messages instead of falling asleep when I see the notifications on the screen.
I’ve long thought that a bedside alarm clock would be perfect for me, but I couldn’t find one that fulfilled all my requirements:</p>
<!-- break -->

<ul>
<li>I needed something that had a screen that would always be always lit, so I could check the time with one eye and half a brain awake, in the complete darkness of the bedroom.</li>
<li>A screen that wasn’t too bright and wouldn’t disturb sleep, but that would also be legible in direct sunlight, so I could see the time during the day.
This meant adaptive brightness.</li>
<li>Octagonal shape so I can lay it down on its side (or at 45°) instead of having to crane my neck up to check the time when lying down (I really did think of everything).</li>
<li>Weather forecast for the next hour or two, so I can reliably fail to wake up for tennis when not necessary.</li>
<li>Annoying beeper for alarms.</li>
<li>Less annoying built-in LEDs that would increase in brighness for a few minutes before an alarm went off, so I can wake up less annoyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot2.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot2-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>Look at this sexy thing.</span></p></div><p>Sexy.</p>
<h2>Designing this thing</h2>
<p>Conceptually, making an alarm clock to fulfill these requirements isn’t hard.
You take a small OLED screen, an ESP8266, connect them together, add some LEDs and a buzzer, and you’re done!
Since the hardware was more-or-less straightforward, I started with designing the octagonal case:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back.png" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back-small.png"></a></p><p><span>The back of the clock.</span></p></div><p>The OLED screen has four mounting holes, so I designed the mount around them.
For the ESP8266, I use a WeMos D1 Mini board, as it’s quite small and nice to work with.
I initially thought I’d have to connect the WeMos to the four pins of the screen with wires, but I discovered that if you kinda squint, you can get four of the ESP8266’s pins to match up with the screen’s pins and in the correct order, which means I could solder the ESP8266 behind the screen module directly, which simplified the wiring by a lot.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>Look at that subtle off-white coloring.</span></p></div><p>While designing the clock, I created a quick mockup of the screen as I wanted it to show.
I decided I wanted the hour to be displayed in as big letters as possible, since this screen is small, and the other elements I wanted were wind speed, temperature and weather forecast for the next hour.</p>
<p>The other components left to add were a photoresistor (for sensing ambient light), a buzzer and a LED strip.
They were all straightforward to add, the resistor is connected to the ESP8266’s analog pin, and the buzzer and LED strip to some other free pins.</p>
<h2>The software</h2>
<p>The software was the slightly trickier part in this build, although that was pretty straightforward too.
I needed multiple components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the time somehow (there’s no real-time clock on the ESP8266 and I didn’t want to add one).</li>
<li>Dimming the screen in a pleasing manner.</li>
<li>Getting the weather forecast and current weather.</li>
<li>Connecting to WiFi and autoupdating.</li>
<li>Annoying me into wakefulness in a satisfactory manner.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The clock</h3>
<p>There’s an old Chinese saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>To know the time, you must first connect to the internet.</p>
<p>– Sun Inc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, connecting to the Internet is very easy with tzapu’s <a href="https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager">excellent WiFiManager</a> library.
The clock creates an access point, you join it with your phone or computer, give it your WiFi network’s password, and you’re done.</p>
<p>After connecting, an NTP library can fetch the time every so often from the closest server, so the clock is always up to date.
It was important to me that this clock is solid enough to trust with my most important wake-up alarms, and it achieves this goal admirably (unless the internet connection is down).</p>
<p>That also takes care of autoupdates, since I have a simple, secure autoupdate machine I set up using <a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/espota-server">ESPOTA-server, an autoupdate server I wrote for the ESP8266</a>.
The clock checks for a new update every day, and automatically downloads and installs it.
This way, distributing updates will work reliably, even to millions of devices, for when you realize that collecting all the users’ personal data is slightly monetizable.</p>
<h3>The dimming</h3>
<p>After a bit (or a lot) of searching, I finally found how to dim the OLED screen, and another important feature was well on the way of being implemented.
Because it was rather hard to find, I’ll post the code here, along with the appropriate SEO keyword for people to be able to find it.
Here is the code for dimming an SSD1306-compatible, I2C 128x64 OLED screen:</p>

<p>Once I discovered that, the rest of the dimming was easy:
I would just read the ambient light from the photoresistor and set the screen’s brightness according to the photoresistor’s value.</p>
<p>Another job <del>well</del> done.</p>
<h3>The weather</h3>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>What a beauty.</span></p></div><p>Getting the weather was easier than I thought.
<a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather</a> has a simple API, which accepts a pair of coordinates and gives you the current weather and forecast for that location.
It only took a few minutes to fetch that data on the clock, and then I spent some time positioning them on the screen and turning the forecast into an appropriate icon so it could be displayed on the small screen.</p>
<p>To display the icons, I used <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/overview">Adafruit’s always helpful GFX library</a> and converted the OpenWeather icons to a format more suitable for display on a monochrome screen.
This took a bit of trial and error, as I wanted the icons to be easily distinguishable at a glance, even though their size was 12x12 pixels and just one color.
In the end, I think they worked out well, as it’s easy to tell if it’s raining or not.</p>
<h3>The wakefulness</h3>
<p>So the initial plan here was to have a buzzer buzz loudly and annoyingly in an attempt to wake me up.
However, I am a pretty light sleeper, and I hate loud and annoying sounds (surprisingly), so I wanted this to be a last resort.
The solution I came up with here is the following:</p>
<p>Say I want to set the alarm for 9:30, just in time to be ten minutes late for tennis.
The LEDs would start glowing very faintly at 9:20, slowly increasing in intensity over the next ten minutes, at which point they’d reach maximum.
If I still wasn’t up by then, the buzzer would begin beeping at the top of its lung, hopefully waking me up reliably.
This seemed like a pretty good algorithm, and one that would both wake me up pleasantly and reliably.</p>
<p>There was only one problem:
The clock doesn’t have any buttons or controls or any way for me to enter the alarm time.
I could create a web server where I could configure alarms, but I figured I’d rather get a rooster instead, so I did neither and just made an alarm clock that cannot alarm.
This symbolizes the futility of human existence and its incessant search for meaning in a cold and unfeeling universe that’s ultimately profoundly devoid of such, and then you die.</p>
<p>Not having to wake up to a buzzer is cool, though.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with this clock!
I can now open an eyelid, look at the time and fall asleep again, which is a massive quality-of-life improvement over the previous “fuck sleep I’ve got Instagram likes” situation.
The octagonal shape is a killer feature, I keep the clock angled 45° (as in the photo) and it really is the perfect angle for reading it while lying down.</p>
<p>One thing I’d like to improve in the future is to add a battery, because right now it’s solely USB powered and will obviously die if there’s a power outage. Adding a small LiPo battery and a charger circuit will be pretty easy and will ensure that the clock can keep running for hours even without power.</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/do-not-be-alarmed">https://gitlab.com/stavros/do-not-be-alarmed</a></p>
<p>It’s not very complete, so use it at your own risk, and I haven’t really added deployment details, but it should be very easy to build with one PlatformIO command.</p>

							<p><em>TLDR: DuckDB now has full-text search functionality, similar to the FTS5 extension in SQLite. The main difference is that our FTS extension is fully formulated in SQL. We tested it out on TREC disks 4 and 5.</em></p>

<p>Searching through textual data stored in a database can be cumbersome, as SQL does not provide a good way of formulating questions such as “Give me all the documents about <strong>Mallard Ducks</strong>”: string patterns with <code>LIKE</code> will only get you so far. Despite SQL’s shortcomings here, storing textual data in a database is commonplace. Consider the table <code>products (id INT, name VARCHAR, description VARCHAR</code>) - it would be useful to search through the <code>name</code> and <code>description</code> columns for a website that sells these products.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>We expect a search engine to return us results within milliseconds. For a long time databases were unsuitable for this task, because they could not search large inverted indices at this speed: transactional database systems are not made for this use case. However, analytical database systems, can keep up with state-of-the art information retrieval systems. The company <a href="https://www.spinque.com/">Spinque</a> is a good example of this. At Spinque, MonetDB is used as a computation engine for customized search engines.</p>

<p>DuckDB’s FTS implementation follows the paper “<a href="https://hannes.muehleisen.org/SIGIR2014-column-stores-ir-prototyping.pdf">Old Dogs Are Great at New Tricks</a>”. A keen observation there is that advances made to the database system, such as parallelization, will speed up your search engine “for free”!</p>

<p>Alright, enough about the “why”, let’s get to the “how”.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-the-data">Preparing the Data</h3>
<p>The TREC 2004 Robust Retrieval Track has 250 “topics” (search queries) over TREC disks 4 and 5. The data consist of many text files stored in SGML format, along with a corresponding DTD (document type definition) file. This format is rarely used anymore, but it is similar to XML. We will use OpenSP’s command line tool <code>osx</code> to convert it to XML. Because there are many files, I wrote a bash script:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> latimes/xml
<span>for </span>i <span>in</span> <span>$(</span><span>seq</span> <span>-w</span> 1 9<span>)</span>
<span>do
        </span><span>cat </span>dtds/la.dtd latimes-<span>$i</span> | osx <span>&gt;</span> latimes/xml/latimes-<span>$i</span>.xml
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This sorts the <code>latimes</code> files. Repeat for the <code>fbis</code>, <code>cr</code>, <code>fr94</code>, and <code>ft</code> files.</p>

<p>To parse the XML I used BeautifulSoup. Each document has a <code>docno</code> identifier, and a <code>text</code> field. Because the documents do not come from the same source, they differ in what other fields they have. I chose to take all of the fields.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>duckdb</span>
<span>import</span> <span>multiprocessing</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that we have a dataframe, we can register it in DuckDB.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># create database connection and register the dataframe
</span><span>con</span> <span>=</span> <span>duckdb</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>database</span><span>=</span><span>'db/trec04_05.db'</span><span>,</span> <span>read_only</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>'documents_df'</span><span>,</span> <span>documents_df</span><span>)</span>

<span># create a table from the dataframe so that it persists
</span><span>con</span><span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>"CREATE TABLE documents AS (SELECT * FROM documents_df)"</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is the end of my preparation script, so I closed the database connection.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-search-engine">Building the Search Engine</h3>
<p>We can now build the inverted index and the retrieval model using a <code>PRAGMA</code> statement. The extension is <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/full_text_search">documented here</a>. We create an index table on table <code>documents</code> or <code>main.documents</code> that we created with our script. The column that identifies our documents is called <code>docno</code>, and we wish to create an inverted index on the fields supplied. I supplied all fields by using the ‘*’ shortcut.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>con</span> <span>=</span> <span>duckdb</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>database</span><span>=</span><span>'db/trec04_05.db'</span><span>,</span> <span>read_only</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>"PRAGMA create_fts_index('documents', 'docno', '*', stopwords='english')"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Under the hood, a parameterized SQL script is called. The schema <code>fts_main_documents</code> is created, along with tables <code>docs</code>, <code>terms</code>, <code>dict</code>, and <code>stats</code>, that make up the inverted index. If you’re curious what this look like, take a look at our source code under the <code>extension</code> folder in DuckDB’s source code!</p>

<h3 id="running-the-benchmark">Running the Benchmark</h3>
<p>The data is now fully prepared. Now we want to run the queries in the benchmark, one by one. We load the topics file as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># the 'topics' file is not structured nicely, therefore we need parse some of it using regex
</span><span>def</span> <span>after_tag</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>tag</span><span>):</span>
    <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>'&lt;'</span> <span>+</span> <span>tag</span> <span>+</span> <span>r</span><span>'&gt;([\s\S]*?)&lt;.*&gt;'</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>m</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>].</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>).</span><span>strip</span><span>()</span>

<span>topic_dict</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'../../trec/topics'</span><span>,</span> <span>'r'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span>bs_content</span> <span>=</span> <span>bs</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(),</span> <span>"lxml"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>top</span> <span>in</span> <span>bs_content</span><span>.</span><span>findChildren</span><span>(</span><span>'top'</span><span>):</span>
        <span>top_content</span> <span>=</span> <span>top</span><span>.</span><span>getText</span><span>()</span>
        <span># we need the number and title of each topic
</span>        <span>num</span> <span>=</span> <span>after_tag</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>top</span><span>),</span> <span>'num'</span><span>).</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>' '</span><span>)[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>
        <span>title</span> <span>=</span> <span>after_tag</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>top</span><span>),</span> <span>'title'</span><span>)</span>
        <span>topic_dict</span><span>[</span><span>num</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>title</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This gives us a dictionary that has query number as keys, and query strings as values, e.g. <code>301 -&gt; 'International Organized Crime'</code>.</p>

<p>We want to store the results in a specific format, so that they can be evaluated by <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval.git">trec eval</a>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># create a prepared statement to make querying our document collection easier
</span><span>con</span><span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>"""

            SELECT *, fts_main_documents.match_bm25(docno, ?) AS score FROM documents) 
        SELECT docno, score
        FROM scored_docs
        WHERE score IS NOT NULL
        ORDER BY score DESC
        LIMIT 1000)
    """</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Now that we have created our ‘results’ file, we can compare them to the relevance assessments <code>qrels</code> using <code>trec_eval</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./trec_eval <span>-m</span> P.30 <span>-m</span> map qrels results
map                     all 0.2324
P_30                    all 0.2948
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not bad! While these results are not as high as the reproducible by <a href="https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions-robust04.md">Anserini</a>, they are definitely acceptable. The difference in performance can be explained by differences in</p>
<ol>
  <li>Which stemmer was used (we used ‘porter’)</li>
  <li>Which stopwords were used (we used the list of 571 English stopwords used in the SMART system)</li>
  <li>Pre-processing (removal of accents, punctuation, numbers)</li>
  <li>BM25 parameters (we used the default k=1.2 and b=0.75, non-conjunctive)</li>
  <li>Which fields were indexed (we used all columns by supplying ‘*’)</li>
</ol>

<p>Retrieval time for each query was between 0.5 and 1.3 seconds on our machine, which will be improved with further improvements to DuckDB. I hope you enjoyed reading this blog, and become inspired to test out the extension as well!</p>

							<p>Today, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority issued an advance notification of a 100 million NOK (€ 9 600 000) fine to the dating app Grindr, as a result of a legal complaint filed by the Norwegian Consumer Council. </p><p>- This is a milestone in the ongoing work to ensure that consumers’ privacy is protected online. The Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) has clearly established that it is unacceptable for companies to collect and share personal data without user´s permission, Finn Myrstad, director of digital policy in the Norwegian Consumer Council said.</p>
<p>In 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Council <a href="https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/new-study-the-advertising-industry-is-systematically-breaking-the-law/">revealed how many apps collect and share large amounts of sensitive information</a> without users’ knowledge. Based on these findings, the Consumer Council filed legal complaints, together with&nbsp;noyb, the European Center for Digital Right,&nbsp;against the dating app Grindr and five commercial partners for breaches of the&nbsp;General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>The Data Protection Authority has now upheld the Consumer Council’s&nbsp;complaint&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/news/2021/intention-to-issue--10-million-fine-to-grindr-llc/">issued an advance notification of a 100 million NOK&nbsp;</a>(€ 9 600 000)&nbsp;one-time&nbsp;administrative&nbsp;fine, which amounts to 10 percent of Grindr’s global annual revenue.&nbsp;Grindr has until February 15th&nbsp;to provide comments or remarks&nbsp;on the decision.</p>

<p>-  This is excellent news and sends a clear signal that it’s illegal to monitor consumers without their consent 24/7 to collect and share their data. The GDPR does have teeth and consumer groups stand ready to act against those who break the law, Monique Goyens, Director General of The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), said.</p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">– The message is simple: ‘take it or leave it’ is not consent. If you rely on unlawful ‘consent’ you are subject to a hefty fine.

<p>We made it into Iceland today! (No pictures of me in this post – I have horrible bed head at the moment, recovering from jet lag.)</p>



<p>As Americans, if we want to visit Iceland, we have a few choices:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Just drop in as a tourist for 90 days</strong> – except this is off-limits now due to the COVID19 travel bans</li><li><strong>Get a work permit and stay for years</strong> – this is what we’d originally planned to do when <a href="https://ozar.me/2020/10/were-planning-to-move-to-iceland-for-a-while/">I first shared that we were moving to Iceland for a while</a>. I had signed on to work part-time for an Icelandic company, a few days per month, in order to get a conventional work permit. However, my soon-to-be-employer had a shakeup, and rather than find another employer, we opted to…</li><li><strong>Get <a href="https://work.iceland.is/working/icelands-remote-work-long-term-visa">Iceland’s new teleworker visa</a></strong> – which lets you stay for 6 months per year as long as you’re from a country that wouldn’t normally need a tourist visa, and you can prove that you have a remote job that makes at least around $100K USD per year.</li></ul>



<p>The good news of using the teleworker visa:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Iceland">Iceland’s internet infrastructure</a> is fantastic, with full 1Gbit/sec fiber available all over the country, making it easy to work remotely</li><li>I don’t have to work for someone else, and I don’t have to go into an office, so I can limit my possible exposure to COVID19</li><li>It doesn’t affect our tax status – we don’t have to pay extra income taxes in Iceland, just our normal US income taxes back home</li></ul>



<p>The bad news:</p>



<ul><li>It’s only good for 6 months per year – they’ve talked about raising that, but for now it’s still just 6 months</li><li>It’s not eligible for a permanent residency permit – if I’d have had a regular work permit and stayed for 4 years straight (less vacations), we could have gotten a permanent residency permit, so we were planning to build a house in Iceland – that’s off for now</li></ul>



<h3>The teleworker visa application process</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.utl.is/index.php/en/long-term-visa-for-remote-workers-and-their-family-members">teleworker visa application</a> is pretty simple, but can’t be done online: you have to send over real paper forms and passport photos. I would highly recommend shipping your application via a shipping company that includes signed proof of delivery and tracking. If you need help with the application process, <a href="https://www.workfromiceland.com/remotework">WorkFromIceland.com</a> offers an advisory package, but it costs thousands of dollars. (We didn’t use it, but I was tempted.)</p>



<p>After Iceland’s Directorate of Immigration receives your application, it goes into a bit of a black hole. We didn’t get email confirmation that our application was received, and <a href="https://www.utl.is/index.php/en/processing-time-and-applications-being-processed">Iceland’s immigration status page</a> doesn’t show what range of teleworker visas they’re working on. That page is only updated about once a month – if you apply, I’d recommend using a service like <a href="https://distill.io/">distill.io</a> to watch the page for changes.</p>



<p>We received approval via email after 5 weeks to process, but we had a few folks talking to the Iceland government on our behalf, so that might have sped things up. As we worked through the final logistics with the Directorate of Immigration, we found out that we were literally the very first people to get approvals for this new visa!</p>



<p>Iceland sends you a signed email confirmation, at which point you’re eligible to enter the country. You show this email to passport control as you enter Iceland, they check their databases, and in you go.</p>



<h3>Quarantining in Iceland</h3>



<p>Obviously this situation is very fluid, and I’m writing about the January 2021 situation. If you’re reading this later, check <a href="https://www.covid.is/english">covid.is</a> for the latest coronavirus travel restrictions.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="139" height="300" src="https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-139x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-139x300.png 139w, https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-277x600.png 277w, https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-600x1299.png 600w, https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-768x1663.png 768w, https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test.png 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 139px) 100vw, 139px"><figcaption>I passed!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>72 hours before you fly into Iceland, you have to <a href="https://visit.covid.is/">register for your free COVID19 test</a> and download the <a href="https://www.covid.is/app/en">Rakning C-19 app</a>. Iceland tracks you by your cell phone number, and the app helps the country do contact tracing.</p>



<p>When you arrive, you get a free COVID19 test at the airport. Because they’ve got testing gear centralized in one location, you get your results back in the app quickly – ours took just about 8 hours.</p>



<p>From the airport, you have to go into quarantine for 5 days. There are a set list of hotels that accept quarantining guests, or you can go to your house. You’re allowed to pick up a rental car, and if you have a long drive ahead of you, you can stay overnight in a quarantine hotel first before setting off on your journey – but only one night. Because there are storms in the north where we need to go, we decided to just do the whole quarantine at an approved hotel instead. Room service!</p>



<p>After 5 days, you get another free COVID19 test. (The date, time, and location are sent to you via email &amp; via the Rakning-C19 app within a day of you starting quarantine.) After you receive the all-clear from your second test’s results, then you’re done with quarantining. We’ll drive up north, settle into our rental house, set up my home studio. I’m teleworking again, teaching training classes starting February 1. Oh I think I’m supposed to say 1 Feb now. I’m European. (raises pinkie finger)</p>



<p>I’m not teleworking too hard though: during our stay here, we’re working 2 weeks a month, and spending the rest of the time seeing the amazing sights of Iceland.</p>



<p>If you’ve got any questions about the application process or arriving into Iceland, let me know.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
						
<p>I have a hobby. I like citing papers that provide strong evidence that is directly in opposition to what the authors claim. Lucky me, because PNAS just published a paper that fits snuggly into this category. It’s titled <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2016976118#sec-13">“Experienced well-being rises with income, even above $75,000 per year”</a>. An even better title would have been “Income is a poor gauge for well-being; don’t bother”.</p>



<p>This is the central figure:</p>



<figure><a href="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1024x1013.png" alt="" width="475" height="469" srcset="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1024x1013.png 1024w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-300x297.png 300w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-768x760.png 768w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-202x200.png 202w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image.png 1034w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px"></a></figure>



<p>Whoa! The paper doesn’t fail to mention (multiple times) how this is virtually a perfect linear relationship between well-being and log(income). The authors conclude that people with higher income are more satisfied with life and experience more well-being!</p>



<h2>The real-life version of this graph</h2>



<p>Let’s see what this graph looks like with a linear x-axis and with simulated raw data (see code below). The black dots are simulated individual participants from the study, assuming that statistical assumptions are met. Their exact distribution along the x-axis is not known (the author did not publish raw data), but that doesn’t matter. It only matters how the dots are dispersed for a given income. </p>



<figure><a href="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="462" src="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-1024x462.png" alt="" srcset="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-1024x462.png 1024w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-300x135.png 300w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-768x346.png 768w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-444x200.png 444w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png 1060w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>You are one of the black dots. You could be one of the other black dots. But income does virtually nothing to lower or improve people’s well-being or life satisfaction. Income explained 1.5% and 4% of the variance in Well-Being and Life Satisfaction respectively (see code below).</p>



<blockquote><p>Income explained 1.5% and 4% of the variance in Well-Being and Life Satisfaction respectively</p></blockquote>



<h2>Extreme income rise = extreme happiness?</h2>



<p>Let’s study the most extreme case: you have an annual income of just $15,000. But now you get to jump into the life of a rich person all the way to the other side of the (linear) graph with an annual income of $480,000. The result of this 32-fold increase in income is expected to be:</p>



<ul><li>Life Satisfaction: 62% used to rate higher than you. Now only 35% does! But there’s a 24% chance that you will be <em>less</em> happy than before.</li><li>Experienced Well-Being: 58% used to rate higher than you. Now only 40% does! But there’s a 33% chance that you will be <em>less</em> happy than before.</li></ul>



<p>Hmm, hardly the extreme happiness rush that one might expect would expect from reading the paper and the ensuing media coverage. It’s a vanishingly small effect, considering the extremeness of this example. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I think it’s fairer to say that we’ve now learned that this paper is solid evidence that income is a really poor gauge for happiness. Someone once wrote a song about this:</p>



<figure><img src="https://25.media.tumblr.com/bf7724c5134e8d05cef1d8431e8c1ad1/tumblr_mh1jcs8zyE1rhssuho1_500.gif" alt="money can't buy me love the beatles gif"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://wifflegif.com/gifs/51599-money-cant-buy-me-love-the-beatles-gif">https://wifflegif.com/gifs/51599-money-cant-buy-me-love-the-beatles-gif</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2>Code</h2>



<p>Computing quantiles and probability of deterioration is simple. The z-score is your score relative to the whole population in units of standard deviations. So just the results for Life Satisfaction were obtained by reading off the extremes of the graph and computing the associated quantiles in R: <code>pnorm(-0.3)</code> and <code>pnorm(0.4)</code>. Probability of negative income change is then just <code>pnorm(-0.3, 0.4)</code>.</p>



<p>The plots are fairly straightforward too. First, let’s simulate the raw data:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="r" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group=""># Data
N = 33391  # Number of participants
incomes = exp(seq(log(15000), log(480000), length.out = N))  # x-axis of Figure 1
trend_wb = seq(-0.2, 0.25, length.out = N)  # Linear, read off Figure 1
trend_ls = seq(-0.3, 0.4, length.out = N)   # Linear, read off Figure 1
z_wb = rnorm(N, trend_wb)  # z-score is standard normal
z_ls = rnorm(N, trend_ls)  # z-score is standard normal

# Merge the data in long format
df = data.frame(
  incomes,
  z = c(rnorm(N, z_wb), rnorm(N, z_ls)),
  outcome = c(rep("Experienced Well-Being", N), rep("Life Satisfaction", N))
)
</pre>



<p>Now let’s plot it:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="r" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">ggplot(df, aes(x = incomes, y = z)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, size = 0.3) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = c(trend_wb, trend_ls), color = outcome), lwd = 2) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 75000, lty = 2, lwd = 1, color = "#555555") + 
  facet_wrap(~outcome) + 
  #scale_x_continuous(trans = "log", breaks = c(15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480) * 1000) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480) * 1000, labels = scales::label_number_auto()) + 
  labs(x = "Houshold income", y = "z-scored well-being") + 
  theme_bw(13) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
</pre>



<p>If you want to verify other results, you can fit the linear models to the (simulated) data and see that we can approximately replicate the r-values reported in the paper (r = 0.17 and r = 0.09) and that this correspond to 4% and 1.5% variance explained, respectively:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="r" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">summary(lm(z_ls ~ log(incomes)))
summary(lm(z_wb ~ log(incomes)))</pre>



<p>I leave it as an exercise to the reader to filter out <code>nonlow_incomes = incomes[incomes &gt; 30000]</code> and assess the predictive performance (<code>lm(z_ls ~ log(nonlow_incomes)</code>).</p>

<h3>Anna Novakov and T. Novakov</h3>
<p><em>like a yellow silken scarf, the thick fog hangs along the quay[1]</em></p>
<p>In the 1880s, London’s frequent and well-documented episodes of fog were a phenomenon unique to England’s most densely populated, diverse, and industrialized urban center. The spectacular nature of the embankment fog, often described by eyewitnesses as changeable and even colorful, caught the imagination of many artists and writers who saw in these atmospheric manifestations a symbol of modernity and the role of industrialization on an evolving urban space. While the illusive city, shrouded in winter fog, created the perfect backdrop for mysterious, criminal activity, it also proved to be a compelling inspiration for those who read the fog as a more positive symbol of London’s cosmopolitan status. In this essay, we seek to interrelate some artistic and literary references to the fog with contemporary explanations addressing the causes of this atmospheric phenomenon. Through this interdisciplinary approach, we hope to shed light on the physical, artistic and even psychological implications of Victorian air pollution.[2]</p>
<p>Expansions of industrial activity during the later half of the 19th century resulted in frequent and severe air pollution episodes. In London, the smoke that billowed as a result of domestic and industrial coal burning began mixing with existing natural fog. Charles Dickens wrote in Bleak House that “smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black drizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown snowflakes –- gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of the sun.”[3] The resulting smog (word coined from smoke + fog), was often sited by both visitors and locals as an optical experience unique to London. These low-laying fogs reduced visibility in the city to less than a mile while resulting in the loss of up to fifty percent of the sunshine in the winter months.[4] Thomas Hardy mentions it is in his 1900 poem “The Darkling Rush” as</p>
<p>I leant upon a coppice gate,<br>
When Frost was spectre-gray,<br>
And Winter’s dregs made desolate<br>
The weakening eye of day.<br>
The tangled bine-stems scored the sky<br>
Like strings of broken lyres,<br>
And all mankind that haunted nigh<br>
Had sought their household fires.[5]</p>
<p>While writer Arthur Symons wrote that “In London, men work as if in darkness, scarcely seeing their own hands . . . and not knowing the meaning of their labour.”[6] French writer Joris-Karl Huyseman likewise wrote in 1884 that “A rainy, colossal London smelling of molten metal and of soot, ceaselessly streaming and smoking in the fog now spread out before his eyes . . . All this was transpiring in vast warehouses along the river banks which were bathed by the muddy and dull water of an imaginary Thames . . . while trains rushed past at full speed or rumbled underground uttering horrible cries and vomiting waves of smoke, and while, through every street, monstrous and gaudy and infamous advertisements flared through the eternal twilight.”[7]</p>
<p>In Jayati Gupta’s essay “London Through Alien Eyes,” published in Literary London: Interdisciplinary Studies in the Representation of London, he references Madame Krishnabhabini Das’ 1880s London experiences. She noted that “this sort of fog persists through the day and assumes different hues – sometimes ashen – sometimes black – sometimes yellow.” Another eye witness L.C.W. Bonacina gave this insightful description of yellow fog’s evolution “A really bad nineteenth century fog appeared early in the morning as a thick white mist, like the country fog, only dirtier. With the lighting of the fires it would soon become yellow and pungent, irritating the throat and eyes, till midday the continued outpouring of chimney products would have turned the fog a sooty brownish black causing the darkness of night.” Furthermore he added that, “During summer months major fogs were virtually unknown in the nineteenth century just as they are in the twentieth.”[8]</p>
<p>These, and other more contemporary reports most often described the yellow hue prevalent in London fog. Oscar Wilde noted the yellow hue in his poem “Impression du Matin”:</p>
<p>The Thames nocturne of blue and gold<br>
Changed to a Harmony in grey:<br>
A barge with ochre-coloured hay<br>
Dropt from the wharf: and chill and cold<br>
The yellow fog came creeping down<br>
The bridges, till the houses’ walls<br>
Seemed changed to shadows and St. Paul’s<br>
Loomed like a bubble o’er the town.[9]</p>
<p>Bonacina’s chromatic observations can certainly be credited to the predominance of domestic coal burning. Tars from low temperature coal combustion in the morning were yellow. The yellow tar, created in the morning, was soluble in fog water and thus colored the fog droplets creating the appearance of chromatic fog. Later in the day, emissions from industry, steam locomotives and ships increased coinciding with the darkening fogs. Tar produced in these higher temperatures took on a dark brown coloration. Atmospheric chemist Peter Brimblecombe proposed the following three possible origins for the yellow fog: (i) light scattering by smoke particles above the fog such that it was illuminated by yellowish light, (ii) the gas and weak electric light gave the fog a yellowish hue at night, and (iii) tarry compounds actually colored the fog, giving preference to the latter possibility.[10]</p>
<p>Victorian writers, noted with some frequency additional chromatic effects produced by the modern fog. In 1899, an article was published in The Artist magazine that read “There’s nothing to be seen like it ever – in any town in Europe. They say it’s due to the smoke and it may be; but just look at it. Look at the purple and crimson, the scarlet and gold . . . until with just the tiniest fleck of pink it sinks into the palest green.”[11] Aaron Watson, in an article in the Magazine of Art, suggests that the city “enfolds all ugliness in a purple haze.”[12] Charles Dickens in his novel Our Mutual Friend notes that “Even in the surrounding country it was a foggy day, but there the fog was great, whereas in London it was, at about the boundary line, dark yellow, and a little within it brown, and then browner, and then browner, until at the heart of the City — which call Saint Mary Axe – it was rustic black.”[13]</p>
<p>Visual artists, such as French painter Claude Monet, witnessed the yellow fogs as well as a variety of additional chromatic atmospheric effects. For Monet, London’s varied fogs were a spectacular manifestation of turn-of-century city life -– an optical phenomenon that he captured in a well documented and frequently referenced series of canvases.</p>
<p>London was a magical place for Monet. He beamed “I so love London! But I love it only in winter. It’s nice in summer with its parks, but nothing like it is in winter with the fog, for without the fog, London wouldn’t be a beautiful city. It’s the fog that gives it its magnificent breadth. Those massive, regular blocks become grandiose within that mysterious cloak.”[14] In 1900 he added that “The weather is magnificent but unsettled . . . I can’t begin to describe a day as wonderful as this. One [colored] marvel, after another each lasting less than five minutes, it was enough to drive one mad. No country could be more extraordinary for a painter.”[15]</p>
<p>The constantly changing chromatic effects of London’s fog were unusual and bear little resemblance to contemporary atmospheric phenomena. To understand this unique development it is vital to discuss the evidence for these chromatic fogs. Taking into account the lack of scientific, measurement-based observations, we would like to employ artistic production, such as Monet’s Thames series, as indirect evidence –- source material that forms the basis for a broader explanatory discussion of this form of air pollution.</p>
<p>Between 1898 and 1901, Monet made numerous extended trips to London. Working from an upscale Savoy Hotel suite, he created numerous paintings of the Waterloo and Charing Cross Bridges. As an accomplished and sensitive colorist, Monet found himself captivated by London’s fog and its spectacular optical appearance, which he referred to as l’enveloppe. Of particular relevance to this essay is Monet’s description “The fog in London assumes all sorts of colors; there are black, brown, yellow, green, [and] purple fogs.”[16] Was the colored fog depicted in these paintings and referenced in written accounts a subjective interpretation of the London’s cityscape or documentary evidence of London’s timely and transient atmospheric effects?</p>
<p>These hazy, colorful paintings are certainly marvelous Impressionist interpretations of the city’s skyline. The chromatic effects that Monet was trying to capture in the bridge scenes were fleeting and momentary. The changeable weather conditions of the morning fog and winter color palette, forced the artist to work on stacks of canvases at the same time. Monet recalled that “At the Savoy Hotel . . . from which I looked at my points of view, I had up to a hundred canvases under way –- of the same subject. By searching among the sketches feverishly, I chose one of them that didn’t differ too much from what I saw; despite everything, I altered it completely. When work was finished, I would notice, in moving my canvases, that I had overlooked precisely the one that would have suited me best and which I had at hand.”[17] Monet’s artistic output and his frantic attempts to capture fleeting effects are visual evidence of the changing and colorful atmospheric effects he witnessed.</p>
<p>For Monet, the Waterloo Bridge took on many manifestations depending on the time of day and visual effects of the fog. The bridge appears as mauve semi-circles in the Chicago Art Institute’s version of the Waterloo Bridge. The painting foreground focuses our eye on surface effects of undulating droplets of colored water. Receding into the background, factory chimneys reinforce the arches of the bridge while further bisecting Monet’s composition. …</p></div></article></div></div></section></div></div></div>

A <strong>Platformer</strong> investigation has found:</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Signal appears to have more than 40 million users, up from approximately 20 million last month</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The company is actively developing features related to user names and cryptocurrency payments, potentially creating new avenues for abuse</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>At least one employee quit Signal in recent weeks over concerns that the 6-year-old company does not have a content policy and has resisted developing one</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton has become heavily involved in daily operations, interviewing engineers and writing code</strong> </p></li><li><p><strong>CEO Moxie Marlinspike tells Platformer: “The thing about software is that you never can fully anticipate everything. We just have to be willing to iterate.”</strong></p></li></ul><p>On January 6th, WhatsApp users around the world began seeing a pop-up message notifying them of upcoming changes to the service’s privacy policy. The changes were designed to enable businesses to send and store messages to WhatsApp’s 2 billion-plus users, but they came with an ultimatum: agree by February 8th, or you can no longer use the app.</p><p>The resulting furor sparked a backlash that led Facebook-owned WhatsApp to delay the policy from taking effect until May. In the meantime, though, tens of millions of users began seeking alternatives to Facebook’s suite of products. Among the biggest beneficiaries has been Signal, the encrypted messaging app whose development is funded by a nonprofit organization. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">according to one research firm</a>, the six-year-old app had about 20 million users worldwide. But in a 12-hour period the Sunday after WhatsApp’s privacy policy update began, Signal added another 2 million users, an employee familiar with the matter told me. Days of temporary outages followed.</p><p>The pace has hardly relented since. Signal leapt to No. 1 in the app stores of 70 countries, and it continues to rank near the top of most of them, including the United States. While the company won’t confirm the size of its user base, a second employee told me the app has now surpassed 40 million users globally. And while Signal still has a small fraction of the market for mobile messaging — Telegram, another upstart messenger, <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1352368555711365121">says it added 90 million active users in January alone</a> —&nbsp;the rapid growth has been a cause for excitement inside the small distributed team that makes the app.</p><p>Adding millions of users has served as a vindication for a company that has sought to build a healthier internet by adopting different incentives than most Silicon Valley companies.</p><p>“We're organized as a nonprofit because we feel like the way the internet currently works is insane,” CEO Moxie Marlinspike told me. “And a lot of that insanity, to us, is the result of bad business models that produce bad technology. And they have bad societal outcomes.” Signal’s mission, by contrast, is to promote privacy through end-to-end encryption, without any commercial motive.</p><p>But Signal’s rapid growth has also been a cause for concern. In the months leading up to and following the 2020 US presidential election, Signal employees raised questions about the development and addition of new features that they fear will lead the platform to be used in dangerous and even harmful ways. But those warnings have largely gone unheeded, they told me, as the company has pursued a goal to hit 100 million active users and generate enough donations to secure Signal’s long-term future.</p><p>Employees worry that, should Signal fail to build policies and enforcement mechanisms to identify and remove bad actors, the fallout could bring more negative attention to encryption technologies from regulators at a time when their existence is threatened around the world.</p><p>“The world needs products like Signal — but they also need Signal to be thoughtful,” said Gregg Bernstein, a former user researcher who left the organization this month over his concerns. “It’s not only that Signal doesn’t have these policies in place. But they’ve been resistant to even considering what a policy might look like.”</p><p>Interviews with current and former employees, plus leaked screenshots of internal deliberations, paint a portrait of a company that is justly proud of its role in promoting privacy while also willfully dismissing concerns over the potential misuses of its service. Their comments raise the question of whether a company conceived as a rebuke to data-hungry, ad-funded communication tools like Facebook and WhatsApp will really be so different after all.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>Like a lot of problems, this one started with an imperative familiar to most businesses: growth.</p><p>Encrypted messaging has been a boon to activists, dissidents, journalists, and marginalized groups around the world. Not even Signal itself can see their messages —&nbsp;much less law enforcement or national security agencies. The app saw a surge in usage during last year’s protests for racial justice, even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280112/signal-face-blurring-tool-ios-android-update">adding a tool to automatically blur faces</a> in photos to help activists more safely share images of the demonstrations. This kind of growth, one that supported progressive causes, was exciting to Signal’s roughly 30-member team.</p><p>“That's the kind of use case that we really want to support,” Marlinspike told me. “People who want more control over their data and how it's used — and who want to exist outside the gaze of tech companies.”</p><p>On October 28th, <a href="https://signal.org/blog/group-links/">Signal added group links</a>, a feature that has become increasingly common to messaging apps. With a couple of taps, users could begin creating links that would allow anyone to join a chat in a group as large as 1,000 people. And because the app uses end-to-end encryption, Signal itself would have no record of the group’s title, its members, or the image the group chose as its avatar. At the same time, the links make it easy for activists to recruit large numbers of people onto Signal simultaneously, with just a few taps.</p><p>But as the US presidential election grew closer, some Signal employees began raising concerns that group links could be abused. On September 29th, during a debate, President Trump had told the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys to “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-donald-trump-chris-wallace-0b32339da25fbc9e8b7c7c7066a1db0f">stand back and stand by</a>.” During an all-hands meeting, an employee asked Marlinspike how the company would respond if a member of the Proud Boys or another extremist organization posted a Signal group chat link publicly in an effort to recruit members and coordinate violence.</p><p>“The response was: if and when people start abusing Signal or doing things that we think are terrible, we'll say something,” said Bernstein, who was in the meeting, conducted over video chat. “But until something is a reality, Moxie's position is he's not going to deal with it.”</p><p>Bernstein (disclosure: a former colleague of mine at Vox Media), added, “You could see a lot of jaws dropping. That’s not a strategy —&nbsp;that’s just hoping things don’t go bad.”&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike’s response, he told me in a conversation last week, was rooted in the idea that because Signal employees cannot see the content on their network, the app does not need a robust content policy. Like almost all apps, its terms of service state that the product cannot be used to violate the law. Beyond that, though, the company has sought to take a hands-off approach to moderation.</p><p>“We think a lot on the product side about what it is that we're building, how it's used, and the kind of behaviors that we're trying to incentivize,” Marlinspike told me. “The overriding theme there is that we don't want to be a media company. We’re not algorithmically amplifying content. We don’t have access to the content. And even within the app, there are not a lot of opportunities for amplification.”</p><p>At the same time, employees said, Signal is developing multiple tools simultaneously that could be ripe for abuse. For years, the company has faced complaints that its requirement that people use real phone numbers to create accounts <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kaxge/how-to-use-signal-without-giving-out-your-phone-number-a-gendered-security-issue">raises privacy and security concerns</a>. And so Signal has begun working on an alternative: letting people create unique usernames. But usernames (and display names, should the company add those, too) could enable people to impersonate others — a scenario the company has not developed a plan to address, despite completing much of the engineering work necessary for the project to launch.</p><p>Signal has also been actively exploring the addition of payments into the app. Internally, this has been presented as a way to help people in developing nations transfer funds more easily. But other messaging apps, including Facebook and China’s WeChat, have pursued payments as a growth strategy.</p><p>An effort from Facebook to develop a cryptocurrency, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-rebrands-libra-wallet-service-calibra-to-novi/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Facebook%20announced%20that%20Calibra%20has%20a%20new%20name%2C%20Novi.&amp;text=The%20Libra%20blockchain%20is%20supposed,%E2%80%9Cvia%E2%80%9D%20(way).">now known as Diem</a>, has been <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2019/11/05/libras-regulatory-hurdles-appear-taller-after-house-hearing/">repeatedly derailed</a> by skeptical regulators.</p><p>Marlinspike has served as an adviser to MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency built on the Stellar blockchain designed to make payments simple and secure —&nbsp;and, potentially, impossible to trace. “The idea of MobileCoin is to build a system that hides everything from everyone,” <em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/">Wired</a></em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/"> wrote of the project in 2017</a>. “These components make MobileCoin more resistant to surveillance, whether it's coming from a government or a criminal.”</p><p>People I spoke with told me they regard the company’s exploration of cryptocurrency as risky since it could invite more bad actors onto the platform and attract regulatory scrutiny from world leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike played down the potential of crypto payments in Signal, saying only that the company had done some “design explorations” around the idea. But significant engineering resources have been devoted to developing MobileCoin integrations in recent quarters, former employees said.&nbsp;</p><p>“If we did decide we wanted to put payments into Signal, we would try to think really carefully about how we did that,” Marlinspike said. “It’s hard to be totally hypothetical.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>III.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Signal’s growth imperatives are driven in part by its unusual corporate structure. The app is funded by the Signal Foundation, which was created in 2018 with a $50 million loan from WhatsApp co-founder …</p></div></div>

    <p>Over the past several weeks, GameStop stock has traded more like a cryptocurrency than a failing mall-based retailer.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/gme.png" alt="GameStop"></p>

<p>What is going on here?</p>

<p>In one sentence: Institutional investors short GameStop (i.e., the prevailing wisdom, at least until the past few weeks) are playing a game of chicken with retail investors &amp; contrarian institutions who are long. [1]</p>

<h3 id="the-current-situation">The Current Situation</h3>

<p>GameStop is a video game retailer; it has been in decline for several years now. Video games have moved to an online, direct-to-consumer distribution model. Foot traffic in malls (where most GameStops are located) was down even before COVID; many mall-based retailers are struggling.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, over the course of 2020 this led to GameStop becoming one of the <a href="https://www.highshortinterest.com/">most shorted stocks</a> on Wall Street.</p>

<p>However, there were early signs that GameStop was undervalued. Michael Burry (of <em>The Big Short</em> fame) <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-michael-burry-big-short-stock-next-gen-discs-2019-8">took a large long position in 2019</a>, claiming video game discs are not entirely dead. In August 2020, Roaring Kitty (a.k.a. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/">u/DeepFuckingValue</a> on Reddit) published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alntJzg0Um4">video</a> detailing why GameStop was a good play based on its fundamentals – a future short squeeze would just be the icing on the cake.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/michael_burry.jpg" alt="Michael Burry"></p>

<p>On January 11th, Ryan Cohen (founder of <a href="https://www.chewy.com/">Chewy</a>, which sold to PetSmart for $3.35 billion), <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chewy-co-founder-joins-gamestops-board-after-pushing-overhaul-11610378574">joined GameStop’s board</a> after his investment firm built up a 10% stake in the company. At this point, retail investors, especially those on the popular subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">Wall Street Bets</a> went crazy. They highlighted that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/">GameStop was now a growth play</a>. It is now led by a previously successful founder, its online business is growing at a 300% rate, and it is in the process of turning around its core business. [2] As such, GameStop should be valued at a Venture Capital multiple of 10x+ revenue, rather than a measly 0.5x revenue.</p>

<p>This narrative is compelling. Despite short sellers warning otherwise, GameStop has continued to climb in price. All of the GameStop options issued (with a high strike price of $60) were in the money on Friday (1/22/2021), trigging a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2txra/that_was_a_margin_call/gk87z17/">gamma squeeze</a> as institutions who had written the options rushed to cover their positions. GameStop closed Friday at $65.01.</p>

<p>On Monday (1/25/2021), GameStop opened at $96.73, spiked at $159.18 (likely because of another gamma squeeze), [3] then crashed with pressure from institutional shorts, closing at $76.79 (still up 18% day-over-day).</p>

<p>But the bulls aren’t finished with GameStop. These gamma squeezes are nothing compared to what will be coming: the near-mythical “Infinity Squeeze”. Most famously seen with <a href="https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/">Volkswagen in 2008</a>, when short sellers are forced to cover their positions due to a margin call, the price of the stock rapidly rises (hypothetically to infinity) since the number of shares shorted exceeds the number of shares available to buy.</p>

<h3 id="the-allure-of-wall-street-bets">The Allure of Wall Street Bets</h3>

<p>Can a subreddit comprised of retail investors really move the market like this? I doubt it – all of the big swings in this stock have been caused by institutions. What this subreddit does is <strong>control the narrative</strong>.</p>

<p>First unveiled to the mainstream finance world in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">February 2020 Bloomberg article</a>, Wall Street Bets is profane (as I’m sure you’ve noticed if you clicked any of the links in this post). But Wall Street Bets isn’t some sinister, market-manipulating entity. Rather, it is a virtual water cooler for individual retail investors to post memes – and emojis, oh so many emojis – about their investments.</p>

<p>Reading Wall Street Bets feels like the discussion at a middle school cafeteria table circa 2000. Redditors on Wall Street Bets (who refer to themselves affectionately as “autists” or “retards”) [4] encourage one another to have “diamond hands” (💎 🤲), the will to stay strong and not sell a stock when things are going poorly. Contrast this with the “paper hands” (🧻 🤲) of those who are weak-willed and sell a stock based on market sentiment. Companies are headed “to the moon” (🚀). Bears are not mentioned without the adjective “gay” (🌈 🐻). Self-deprecating cuckold references to “my wife’s boyfriend” abound.</p>

<p>Despite this language (or perhaps because of it), Wall Street Bets is one of the most entertaining and informative places on the internet. People post meaningful analysis of companies that are undervalued and why they are investing. Browsing the subreddit, you get a crash course on concepts that you would otherwise learn only at a buy-side firm or working as an options trader: EBITDA multiple, book value, delta hedging, implied volatility.</p>

<p>But the most compelling aspect of Wall Street Bets is in its name: the bets. The ability to gain (or lose) a life-changing amount of money – with screenshots to prove it – creates an environment similar to that of the casino floor. And if Wall Street Bets is the casino floor, then Wall Street itself is the house.</p>

<p>The same emotion that caused us to root for the thieves in <em>Ocean’s 11</em> is what makes Wall Street Bets so enticing. Put frankly, Millennials are tired of getting fucked by the man. When you’re underemployed with $100,000 in student loan debt, your financial situation feels overwhelming. You really don’t want to take the advice of your parents or CNBC talking heads [5] to invest 10% of your salary for a 4% annual return. At that point, what’s another $5,000? Might as well buy some short-dated GME calls.</p>

<p>For those of use who don’t fit the underemployed Millennial archetype, Matt Levine’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-30/if-you-re-bored-you-can-trade-stocks">Boredom Markets Hypothesis</a> applies. COVID has required us to work from home, without much ability to spend for travel, dining, or entertainment. Putting money into Robinhood is a decent substitute – with the added bonus of it being an “investment”, rather than consumption. In an age where the Fed will print seemingly unlimited money to prop up capital markets, better to be irrational exuberant as a part of the market than be left out of the party.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/money_printer.jpg" alt="money printer go brrrrr"></p>

<p>Further, the narrative presented by the GameStop trade in particular is compelling. It allows the small retail investor to play a role in market events normally only played out at the hedge fund scale (a short squeeze was a key plot element in Season 1 of <em>Billions</em>). The short sellers in this case aren’t particularly sympathetic: Andrew Left of <a href="https://citronresearch.com/">Citron Research</a> released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEi2axM4hwI">video</a> in which he lays out the bear case for GameStop. His main argument was a smug appeal to authority, essentially claiming “Wall Street knows better than you people on message boards”. [6]</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/short_squeeze.jpg" alt="Billions Short Squeeze"></p>
<p>Billions, IRL (image via <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2016/02/09/billions-for-the-99-episode-4-what-it-means-to-face-a-short-squeeze/?sh=5d3100f36d69">Forbes</a>)</p>

<p>So sure, Wall Street Bets is irreverent, has irrational exuberance, and is guilty of hero worship (Elon Musk and more recently Ryan Cohen). But it also provides a sense of community during the stresses of COVID and provides a compelling way for the little guy to stick it to the man.</p>

<p>As Keynes reminded us (in the most overused finance quote of all time): <em>“The markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”</em> When enough people believe in a vision, it can cause that vision to manifest itself. <a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/gamestop-and-the-dangerous-game-of-gamma-squeezes-15546125">Wall Street is scared</a> that retail investors can manifest their own vision, rather that the one dictated by the major financial players.</p>

<h3 id="what-george-soros-got-right">What George Soros Got Right</h3>

<p>The entire GameStop scenario is a case study in reflexivity. [7] Reflexivity is the idea that our perception of circumstances influences reality, which then further impacts our perception of reality, in a self-reinforcing loop. Specifically, in a financial market, prices are a reflection of traders’ expectations. Those prices then influence traders’ expectations, and so on.</p>

<p>This may seem obvious to some, but it flies in the face of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">efficient-market hypothesis</a>. As Soros states,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What makes reflexivity interesting is that the prevailing bias has ways, via the market prices, to affect the so-called fundamentals that market prices are supposed to reflect. [8]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this mean for GameStop? Because of traders’ bullish sentiment, a previously failing company is now in the position where it can leverage the overnight increase in value to make real, substantive changes to its business. GameStop can pay off debt through the issuance of new shares or make strategic acquisitions using its newly-valuable shares. [9] A struggling company could become solid simply not because of a change in the underlying business, but because investors <strong>decided it should be more valuable</strong>.</p>

<p>Reflexivity may be the best way to understand the 21st Century. <a href="https://emerging.substack.com/p/peak-reflexivity">Passive investing is an example of reflexivity in action</a>. [10] So is winner-take-all venture investing. Uber raised an absurd war chest, causing more investors to want to pile in, which led to more fundraising and eventually a successful IPO. The fact that Uber has not yet turned a profit, yet today has a $100 billion market cap, cannot be explained with traditional financial thinking, but can be explained by reflexivity.</p>

<p>The internet and instant communication only accelerates these trends. Instances of reflexivity like the strange market movements we’ve seen with GameStop are happening more and more – not only in financial markets, but also in the political and social realm, to incredible effect.</p>

<p>When Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, I distinctly remember writing in my journal: <em>“Anything is possible.”</em> I was blown away that this complete buffoon of a man, someone who the Huffington Post <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-note-about-our-coverage-of-donald-trumps-campaign_n_55a8fc9ce4b0896514d0fd66">refused to cover as politics</a> meme-d his way into the presidency. He was a joke, until suddenly, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa">Tulpa-esque</a> twist…he wasn’t. Similarly, internet conspiracy theories spread via Facebook memes manifested themselves in the real world when Trump supporters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol">stormed the Capitol</a> a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>Our perception shapes reality. And when enough people agree on a specific perception, it becomes reality. [11] As we become more and more connected, discourse will expand and and accelerate. We’re going to see some strange things become reality.</p>

<p>Even, perhaps, hedge funds going bankrupt and newly-minted …</p></div></div>

January 25, 2021 | https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-instantly-show-your-value | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-instantly-show-your-value">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-f7b3cf53449abc80ad4f"><div><p>Happy new year from Toronto!</p><p>I’ve compiled my favorite ways to convey your product’s value prop. These apply to products and brands, but feel free to apply this to people too. These work for job interviews, selling yourself as a consultant, etc.</p><p><strong>Use before-and-after</strong>: <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/comparisons-heighten-drama" target="_blank">Everyone loves a good before-and-after contrast</a>. Before-and-afters are a powerful application of the idea of “show not tell.” That’s why you see so many before-and-afters when scrolling through your feed: weight loss (not-your-best self vs toned/healthy), home renovation (dingy bathroom vs shiny new renovation), messaging copy (bad writing vs strong writing), etc. A before-and-after is like a jump cut that skips all the boring parts--it emphasizes contrast, which heightens drama and interest. When talking about yourself, show what a project was like before you arrived and what it looked like after your contributions.</p><p><strong>Show, not tell</strong>: I recently came across AI-driven software that reduces background noise on calls. The thing that caught my eye on their homepage is the toggle “on” and “off” button where you can hear a sound sample without their tool versus how much sharper the sound is with their tool. It was pretty incredible and instantly sold me. As a marketer, I’m always on the lookout for <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/case-study-dissecting-an-everyday-story" target="_blank">when I change my mind</a>. It’s hard to change people’s minds, so when it happens successfully, try to learn what worked. Think of how you can demonstrate the value of your product like this.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610079443099_26862"><div><p><strong>Experiential, temporal, sensory</strong>: It’s hard for most brands to describe your product’s value quickly. It’s especially hard if your product has an experiential, temporal, or sensory component.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><em>Experiential</em>: How do you convey a sense of community and belonging? The altMBA had this challenge. In-person courses had websites that showed photos of participants drawing on post-its and pointing at white boards. But our course was entirely online. Photos of people sitting at a computer would hardly do justice. We ended up using screenshots of Zoom gallery view among other things. Not perfect, but we chose to rely less on photography and more on other design elements given this constraint.</p></li><li><p><em>Temporal</em>: How do you convey the value of your product if it lasts 10x longer than competitors who are selling for cheaper? How do you convey the value or benefit of your product if there’s no immediate benefit in a world that loves instant gratification? Think of examples of products you’ve purchased where there’s less immediate value but more long-term value, and how the value prop was positioned.</p></li><li><p><em>Sensory</em>: How do you convey smell through a computer screen? How do you convey how good your weighted blanket feels? To solve this, consumer products will focus more on the emotion, less on the product features. For body wash, the brand doesn’t talk about how the sulfates will get you clean, how it smells, and the ounces of product you get. They talk about taking a moment for yourself.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Don’t worry about correct grammar</strong>. Go ahead and break grammar rules. The only thing that matters is that your customer takes action and you build trust in the process. I add that last part about building trust because you want to aim for conversion, but not destroy your brand equity in the process. It’s a delicate balance per the <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/brand-marketing-vs-performance-marketing" target="_blank">Brand vs Performance Marketing Spectrum</a>.</p><p><strong>Increase desire, don’t just decrease friction</strong>: People jump through hoops for things they want. Did you pick your spouse because they were the most convenient option? No, you picked them despite needing to overcome obstacles. We tend to focus on removing friction because it feels comfortable and there’s a checklist of ways to do it. There’s less of a formula for <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/increasing-desire-vs-decreasing-friction" target="_blank">increasing desire</a>--which makes it all the more worthwhile because there’s upside potential that fewer people attempt to tap into.</p><p><strong>Be/Have/Do</strong>: This is one of my favorite frameworks for showing transformation. You want to show how your product helps a brand transform. What does your product let your customer be that they weren’t before? What do customers have that they didn’t have before? What can they do now that they couldn’t do before? This is a good exercise to focus your value proposition and generate talking points for business development, sales, and marketing copy.</p><p><strong>Aim for “No brainer status”</strong>: You need to aim for an instant yes. Not a yes after a hundred hours of nurturing. Think about what features, benefits, and value would make this an instant yes for your prospective customers. By the way, even if you think it’s an instant yes, you’ll still need to work at getting the yes. <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/everything-takes-longer-than-you-think-so-plan-accordingly" target="_blank">Everything takes longer than you think</a>. The reason to aim for a no brainer status is because this is like a rubber band. We’re stretching it, but it will snap back a bit.</p><p><strong>Do what makes their eyes light up (ELU)</strong>: You should have your pitch ready, but <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/eyes-light-up-elu" target="_blank">watch out for what makes people’s eyes light up</a>. What makes them lean in? You can tell when someone doesn’t really care about what you’re saying. Then there are moments when suddenly a spark of aliveness flashes in their eyes because you just said something they care about. Watch for ELU.</p><p><strong>Avoid backstory scope creep</strong>: This applies to showing your value via email, pitches, or conversations. Remove the 90% of stuff that’s only moderately relevant, and be ruthlessly focused on the 10% that’s most relevant to your audience. Talking about your camping trip? <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/start-right-before-you-get-eaten-by-the-bear" target="_blank">Start right before you almost get eaten by a bear</a>. Not a detailed agenda of the days leading up to arriving at camp.</p><p><strong>Consider overhauling and starting from scratch</strong>: If you’re struggling to describe your value, figure out <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-fix-limbo-copywriting" target="_blank">if the problem is the marketing or the underlying idea</a>.</p><p><strong>Focus on what your customer wants to hear about, not what you want to talk about</strong>: This is an easy way to figure out what to trim from your talking points. You think, “I have so much to talk about. Where do I start??” Start by asking yourself what would change your audience’s behavior for the better. I call this principle <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/strategy-not-self-expression" target="_blank">Strategy, Not Self-Expression</a>.</p><p><strong>Choose the right heuristics and design to appeal to people like us</strong>: Upon landing on a site, most customers are judging you within a few seconds. “People like us” refers to whatever group you might identify with. For example, people like us could be thoughtful, design-conscious knowledge workers at tech startups.</p><p>What’s a product that instantly sold you? I’m curious and would love to know…</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/FictionalFlag.jpg">Did you ever want to live in your own country, to make your own rules? Tired of adjusting yourself to other people?&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>One solution is to buy a decommissioned cargo ship, and then strand it on a very shallow part of the sea, on international waters. You need really deep pockets and an adventurous spirit to succeed with this, but what an exciting adventure it would be!</p>
                    
                    <h2>Finding a ship</h2>
                    <p>The ship has to be large enough to become a small island where you can live permanently, and sustain yourself through growing of food. It also has to be large enough to not get turned over in a storm. This leaves us with large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker" target="_blank">oil tankers</a>. They are flat bottomed, and have several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_the_oil_tanker" target="_blank">compartments</a> for the cargo which will make them more stable in rough seas.</p>
                    <p>To know the price of decommissioned ships we can look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_breaking" target="_blank">ship breaking yards</a>. In <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@22.4365831,91.7317171,15z" target="_blank">Chittagong, Bangladesh</a>, there is one of the biggest ship grave yards in the world, where they run the ships full speed onto the shore, and the locals are busy cutting them up into pieces and selling it as scrap metal.</p>
                    <p><i>Below: The coastline of Chittagong is lined with ships.</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ChittagongShipGraveyard.jpg"></p>
                    <p><i>Below: Zooming in you can see how the ships are being cut to pieces.</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ChittagongShipGraveyard2.jpg"></p>
                    <p>The scrap metal companies buy a medium size ship for around <a href="http://www.jimbojack.com/Countries/Bangladesh/Bangladesh_Chittagong_Ship-breaking_Yards.htm" target="_blank">$10 million</a>. Add to that the cost of sailing the ship to its final destination.</p>
                    <p>What remains is to contact shipping companies, and add yourself to the wait list of one of their vessels.</p>
                    <h2>Destination</h2>
                    <p>The challenge is to find a part of the ocean that is very shallow, but on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea" target="_blank">international waters</a>, which is 22 km (12 nautical miles) from the shoreline. To be safe, it should also be out of each country's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone" target="_blank">exclusive economic zone</a>, which is 370 km from the shoreline.</p>
                    <p><i>Below: Waters (light blue) outside of any country's exclusive economic zone (dark blue).</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ExclusiveEconomicZones.jpg"></p>
                    <p>If possible it should be in a climate that makes farming easy, in a part of the world not afflicted by piracy, and in relatively calm waters.</p>
                    <p>How shallow does the ocean have to be? The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(hull)" target="_blank">draft</a> of a reasonably large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panamax" target="_blank">Panamax</a> class tanker is 10 to 15 m.</p>
                    <p>To find the shallow parts of the oceans, we can use <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/" target="_blank">Google Earth</a>&nbsp;to visualize data about seamounts (mountains in the oceans) from <a href="http://www.seaaroundus.org/" target="_blank">SeaAroundUs.org</a>, and then match this with the EEZ areas, as a user has done at the <a href="http://www.seasteading.org/forum-list/topic/natural-breakwaters-avoiding-waves-geography/" target="_blank">Seasteading.org</a> web site.</p>
                    <p>I have saved the data files here for future reference: <a href="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ExclusiveEconomicZones.kmz">ExclusiveEconomicZones.kmz</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/SeamountsUnder100m.kmz">SeamountsUnder100m.kmz</a>.</p>

                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/SeasteadingSites2.jpg"></p>
                    <p>The Vitoria-Trinidade site looks like the easiest and safest option, and also the least afflicted by storms.</p>
                    <p>The ship could possibly be sailed slowly into position, and then sunken to rest on the ocean floor, by initially filling the tanks with water, and then replacing it with rocks sourced from the bottom.</p>
                    <p>But this requires the ocean floor to be reasonably flat, which might prove difficult, so a more realistic approach would be to anchor the ship using several huge anchors and long chains, and then filling up the bottom of the ship with ballast to make the ship behave well in storms.</p>
                    <p>On top of the deck you fill up with soil and plant trees and have various types food production. A Panamax ship has a deck of around 280 x 30 m, which is 8,400 m2, or the size of a soccer field.</p>
                    <p>Fresh water is made by desalination of sea water. Solar panels provide electricity. For housing the existing bunks of the ship is used.</p>
                    <p>Some obvious considerations include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Protection from intruders.</li>
                        <li>Having sustainable food production.</li>
                        <li>Protection from storms and high waves.</li>
                        <li>Hull maintenance, to save it from deteriorating in the saline water.</li>
                        <li>Carefully examining the site to look for geological problems (under water volcanoes, active fractures, etc).</li>
                    </ul>

<p>The War on Drugs is a massive failure. As neuroscientist and Columbia University Professor Dr. Carl Hart writes in his latest book, <em>Drug Use for Grown-Ups: Chasing Liberty in the Land of Fear</em>, “the American taxpayer spends approximately $35 billion each year fighting this war, yet the drugs in question remain as plentiful, if not more so, than they were in 1981, when the sum total of America’s annual drug-control budget was a mere $1.5 billion.” The difference now, Hart describes, is that today, tens of thousands of people are dying from drug-related overdoses—with opioids being the “primary culprit.” But it’s not that simple, when the “opioid crisis” in particular is, in reality, “a crisis of data collection and reporting.” In this account, Hart digs below the surface to re-evaluate the American relationship to drugs, while shedding light on his own personal relationship to drugs, as well. Both captivating and controversial, we caught up with Dr. Hart to talk about drugs and parenting, policy, addiction, and more.&nbsp;</p>

What’s one thing you really want readers to glean from it?&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>CH: The thesis of the book is very simple: It’s about liberty so long as you don’t disrupt other people’s ability to pursue their liberty. I want people to understand that liberty and the pursuit of happiness are protected in our founding document. It’s the core of being American.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h-in-the-book-you-re-very-open-about-your-own-drug-use-what-s-that-like-coming-out-of-the-drug-closet-as-a-professional-and-as-a-parent"><span id="In_the_book_youre_very_open_about_your_own_drug_use_Whats_that_like_coming_out_of_the_drug_closet_as_a_professional_and_as_a_parent"><strong>In the book, you’re very open about your own drug use. What’s that like, coming out of the drug closet, as a professional and as a parent?</strong></span></h2>
<p>That’s a big question I have to face and I still struggle with it. The most important point for me is that I live like the man that I claim to be, and that means that I have to think about how my children see me. They know that I take care of my responsibilities with them and that I care about our broader community. They see people suffering, being vilified, and persecuted for being labeled a drug user—and they know their father is standing up on behalf of those people, who have been cast away in society, and they feel good about it. As long as they feel good, I feel good. My primary concern is my family, and my children in particular.&nbsp;</p>

I think before he thought I would remember, my dad would sometimes smoke “herb” in front of me before I was old enough to register the observation. How do you handle this with your own kids?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>

<p>My drug use is still personal and private. It’s like asking, “have your children seen you have sex?” I’m 54 years old, I’m not a child, and so I engage in grown-up behaviors in which my children will not observe me. I don’t observe them doing certain things, either. I only care about them being safe and taking care of themselves.</p>

At the same time, it’s a good opportunity to model a responsible, healthy relationship to drugs (be it heroin, cannabis, or even alcohol). How do you reconcile this with the query from those who might bring up the argument that trying drugs, like heroin, will automatically lead to addiction?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>There’s a lot in that question, so let’s unpack the first major point: How do you model responsible drug behavior? First of all, I don’t think of drug-taking behavior as abhorrent or unique. It’s just behavior. How do you model behavior? Well, what do responsible people do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>They keep their appointments, they make their obligations. And with drugs, you set aside time for that activity, and you know how long it takes for you to engage in that activity, and once it’s over, you carry out the other responsibilities you have. It’s not different from any other behavior—this is the big lie that’s so hard to undo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this notion that one hit and you’ll become addicted is nonsense: That point is always overstated. If a person is already irresponsible, then if they take heroin, they might also be irresponsible with their heroin use. How responsible a person is will tell how well they handle those other behaviors; it predicts how well they will do heroin or pay their bills. So their drug behavior, whether heroin or cannabis, is not unique from other behaviors.</p>

<h2 id="h-so-when-we-talk-about-drug-legalization-and-people-ask-what-about-the-addicts-what-do-you-say"><span id="So_when_we_talk_about_drug_legalization_and_people_ask-what_about_the_addicts-what_do_you_say">So when we talk about drug legalization and people ask—”what about the addicts?”—what do you say?</span></h2>

<p>In the U.S. and around the world, when we think about addiction, people tend to blame the drug—the substance, itself—for causing addiction, and that’s a limited and inaccurate approach. The majority of people who use any drug are not addicted: That tells you that you have to look beyond the drug with people who meet criteria for addiction. You’ll find that people who already have psychiatric disorders, or limited economic opportunities, are more likely to have the criteria for drug addiction. It’s not the drug that you have to focus on, but those other factors, regardless of whether they’re using the drug or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of the problem with the drug discussion is that addition has hijacked the conversation, such that we only talk about drug addiction when talking about drug use. It’s like only talking about car crashes when we talk about automobiles. It’s ridiculous. So we have to change that, and that’s what I’m trying to do. If when we talk about drug use and we gave addiction proportional treatment of the topic, it wouldn’t be talked about that often. It’s a concern, but the reason people are addicted is not because of the drug.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When we think about the addiction narrative, the reason many of these substances are prohibited is American racism. One of the primary motivating factors behind alcohol prohibition was dislike of the Germans; remember this was around the time of World War I. When we think about cocaine, to vilify it, its negative effects were associated with Black people. When we wanted to vilify opioids, we paired it with the Chinese. All of this media hysteria was inaccurate—lies and misinformation. By connecting horrible acts with those groups and the drugs they used, the media reports and politicians gained standing. They oftentimes used white women as the object of their protections, so they were protecting white women and children from being corrupted with these drugs. Once they were corrupted, they would intermingle with those other racial groups—so they really tied the potential for addiction with these drugs, hoping to make people fearful of taking them in their quest to protect primarily white women. That’s how we have this connection.</p>

And how do we define drug abuse, versus drug use, to begin with?</span></h2>
<p>We define it as when people have certain symptoms in which they have disruptions in their functioning: They may not be meeting their occupational obligations, their family obligations, or other obligations. They may be actively trying to quit and having a hard time. They may experience some negative effects from their drug use, whether physiological or social, and they are disturbed by all these symptoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They, themselves, must be disturbed by these symptoms. Such as, you may engage in behavior and your significant other may not like it, but you may not be troubled by the behavior or it may not actually be a problem. So the person, themself, must be distressed by these symptoms, too. The person’s own perspective is important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our country, each of us are guaranteed life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We often think about those rights as guarantees in jingoistic terms, as opposed to unpacking how serious and noble those ideas are, and so I’m trying to remind people that everyone has those unalienable rights. That means they can’t be taken away from them, as long as they don’t disrupt other people’s ability to pursue their rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I had a relative who had a drug problem, I’d be hard pressed to find a place in the U.S. where I would send them—in large part because, too often, those places focus their energies on the drug itself, as opposed to those other psychosocial factors, such as whether that person has housing, health care, or gainful employment (that is, employment that would be appropriate for their age, education, ability to support a family, all those things). Does the person have other psychiatric illnesses or problems going on? All those factors are far more important than the drug itself. And too often the drug rehab centers focus on the drug itself and miss the boat.</p>

<p>For one, why are we missing the boat when we talk about opioids? We are getting it wrong because there is money in getting it wrong. There are grants now to deal with the so-called opioid crisis. This is an economic strategy, as opposed to making sure people have gainful employment. Police organizations get grants. NGOs get grants to deal with opioids. Coroners, medical examiners, everyone is getting money to deal with it. Everything they do, they see opioids because that’s where the spotlight is shining—if you’re looking for something, you’ll find it.</p>
