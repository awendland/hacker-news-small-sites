		A running tally of how the pandemic has been increasing inequity at a fantastic rate.	</p><div>
		
<p><strong>By Chuck Collins</strong> /<a href="https://inequality.org/great-divide/updates-billionaire-pandemic/"> Inequality.org</a></p>



<p>The collective wealth of all U.S. billionaires has increased over $1.1 trillion since mid-March 2020, a nearly 40% leap during the past 10 months of national emergency. This wealth windfall could pay for all the relief for working families contained in the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-to-propose-1-9-trillion-covid-19-package-11610661977" target="_blank">$1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package</a>&nbsp;proposed by President Biden, while leaving the nation’s richest households no worse off than they were before COVID-19 hit.</p>



<p>The combined fortune of the nation’s 660 billionaires as of Monday, January 18, 2021 was $4.1 trillion, up 38.6% from their collective net worth of just under $3 trillion on March 18, 2020, the rough start of the pandemic, based on&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;data compiled in&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LGeUxuE-Z2OyNKu54JQIffS1v588iUvV6yd6D2vH6Vc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this report&nbsp;</a>by the Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF) and the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS). There have been 46 newly minted billionaires since the beginning of the pandemic, when&nbsp;<a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/issue/tale-two-crises-billionaires-gain-workers-feel-pandemic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there were 614</a>.</p>



<p>At $4.1 trillion, the total wealth of America’s 660 billionaires is two-thirds higher than the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$2.4 trillion in total wealth</a>&nbsp;held by the bottom half of the population,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.census.gov/popclock/embed.php?component=counter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">165 million Americans</a>.</p>



<p>March 18 is used as the unofficial beginning of the pandemic because by then most<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/states-coronavirus-fema/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;federal</a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/what-states-have-declared-coronavirus-emergencies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;state</a>&nbsp;economic restrictions responding to the virus were in place. Moreover, March 18 was also the publication date of Forbes’ annual billionaires report in 2020. It provided a detailed baseline that ATF and IPS have been comparing periodically with real-time data from the&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;website. This methodology has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/12/joe-biden/biden-says-billionaires-gained-800-billion-study-l/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorably reviewed by PolitiFact</a>.</p>



<p><strong>The $1.1 trillion wealth gain by 660 U.S. billionaires since March 2020 could pay for:</strong></p>



<ul><li>All of the relief for working families contained in President Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package, which includes $1,400 in direct payments to individuals, $400-a-week supplements to unemployment benefits, and an expanded child tax credit. (See table below)</li><li>A stimulus check of more than $3,400 for every one of the roughly&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.census.gov/popclock/embed.php?component=counter" target="_blank">331 million people in the United States</a>. A family of four would receive over $13,000.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/530913-gop-senator-blocks-bill-for-12k-stimulus-checks-for-second-time" target="_blank">Republicans in Congress resisted</a>&nbsp;sending families stimulus checks most of last year, claiming we couldn’t afford them.</li></ul>

<p>Because of long-standing racial and gender disparities,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/11/16/new-but-narrow-job-pathways-for-americas-unemployed-and-low-wage-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low-wage workers</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/23/914427907/as-pandemic-deaths-add-up-racial-disparities-persist-and-in-some-cases-worsen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people of color</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/09/covid-19-gender-inequality-jobs-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">women</a>&nbsp;have suffered disproportionately in the combined medical and economic crises of 2020. Latinos are more likely to&nbsp;<a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become infected with Covid-19</a>&nbsp;and Blacks to die from the disease than are white people. Billionaires are overwhelmingly white men.</p>



<p>The stock market surge and lock-down economy have been a boon to tech monopolies and helped create multiple U.S. “centi-billionaires.” Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates were each worth more than $100 billion on Jan. 18. Prior to this year, Bezos had been the only U.S. centi-billionaire, reaching that peak in 2018. Bezos and other billionaires have seen particularly astonishing increases in wealth over the past 10 months:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Elon Musk’s</strong>&nbsp;wealth grew by over $154 billion, from $24.6 billion on March 18 to $179.2 billion on Jan. 18, a nearly eight-fold increase, boosted by his&nbsp;<strong>Tesla</strong>&nbsp;The boost in wealth of the SpaceX founder over the past 10 months is more than twice that of any other billionaire. That $154 billion growth in wealth is also about seven times NASA’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/nasas-fy-2020-budget#:~:text=NASA%27s%20budget%20in%20fiscal%20year%20%28FY%29%202020%20is,by%20a%20supplemental%20budget%20request%20on%2013%20May." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$22.6 billion budget in FY2020</a>, the federal agency Musk has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/26/spacex-how-elon-musk-took-idea-cusp-history/5257977002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credited with saving his company</a>&nbsp;with a big federal contract when the firm’s rockets were failing and it faced bankruptcy.</li><li><strong>Jeff Bezos’s&nbsp;</strong>wealth grew from $113 billion on March 18 to $182 billion, an increase of 61%. Adding in his ex-wife MacKenzie Scott’s wealth of $55 billion on Jan. 18, the two had a combined wealth of almost a quarter of a trillion dollars thanks to their&nbsp;<strong>Amazon</strong>&nbsp;If Bezos’s $68.6 billion growth in wealth was distributed to all his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/pushed-by-pandemic-amazon-goes-on-a-hiring-spree-without-equal.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">810,000 U.S. employees</a>, each would get a windfall bonus of almost $85,000 and Bezos would not be any “poorer” than he was 10 months ago.</li><li><strong>Mark Zuckerberg’s&nbsp;</strong>wealth grew from $54.7 billion on March 18 to $92 billion, an increase of over two-thirds fueled by his&nbsp;<strong>Facebook</strong></li></ul>



<p>Tax reform that ensures the wealthy pay their fair share—the principle&nbsp;<a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/issue/joe-bidens-tax-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Biden tax plan</a>&nbsp;is built on—would transform a good chunk of those huge billionaire gains into public revenue to help heal a hurting nation. But getting at that big boost in billionaire fortunes is not as simple as raising tax rates: tax rules let the rich delay, diminish and even ultimately avoid any tax on the growth in their wealth. What’s needed is structural change to how wealth is taxed.</p>



<p>The most direct approach is an annual wealth tax on the biggest fortunes, proposed by Senators&nbsp;<a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Warren</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bernie Sanders</a>, among others. Another option is the annual taxation of investment gains on stocks and other tradable assets, an idea advanced by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/wyden-unveils-proposal-to-fix-broken-tax-code-equalize-treatment-of-wages-and-wealth-protect-social-security-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Senate Finance Committee chair, Ron Wyden</a>. Even under the current discounted tax rates for investment income, if Wyden’s plan had been in effect in 2020, America’s billionaires would be paying hundreds of billions of dollars in extra taxes this spring thanks to their gargantuan pandemic profits last year.</p>

<h4><strong>December 9, 2020 Update</strong></h4>



<p>According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qLbVmE3QyBh06GFFYkUv7eEWvz8DInZam4dx5vyLtT8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report</a>&nbsp;by the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) and Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF), the collective wealth of America’s 651 billionaires has jumped by over $1 trillion since roughly the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to a total of $4 trillion at market close on Monday, December 7, 2020. Combined, just the top 10 billionaires are now worth more than $1 trillion.</p>



<p>Their wealth growth since March is more than the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/12/03/what-is-in-congressional-bailout-deal-stimulus-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$908 billion in pandemic relief</a>&nbsp;proposed by a bipartisan group of members of Congress, which is likely to be the package that moves forward for a vote in the next week, but has been stalled over Republican concerns that it is too costly.</p>



<p>The total net worth of the nation’s 651 billionaires rose from $2.95 trillion on March 18—the rough start of the pandemic shutdowns—to $4.01 trillion on Dec. 7, a leap of 36%, based on an analysis of&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;magazines research on billionaires. By around March 18 most&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/states-coronavirus-fema/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">federal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/what-states-have-declared-coronavirus-emergencies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">state</a>&nbsp;economic restrictions in response to the virus were in place.</p>



<p>Forbes’ annual global billionaires report was published March 18, and ATF and IPS collected the real-time data on Dec. 7 from the&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;website. The methodology of this analysis has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/12/joe-biden/biden-says-billionaires-gained-800-billion-study-l/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorably reviewed by PolitiFact</a>. The ATF-IPS analysis also looks at wealth growth since February 2019—the date of Forbes’ immediately previous annual billionaires report published well before the start of the pandemic and resulting market gyrations.</p>



<p><strong>The $1 trillion wealth gain by 651 U.S. billionaires since mid-March is:</strong></p>



<ul><li>More than it would cost to send a stimulus check of $3,000 to every one of the roughly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.census.gov/popclock/embed.php?component=counter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">330 million people in America</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="background"><a href="#background">→</a>Background</h2><p>I recently got the chance to completely reset my Windows 10 machine, and took advantage of the
opportunity to create a dev environment I would love. These were my high-level goals:</p><ul><li>Make WSL my primary dev environment</li><li>Use VSCode as my primary editor</li><li>Have a beautiful terminal</li></ul><h2 id="wsl-%26-vscode"><a href="#wsl-%26-vscode">→</a>WSL &amp; VSCode</h2><p>To achieve this, I started by installing WSL 2. I went with an Ubuntu distro because that's what
I've had the most experience with in the past. You can find instructions on installing WSL and/or
upgrading it to WSL 2 in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">official
docs</a>.</p><p>Next I installed <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>, and the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack">Remote Development extension
pack</a>
which is where things start to get fun. With this extension pack installed, you can edit files in
the WSL filesystem seamlessly with VSCode.</p><h2 id="windows-terminal"><a href="#windows-terminal">→</a>Windows Terminal</h2><p>To get my beautiful terminal going, I installed <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-1-0/">Windows
Terminal</a> (WT), which is an
awesome new terminal experience for Windows from Microsoft.</p><p>Although I wanted WSL to be my primary dev environment, I still wanted working in Windows to be a
nice experience as well, so I wanted to make sure my PowerShell terminal was great too. To get that
going, I also installed the latest <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/announcing-powershell-7-0/">PowerShell
7</a>.</p><p>Now it was time to setup my WT profiles. By default, WT creates a profile for WSL, PowerShell, cmd,
and Azure Cloud Shell. I'm not interested in using cmd or Azure Cloud Shell, and I'm going to be
using PowerShell 7 instead of PowerShell, so I disabled all but the WSL shell. To do this, simply
add the <code>"hidden": true</code> property to the profiles in the WT settings file (click the dropdown in the
header bar and then Settings or <span><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd></span>).</p><h3 id="powershell-wt-profile"><a href="#powershell-wt-profile">→</a>PowerShell WT Profile</h3><p>Now to create my PowerShell 7 profile, I added the following object to the profiles array:</p><pre data-language="json" data-index="0"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"guid"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>{346d54ee-6282-41c7-846a-0a2fa38ff66b}</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"name"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>PowerShell</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"commandline"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>pwsh.exe</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"icon"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>%SystemRoot%</span><span>\\</span><span>Installer</span><span>\\</span><span>{8B844F39-E6EE-486B-BE85-96A485AE2B96}</span><span>\\</span><span>PowerShellExe.ico</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"startingDirectory"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>D:</span><span>\\</span><span>code</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>A few things to note:</p><ul><li>To generate a GUID, you can use the <a href="https://www.guidgenerator.com/online-guid-generator.aspx">Online GUID
Generator</a> website</li><li>I am using the <code>pwsh.exe</code> command instead of <code>powershell.exe</code> to use PowerShell 7</li><li>Follow these steps to find the icon path on your system:<ol><li>Open your Start menu and search for PowerShell 7</li><li>Right click on the app and click "Open file location"</li><li>In the file explorer that opens, right click the shortcut and click "Properties"</li><li>On the "Shortcut" tab, click the "Change Icon..." button and copy the file path</li></ol></li><li>I like to set the starting directory to be where I keep all my projects, and ideally this is near
the root of a drive to keep file paths as short as possible</li></ul><h3 id="ubuntu-wt-profile"><a href="#ubuntu-wt-profile">→</a>Ubuntu WT Profile</h3><p>Since I want to make WSL my primary environment, I moved its profile object to the top of the list
so that it will appear first in the new tab dropdown. Then I replaced the top-level <code>defaultProfile</code>
property with the WSL profile's <code>guid</code> property to make it the profile that is opened automatically
when WT launches.</p><p>Similarly to PowerShell, I wanted the starting directory to be <code>~/code</code>. If you try setting that
directly in the WT configuration, you'll find it doesn't work because WT doesn't know how to resolve
it. You can use an absolute path to get there instead, and you need to use a Windows file path that
WT can understand. You can access a WSL distro's file system from Windows using <code>\\wsl$\&lt;distro&gt;</code>, so, I added this property to the Ubuntu profile object: <code>"startingDirectory": "\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\blake\\code"</code> (where <code>Ubuntu</code> should be replaced with the name of your WSL
distro and <code>blake</code> with your WSL username).</p><h3 id="wt-theme"><a href="#wt-theme">→</a>WT Theme</h3><p>Finally, I wanted to get a new theme for my WT. I decided I would like to use the same colour scheme
as I was using for VSCode at the time, which was the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl">Night
Owl</a> theme. So (naturally), <a href="https://chimerical.ca/posts/generate-windows-terminal-scheme">I
created</a> a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blake-mealey.generate-wt-scheme">VSCode
plugin</a> to
automatically generate a WT theme.</p><p>Here's what my terminal looks like with the Night Owl theme:</p><p><span>

  <img alt="Windows Terminal with Night Owl" title="Windows Terminal with Night Owl" src="https://chimerical.ca/static/20a8faf4783f0c30ece0bcfc207c1fed/00d43/terminal.png" srcset="https://chimerical.ca/static/20a8faf4783f0c30ece0bcfc207c1fed/63868/terminal.png 250w,https://chimerical.ca/static/20a8faf4783f0c30ece0bcfc207c1fed/0b533/terminal.png 500w,https://chimerical.ca/static/20a8faf4783f0c30ece0bcfc207c1fed/00d43/terminal.png 1000w,https://chimerical.ca/static/20a8faf4783f0c30ece0bcfc207c1fed/1628f/terminal.png 1232w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" loading="lazy">
  </a>
    </span></p><h2 id="shell-profiles"><a href="#shell-profiles">→</a>Shell Profiles</h2><p>Next up I wanted to get my shell profiles started. We'll iterate on these more later on. Your shell
profile is a script that gets run when the terminal starts which can be used to configure the
current environment. For PowerShell, this will be a PowerShell script and for WSL it will be a bash
script.</p><h3 id="powershell-profile"><a href="#powershell-profile">→</a>PowerShell Profile</h3><p>Let's start with PowerShell again. You can run <code>echo $PROFILE</code> to see if a profile script already
exists. For me it did, and it was located at
<code>C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</code>. If it doesn't exist for you,
it's not a big deal. It seems that PowerShell looks in a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/understanding-the-six-powershell-profiles/">variety of
places</a> and you
can just create a script in the appropriate place and it should work. Here's what I added to my
profile script:</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="1"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name editor </span><span>-</span><span>Value nano</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name edit </span><span>-</span><span>Value editor</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>profile_alias</span><span> { editor $PROFILE }</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name profile </span><span>-</span><span>Value profile_alias</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>reload_alias</span><span> { </span><span>&amp;</span><span> $PROFILE }</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name reload </span><span>-</span><span>Value reload_alias</span></span></code></pre><p>Let's break this down a bit. First of all, I am creating a couple aliases (<code>editor</code> and <code>edit</code>) for
my in-terminal editor. I prefer to use a terminal editor instead of a GUI editor because it reduces
context switching when working in the terminal, and is much faster to load the file to make a quick
edit. That said, if you wanted to use VSCode, you could replace <code>nano</code> with <code>code</code>.</p><p>The reason I create an alias for my editor command is so that I can change the editor at any time
and not have to change my muscle memory to use the new command. It also means I can create more
aliases that open the editor without having to change all of them if I change my editor.</p><p>Next, I add the <code>profile</code> alias which opens the profile script in my editor (the <code>editor</code> alias is
already coming in handy!). This is great because now I don't need to remember where my profile is
ever again, I can just run <code>profile</code> and can start editing it right away. I also add a <code>reload</code>
alias which simply reloads the shell using the profile script. This lets me use my changes to the
profile script without having to create a new terminal instance.</p><h3 id="bash-profile"><a href="#bash-profile">→</a>Bash Profile</h3><p>Now let's do the same thing for bash. In bash, the profile is a bash script located at <code>~/.bashrc</code>.
By default it contains a lot of stuff already, so I like to add my changes to the bottom of the
script. Here's what I added:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="2"><code><span><span>#</span><span> ~/.bashrc</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> EDITOR=</span><span>"</span><span>nano</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> editor=</span><span>"</span><span>$EDITOR</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> edit=</span><span>"</span><span>editor</span><span>"</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> PROFILE=</span><span>"</span><span>~/.bashrc</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> profile=</span><span>"</span><span>editor </span><span>$PROFILE</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> reload=</span><span>"</span><span>source </span><span>$PROFILE</span><span>"</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> explorer=</span><span>"</span><span>explorer.exe</span><span>"</span></span></code></pre><p>This is very similar to the PowerShell script. First, we create an <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable.
Some Linux programs respect the <code>EDITOR</code> variable, so it's a good idea to set it if you want more
programs to know which editor you want to use. Then we use <code>EDITOR</code> to create our <code>editor</code> and
<code>edit</code> aliases just like before.</p><p>Then, I add the same <code>profile</code> and <code>reload</code> aliases to edit and reload the profile script.</p><p>Finally, I added another alias which maps <code>explorer</code> to <code>explorer.exe</code> which makes it the same
command for opening the Windows File Explorer in WSL as in PowerShell.</p><h2 id="terminal-editor"><a href="#terminal-editor">→</a>Terminal Editor</h2><p>Let's revisit our terminal editor. I started with nano because it's a pretty intuitive and easy to
use editor for terminals. I don't have a lot of terminal editor experience, so I'm not very handy
with Vim, and even nano can be a bit awkward to use.</p><p>So, I did a bit of research to see if there were any editors that had more similar keyboard
shortcuts and navigation to a modern GUI text editor, like VSCode. I found
<a href="https://micro-editor.github.io/">micro</a> which is available cross-platform, which is perfect!</p><h3 id="powershell-editor"><a href="#powershell-editor">→</a>PowerShell Editor</h3><p>Let's install it. In PowerShell, it's most easily installed via <a href="https://scoop.sh/">scoop</a> or
<a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a>. If you don't have either installed yet I'd highly recommend
you do, as it makes installing programs in Windows a much easier experience. I'm going to use scoop
for the purposes of this guide. With scoop installed, simply run <code>scoop install micro</code>. Now you can
run <code>micro</code> to edit your files.</p><p>Let's update our profile script to use it:</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="3"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name editor </span><span>-</span><span>Value micro</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="ubuntu-editor"><a href="#ubuntu-editor">→</a>Ubuntu Editor</h3><p>To install on Ubuntu, we can run the install script from the micro website:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="4"><code><span><span>curl https://getmic.ro </span><span>|</span><span> bash</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we can update our bash profile to use it:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="5"><code><span><span>#</span><span> ~/.bashrc</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> EDITOR=</span><span>"</span><span>micro</span><span>"</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="micro-theme"><a href="#micro-theme">→</a>Micro Theme</h3><p>One issue you might notice once you start editing in micro is that it's theme clashes with your WT
theme. One option could be to port your WT theme to micro, but this is quite a bit of work. I found
using the built-in <code>simple</code> theme uses your terminal theme's background colour and seems to fit
quite well for me.</p><p>To do this, you'll have to configure micro for PowerShell and WSL separately. To configure it, open
micro, press <span><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd></span> to open the command prompt, then enter the command <code>set colorscheme simple</code>.</p><h2 id="terminal-prompt"><a href="#terminal-prompt">→</a>Terminal Prompt</h2><p>Finally, to make our terminal really pretty, we need to customize the prompt. There's lots of
options out there for this, but the most popular one seems to be
<a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">ohmyzsh</a> for Bash and
<a href="https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh">oh-my-posh</a> for PowerShell. I'm not a huge fan of
these because in my experience they slow down the terminal to a point which makes me frustrated to
use them, and since they are separate solutions for each environment they must be configured separately.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://starship.rs/">Starship</a>, a "blazing-fast," cross-platform alternative with a
delightfully simple prompt and some awesome customization (with the promise of even more coming in
future releases). Since WSL and PowerShell both have access to the Windows filesystem, we can even
store the Starship configuration in a central place and have both pull from it.</p><h3 id="powershell-starship"><a href="#powershell-starship">→</a>PowerShell Starship</h3><p>To install Starship for PowerShell, we can again use scoop: <code>scoop install starship</code>. To load
starship, we again need to edit our profile (now with our snazzy editor and single-command alias):</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="6"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Invoke-Expression</span><span> (</span><span>&amp;</span><span>starship init powershell)</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we can run our <code>reload</code> alias and see the beautiful prompt immediately.</p><h3 id="bash-starship"><a href="#bash-starship">→</a>Bash Starship</h3><p>Installing Starship for …</p></div></div>

No need for a storefront.</p><p>I built Gumroad the weekend I thought up the idea, and launched it early Monday morning on Hacker News. The reaction exceeded my grandest aspirations. Over 52,000 people checked it out on the first day.</p><p>Later that year, I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest — before I vested any of my stock — to turn Gumroad into what I thought would become my life’s work.</p><p>Almost immediately, I raised $1.1M from an all-star cast of angel investors and venture capital firms, including Max Levchin, Chris Sacca, Ron Conway, Naval Ravikant, Collaborative Fund, Accel Partners, and First Round Capital. A few months later, in May 2012, we raised $7M more. Mike Abbott from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB), a top-tier VC firm, led the round.</p><p>I was on top of the world. I was just 19, a solo founder, with over $8M in the bank and three employees. The world was starting to take note.</p><p>We grew the team. We stayed focused on our product. The monthly numbers started to climb. And then, at some point, they didn’t.</p><p>To keep the product alive, I laid off 75 percent of my company — including many of my best friends. It really sucked. But I told myself things would be fine: The product would continue to grow and no one far from the company would ever find out.</p><p>Then, TechCrunch got wind of the layoffs and published “Layoffs Hit Gumroad As The E-Commerce Startup Restructures.” All of a sudden, my failure was public. I spent the week ignoring my support network and answering our customers’ concerns, many of whom relied on us to power their businesses. They wanted to know if they should look for alternative products. Some of our favorite, most successful creators left. This hurt, but I don’t blame them for trying to minimize the risk in their own businesses.</p><p>So what exactly went wrong, and when?</p><h2>Failing in style</h2><p>Let’s start with the numbers. This is our monthly processed volume, until the layoffs:</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/0_z7tBf5i6wH-HbLhU.png"></p><p>It doesn’t look too bad, right? It’s going in the right direction: up.</p><p>But we were venture-funded, which was like playing a game of double-or-nothing. It’s euphoric when things are going your way — and suffocating when they’re not. And we weren’t doubling fast enough to raise the $15M+ Series B (the second major round of funding) we were looking for to grow the team.</p><p>For the type of business we were trying to build, every month of less than 20 percent growth should have been a red flag.</p><p>But at the time, I thought it was okay. We had money in the bank and product-market fit. We would continue to ship product and things would work out. The online creator movement was still nascent; the slow growth wasn’t our fault. It always looked like change was right around the corner.</p><p>But now, I realize: It doesn’t matter whose “fault” it is; we hit a peak in November 2014 and stalled. A lot of creators absolutely loved us, but there weren’t enough of them who needed our specific product offering. Product-market fit is great, but we needed to find a new, larger fit to justify raising more money (and then do it again and again, until acquisition or IPO).</p><p>In January 2015, after our final double-or-nothing hail-mary, our bank balance dipped below 18 months of runway. I told my 20-person team the road ahead would be a tough one. We didn’t have the numbers to raise a Series B, and we would have to work really hard over the next nine months to get even close. To that end, we deprioritized everything except features that would directly move the needle. Many were not core to our business, but we needed to try everything we could to get our monthly processed volume to where it needed to be.</p><p>If we succeeded, we would raise money from a top-tier VC again, hire more people, and pick up the journey where we’d left off. If we didn’t, we would have to drastically downsize the company.</p><p>In those nine months, when the whole team knew we were fighting for our company’s life, not a single person left Gumroad. From “this is gonna be hard,” to “yep, turns out it was,” every single person worked harder than ever.</p><p>We launched a “Small Product Lab” to teach new creators how to grow and sell. We shipped a ton of features, including weekly payouts, payouts to debit cards, payouts to the U.K., Australia, and Canada, various additions to our email features, product recommendations and search, analytics to see how customers are reading/watching/downloading the products they’ve purchased, and add-to-cart functionality. And that was just between August and November.</p><p>Unfortunately, we didn’t hit the numbers we needed.</p><h2>Slim down or shut down?</h2><p>Looking back, I’m glad we didn’t hit those numbers. If we’d doubled down, raised more money, and appeared in the headlines again, there would have been a very real possibility of even more spectacular failure.</p><p>With that off the table, our options were:</p><p>Shut down the business, return the remaining money to investors, and try something new.</p><p>Continue with a slimmed-down version of the company to aim for sustainability.</p><p>Position the company for an acquihire.</p><p>Some of my investors wanted me to shut down the business. They tried to convince me that my time was worth more than trying to keep a small business like Gumroad afloat, and I should try to build another billion-dollar company armed with all of my learnings — and their money.</p><p>I tended to agree with them, to be honest. But I was accountable to our creators, our employees, and our investors — in that order. We helped thousands of creators get paid, every month. About $2,500,000 was going to go into the pockets of creators — for rent checks and mortgages, for student loans and kids’ college funds. And it was only growing! Could I really just turn that faucet off?</p><p>If I sold the company, it would be mostly for our stellar team — and I would no longer be able to control the destiny of the product. There were too many acquisition stories of companies promising exciting journeys and amazing synergies to come — and ending with a deprecated product a year later.</p><p>Selling was certainly tempting. I could say I sold my first company, raise more money, and do this all again with a new idea. But that didn’t sit right with me. We were responsible to our creators first. That’s what I told every new hire and every investor. I didn’t want to become a serial entrepreneur and risk disappointing yet another customer base.</p><p>We decided to become profitable at any cost. The next year was not fun: I shrunk the company from twenty employees to five. We struggled to find a new tenant for our $25,000/month office. We focused all of our remaining resources on launching a premium service.</p><p>In June 2015, a few months before our layoffs, our financials looked like this:</p><ul><li>Revenue: $89,000 for the month</li><li>Gross profit: $17,000</li><li>Operating expenses: $364,000</li><li><strong>Net profit: -$351,000</strong></li></ul><p>A year later, in June 2016, our monthly numbers looked like this:</p><ul><li>Revenue: $176,000 for the month</li><li>Gross profit: $42,000</li><li>Operating expenses: $32,000</li><li><strong>Net profit: +$10,000</strong></li></ul><p>It hurt, but it meant creators would keep getting paid. It also meant that we were in control of our own destiny.</p><h2>From skeleton crew to lifestyle business</h2><p>It got worse from there.</p><p>Gumroad was no longer the venture-funded, fast-growing startup our investors and employees signed up for. As everyone else found other opportunities, the skeleton crew fizzled from five to one.</p><p>I was basically alone. I didn’t have a team, nor an office. And San Francisco was full of startups raising gobs of money, building amazing teams, and shipping great products. Some of my friends became billionaires. Meanwhile, I was running a “measly” lifestyle business. It wasn’t what I wanted to do, but I had to keep the ship from sinking.</p><p>Now, I understand some people would dream to be in that position. But at the time, I just felt trapped. I couldn’t stop, but there was only so much I could do as an army of one.</p><p>For years, my only metric of success was building a billion-dollar company. Now, I realize that was a terrible goal.</p><p>I shut off the rest of the world. I didn’t tell my mom about the layoffs — she had to read the article and tweets herself to find out. My friends were worried, but I assured them I was neither depressed nor suicidal. I left San Francisco for long stretches at a time, thinking that some travel would give me adequate distance. It only made me more lonely.</p><p>Every day, I woke up and took care of all of Gumroad’s support queries. I tried to fix all of the bugs I could. Often, I had to ask for help from former Gumroad engineers. They were all employed by then, but they always found time to help. Once all things Gumroad were taken care of, I tried to go to the gym, and if I had the willpower, work on a side project (a fantasy novel). Most days, I failed.</p><p>To me, happiness is about an expectation of positive change. Every year before 2016, there …</p></div></div>

<p>When most people hear Apple in a sentence, their next thought is likely the color. This is because color has always played an exciting role in Apple’s history: from the original Mac to the iMac, from the G3 to the Cube, from Bondi Blue to Snow White. The introduction of color played a vital part in these products' success as it helped create strong visual brand recognition.</p>
<p>The prominent use of color no doubt stems from Steve Jobs obsessing over the smallest details. For instance, there was a time when Steve spent 30 minutes picking the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-attention-to-detail-2011-10">perfect shade of gray for the restroom signs</a>! and another time <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-attention-to-detail-2011-10#he-insisted-on-making-the-circuit-board-inside-the-mac-look-great-2">when he insisted on making the circuit board inside the Mac look great</a>. An engineer told him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The only thing that matters is how well it works. Nobody is going to see the PC board.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jobs response was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I want it to be as beautiful as possible, even if it’s inside the box. A great carpenter isn’t going to use lousy wood for the back of a cabinet, even though nobody’s going to see it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For as long as we’ve had TVs, color has been an important metric to judge the display’s quality. We’ve witnessed technologies such as CRT, Plasma, and LCD compete to display the most life-like color. The newest technology to enter this fray is High Dynamic Range, aka HDR. The aim remains the same i.e. to recreate an image closer to that seen by the human eye. Traditionally, every video has been delivered in an 8-bit specification known as Rec. 709, displaying up to millions of shades of colors. HDR improves upon this by stepping up to 10 or 12-bit standard known as Rec. 2020 or BT.2020, representing 60 times more color combinations with smoother shade gradations aka “Billions of colors”.</p>
<p>Apple has generally been at the forefront of adopting the latest display technology. Some notable examples include - introducing high-resolution Retina Displays when 1366x768 was a very common resolution for Windows laptops, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-30-apple-imac-5k-el-capitan-billions-colors.html">Shipping 2015 Retina iMacs</a> with 10-bit displays i.e. “Billions of colors”, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/09/apple-tv-4k-brings-home-the-magic-of-cinema-with-4k-and-hdr/">Apple TV 4K, which was one of the first consumer devices to support Dolby Vision HDR in 2017</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/09/apple-tv-4k-brings-home-the-magic-of-cinema-with-4k-and-hdr/">automatic upgrades of HD titles to Dolby Vision</a> for iTunes users - a move that is still unrivaled, iPhone 12 which is the first smartphone to be able to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/10/apple-introduces-iphone-12-pro-and-iphone-12-pro-max-with-5g/">record videos in the Dolby Vision HDR format</a>. Apple also sells <a href="https://www.apple.com/pro-display-xdr/">Pro Display XDR</a>, that costs upward of ~$5000 and ticks all the right boxes for any professional doing color-accurate work.</p>
<p>Therefore, with Apple’s color pedigree, it was surprising to see that on the M1 device specification page, there is <strong>no mention of whether M1 devices can output “Billions of colors”</strong>. In contrast, the Intel-based devices clearly outline this support.</p>

<p>Even the trusty method of viewing the value in <code>"About this mac" -&gt; "System Report" -&gt; "Graphics/Displays"</code> doesn’t show anything. Usually, this would list a value of 30-bit here (<em>i.e. 10-bit per RGB channel</em>). On M1 devices, the below is what you see when connected to an HDR capable display i.e. no mention of whether the M1 Mini is outputting a 10-bit video signal.</p>

<p>For this test, I used my trusty 2017 Vizio M65-E0 TV that has a 10-bit panel. I connected the Mac Mini to my Denon AVR-X1300 receiver. The “Displays” settings on Mac OS immediately gave me an option of enabling HDR.</p>

<p>At this point, it’s clear that the Mac Mini can output an HDR10 signal when connected to an HDR capable display. Next, I explored if it can output a 10-bit signal / Billions of colors to a non-HDR 10-bit display. This was done by connecting to the Philips Brilliance P272P7VU monitor.</p>
<h3 id="10-bit-psd-test">10-bit PSD test</h3>
<p>The first test was done by displaying a 10-bit PSD file in “Preview”, which supports 10-bit files. <strong>If the M1 outputs a 10-bit signal, then the gradients in the file would be smooth.</strong> Opening the file in “Preview” confirmed the 10-bit output as the test pattern was completely smooth. I also opened the same file in another image viewer called “Pixea” and observed banding which most likely is because “Pixea” doesn’t support 10-bit files. In the image below, the same file is open in “Preview” on the left and “Pixea” on the right.</p>
<p>NOTE: <em>You might not observe the difference between the two images below as during the upload and publishing this image might get converted to 8-bit. On my machine the left image is completely smooth while the right displays banding.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the summer, I developed a couple of small, sort of silly programs.
One, <a href="https://jakemccrary.com/experiments/photo-fit/">Photo Fit</a>, is a little tool that runs in a web browser and resizes photos to fit as your phone’s background.
The other, <a href="https://default-equipment.herokuapp.com/">Default Equipment</a>, runs on Heroku and automates changing the “bike” of my Strava-tracked e-bike rides to be my <a href="https://onewheel.com/">onewheel</a>.</p>

<p>These weren’t created to solve large problems in the world.
There is no plan to make any money with them.
As of October 2020, Default Equipment doesn’t even work for other people (though it could, send me a message if you’d like to use it and I’ll get around to it).</p>

<p>Each was created to fix a minor annoyance in my life and, because these tools can live on the Internet, they can fix the same minor annoyance in other lives.</p>

<p>With an increasing amount of software in the world, being able to write software is nearly sorcery<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.
As a developer, you can identify a problem in the world and then change the world to remove that problem.
And, depending on the problem, you can remove it for everyone else.</p>

<p>Software developers aren’t alone in being able to identify problems and remove them through creation.
Carpenters can build shelves for their books.
Cooks can prepare food to remove hunger.
You can come up with nearly an infinite number of other examples.</p>

<p>The difference is that a solo developer can solve problems for an unknown number of other folks.
This is enabled by the Internet enabled ease of distribution.
This is very powerful.</p>

<p>Developers can expose their solution to others through a web application.
Desktop or mobile applications can be distributed through various app stores or made available as a download.
Source code can be made available for others to run.
Being able to distribute easily and cheaply is a game changer.</p>

<p>A developer’s change to the world might be a minor improvement.
Photo Fit might never be used by anyone besides me.
But it is still out there, making the world slightly better.
It is available for someone to stumble upon when they are also annoyed by the same problem.</p>

<p>It felt good to write these tiny, useful programs.
If you scope them small enough, there is a definitive ending point<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.
This lets you feel that finishing-a-project satisfaction quickly.
The small size also allows you experiment with new techniques and tools without committing to a large and ongoing commitment.</p>

<p>I wrote both Photo Fit and Default Equipment in TypeScript.
Before the beginning of summer, I didn’t know TypeScript and had little exposure to Node.js.
Now I have some experience with both and gained that while making small improvements to my life and potentially the lives of others.</p>

<p>If you haven’t developed software to solve a small problem recently, I’d recommend doing it.
Don’t hesitate to remove a problem that feels silly.
Removing those problems can still make your life slightly better and gives you an opportunity to learn.
It feels good to remove an annoyance from your life.
If you can, make that software available to others so their lives are improved as well.
Take advantage of the power of easy distribution to improve the world and not just your tiny slice of it.</p>

<p>When European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen talks about politics, there is never a shortage of superlatives and grandiloquence. Until recently, that was also true when she was talking about the extremely sensitive issue of vaccines.</p>


<div>
<p>In late November, von der Leyen gushed about the contracts the European Union had signed with various producers, saying it meant that Europeans would have "access to the most promising future vaccines under development" against the coronavirus. When it became clear in December that the first people in the EU would be vaccinated soon after Christmas, she even injected a bit of pathos, tweeting "It's Europe's moment." When the vaccinations then began, she wrote of a "touching moment of unity" and a "European success story."</p><p>These days, though, von der Leyen is noticeably quieter – a silence that could have to do with the fact that the erstwhile "success story" might ultimately turn out to be the greatest disaster of her entire political career.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Europe is facing a vaccine disaster. Whereas countries like Israel, Britain and the United States. are quickly moving ahead with vaccinations, the EU is reeling from a string of setbacks. First, U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech informed Brussels that it would be delivering far less vaccine than planned in the coming weeks. Then, the company AstraZeneca said it would only be delivering 31 million doses of its vaccine by the end of March instead of the 80 million Europe had been expecting. And again, the Commission was caught completely off guard.</p><p>Since then, frustration and anger has been growing across the EU. Europe, one of the most affluent regions in the world, is proving to be unable to quickly protect its citizens from a deadly disease, while other countries are showing how it is done.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>And the boss is nowhere to be found.</p><p>The louder the criticism has grown, the less has been heard from the erstwhile loquacious Commission president. She has, at times, been like the phantom of Brussels. Requests for comment from the press have been systematically blocked by her communications department and she has essentially gone into hiding. This week, though, at the World Economic Forum, she wasn't able to entirely avoid the issue. "Now, the companies must deliver," she said. In other words, the companies are to blame, not us. Not me.</p><p>It is, to put it bluntly, a pattern that has occurred frequently throughout her career.</p>
</div>

<p>Whenever von der Leyen, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDIU), has taken on a new leadership position, she has never just been the new minister. She has always acted as though she would do everything different – better – than her predecessor. It has frequently sounded as though von der Leyen planned to reinvent whatever department or ministry she had just assumed control of, making it more functional and more glamorous at the same time. But by the time it became necessary to dive into the sordid details, she had usually moved on.</p><h3>Posing as the Mother of the Nation</h3><p>When von der Leyen was appointed family minister in 2005, she introduced a generous federally funded program for parental leave and expanded daycare offerings, essentially revolutionizing her party's family-policy image in the process. But when it came to addressing the difficulties associated with opening a huge number of new daycare facilities – that was left to her successor.</p><p>When she became minister of labor and social affairs in 2009, she promised a hot lunch for every child. The result, though, was a confusing collection of regulations. "Ursula von der Leyen was excellent at posing as the mother of the nation and launching illusory programs for the poor," says Ulrich Schneider, head of the federation of German welfare associations.</p>

<p>And at the Defense Ministry? The bureau is still trying to clean up the messes that its former boss left behind.</p><p>In each instance, von der Leyen's departure was perfectly timed. Just as the time had come for evaluations, she had already climbed up to the next rung on her career ladder.</p><p>Which is why she is now faced with a real problem. First of all, there isn't really anywhere left to go from her current post in Europe's top position. And second, the pandemic has hit the fast-forward button on political developments, with the consequences of political decisions taking mere weeks to manifest themselves instead of several years. "I am absolutely stunned by how negligent Ursula von der Leyen has been in overseeing the start of vaccinations in recent months," says Lars Klingbeil, general secretary of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD).</p><p>Indeed, von der Leyen finds herself in an extremely difficult situation. The next several weeks could decide her political future.</p><p>On Tuesday of this week, she delivered a video address to the World Economic Forum, where she spoke about Donald Trump, the storming of the Capitol and the question as to whether democracy has been damaged in the last four years. She spoke about climate change, biodiversity, artificial intelligence and digitalization.</p><p>In the first several minutes of her talk, she only briefly mentioned the coronavirus pandemic, and it was fully 15 minutes before she even said the word "vaccine." Only to say things like: "We know that in a pandemic there is no time to lose."</p><h3>Bazaar Bargaining</h3><p>Initially, of course, things looked quite good on the vaccine front. Back in summer, nobody was willing to predict that the first vaccine would be approved in the EU as early as December and that vaccinations would begin. Nor that a second vaccine would quickly follow in January. Von der Leyen was also able to claim a significant success when the EU agreed on a joint vaccination strategy in June, despite the fact that the bloc's 27 member states had always defended sovereignty when it came to health care policy. For the Commission president, it represented a gain of both prestige and power. Fleetingly, at least.</p><p>The problems began soon thereafter. Negotiations with vaccine producers bogged down, and it wasn't until November that the EU was able to reach a purchase agreement with BioNTech/Pfizer and with Moderna, the manufacturers of the two most successful vaccines thus far introduced. The EU negotiating team, according to people familiar with the talks, was intent on pushing down the price. There was also allegedly an extended disagreement on liability issues, particularly with Pfizer.</p><p>While others simply acted with expedience and placed huge orders, the EU – right in the middle of the worst pandemic in a century – decided to bargain like they were at the bazaar. Von der Leyen, of course, didn't lead these negotiations personally. But she is the boss, and carries the political responsibility.</p><p>After a year of the pandemic, hundreds of millions of Europeans are tired, frustrated and desperate for an appointment to finally get vaccinated. No other issue is as important at the moment – for the economy, for society and for politics. And the time will come to assign blame for the missteps that have been made. The search for where to place that blame won't start down below among the army of EU bureaucrats. It will start at the top.</p>
</div>
<section>

</section>
<div>
<p>Given that truth, von der Leyen's press department has been energetic in its defense of the Commissions actions. After all, the EU has secured rights to 2.3 billion doses of vaccine, they have pointed out, with 760 million of them from BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna.</p><p>But what use is that when the availability of the vaccine will remain so limited for the foreseeable future? When the producers are unable to deliver what they have agreed to – or can only deliver much later?</p><p>And what, actually, is in those contracts, which have thus far remained confidential? Are the deliveries promised by the producers legally binding? Or did the Commission agree to flimsy fine print such that it has no leverage against the producers?</p><p>Thus far, only the contract with the German company Curevac has been made public. It says that the producer will make "reasonable best efforts" to deliver the agreed upon number of doses within the negotiated time frame. Pascal Soriot, the head of AstraZeneca, is now claiming the same thing. The Curevac contract also says that the producer must inform purchasers as quickly as possible of possible delays, explain the causes for those delays and present a revised timeline for delivery. That, though, is all.</p><p>Should the AstraZeneca contract contain the same language, it would be politically explosive. Tiemo Wölken, a member of European Parliament with Germany's Social Democrats, believes the contract is similar in that regard. "The wording of the delivery requirement for Curevac is supposedly similar," he says. "As such, what Soriot is saying doesn't sound implausible."</p><p>That would be a huge embarrassment for von der Leyen, but it would come as welcome news for a man who isn't yet out of the firing line himself: German Health Minister Jens Spahn. At home, Spahn has been the subject of scathing critique for the flubbed beginning of the vaccination campaign. Spahn, who just recently warned the country that "10 difficult weeks" were still to come, is now able to deflect some of the criticism to Brussels – onto the shoulders of fellow CDU member Ursula von der Leyen.</p><h3>Moving Too Slowly</h3><p>There is a history to their vaccine-related relationship. In mid-June, Spahn pushed ahead with his counterparts from France, the Netherlands and Italy, reaching an initial agreement with AstraZeneca. They planned to share the order with all EU member states. But that's not how things worked out.</p><p>Several countries intervened, the Chancellery in Berlin got involved and, in late June, Spahn and the others handed over responsibility for the negotiations to the European Commission. Thereafter, say people involved in the process, the …</p></div></div></div>

		<p>Another day, another post telling me to do something, or not do something, or adopt some technology, or not adopt some technology, or whatever it is that they want me to do, because it makes it easier to “reason about the code”.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<p>More precisely, it’s a thought-terminating cliche. Ironic, as the phrase “reason about” is used as a highfalutin synonym for “think about”. The idea is that there’s nowhere to go from here. I want to do things one way, some random on medium dot com wants me to do things another way, their way makes it easier to reason about the code, therefore that’s the better approach.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the fact that people don’t think—sorry, reason—about things the same way. If we did, then there’d be little point to things like film review sites, code style guides, or democracy. We don’t know precisely <em>what</em> influences different people to think in different ways about different things, but we have some ideas. Some of the ideas just raise other questions: like if you say “it’s a cultural difference” then we have to ask “well, why is it normal for all of the people in that culture to think this way, and all of the people in this culture to think that way?”</p>
<p>This difference between modes of thought arises in computing. We know, for example, that you can basically use any programming language for basically any purpose, because back in the days when there were intellectual giants in computering they demonstrated that all of these languages are interchangeable. They did so before we’d designed the languages. So choice of programming language is arbitrary, unless motivated by external circumstances like which vendor your CTO plays squash with or whether you are by nature populist or contrarian.</p>
<p>Such differences arise elsewhere than in choice of language. Comprehension of paradigms, for example: the Smalltalk folks noticed it was easier to teach object-oriented programming to children than to professional programmers, because the professional programmers already had mental toolkits for comprehending programming that didn’t integrate with the object model. It’s easier for them to “reason about” imperative code than objects.</p>
<p>OK, so when someone says that something makes it easier to “reason about” the code, what they mean is that <em>that person</em> find it easier to think about code in the presence of this property. I mean, assuming they <em>do</em>, and are not disingenuously proposing a suggestion that you do something when they’ve run out of reasons you should do it but still think it’d be a good idea.  But wait.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<p>Code is a particular representation of, at best, <em>yesterday’s</em> understanding of the problem you’re trying to solve. “Reasoning about code” is by necessity accidental complexity: it’s reflecting on and trying to understand a historical solution of the problem as you once thought it was. That’s effort that could better be focussed on checking whether your understanding of the problem is indeed correct, or needs updating. Or on capturing a solution to an up-to-the-minute model of the problem in executable form.</p>
<p>This points to a need for code to be <em>deletable</em> way faster than it needs to be thought about.</p>
<p>Reasoning about code is a scam.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of FPGA development boards out there, and I don’t dare to count but I must own a
considerable fraction of them. Most of these are designed deliberately for development purposes, 
but a few are not, and yet they can sometimes be a good match.</p>

<p>One board that falls in this category is the 
<a href="https://www.colorlight-led.com/product/colorlight-i5-led-display-receiver-card.html">Colorlight i5</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/colorlight_i5.jpg" alt="Colorlight i5"></p>

<p>Like other members of the Colorlight family (the <a href="https://github.com/q3k/chubby75">Colorlight 5A-75B</a> 
comes to mind), the i5 is ‘real’ product that is designed for one specific purpose: it is a 
controller for large LED video panels. And that’s a huge plus, because in FPGA land, high volume means 
low cost, usually much lower than buying individual components on Digikey or Mouser.</p>

<p>The Colorlight i5 is especially attractive because it’s a plug-in card, with a reappropriated DDR SODIMM 
connector. Even better is that nothing about this module seems to be tailored specifically for LED panels. 
Unlike the 5A-75B, there are no unidirectional 3V3 to 5V level shifters: FPGA GPIO pins are routed straight to the 
SODIMM connector and can be used any way you want: input or output, LVCMOS or LVDS or any configuration
that’s supported by the FPGA.</p>

<p>The Colorlight i5 uses a Lattice ECP5U-25, an FPGA that’s supported by the Yosys/NextPNR open source
tool flow, an extra bonus.</p>

<p>That said, there’s still a hurdle to using this board as development platform: you need a way to power it,
there are no easy usable GPIO connectors (such as PMOD connectors), and while are easily accessible
test JTAG points to program the FPGA, you still need an external JTAG programmer and solder a bunch
of wires to make things work.</p>

<p>Or…</p>

<p>you could go to the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001686186007.html">AliExpress webstore</a> of
<a href="https://www.muselab-tech.com/">Muse Lab</a> and buy their Colorlight i5 development board.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/development_board.jpg" alt="Colorlight i5 Development Board"></p>

<p>I bought their Colorlight i5 module + development board combo for $50 and gave it a try.</p>



<p><em>Skip to <a href="#from-unboxing-to-blinky">From Unboxing to Blinky</a> if you want to get your hands dirty ASAP.</em></p>

<p>Let’s first go over characterstics of the module itself:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/i5-top-annotated.jpg" alt="Colorlight i5 Top Annotated"></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Low Cost: $30 and up</p>

    <p>I’ve seen these modules for $18.50, but with a $25 shipping fee, which makes it only attractive if you’re
  buying at least 3. For $35, you can get them with free shipping on AliExpress. That’s
  still a fantastic deal for what you get.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lattice ECP5 LFE5U-25F FPGA</p>

    <p>Specifications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>24K LUTs</li>
      <li>56x sysMEM block RAMs (of 18Kb each), good for up to 126KByte of on-chip RAM</li>
      <li>194Kb of distributed RAM</li>
      <li>28x DSPs with 18x18 multiplier and 36-bit accumulator</li>
      <li>2 PLLs, 2 DLLs</li>
      <li>0 SERDES</li>
      <li>381 caBGA package</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The -25 version is one of the smaller versions in the ECP5 family, but it’s still enough
  for many applications. You can comfortably fit a VexRiscv-based Linux SOC in there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>EtronTech EM638325-6H 2M x 32bit SDRAM, 166MHz</p>

    <p>Single data rate SDRAM is ancient and slow now, but sufficient for most hobby projects. It’s also 
  easier to use because there’s usually no trickery required with complex PLL/DLL configurations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2x Broadcom B50612D 1Gb Ethernet Transceivers</p>

    <p>That’s right, not one but two. You could make your own firewall with this thing.</p>

    <p>The PHYs are using an RGMII MAC interface.</p>

    <p>The module only contains the transceivers, not the Ethernet transformers or 
  RJ45 connectors. The 2x 4 differentials pairs are routed to the SODIMM pins.</p>

    <p>GD25B16C 16Mbit Quad SPI Serial Flash</p>

    <p>According to the <a href="http://www.latticesemi.com/~/media/LatticeSemi/Documents/ApplicationNotes/EH/TN1260.pdf">Lattice ECP5 sysCONFIG Usage Guide</a>,
  the FPGA has a maximum uncompressed bitstream size of 5.42Mb. That leaves more than 11Mb or ~1.4MByte for
  user applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>25MHz Oscillator</p>

    <p>The Ethernet transceivers require a 25MHz oscillator. It also goes to the FPGA as its only external clock
  input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 LEDs</p>

    <p>A red LED seems to be connected to power and is always on, but the green LED is controlled
  by the FPGA: a strict requirement to get that blinky going!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JTAG Interface</p>

    <p>4 JTAG test points are not marked as such but they are easy to solder and accessible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3x Mystery CD4051B 8 Channel Analog Multiplexer/Demultiplexer</p>

    <p>These are only present on V7.0 of the board, not on V6.0. Its functionality hasn’t been
  reverse engineered yet, but some of the demultiplexed ports are going to the SODIMM pins.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DDR-SODIMM Connector</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>3V3 to 6V power rail</p>

        <p>There are voltage regulators on the module, but there are no pins back to
  the connector with regulated voltage.</p>
      </li>
      <li>2x 4 differential Ethernet pairs</li>
      <li>106x general purpose GPIO pins</li>
      <li>
        <p>2 mystery <code>RCV_BK1</code>/<code>RCV_BK2</code> pins</p>

        <p>These have something to do with receiver backup power. Unknown how they are connected
  on the module.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>21 mystery pins</p>

        <p>Related to the 8 channel analog multiplexers.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A heat sink</p>

    <p>Not exactly a heavy duty one, but a piece of metal that squeezes against the FPGA and
  the two Ethernet transceivers. Much better than nothing!</p>

    <p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/heatsink_removed.jpg" alt="Board and Heatsink"></p>

    <p>The heat sink is pretty easy to remove without damaging the board.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There’s a lot to work with here. What’s even better is the potential for future
upgrades: Colorlight has i6, i9, and i9+ modules with the same SODIMM pinout as the i5, but
with larger FPGAs: the i9 board has a Lattice ECP5-45. The i9+ a Xilinx Artix A50T.</p>

<p>For the i5 board, V6.0 and V7.0 are pinout compatible too, with the exception of the mystery pins.</p>



<p>As I wrote earlier, the development board can be <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001686186007.html">bought on AliExpress</a>, 
but only as a package deal: $50 for the development board and the i5 module, with free shipping.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/development_board-annotated.jpg" alt="Development Board Annotated"></p>

<p>It has the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DDR-SODIMM socket for the i5 module</li>
  <li>
    <p>1x 30-pin connector for Ethernet (purple)</p>

    <p>This connector has the 2x 4 differential Ethernet pairs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4x 30-pin connectors for generic GPIOs (yellow)</p>

    <p>Each connector has 20 GPIOs, ground, 3V3, and 5V pins. The
  pins are smartly organized so that the connector is also compatible
  with 2 side-by-side PMOD connectors.</p>

    <p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/board_with_double_PMOD.jpg" alt="Board with double PMOD"></p>

    <p>In this case, the center pins can’t be used and the number of usable GPIOs 
  per 30-pin connector drops to 16, 8 for each PMOD.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1x 30-pin mixed-use connector for generic GPIOs + special functions (orange)</p>

    <p>Just like the 4 earlier connectors, there are 20 GPIOs on this connector,
  in the same configuration, but 6 of the GPIOs have been assigned
  a special meaning: UART and SPI.</p>

    <p>The UART and SPI pins are also routed to the microcontroller to be used as
  a potential FPGA debug console, and, presumably to progam the SPI
  flash on the board.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HDMI connector - video out only</p>

    <p>This one is a surprise, since the FPGA on the module does not support
  high speed SERDES IOs. Instead, the pins are connected to generic
  IOs that can be configured as differential pairs inside the FPGA.</p>

    <p>I doubt that these IOs meet the strict electrical requirements that are
  set by the HDMI standard specification, but meeting these requirements is 
  not necessary to drive an image that can be decoded by most monitors.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the I2C, HOTPLUG and CEC pins of the HDMI connector
  are not connected. The lack of HOTPLUG makes it impossible to use
  the HDMI connector for video input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>USB C Port</p>

    <p>A USB C port is used to power the board, to program the FPGA, and to
  send FPGA UART console traffic from and to a host PC.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller (MCU)</p>

    <p>This STM32 MCU is identical to the one used on the dirt cheap and popular 
  <a href="https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F103C8T6-Blue-Pill.html">Blue Pill development boards</a>.</p>

    <p>The MCU on this development board is used as programming and debug
  interface only. On one side, it has a USB 1.1 interface to connect to a host
  PC. On the other, it controls JTAG, UART, and SPI pins to the Colorlight
  module. It also controls 2 LEDs.</p>

    <p>The user is not supposed to reflash the MCU with custom firmware, but if
  you’re so inclined, the SWD pins to do so are located underneath the
  USB connector (on the other side of the PCB.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>USB 5V -&gt; 3.3V voltage regulator</p>

    <p>An AMS1117-3.3V that’s used to convert the USB 5V to 3V3 to power the MCU and the
  3v3 pins of the PMOD ports, but NOT the Colorlight module (which is powered by USB 5V rail 
  and has its own voltage regulators.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 LEDs</p>

    <p>Not to be confused with the 2 bright LEDs on the module itself, two tiny and faint LEDs 
  are controlled by the MCU. The red LED flickers when there’s USB traffic. A blue
  LED seems to be always on and is hidden entirely underneath the module.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Power Button</p>

    <p>When pressed, this button interrupts power to Colorlight module, but not to the MCU. If you
  want to power off the MCU, you must unplug the USB cable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JTAG Pogo Pins</p>

    <p>While the i5 module has easy accessible JTAG test points, they are not connected to the SODIMM
  connector. The development board makes the connection with the test points with 4 pogo pins.
  It’s an elegant solution that removes the need for any soldering.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<p>The package arrived with the i5 module (V7.0), the development board, a USB C cable, and 6 30-pin
connectors that you need to solder yourself.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/box_contents.jpg" alt="Box Contents"></p>

<p>I’m not well qualified to judge the quality of the PCB, but it looks well made to me.</p>

<p>After inserting the 30-pin connectors into the PCB (it’s a bit of a hassle that requires
wiggling slightly bent pins in the right hole), I noticed a minor issue: my HDMI cable doesn’t fit between the 2 30-pin connectors
that surround the HDMI connector. As a result, the cable can’t be plugged in completely:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/hdmi_doesnt_fit.jpg" alt="HDMI doesn't fit"></p>

<p>You need a HDMI cable with a narrow connector to make things work, or don’t solder connectors
P2 and P3, which is what I did.</p>

<p>The box doesn’t contain any documentation, not even a leaflet with a URL. You have …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	  <p>Like many people, I’ve been entertaining myself at home by baking a ton and talking about my sourdough starter as if it were a real person. I’m pretty good at following recipes, but I decided I wanted to take things one step further and understand the science behind what differentiates a cake from a bread or a cookie. I also like machine learning so I thought: what if I could combine it with baking??!</p>

<p>I’ll start by explaining why baking presents an interesting ML problem. Then I’ll show you how I collected my own dataset, trained a simple model, deployed it, built a little app to get predictions, and used the model to invent a new recipe. If you’re only here for the recipe, I suppose you can <a href="#recipe">skip ahead</a>.</p>

<p>Are videos more your thing? Here’s me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4saaQZSmBw">speaking about</a> how I built this.</p>

<h2 id="why-would-you-use-machine-learning-for-baking">Why would you use machine learning for baking?</h2>

<p>Maybe you’re thinking, couldn’t you just read a book or even a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-free-yourself-from-recipes-with-a-few-golden-coo-1450617561" target="_blank">blog post</a> that explains the sugar, fat, and flour ratios that make up different baked goods? Sure, I could do that. But my attention span has been pretty short these days, and that approach doesn’t really scale. If I learn enough to start inventing my own recipes, that only directly benefits the people who can eat them, which is currently not many.</p>

<p>Now maybe you’re thinking, couldn’t we solve this with traditional programming? For example, if the typical flour:liquid ratio for bread is 5:3, I could write a program like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>ratio</span> <span>=</span> <span>flour_amt</span> <span>/</span> <span>water_amt</span>

<span>if</span> <span>ratio</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>1.5</span> <span>and</span> <span>ratio</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"It's bread!"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That <em>kind of</em> works, but it’ll quickly get unwieldy. What if the flour:water ratio is close, but not exactly 5:3? What if I want to predict more than just bread? And what if I don’t feel like converting ingredient amounts into ratios? I am lazy (in certain ways) and I want to input my ingredient amounts without doing any math, and then have something magically tell me what it thinks it is.</p>

<p>Enter 🌟 machine learning 🌟</p>

<p>This is a great fit for ML because I can gather recipe data and train a model to identify patterns in that data. Since a lot of people have written about baking ratios, I’m going to assume there are some high-level patterns about them that I can teach a model to learn.</p>

<p>Hopefully by now I’ve convinced you that this will be a fun problem to solve with machine learning. But maybe you’re <em>still</em> skeptical, and you’re wondering: what’s the point of this? Don’t you already know what you’re baking when you follow a recipe? It seems silly to have a model tell you what you already know. All of that is true if I simply input an existing recipe into my model and ask it for a prediction. Remember, though, that the whole reason I’m doing this is to learn things like what makes a cake a cake, and not a cookie. Then I can experiment with different ratios to create a new recipe. Maybe I want to invent something that my model thinks is 50% cake, 50% cookie.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-dataset">Creating the dataset</h2>

<p>I couldn’t find an existing dataset of basic baking ingredients, so I decided to create my own very small one. Luckily there is no shortage of recipes on the internet, and I found 33 recipes each of breads, cakes, and cookies to make a dataset with 99 total recipes. To keep this problem relatively simple, I looked only at the following ingredients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flour: If a recipe called for different types of flour, I counted it it all towards the flour amount</li>
  <li>Sugar: I also combined different sugars (granulated, brown, etc.) as one amount</li>
  <li>Sourdough starter: If you know, you know</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Yeast</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Water</li>
  <li>Oil</li>
  <li>Eggs</li>
  <li>Baking powder</li>
  <li>Baking soda</li>
  <li>Butter</li>
</ul>

<p>I tracked it all in a spreadsheet that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/spreadsheet.png" alt="Baking spreadsheet dataset"></p>

<p>I know, I’m using cups and teaspoons and not something more universal like grams. If my little model becomes a smash hit, I will try to add metric system support.</p>

<p>While collecting the data, I did my best to include various types of breads, cakes, and cookies so that the model could handle a diverse repertoire of baked goods.</p>

<h2 id="processing-data">Processing data</h2>

<p>I went into this thinking I could feed my ingredient inputs directly into my machine model, since ML model inputs need to be numeric. Not quite. There are a few problems with the data in its current form.</p>

<p>First, my spreadsheet has a mix of units: I’m using cups for some ingredients, teaspoons for others, and eggs are just eggs. I don’t want my model to think that 1 unit of flour is the same as 1 unit of yeast (can you imagine what would happen there?). Since the majority of my data is in cups, I decided to convert everything else to cups. For teaspoons, this was fairly straightforward since 1 teaspoon is around .02 cups. For eggs, after some research I settled on 1 egg being approximately .2 cups. It’s not perfect, but now everything is in the same units.</p>

<p>Next I needed a way to scale the data. Some recipes make 2 giant cakes, while others make a small loaf of bread. Converting all ingredient amounts to the same scale will ensure my model doesn’t give more weight to bigger recipes. I decided to scale amounts by converting each ingredient to a percentage of the total recipe. To do this I took the sum of each row, and then divided each ingredient by the sum to get its percentage. The bread recipe in the screenshot above becomes:</p>

<p><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/scaled_inputs.png" alt="Scaled recipe inputs"></p>

<p>With my 99 recipes all converted to the same unit and scaled to percentages, it’s time to build and train a model.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-tensorflow-model">Building a TensorFlow model</h2>

<p>I’m going to use TensorFlow’s <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras" target="_blank">Keras API</a> for this model, which makes the model code pretty short:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>model</span> <span>=</span> <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>keras</span><span>.</span><span>Sequential</span><span>([</span>
  <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>keras</span><span>.</span><span>layers</span><span>.</span><span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>,</span> <span>input_shape</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>num_ingredients</span><span>,)),</span>
  <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>keras</span><span>.</span><span>layers</span><span>.</span><span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>,</span> <span>activation</span><span>=</span><span>'relu'</span><span>),</span>
  <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>keras</span><span>.</span><span>layers</span><span>.</span><span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>activation</span><span>=</span><span>'softmax'</span><span>)</span>                
<span>])</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>My model output is a softmax array, which means it’ll output the probability a particular recipe is a bread, cake, or cookie (in that order). Softmax means that all the probabilities will add to 1. So a 97% confident bread prediction would look like the following:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>[</span><span>.97</span><span>,</span> <span>.02</span><span>,</span> <span>.01</span><span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After training, my model has reached 90% accuracy. Pretty cool! But can I trust it, or is it overfitting the training data?</p>

<p>🚨This is definitely not an ML best practice, but I will be testing my model on real-world, production data. Mostly because I got tired of copying enough recipes into my spreadsheet to make a test set. Do not try this at home 🚨</p>

<p>To test the model, I made up the following recipe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flour: 1 c</li>
  <li>Sugar: 1 c</li>
  <li>Salt: ½ tsp</li>
  <li>Eggs: 1</li>
  <li>Butter: 1 c</li>
</ul>

<p>The model predicts cookies with 84% confidence. Sounds reasonable. What about an edge case, like a bread without yeast or sourdough starter? Let’s try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flour: 4 c</li>
  <li>Salt: ½ tsp</li>
  <li>Water: 1.2 c</li>
  <li>Oil: 3 tsp</li>
  <li>Baking powder: 2 tsp</li>
</ul>

<p>My model says bread with 99% confidence, nice! If I instead wrote a series of if statements to handle that edge case, you can see how it would quickly get very long.</p>

<h2 id="deploying-the-model-to-ai-platform">Deploying the model to AI Platform</h2>

<p>I don’t want to be the only one who gets to use this model, so it’s time to deploy it. I’m going to deploy it to Google Cloud <a href="https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/prediction/docs" target="_blank">AI Platform Prediction</a>. In order to do that, I need to use the TensorFlow <code>model.save()</code> method to save my model assets to a Cloud Storage Bucket. Then I can use gcloud to deploy my model from the command line, pointing it at the bucket path of my saved model.</p>

<p>When you save your TensorFlow model, you can pass it a local filepath or a Cloud Storage bucket. Here I’ll pass it my GCS bucket directly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>model</span><span>.</span><span>save</span><span>(</span><span>'gs://my_gcs_bucket/path'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>With that, I’m ready to deploy using gcloud (you can also deploy via the UI or the API):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>!</span><span>gcloud</span> <span>ai</span><span>-</span><span>platform</span> <span>versions</span> <span>create</span> <span>'v1'</span> \
<span>--</span><span>model</span> <span>'baking'</span> \
<span>--</span><span>origin</span> <span>'gs://path/to/saved/model'</span> \
<span>--</span><span>runtime</span><span>-</span><span>version</span> <span>2.1</span> \
<span>--</span><span>framework</span> <span>TENSORFLOW</span> \
<span>--</span><span>python</span><span>-</span><span>version</span> <span>3.7</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When your model has deployed, you’ll see it in your cloud console like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/caip-prediction.png" alt="Cloud AI Prediction UI"></p>

<h2 id="building-a-web-app">Building a web app</h2>

<p>🙏 <em>Shout out to my teammate <a href="https://twitter.com/_davideast" target="_blank">David</a> for his help on the web app</em> 🙏</p>

<p>It would be fun if I had a basic web app to get predictions on my model. That way I could quickly experiment with different ingredient ratios. Remember that my model needs the ingredient inputs all converted to cups and then scaled as percentages of the total recipe. It would be mean if I made people do those calculations on their own, so this should probably be handled server side – a great use for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions" target="_blank">Cloud Functions</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/arch-diagram.png" alt="Architecture diagram"></p>

<p>I’ll use the Python runtime and write a function that takes the ingredient inputs in their user-friendly units and converts them to cups and then to percentages. From the same function I can send that scaled input to my model and return a nice, readable prediction to the web app. A snippet of the function is below, and you can find it all in <a href="https://gist.github.com/sararob/1fb9fb132a93bdda95f7a71d2afd38ad" target="_blank">this gist</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to play around with it yourself, <strong><a href="https://whatareyoubaking.com/" target="_blank">it’s here</a></strong>. I’m sure you’ll try to do something weird with it (this is the internet after all), just keep in mind that the model has been trained on minimal data and it only knows about 3 things: bread, cake, and cookies. So if you enter the ingredients for a brownie or anything else, it’ll do its best to slot it into the only 3 categories it knows about. Think of it …</p></div></div>

        <p>2020-11-17</p>

        
<h2 id="problem-1-no-semantics">Problem 1: no semantics</h2>

<p>The fundamental problem with enums is that they don’t have a semantic meaning for the left and right side. Let’s look at an example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fruits</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>apple</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Apple'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s not at all clear why the cases of <code>apple</code> and <code>Apple</code> are different here, and what does the difference in case mean? Which of those two do we store in the database for example? Which do we show to the user?</p>

<p>Our experience over the years has made us believe that naming things helps, but subtle names help very little. We’ve tried naming the user facing string <code>label</code> and <code>title</code>. Both those are no good and are frequently misunderstood. We’ve settled for <code>display_name</code> as hard to misunderstand.</p>

<p>The example above written with tri.tokens becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fruits</span><span>(</span><span>TokenContainer</span><span>):</span>
    <span>apple</span> <span>=</span> <span>Token</span><span>(</span><span>display_name</span><span>=</span><span>'Apple'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The only problem here is that the word <code>apple</code> still has no name associated with it. We think this is an ok trade off, and we call this string the “name”, or sometimes “code name”. This is the string that goes into the database. Never anything else!</p>

<h2 id="problem-2-hard-to-add-data">Problem 2: Hard to add data</h2>

<p>With python enums it’s difficult to add additional data for the cases. You can use tuples but it has the same problem of no semantics but it gets worse the bigger the tuple is. This is an example from the official documentation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>MERCURY</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>3.303e+23</span><span>,</span> <span>2.4397e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>VENUS</span>   <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>4.869e+24</span><span>,</span> <span>6.0518e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>EARTH</span>   <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>5.976e+24</span><span>,</span> <span>6.37814e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>MARS</span>    <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>6.421e+23</span><span>,</span> <span>3.3972e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>JUPITER</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>1.9e+27</span><span>,</span>   <span>7.1492e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>SATURN</span>  <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>5.688e+26</span><span>,</span> <span>6.0268e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>URANUS</span>  <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>8.686e+25</span><span>,</span> <span>2.5559e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>NEPTUNE</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>1.024e+26</span><span>,</span> <span>2.4746e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>mass</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>mass</span> <span>=</span> <span>mass</span>       <span># in kilograms
</span>        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>radius</span> <span>=</span> <span>radius</span>   <span># in meters
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s impossible to understand the definition of the data without reading the constructor (and the constructor is a bit weird too as <code>self</code> here are the cases, not the <code>Planet</code> class!). The constructor then changes this positional chaos to the named members <code>mass</code> and <code>radius</code>. In <a href="https://tritoken.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">tri.token</a> this would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>Token</span><span>):</span>
    <span>mass</span> <span>=</span> <span>TokenAttribute</span><span>()</span>
    <span>radius</span> <span>=</span> <span>TokenAttribute</span><span>()</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Planets</span><span>(</span><span>TokenContainer</span><span>):</span>
    <span>MERCURY</span> <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>3.303e+23</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>2.4397e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>VENUS</span>   <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>4.869e+24</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>6.0518e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>EARTH</span>   <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>5.976e+24</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>6.37814e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>MARS</span>    <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>6.421e+23</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>3.3972e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>JUPITER</span> <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>1.9e+27</span><span>,</span>   <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>7.1492e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>SATURN</span>  <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>5.688e+26</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>6.0268e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>URANUS</span>  <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>8.686e+25</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>2.5559e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>NEPTUNE</span> <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>1.024e+26</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>2.4746e7</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This has clear semantics for each row and removes the need for the constructor on the Enum class.</p>

<p>Another common solution to the problem above is to have the data for mass and radius somewhere else. This results in several dicts you need to reconcile and validate.</p>

<h2 id="problem-3-scales-badly-for-sparse-data">Problem 3: scales badly for sparse data</h2>

<p>We have many cases with sparse data. This is what it would look with enums:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fields</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>party_group_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>default</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>'rec_party'</span><span>,</span> <span>default</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>None</code> here means it doesn’t exist and the sentinel <code>default</code> means to automatically generate the default. In tri.token this would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fields</span><span>(</span><span>TokenContainer</span><span>):</span>
    <span>party_group_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>Field</span><span>(</span><span>total_download_name</span><span>,</span> <span>dw_name</span><span>=</span><span>"rec_party"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>total_download_name</code> here is a special sentinel value so we can shorten <code>total_download_name=default</code> to just <code>total_download_name</code>.</p>

<p>This problem grows with each case of the enum. As of this writing the <code>Fields</code> container from this example has 486 cases, making the sparse data issue much worse.</p>

<h2 id="problem-4-dangerous-to-work-around-these-problems">Problem 4: dangerous to work around these problems</h2>

<p>One could make all the cases for an Enum into dicts:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fields</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>party_group_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span>
        <span>total_download_name</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span> 
        <span>dw_name</span><span>=</span><span>"rec_party"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>)</span>
    
    <span>instrument_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>dict</span><span>()</span>
    <span>agreement_curr</span> <span>=</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span>
        <span>file_column</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This doesn’t work though because all empty dicts are the same so if you add <code>avg_mtm_diff_usd = dict()</code> now data is thrown away silently.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Python native enums are great for what they were designed to do, but we’ve found that they are limited and don’t allow you to grow the complexity and usage in a sane way. We developed tri.token before python enums and were hoping we could throw away tri.token and replace it with enums, but unfortunately this wasn’t the case.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There are approximately 7.5x10^18 grains of sand on Earth. This story is about finding changes in an equation that has a difference of approximately 1e-18 out of hundreds of billions of calculations. That is 7 grains of sand that are different to what we expect across the entire planet Earth.</p>
<p>After spending days generating gigabytes of debug logs and GDB breakpoints, I finally discovered a very peculiar bug in the compiler. I thought this would be an interesting story to tell.</p>
<p><strong>Update: Thanks to gus_massa and wiml @ HackerNews for pointing out I had used associative instead of commutative</strong></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Back in 2008 I started developing a scientific modelling platform called the <a href="https://niwa.co.nz/fisheries/tools-resources/spatial-population-modelling">Spatial Population Model (SPM)</a>. This software is designed to model or simulate and ocean environments to approximate the health of fish stocks. The output of SPM is used to create scientific reports that are given to Governments for the setting of commercial fishing quota. </p>
<p>Due to the political nature of these reports, reproducibility and integrity of results is crucial. Scientists from around the world will use the software to re-run models across different Operating Systems and compilers to validate results.</p>
<p>Since it was 2008, it was decided that SPM would not be multi-threaded. This is because of: no C++ standard threading, average computer had 2 cores, incompatibility with auto-differentiation libraries) </p>
<p>Fast forward to 2020/21 where many-core systems are commonplace. I had recently acquired for myself an AMD 5950X 16c/32t CPU and was keen to apply it to some modelling work. SPM is still in use as a world leading spatial modelling platform and has received continual updates. I’ve had a long interest in bringing concurrency to SPM to invent new methods of scientific modelling that evolve the underlying mathematics. As a proof of concept, I wanted to start working through threading the internal gradient calculation. Models in SPM are user defined and can be enormous (&gt;100k lines of input text) so we’re unable to analytically determine the gradient function through auto-differentiation. We use an iterative approach tweaking model parameters to calculate the gradient. These tweaks are independent and therefore can be parallelised. </p>
<p>This seemed like a relatively straight forward piece of work. I would need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Move all of the classes to be children of a new Model class</li>
<li>Remove all singletons</li>
<li>Keep the floating-point operations in the exact same order when calculate on the main thread (IEEE-754)</li>
<li>Support an arbitrary number of threads</li>
<li>Produce identical results regardless of the number of threads, Operating System or compiler</li>
</ol>
<h2>IEEE-754 or the floating-point nightmare</h2>
<p>The development of scientific modelling platforms like SPM requires a significant amount of thought and effort around reproducibility. Given the same input files, any user must be able to re-run your model and get the exact same answer out. This seems incredibly obvious, but it’s not…</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE-754</a> is the standard for floating-point arithmetic. Floating point math in computers is an approximation. Whenever you see a floating point value it is highly unlikely to be completely accurate. Floating-point arithmetic is commutative, but not associative. So for floating-point numbers,
A + B = B + A always, but
A + (B + C) != (A + B) + C in many cases.
The order in which operations occur within your model will influence the output. While this is inconsequential for small programs or games; this continual adding of errors for scientific models where the number of operations is in the hundreds of billions is consequential. </p>
<p>Every thread we spawn must run the same operations in the exact same order. When the threads give their results back to the main thread, they must do so in a way that ensures that all future operations happen in the exact same order. This is regardless of the number of threads or number of parameters in the model.</p>
<p><em>Side Note: Within scientific models, we use double precision numbers (double) and not single precision (float). Single precision does not have enough precision to handle the number of calculations required. At the end of a model the error added by the approximation of floating-point math is very significant. This limits us to using CPUs over GPUs as the double precision performance of GPUs is not that much better than a modern CPU when you have to factor in the added complexity of writing GPU specific code.</em></p>
<h2>The first signs of trouble</h2>
<p>With my task list ready, I started to work through re-factoring the code. Everything was modified to use a central model class as the parent for the system. This allows me to spawn as many model classes as threads. Everything was compiling and running without crashes. Time to check the output..</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>1999.818926297566804 // original score running no threads
1999.8189264475995515 // my new score running 32 threads</code></pre></div>
<p>A slight difference, nothing to be concerned about as I had probably changed the order of execution for some of the equations by threading them. I was testing with a small model that ran in &lt;5 seconds, so working through each of the instantiated classes to check the code won’t take too long. Another day down and nothing obvious was found. Time to run the application through GDB and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer">Sanitizers</a> looking for issues… nope nothing there either.</p>
<p>A simple model will have recruitment/breeding, ageing and death. I started to reduce and simplify the processes in the model to see if I could identify any key process or parameter. I removed the random number generate and commented out a large amount of complex math… but still no luck.</p>
<h2>Down the rabbit hole of debug logging and GDB</h2>
<p>After three days of trying to find the issue, I had added a LARGE amount of debug logging and had resorted to doing step throughs in GDB looking for a point at which I would notice a change in the result. The log files were 20MBs+ and the model would only show issues after a few iterations… why not immediately?</p>
<p>Was I calling a function later in the model that had the issue? Or was the issue starting earlier but at a greater precision that I was printing. I was printing my debug output with a <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/manip/setprecision">precision</a> of 15. Time to increase the precision to 20. This is basically the maximum amount of precision you can print from a double with accuracy. I did a few more model runs and saw that the variation in results had moved to much earlier in the model… almost immediately.</p>
<p>The model would load the configuration file, then construct all of the user defined objects in memory. As part of constructing these objects a bunch of calculations would be run to build caches. To save on moving data between threads each thread would repeat the same process. Every new thread would get the configuration file that had been loaded, create all of the objects and run the initial calculations. GDB showed that even these initial calculates were having different results.</p>
<p>My working folder was littered with files named “fuck”, “fuck1” and “fuckN” each with more than 20MBs of debug output for a small model run. Diff was run across files to see where changes were occurring and how small they were… But still no luck.. everything was going wrong almost immediately but I had no idea why.</p>
<h2>Surely it’s not a compiler bug?</h2>
<p>SPM uses the GCC and MinGW64 compilers. This allows us to have near-identical code for Windows and Linux with common makefiles. I have always preferred <a href="https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/">TDM-GCC</a> as this has a current release. In this instance, TDM-GCC 9.2.0 from March 2020. Running the sanitizers was done on OpenSuSe Tumbleweed Linux using GCC 10.2.1. These are both very modern versions of the GCC compiler suite. I have never been one to blame tools for a bug in my code.</p>
<p>At this point, I am way down the rabbit hole trying to find the cause of this bug. Some testing had shown me that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original binary would produce the same result on every run</li>
<li>My new binary would produce the same result on every run, but different to the original</li>
<li>My new binary would produce the same result regardless of the number of threads.. from 1 to 100</li>
</ul>
<p>That last observation made me curious. Why did my new code produce a different result when I ran it with only one thread? What would make it different from the original binary. Having only 1 thread that was executing would eliminate any race conditions.</p>
<p>In the original binary, we do not create any threads. We load the model, build and run it. In the new code, even with one thread we create that thread, load the model, build and run it. What was I doing during the thread creation process that would cause this issue? Time for GBs of log files and GDB.</p>
<p>Stepping through every operation to validate the output lead me into what we call a selectivity. This is a static piece of code that takes an input, calls a standard simple piece of math and returns an output. These few lines of code had returned different results in a thread and not. Time to analyse the following code:</p>
<div data-language="c++"><pre><code>double CLogisticSelectivity::calculateResult(int Age) {
    double dRet = 0.0;
    double dTemp = (dA50-Age)/dAto95;

    if(dTemp &gt; 5.0)
      dRet = 0.0;
    else if (dTemp &lt; -5.0)
      dRet = dAlpha;
    else
      dRet  = dAlpha/(1.0+pow(19.0,dTemp));

    return dRet;
}</code></pre></div>
<p>If I gave the code Age = 1 then ran it I got the following results:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Local  = 0.0010370292068795884059
Thread = 0.0010370292068795879722</code></pre></div>
<p>What gives? There is nothing in here that should be different in a thread. I am not passing in anything but an int with the value of 1. I edited the code to make dA50 and dAto95 local variables to remove any potential race conditions or thread wonkiness and still had the same error in output. Everything was initialized within the same function and the only external value was an Integer. Weird…</p>
<h2>Compiler bug? But how…</h2>
<p>Looking at the code, the only things that could create the bug were the operators and pow() call. These are part of the C++ standard offering so it’s highly unlikely that either of these would have an error. What next?

			<p>Last summer the Go team announced an updated <a href="https://blog.golang.org/generics-next-step">design
draft</a> for adding generics to the
language. Included in the announcement was a new experimentation tool, named
<code>go2go</code>, for developers to compile, test, and run code written using the
generics feature described in the latest design draft. This blog post documents
my experience using the <code>go2go</code> tool to add support for generics to an existing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">PubSub</a>
package.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tl;dr: <a href="https://github.com/benburkert/pubsub/commit/73593d5f0ef07eebf04379244d5446224c793dcb">here is the code
diff</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="go2go">go2go</h2>
<p>The <code>go2go</code> tool is a working prototype. It can parse the new language syntax
and transform it to a sort of “intermediate” Go 1 code, which can then be fed
to the standard Go compiler and executed. I have read that it relies on
monomorphization to transform code, but I can’t say that I understand what that
means.</p>
<p>You can install the <code>go2go</code> tool now by fetching &amp; building the latest version
of the <code>dev.go2go</code> branch of the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go">Go project’s source
repository</a>. There is also an online version at
<a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/">The go2go Playground</a>.</p>
<h2 id="generic-pubsub">Generic PubSub</h2>
<p>There are many ways generics can be useful in a codebase, but I am particularly
interested in how they can be applied to “container” code. That is, code that
typically implements a specialized algorithm or data structure unrelated to the
structure of the objects it holds.</p>
<p>PubSub is a good fit for generics for a few reasons. The need for high
performance (either low latency or high throughput) meshes well with compiler
optimizations that generics enable. And it is typically used in highly
concurrent programs where correctness checks are critical to avoiding data
races and memory bugs. Generics can lift these checks from runtime to compile
time, which helps the implementer build a correct PubSub implementation.</p>
<p>But, (in my opinion) the most important benefit is the elimination of “book
keeping” code that simplifies the API surface area for consumers of the PubSub
library. It’s a particularly tricky pattern to use correctly as a developer, so
any reductions in API complexity can be a major boon to them.</p>
<h2 id="githubcombenburkertpubsubhttpspkggodevgithubcombenburkertpubsub"><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/benburkert/pubsub">github.com/benburkert/pubsub</a></h2>
<p>The package I’ve chosen to analyze is a pretty bare bones PubSub
implementation I wrote a while ago. It allows package users to publish and/or
subscribe to a single stream of objects, via a function call/callback or
channel send/receive. The objects can be of any type and are internally tracked
as empty interface instances. There is a complicated API for adding type safe
publishers and subscribers (enforced at runtime), which works with both
<a href="https://github.com/benburkert/pubsub/blob/master/example/typedfunc/main.go">functions</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/benburkert/pubsub/blob/master/example/typedchan/main.go">channels</a>.</p>
<p>Under the hood, it is broken down into two major components: a fixed size ring
buffer with a max number of readers/writers, and a PubSub layer that sits over
the underlying buffer. The basic API is quite simple, but the API for typed
functions and channels is not: the user has to manipulate the underlying buffer
at times. It’s a leaky abstraction that I wish did not exist.</p>
<p>It has already shown to be quite reliable and performant in production
environments, but (im)proving correctness is always a good thing. Likewise for
removing potential runtime panics.</p>
<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
<p>At the moment, I’m only interested in how generics can improve the correctness
of this package, its APIs, and programs that consume them. As mentioned above,
<code>go2go</code> is only a prototype, and I don’t expect it to produce a faster or
smaller binary, so I’ve skipped that analysis entirely. There will most
certainly be impacts on performance (both good and bad!), but any investigation
would be pure speculation until generics support moves beyond the prototype
phase.</p>
<p>The <code>go2go</code> tool itself is still rough around the edges: error messages can be
confusing and un-googlable. And it may require code changes to get around
limitations of the tool. The <code>go2go</code> playground is a better place to start
exploring with generics; I don’t recommend the <code>go2go</code> tool route unless you
are working on an existing, multi-file package.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I spent two Sunday afternoons on this project, or about 10 hours total. I
hadn’t kept up closely with the state of the generics language feature, so this
included reading parts of the proposal and getting up to speed with the new
tooling and syntax.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/benburkert/pubsub/commit/73593d5f0ef07eebf04379244d5446224c793dcb">changes</a>
clocked in at a little over 500 LOC, with about 100 lines of added code. Almost
all of the added code was in additional tests.</p>
<p>I started by updating the <code>Buffer</code> type, next the <code>PubSub</code> type, and finally
the <code>Publisher</code>, <code>Subscriber</code>, and <code>Context</code> types. Nothing else required changes.</p>
<h2 id="buffer"><code>Buffer</code></h2>
<p>The major change to the <code>Buffer</code> type was swapping out the underlying storage slice,
changing it from an empty interface slice (<code>data []interface{}</code>) to a slice of
<code>T</code>s, where <code>T</code> is a <code>comparable</code> type parameter on <code>Buffer</code>. The <code>comprable</code>
trait was needed because the buffer uses an equality check (<code>==</code>) to test if
the next position to read is marked empty (i.e. unwritten). Previously the
package used a typed byte value to mark the initial data slice items as empty.
But because the type of <code>T</code> is now a type parameter, the global empty marker
trick no longer works.</p>
<p>To compensate, an empty value parameter was added to the <code>NewBuffer</code> func and
an <code>empty T</code> field added to <code>Buffer</code>. The new <code>data</code> slice of <code>T</code>s is set to
the empty value instead of the zero value for <code>T</code>. Careful: the empty value
cannot be written to the buffer, so using the <code>T</code>'s zero value may have very
bad consequences if the zero value of <code>T</code> can be written by the program (i.e.
<code>int(0)</code>). In practice, this shouldn’t be an issue because the <code>PubSub</code> type
uses its own trick to avoid having the empty value of <code>T</code> conflict with user
values.</p>
<p>After this small but cardinal set of changes, the rest was mostly swapping out
empty interfaces for type parameters, and adding additional <code>Buffer</code> tests.
Since writing the latest version of this package, I have picked up the habit
of mostly writing <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/2019/05/07/prefer-table-driven-tests">table style
tests</a>. The added
tests were done in this fashion, and they are structured pretty much the same
as non-generic table style tests. It feels like generics could improve these
table style tests further, but it’s not immediately obvious to me. Perhaps
there are improvements lurking around the corner, but for now it’s only a hope.</p>
<h2 id="pubsub"><code>PubSub</code></h2>
<p>Next up was the <code>PubSub</code> type. Unlike the <code>Buffer</code> type, it was important that
the <code>PubSub</code> type be able to work on any type <code>T</code>, not just comparable types
(i.e. <code>[T any]</code> vs <code>[T comparable]</code>). Otherwise, maps and slices would be
unsupported type parameters. This requirement introduced a catch: reusing the
<code>T</code> type parameter on <code>PubSub</code> for <code>Buffer[T]</code> would lift that constraint,
meaning the type for <code>Buffer</code> would have to be comparable.</p>
<p>To get around this, I relied on the comparability of pointers: <a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/p/Y2XuSbTbbt5">a pointer to a
type with an <code>any</code> type parameter is always
comparable.</a> This meant adding a
layer of indirection via a <code>cell</code> struct, which the underlying <code>Buffer</code> holds a
slice of instead of the <code>T</code>s to <code>PubSub</code>. It might seem unfortunate that the
solution required this extra indirection, but in actuality it doesn’t introduce
any extra overhead compared to the previous version. That is because the <code>cell</code>
type is not much different than the empty interface type that <code>Buffer</code> used
prior. And it also provided a way of reimplementing the unsubscribe mechanism.</p>
<p>The API allows for the function and channel subscribers to unsubscribe by
calling a function or closing a channel, respectively. In both these cases, the
subscriber can signal to the callback/receiver handler to close the
subscription. So each subscriber must have their own way of being signaled for
shutdown.</p>
<p>This signal is implemented as an instance of an empty struct chan. Because
channels have the property of being comparable and equal only to the same
instance of itself, these channels can be used as for both a per-subscriber
marker and for signal delivery. Instead of pushing these channels directly into
the buffer, the <code>cell</code> type added a <code>ch</code> field for these channels. These
“control” <code>cell</code> values can be differentiated from “data” <code>cell</code> values by
setting a non-nil <code>ch</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>PubSub</code> methods were then updated to drop the empty interfaces for type
parameters. The only real behavioral change to a method was in <code>PubSlice</code>: the
<code>[]T</code> argument had to be copied into an equivalent <code>[]cell[T]</code> before being
written to the <code>Buffer</code>. While it is additional overhead, that overhead was
likely already being performed by users, because their typed slice would have
to be copied to an empty interface slice prior to calling the old <code>PubSlice</code>.
If anything, it’s an improvement because it eliminates more book-keeping for
the user. Typically the conversion to <code>interface{}</code> parameters is handled by
the compiler/runtime, but not for a slice of empty interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="publisher-subscriber--context"><code>Publisher</code>, <code>Subscriber</code>, &amp; <code>Context</code></h2>
<p>With the move to type parameters for the <code>PubSub</code> type, there is no longer a
need for the old “type safe” API: the basic API now supports compile time type
safety. It’s a big improvement over the old API. The <code>Publisher</code> &amp; <code>Subscriber</code>
interfaces were deleted, along with the <code>Context</code> interface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>n.b. <code>Context</code> was unfortunately named due to being written before the
<code>context</code> package was part of the standard library.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I can understate how gratifying it is to see this sort of
improvement naturally fall out from a new language feature. Deleting code
always feels good, but that hardly compares to removing leaky abstractions. At
this point the <code>Buffer</code> type could be unexported, but I held off for the sake
of keeping the diff readable.</p>
<p>The “unusable empty value” <code>Buffer</code> problem mentioned above is solved rather
trivially: because the <code>Buffer</code> of a <code>PubSub</code> is no longer exposed via the API
to users, a nil <code>cell</code> value can safely be used as the empty value,
because there is no other opportunity for a nil <code>cell</code> to be written to the
<code>Buffer</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I struggled to grasp generics at the outset of this experiment. They are
complex in a way that I haven’t encountered in a while with Go: I wasn’t sure
when to reach for them and when to use another feature of Go. I didn’t have a
firm understanding of “what” needed to be done until I started using the
<code>go2go</code> tool. It was difficult, but …</p></section></div>

<p>This list is by no means exhaustive. There are likely many more things that HTML tags give us (like headaches, reactjs, and some money at the end of the month if we are lucky).</p>
<p>With the Shadow DOM it is possible to compose all of the features above and hide them away inside custom tags.</p>

<p>When a Web Component has no shadow root, it will happily render all its children:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;

&lt;</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root.&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>&gt;

&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;

</span><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>("</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>",
</span><span>// What follows is the the &lt;simple-web-component&gt; code:
</span><span>class extends </span><span>HTMLElement </span><span>{
    </span><span>initialize</span><span>() {
      </span><span>// Nothing for now... just a simple component
    </span><span>}

    </span><span>// Call initialize when added to a parent node
    </span><span>connectedCallback</span><span>() { </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>(); }
}</span><span>);

&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;

&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>The code above creates the functionality for the <code>&lt;simple-web-component&gt;</code> tag. Which gets rendered as expected:</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/no-shadow-dom.png" alt="A portion of a browser window, showing the following text in black letters &quot;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root&quot;, in a white background." title="In direct sunlight"></p>
<p>However, this is not how it behaves when a shadow root is added to it.</p>
<h3 id="adding-a-bare-shadow-root">Adding a bare shadow root</h3>
<p>The code inside the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag needs to be slightly adjusted to add a shadow root.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>("</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>",

</span><span>// The &lt;simple-web-component&gt; code:

    </span><span>initialize</span><span>() </span><span>{
        </span><span>const </span><span>p </span><span>= </span><span>document.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>p</span><span>"</span><span>);

    }

    </span><span>// Call initialize when added to a parent node
    </span><span>connectedCallback</span><span>() </span><span>{ </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>(); }
}</span><span>);

</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;simple-web-component&gt;</code> class now has a <code>root</code> attribute <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attachShadow">set with its shadow root</a>. Then a simple <code>&lt;p&gt;In the shadow!&lt;/p&gt;</code> is placed inside it by the <code>initialize()</code> function.</p>
<p>This simple shadow root will affect the display of the component.</p>
<p>The previous <code>&lt;p&gt;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root.&lt;/p&gt;</code> will no longer be shown since it is outside the shadow root, and now only the shadow root contents are being displayed.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/with-shadow-dom.png" alt="A portion of a browser window, showing the following text in black letters &quot;In the shadow!&quot; in a white background." title="Shaded"></p>
<p>However, the inspector tools shows how the tag is really juggling the shadow dom:</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/shadow-dom-inspector.png" alt="The hierarchy of tags as seen by the inspector tools. Under the &quot;simple-web-component&quot; tag, there is a &quot;#shadow-root&quot; tag with a single &quot;p&quot; tag with the text &quot;In the shadow!&quot;. Also, under the &quot;simple-web-component&quot; another &quot;p&quot; tag can be seen with the content &quot;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root.&quot;" title="This shadow is not for everyone"></p>
<p>Looking at the above hierarchy it is worth noting that the original <code>&lt;p&gt;Hello World!..&lt;/p&gt;</code> is still there, but <em>why is it not visible?</em></p>
<p>Once a shadow root is added to a tag, it becomes the thing that will get rendered. Shadow DOM is the authority, everything else is discarded, and only the stuff inside the shadow root gets displayed.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Because the idea was that whatever children a custom tag would have could get rendered with ninja tricks inside the shadow. Thus giving the impression that the custom tag was getting its input from its visible children and then performing hidden layout and style foojitsu on that input (such tricks would occur inside the shadow dom - hidden from the written HTML).</p>
<p>Nobody cares. In fact, let me revert this logic.</p>
<h2 id="you-wouldn-t-download-a-car">You wouldn't download a car</h2>
<p>The first step to revert the Shadow DOM is to copy all the custom components' children into its shadow root.</p>
<p>This will allow HTML to be rendered as expected while maintaining the Shadow DOM's encapsulation features.</p>
<p>Luckily the Web Components spec provides just the feature for this, through the <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<h3 id="i-m-such-a-slot">I'm such a <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code></h3>
<p>This tag is used mainly in HTML <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>'s. It is the way that <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>'s have to tell which parts can be set by outsiders. Typically <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code>'s have a name attribute to be used as the reference to where the content will go. (You can see an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot#attributes">example of it here</a>, but it is not necessary, I won't be using it.)</p>
<p>The cool thing is that if there is no <code>name</code> specified on the <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code>, then it becomes the default <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> where all unspecified content will go in.</p>
<p>This is perfect. It means that if a <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> is placed inside the shadow root (without a <code>name="..."</code> attribute), then all of the custom element children will automatically be copied into it.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;

&lt;</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>&gt;

<p>To achieve it, the following CSS is added to the Shadow DOM:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="css"><span>:</span><span>not(slot) </span><span>{
    display: none;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The common practice is to create a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag, place the above content inside it and then append the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag to the Shadow DOM:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>    </span><span>initialize</span><span>() {
        </span><span>const </span><span>p </span><span>= document.</span><span>createElement</span><span>("</span><span>p</span><span>");
        </span><span>p</span><span>.</span><span>textContent </span><span>= "</span><span>In the shadow!</span><span>";

        </span><span>const </span><span>style </span><span>= document.</span><span>createElement</span><span>("</span><span>style</span><span>");
        </span><span>style</span><span>.</span><span>textContent </span><span>= `
</span><span>        :not(slot) {
          display: none;
        }</span><span>`;

        </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>root</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(
          </span><span>style</span><span>,
          </span><span>p</span><span>,
          document.</span><span>createElement</span><span>("</span><span>slot</span><span>")
        );
    }
</span></code></pre>
<p>And just like that, the actual behavior of the Shadow DOM is reversed. The Shadow DOM contents are hidden by default, while the original custom tag children get rendered by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/reversed-shadow-dom.png" alt="A portion of a browser window, showing one line of text with the phrase &quot;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root.&quot;. This text line has black letters on a white background." title="Only the child paragraph is visible"></p>
<p>No "In the shadow!" text is visible.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is possible to sweep all kinds of useless trash under the Shadow DOM.</p>
<p>However, it might require reversing the Shadow DOM's visibility (which is rendered by default).</p>
<p>To achieve it, a full copy of the custom element original children is made into the Shadow DOM (through the default <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> tag). The next step is to hide everything inside the Shadow DOM that does not belong to the original children.</p>
<p>With these two moves, the element's original children become visible while leaving all the other shadow DOM contents invisible.</p>

The capital, in the northeast, is Port-aux-Français,&nbsp;which has&nbsp;a scientific base&nbsp;of&nbsp;about 80 people. The colony of black-browed albatrosses is 30-40 km away, so we flew there by helicopter.</p><p>It’s a sub-Antarctic island so there are no trees and, above 200-300 metres, no vegetation, only rock. The explorer Captain James Cook called it Desolation Island. There’s a lot of rain and wind and some snow, although it wasn’t very cold. Temperatures ranged from zero to about six degrees.</p><p>I enjoyed it there. We had a nice hut in a small valley along a river.</p><p>Every day we woke at 6am and walked for three quarters of an hour to the colony.</p><p>Black-browed albatrosses nest in cliffs so we had to use a rope to get from the plateau to 200 metres down. We were then in the cliff, on a ledge about two by ten metres with about 200 nests below us. They were part of a larger colony of a thousand pairs.</p><figure data-orig-height="3040" data-orig-width="4056" data-orig-src="https://horizon-media.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/IMCEUpload/encode_-_the_coast_with_the_colony_on_the_back_ground.jpg"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ff1288620f391a2806bf00531fbdab46/0240891bbfec1ec5-a6/s1280x1920/d7f27f9d9f4e21c03eabd3f246ed4a29099c1c22.jpg" alt="The three researchers flew by helicopter to a sub-Antarctic island which is home to black-browed albatrosses perched on cliffs.

When the partner comes back it takes over the egg and the other one goes. We wanted to attach loggers to the birds at the time they were departing, so we had to wait for changeovers.</p><p>Each time there was a changeover we went further down with a rope to reach that nest. It took three of us – one to capture and hold the bird, one to attach the logger and the third to take notes and weigh the bird.</p><p>They are very tame so you can come very close without any problem. That’s the advantage of working with albatrosses.</p><figure data-orig-height="3024" data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-src="https://horizon-media.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/IMCEUpload/field_hut_under_the_snow.jpg"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/0605ae2b0d918afe3fc28a494d0437e5/0240891bbfec1ec5-13/s1280x1920/8b4045f0691fb7b55f5b17dfc5660fbdf26175bc.jpg" alt="The team stayed in a hut about a 45-minute walk away from the albatross colony they were studying.

Other days we did about ten. It depends on the wind. Albatrosses use wind to travel to reduce flight (energy) costs, so if&nbsp;the wind is&nbsp;not favourable, it takes more time for the birds to return to the colony.&nbsp;</p><p>The days were uncomfortable but we had good equipment, we had a lot of nice tea. And&nbsp;the site&nbsp;is very beautiful – it’s a&nbsp;spectacular cliff, you have the very rough sea and you have all the albatrosses flying around. Sometimes when it’s snowing it’s a bit cold, but otherwise it’s a very nice spot. It’s not difficult work so long as you don’t&nbsp;get vertigo in&nbsp;these steep cliffs.</p><p>After about eight days we had&nbsp;equipped&nbsp;40 albatrosses with our new loggers. The birds are at sea for about 10 days so, after a few more days, the first ones started to return and we recovered the loggers.</p><figure data-orig-height="3264" data-orig-width="4928" data-orig-src="https://horizon-media.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/IMCEUpload/black_browed_colony1_0.jpg"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/408899cf4e1457ebbdaef1c0a71a0583/0240891bbfec1ec5-db/s1280x1920/31ebd346db2e1bd55015ce19216517d6b1eb6d61.jpg" alt="The researchers used ropes to reach the albatross nests.

But the new (lighter) loggers could not transmit their data. That’s why we had to retrieve them.</p><p>Each day at 6pm we had to contact our base (in Port-aux-Français) using a satellite phone to tell them that we were safely on the way back to the hut. They were nervous about our safety. That one minute on the sat phone was our only connection to the outside world. But it was quite nice because we had no information – nothing about COVID and all the problems.</p><p>In the evening we downloaded the data from the loggers onto our computers.</p><p>When the month was finished, to get back to the base we had to walk four hours and take a small boat for four hours across the bay.

If they switch them off they are probably doing illegal fishing. While we were on Kerguelen I had someone downloading all the movements of declared vessels in the southwestern Indian Ocean from their AIS (Automatic Identification System) transmissions. When I return to France, we will be able to tell whether the boats that were detected by the albatrosses had an AIS signal. If they don’t, then they were illegal if they were found in a national economic zone.</p><p>In our previous work we found that at a third of the boats were not using their transponders. We detected some sectors where there are a lot of illegal boats, for example around the Prince Edward Islands which are in South African waters.</p><p>This time we will have information from a different species, one that is even more attracted by fishing vessels. So we are expecting to have detected even more boats around Kerguelen. We are discussing (our findings) with the French authorities. This information will be used in the future for surveillance.</p><p>We are also interested in understanding whether the birds (that hang around) vessels gain more mass than birds foraging naturally. The question of mass gain is important when studying seabird-fisheries interactions. On the one hand there is a risk of being ensnared in on the lines, but there might be an advantage of gathering easy food.</p><figure data-orig-height="1080" data-orig-width="1080" data-orig-src="https://horizon-media.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/IMCEUpload/map-kerguelen6.jpg"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/318663e9508fcfe6ed579b04bc49665e/0240891bbfec1ec5-2a/s1280x1920/51326a411eb8990166edaf8cac0c6cbf781cecba.jpg" alt="It takes 15 days to travel by supply ship from the Indian Ocean island of Réunion to the Kerguelen Islands.

<p>Oh no…. Not another CIDR calculator, because <a href="https://www.ultratools.com/tools/netMask">there</a> <a href="https://account.arin.net/public/cidrCalculator">really</a> <a href="https://www.subnet-calculator.com/cidr.php">are</a> <a href="https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr">a</a> <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/subnetcalculator.aspx">bunch</a>.</p>



<p>Allow me to advocate for my app <a href="https://www.cidrizer.com/">CIDRizer</a>, focused on CIDR space <em>coverage</em>.  If one has a <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/cidr">CIDR</a> block (account, VPC, etc.), and their engineers take a little slice here and there (of varying <a href="https://dnsmadeeasy.com/support/subnet/">mask size</a> and probably not consecutive), how can one actually see what’s left?</p>



<p>Example (<a href="https://www.cidrizer.com/">CIDRizer</a> input):</p>



<pre><code>10.10.10.0/24   # Overall Account/VPC

10.10.10.32/29  # Jim's tests
10.10.10.128/29 # dev4a
10.10.10.160/28 # Ruth's team</code></pre>



<p>… can be completely covered/represented as follows (CIDRizer output):</p>

<p>The keyword guiding IKEA’s history is <em>innovation.</em></p>



<p>Ever since its start in 1943, the name IKEA has been synonymous with minimal, cheap furniture that can be bought and assembled in one’s own home. Its first innovation is also its most famous one – the flatpack furniture. By introducing this concept, and moving furniture assembly onto the user – contrary to what other furniture stores were doing – it allowed the company to reduce costs. This concept made IKEA the world’s biggest furniture store, with no real worldwide competition. This enviable position, allowed it to focus on other innovations and products that could improve the IKEA brand and allow the company to enter new markets.</p>



<p>There were, of course, a number of high profile <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-ikea-tv-reviewed-worse-than-assembling-100-bookshe-5919216">mistakes</a>, but how else would a company from Sweden make €12.4 billion profit, if not for continuously making mistakes and learning from them along the way? The IKEA furniture made in the 1950s might not be fitting for today or appropriate in 10 years, while the food sold by the company 20 years ago might not respect the increasing sustainable lifestyle of many of its customers. The creation of <a href="https://space10.com/">SPACE10</a>, IKEA’s very own <a href="https://x.company/">‘X</a>’, the former Google X, has helped the company to experiment with new concepts and projects to address these challenges and keep the company on the forefront to new challenges. IKEA is changing how customers live, eat, and work, and its future will have a bigger role in our everyday lives.</p>



<p>There are four main areas where I believe IKEA is spearheading new concepts, new technology, and better practices:</p>



<ol><li>Food</li><li>Housing</li><li>the Smart Home</li><li>Augmented Reality</li></ol>



<p>I’ll delve deeper into each category and explain how IKEA is expected to be innovating in each, and then we’ll briefly look at how IKEA has the potential to rival Amazon, as it makes the jump from a furniture store to the everyday store.</p>



<h3>1. Food</h3>



<p>A few years after the flatpack furniture was invented, IKEA started opening IKEA Bistros and food markets, in its out-of-town stores.</p>



<p><em>“It’s difficult to do business with someone on an empty stomach.”</em></p>



<p>These were the words of IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad, who wanted to start serving food to the people spending whole days at IKEA stores out of the city. What better way to keep customers at your store than to offer them cheap AND good food?</p>



<p>The meatball remains an IKEA favourite, and the word itself has become as synonyms to IKEA as the flatpack furniture. With millions of IKEA meatballs sold each year, you would think the company would not want to upset the cart by changing recipes and adding new items to the menu. However IKEA did just that, and in mid-2020 it rolled out its ‘<a href="https://www.ikea.com/kr/en/p/allemansraetten-vegetable-balls-frozen-100-vegetables-40346434/">veggie balls</a>’ and the ‘<a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/this-is-ikea/sustainable-everyday/veggie-hot-dog-plant-based-goodness-pub166a3131">veggie hotdog</a>’ for public consumption. Two of the most famous IKEA food staples now have their vegetarian version, with the veggie balls producing around 15 to 20 times less carbon footprint than the meatballs. IKEA also joined forces with other organisations to buy sustainably farmed <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/this-is-ikea/sustainable-everyday/patar-special-edition-from-uganda-with-love-a-very-special-single-origin-100-arabica-coffee-pub1e423691">coffee</a>, and <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/this-is-ikea/sustainable-everyday/egentid-good-for-you-the-farmers-and-the-planet-pub561f3b31">tea</a> and created the ‘IKEA Food <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/this-is-ikea/sustainable-everyday/ikea-food-better-chicken-pub4fcff351">Better Chicken</a>’ programme which seeks to source chicken under strict animal welfare criteria.</p>



<div id="w-node-0c78ba3acc40"><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99db1a0428adda3ed5a_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F0d586b7c-d38b-4215-84a6-c66fc5f76825_1200x800.jpeg?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Like other companies in the food sector, IKEA recognises the increasing number of individuals becoming aware of the carbon footprint needed to sustain the current consumption pattern. SPACE10 has been trying to build on the meatball’s legacy by creating new concepts which leave a much smaller carbon footprint, like meatballs made from artificial meat and those made from insects, which are not unconventional ideas in 2020, even if they have yet to enter the mainstream markets. The Lab also has a concept of a 3D printed meatball, which is more of an aesthetical project rather than a ready-to-serve meatball, however, this goes to show how SPACE10 is seeking to broaden the perspective of both IKEA itself, as well as its customers, to future possibilities in the food sector.</p>



<h3>2. Housing</h3>



<p>In the early 1990s, IKEA realised that the <a href="https://data.oecd.org/price/housing-prices.htm">increase in residential property prices</a> is making it harder and harder for certain sections of the population looking to buy a home without having to break the bank. <a href="https://www.boklok.com/">BoKlok</a> was born from an agreement between Swedish construction giants, Skanska, and IKEA, to build and design low-cost housing, complete with, of course, IKEA furnishing. Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland have been the first beneficiaries of this project, while the <a href="https://www.archpaper.com/2020/05/ikea-modular-boklok-development-offshoot-manufacturer/">United Kingdom</a> will be the first country to host BoKlok housing outside of the Nordics.</p>



<p>BoKlok, which was also called ‘<a href="https://medium.com/@bartholomewhearn/the-flat-pack-taken-to-the-next-level-the-boklok-concept-26078e433b3f">the flatpack taken to the next level</a>’, prides itself in using as limited and as sustainable resources as possible. The design and materials used for the pre-fabricated blocks make the houses’ energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable. This modular housing technique, allows BoKlok to build up to 80% of the houses in a factory and then transport and assemble them to the construction site itself.</p>

<p>With BoKlok, IKEA has managed to infiltrate the housing market, and as housing prices continue to rise above median wages, the company will continue to find a market for low-cost housing. What made BoKlok successful, and continues to do so, is the cost-cutting every step of the way, with profits then being passed on to the consumer. A combination of cheap land, a single standard design, and large-volume manufacturing allows IKEA to create entire housing estates while eliminating brokers and their fees. Buying a flat with BoKlok is also as simple as buying a new bed frame from IKEA – you just have to register at the nearest IKEA store for available housing units.</p>



<p>While this is already disruptive in the current housing market, IKEA, or rather IKEA’s SPACE10 has already come up with a BoKlok on steroids – a new concept for future housing and working environment. ‘<a href="https://www.urbanvillageproject.com/">The Urban Village Project</a>’ shares the same aims of BoKlok, that of creating a sustainable and affordable way of living, but it also aims higher – to completely transform the housing market, by “bypassing the interests of short-term investors”. What this means is that the Project looks for financing by collaborating with “pension funds, future-oriented companies and municipalities” in order to drive down costs, and combine the project with co-operative structures to keep housing within the community. All managed through a neat-looking app.</p>



<div id="w-node-2227ad890b79"><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99d234ed0583a59caba_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F21b99d3b-2ea6-47b7-b930-5c8a9f0856ff_1200x675.jpeg?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Related to this, is IKEA’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18652178/ikea-rognan-robot-murphy-bed-furniture-ori-living-democratic-design-days">announcement</a> that it will start to create robotic furniture for small spaces. Rolling out in places like Hong Kong and Japan, micro-apartments will be the first to feel the benefits of the Rognan furniture, which transforms easily depending on what you need to use at the time. The idea is that one will not use a certain section of the place while busy doing something else, like not using the bed if you’re on the sofa – and Rognan helps to maximise space accordingly.</p>



<div id="w-node-cb2d728635af"><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99ed5fd03adadf17e70_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F29718baf-50d5-4c9d-917e-55d18b183521_1000x563.gif?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="New IKEA collaboration features robotic furniture for small space living |  6sqft" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>In the near future, I would also see IKEA getting into the workspaces sector, providing low-cost offices for freelancers and even startups looking to cut costs. Coworking is expected to grow to an estimated <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-coworking-spaces-market-2020-2030---covid-19-growth-deviations-trends--developments-competitive-landscape-analysis-301078785.html">$11.52 billion in 2023</a>, with Europe, IKEA’s home territory, leading the way, which makes it easier for the company to integrate this sector into its current BoKlok partnership with Skanska.</p>



<h3>3. the Smart Home</h3>



<p>In more recent years, IKEA added smart home products in its catalogue. While the company was relatively late to the party, today the IKEA customer has a number of functional smart products to choose from and which can be easily connected through the IKEA Home smart app, as well as other third-party applications. In typical IKEA fashion, its mantra of ‘making not using space’, the company did not just copy other smart appliances – IKEA’s wireless chargers can be integrated into furniture, and a SONOS Bluetooth speaker is produced either as a bookshelf or as a lamp, and both work with Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri voice assistants. This is certainly an area were IKEA will be looking to improve on. By creating its own smart technology as an integrated part of its furniture, the company would be able to get a better understanding of how its products are being used, for how long, and can even signal to the owner when that furniture needs repairing or replacing.</p>



<div id="w-node-55f2fdd96208"><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99d04c5930384f862ec_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fe8f7e7b8-c1c0-42f4-825c-24b79e539dea_970x646.jpeg?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="The Review: Is the New Ikea x Sonos Speaker Worth It? - Western Living  Magazine" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>A series of projects called ‘<a href="https://www.everydayexperiments.com/">Everyday Experiments</a>’, by SPACE10, continue on this trend of making sure that the smart appliances being created are beneficial to the consumer. These experiments recognise the increasing multi-dimensional use of one’s house, from living quarters, to play areas, to work stations. The latter is an increasingly important part of one’s home, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Smart improvements to the house have to respect the serenity one looks for in a home, making life easier and more comfortable, while avoiding adding further technological distractions. There are also, of course, privacy issues when it comes to smart furniture or appliances, so IKEA would also be wary of further technological intrusiveness on its customers.</p>



<p>Some of these experiments are more likely to be used in everyday situations than others, such as the one using <a href="https://www.everydayexperiments.com/light-gestures">hand gestures</a> to control a light fitting, making it easier for someone to switch on/off or dim the lights without having to move.</p>



<div id="w-node-af9a579989cd"><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99d7943e0448eb6f49c_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F9bd14c8f-8475-47d4-85ce-df380139d4f9_900x504.png?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>While IKEA might need to collaborate with other technological companies, such as SONOS, and depend on Google, Amazon, and Apple for voice assistants in order to grow its smart ecosystem in the short term, its better understanding of the home and what tenants want from it, allow IKEA to be in a position to create superior, practical smart appliances, than other companies in the field. Björn Block, Business Leader at IKEA Home Smart, himself <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21024497/ikea-smart-home-tech-sweden-furniture-sonos-meatballs-bjorn-block">said that</a>:</p>



<p>“We’re (<em>IKEA</em>) definitely into the tech space, we’re into the digital space, and we really want to be here and really play this because I think that we can also make a difference.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>The 250 US federal agencies and businesses that fell victim to the recent cyber attack had one thing in common – they all used software provided by SolarWinds Worldwide, LLC (“SolarWinds”).&nbsp; TermScout – a software contract rating company –&nbsp; looked at the standard customer contract that SolarWinds customers are asked to sign – the <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/-/media/solarwinds/swdcv2/legal/legal-documents/solarwinds-software-services-agreement.ashx?la=en&amp;hash=C9D4ACDBAE48680890EF52C6E4663B0C9208F341">Software Services Agreement</a> (“SSA”).&nbsp; In this article, we explore what the SSA says about how risk is allocated between SolarWinds and its customers in this type of event, assuming a customer is able to prove that SolarWinds is liable, under breach of contract or some other theory.</p><p><span>[TermScout is not commenting on whether or not SolarWinds is liable or responsible for this breach.&nbsp; This article is purely a hypothetical analysis that analyzes how the SSA purports to allocate risk on such matters.]</span></p><h2>Overall</h2><p>While the SSA does commit SolarWinds to basic data security standards (see Data Security Commitments below), the limits on SolarWinds’ liability will likely keep most customers from recovering any or all of their damages, even if they’re able to prove that SolarWinds breached the agreement or otherwise would be liable (i.e. under another theory such as tort).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>SolarWinds’ total liability for direct damages is capped at the amount paid or payable by the customer in the last 12 months, and SolarWinds is not liable for any type of indirect damages.&nbsp; Notably, there are no exceptions to these limits on SolarWinds’ liability.&nbsp; This means that even if a customer that signed the SSA can prove that SolarWinds is liable for damages the customer suffers as a result of this breach, it is unlikely to recover more than 12 months’ worth of fees.</p><p>While capping liability at 12 months’ fees is very common (<a href="https://termscout.com/contract-comparison/incident-management-software">all 3 companies TermScout has reviewed in the Incident Management Software category</a> (“IMS”) do this), failing to carve out any exceptions from the limits is uncommon, and is one of many red flags that TermScout tracks.&nbsp; The other 2 IMS companies reviewed carve out liabilities related to third party IP infringement, but none carve out liabilities related to data security or data breach issues. &nbsp; While this approach is not uncommon, we are seeing more and more companies accept increased liability for violating their data security commitments.&nbsp; <a href="https://termscout.com/contract-review/cloud-platform-as-a-service-paas-software/snowflake">Snowflake</a>, for example, doubles the amount a customer can recover for data security-related issues – to 2 times 12 months’ fees [12(c), <span><a href="https://1amiydhcmj36tz3733v94f15-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2019Aug23-Snowflake-Terms-of-Service-eo.pdf">Snowflake’s TOS</a>]</span>.</p><p>Taking into account the above factors and a number of other considerations, <a href="https://termscout.com/contract-review/primary-comparison/solarwinds#methodology">SolarWinds’ SSA earned the TermScout overall rating of <strong>Extremely</strong> <strong>Unfavorable</strong></a> – the worst of the 3 IMS companies we have reviewed.</p><h2>Data Security Commitments</h2><p>For every software contract TermScout looks at, it answers the data-security questions shown in the table below, among others.&nbsp; This data, along with similar data from 17 other contractual topics (e.g., limits on liability, indemnification, etc.), is used to calculate overall contract favorability so that TermScout customers can quickly understand the level of risk they take on when signing new contracts (<span>Learn more about TermScout’s methodology </span><a href="https://pages.termscout.com/methodology/"><span>here</span></a>).</p><p>TermScout considers the following to be basic minimum requirements that customers look for in contracts – customers with leverage or heightened data risks may seek stronger protections.</p><table id="tablepress-2"><thead><tr><th>Question</th><th>SolarWinds SSA</th><th>Citation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Does the vendor make any contractually binding commitments with respect to its data security standards or practices?</td><td>Yes, to “maintain appropriate administrative, physical, technical and organizational measures that ensure an appropriate level of security for Confidential Information and Personal Data.”</td><td>7.2, SSA</td></tr><tr><td>Which third party data security audits, standards, or certifications does the vendor commit to?</td><td>EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework</td><td>Privacy Shield, Privacy Notice (1)</td></tr><tr><td>Does the contract provide a list of subprocessors?</td><td>Yes</td><td>5.2, DPA (2)</td></tr><tr><td>Does the vendor commit to ensuring that its sub-processors will be bound by the same or similar data or privacy commitments as those contained in the contract?</td><td>Yes</td><td>5.2, DPA</td></tr><tr><td>Does the vendor commit to any form of data breach notification policy?</td><td>Yes</td><td>7, DPA</td></tr><tr><td>Are claims related to any form of data security issues excluded from the limits on Vendor’s liability?</td><td>No</td><td>11, SSA</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://pages.termscout.com/wp-content/uploads/Solarwind-Footnotes.png" alt="" width="777" height="64" srcset="https://pages.termscout.com/wp-content/uploads/Solarwind-Footnotes.png 777w, https://pages.termscout.com/wp-content/uploads/Solarwind-Footnotes-480x40.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 777px, 100vw"></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Customers that signed the SolarWinds standard SSA will have limited rights of recovery.&nbsp; Many companies still sign software agreements and other click-throughs without any form of review, rolling the dice with unknown risks and granting vendors carte blanche to write the rules of engagement unchecked.</p><p>TermScout helps companies quickly assess risk in contracts so that customers can easily understand what they’re signing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>By: Otto Hanson, Founder &amp;

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://outlookzen.com/2015/05/25/avoiding-the-next-financial-meltdown/" target="_blank">In past articles</a>, we have discussed how big-corporations, particularly in the financial industry, put at risk our economy and financial system. Recent events around Gamestop trading, have served as a perfect illustration of the risks and dangers inherent to Big Banks.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Context:</strong> There has recently been <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze" target="_blank">a frenzy of trading activity in shares of Gamestop</a>. Once languishing in the doldrums, its shares attracted large numbers of short-sellers from institutional investors, particularly hedge funds. At some point, mom-and-pop retail investors realized that they had a big opportunity in front of them. First, they argued that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZTr1-Gp74U&amp;ab_channel=RoaringKitty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fundamentals of the business were being underestimated</a> (just like themselves) by the financial elites. Second, they noticed that with such huge short-sale positions, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-mania-explained-how-the-reddit-retail-trading-crowd-ran-over-wall-street-pros.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the short-sellers would be made tremendously vulnerable if the shares were to appreciate in value</a> – which would in turn drive up the share price even more. Championed by a hitherto unknown “Roaring Kitty aka /u/DeepFuckingValue”, these mom-and-pop investors bet big on Gamestop shares, sending the stock price soaring.</p>



<p>As expected, the hedge funds and other financial elites who had made the opposite bet, found themselves in hot water. At the start of trading on Thursday, they faced the prospect of tremendous losses, if Gamestop shares were to continue appreciating. As feared, the shares came roaring out of the gate – jumping from $260 to $468, in the first 30 minutes alone. And that is when rules of the game changed. </p>



<p>Robinhood, the most popular trading platform for mom-and-pop investors, announced right at this critical point, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that its investors would no longer be allowed to buy Gamestop shares</a>. Not even with their own money. Most telling, they were still allowed to sell their shares, but they certainly weren’t allowed to buy any. The upward trajectory was immediately halted, and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/chart?p=GME#eyJpbnRlcnZhbCI6MSwicGVyaW9kaWNpdHkiOjEsImNhbmRsZVdpZHRoIjozLjU4OTE3MTk3NDUyMjI5Mywidm9sdW1lVW5kZXJsYXkiOnRydWUsImFkaiI6dHJ1ZSwiY3Jvc3NoYWlyIjp0cnVlLCJjaGFydFR5cGUiOiJsaW5lIiwiZXh0ZW5kZWQiOmZhbHNlLCJtYXJrZXRTZXNzaW9ucyI6e30sImFnZ3JlZ2F0aW9uVHlwZSI6Im9obGMiLCJjaGFydFNjYWxlIjoibGluZWFyIiwicGFuZWxzIjp7ImNoYXJ0Ijp7InBlcmNlbnQiOjEsImRpc3BsYXkiOiJHTUUiLCJjaGFydE5hbWUiOiJjaGFydCIsImluZGV4IjowLCJ5QXhpcyI6eyJuYW1lIjoiY2hhcnQiLCJwb3NpdGlvbiI6bnVsbH0sInlheGlzTEhTIjpbXSwieWF4aXNSSFMiOlsiY2hhcnQiLCJ2b2wgdW5kciJdfX0sImxpbmVXaWR0aCI6Miwic3RyaXBlZEJhY2tncm91bmQiOnRydWUsImV2ZW50cyI6dHJ1ZSwiY29sb3IiOiIjMDA4MWYyIiwic3RyaXBlZEJhY2tncm91ZCI6dHJ1ZSwiZXZlbnRNYXAiOnsiY29ycG9yYXRlIjp7ImRpdnMiOnRydWUsInNwbGl0cyI6dHJ1ZX0sInNpZ0RldiI6e319LCJjdXN0b21SYW5nZSI6eyJzdGFydCI6MTYxMTg0NDIwMDAwMCwiZW5kIjoxNjExODY3NTQwMDAwfSwic3ltYm9scyI6W3sic3ltYm9sIjoiR01FIiwic3ltYm9sT2JqZWN0Ijp7InN5bWJvbCI6IkdNRSIsInF1b3RlVHlwZSI6IkVRVUlUWSIsImV4Y2hhbmdlVGltZVpvbmUiOiJBbWVyaWNhL05ld19Zb3JrIn0sInBlcmlvZGljaXR5IjoxLCJpbnRlcnZhbCI6MSwidGltZVVuaXQiOiJtaW51dGUifV0sInN0dWRpZXMiOnsidm9sIHVuZHIiOnsidHlwZSI6InZvbCB1bmRyIiwiaW5wdXRzIjp7ImlkIjoidm9sIHVuZHIiLCJkaXNwbGF5Ijoidm9sIHVuZHIifSwib3V0cHV0cyI6eyJVcCBWb2x1bWUiOiIjMDBiMDYxIiwiRG93biBWb2x1bWUiOiIjRkYzMzNBIn0sInBhbmVsIjoiY2hhcnQiLCJwYXJhbWV0ZXJzIjp7IndpZHRoRmFjdG9yIjowLjQ1LCJjaGFydE5hbWUiOiJjaGFydCIsInBhbmVsTmFtZSI6ImNoYXJ0In19fSwidGltZVVuaXQiOiJtaW51dGUiLCJyYW5nZSI6eyJkdExlZnQiOiIyMDIxLTAxLTI4VDA1OjAwOjAwLjgwNVoiLCJkdFJpZ2h0IjoiMjAyMS0wMS0yOVQwNDo1OTowMC44MDVaIiwicGVyaW9kaWNpdHkiOnsiaW50ZXJ2YWwiOjEsInBlcmlvZCI6MSwidGltZVVuaXQiOiJtaW51dGUifSwicGFkZGluZyI6MH19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the share price collapsed from $468 to $130, within a couple hours</a>.

<p><strong>Within hours</strong>, Robinhood found themselves under a huge magnifying glass. Politicians as divided as AOC, Ted Cruz and <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2021/01/28/elizabeth-warren-gamestop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Warren</a>, all protested the flagrant unfairness of what was happening to mom-and-pop investors. There were <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">countless lawsuits filed</a>, and wide-ranging calls for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/sec-reviewing-recent-trading-volatility-amid-gamestop-frenzy-vows-to-protect-retail-investors.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the SEC to investigate what had occurred</a>. But this was only the tip of the iceberg. Soon, a more dangerous story emerged.</p>

<p>Apparently, Robinhood’s biggest customer, source of revenue, and the firm that processes a lot of their user’s trades, <strong>is the same firm</strong> that has also bailed out the original Gamestop short seller, manages $35B in investments, and has a financial stake in driving down Gamestop’s share price. With incentives like these, it’s hardly surprising if Robinhood’s restrictions were motivated by Citadel’s larger agenda of depressing the share price, and the levers they have available to pull.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Let me be clear</strong> about one thing. I am not here to convict Citadel or Robinhood of any crimes. At this point, far more investigation is required, before we can reach any conclusions on what exactly happened.</p>



<p>That said, any clear eyed view of the above chain of events, can only reach one conclusion. Our current financial and economic system is dangerously suspect. Imagine a world where your doctor has bet a million dollars on you dying soon. Imagine a world where a criminal suspect’s parent is made lead investigator in the case. Regardless of whether these individuals acted inappropriately, any competent person would realize that the system is dangerously broken.</p>



<p><em>When people repeatedly face conflicts of interest, they will eventually behave unethically to further their own interests</em>. When you have a single firm that takes long-term investment stakes, while simultaneously facilitating retail trading activity as a market-maker and paying retail brokerage firms tens of millions of dollars, unethical behavior will inevitably happen. Trying to plug these leaks as and when they happen, investigating every individual case one-by-one, is simply a never ending game of whack-a-mole.</p>



<p>Our economy is fundamentally rigged in favor of big-corporations, and stop-gap solutions will simply not do. The only way to attack the problem is to go to the very source. <strong>We need to break up the big Corporations</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We need to break them up into discrete businesses. Each with their own independent CEO and board-of-directors. Each pursuing a single line-of-business. Each free from any conflict of interests, and potential for collusion. Each large enough to run their own business successfully and efficiently, but small enough that they don’t have the power to bribe Congress, bully smaller competitors, collude across different market segments, and rewrite the rules of the game. Each operating independently, in a free and competitive market.</p>



<p>Big corporations are fundamentally antithetical to a level playing field. It is time we broke them up.</p>

    <section>
      <p>I’ve long felt the same way about personal computers that Matt Crawford feels about cars: &nbsp;it is important to build your own PC so that you can have more control over a technology that you use every day.</p><p>I have been building my own PCs since the mid-1990s, when I put together my first machine using a NexGen Intel-clone processor. &nbsp;Since then I have not bought a whole PC; when I want better performance, I simply add more memory, put in new hard disks, upgrade the graphics card, or swap out the motherboard and CPU.</p><p>Windows-based computers are not hard to build. &nbsp;You just buy the parts—motherboard, CPU, memory, disk storage, a case, monitor and graphics card, and plug them together. &nbsp;There are a number of little tricks you learn along the way, like properly seating the cooling fan on top of the microprocessor, or inserting the memory sticks into their sockets the right way. &nbsp;But PCs are highly modular and standardized, and the standards don’t shift that often—from SCSI connectors to SATA, or from DDR3 to DDR4, or DVI to DisplayPort to connect the monitor. &nbsp;You just need to keep straight what the current standards are, and buy accordingly.</p><figure><img src="https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 600w, https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 1000w, https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 1600w, https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 2016w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Getting ready for a build</figcaption></figure><p>Building your own machine has quite a number of advantages. &nbsp;You can customize them to exactly the uses you intend. Not everyone is a gamer who requires a humongous 16GB graphics card. &nbsp;You can get away with a rather modest machine if you’re just trying to create a home entertainment system. &nbsp;You can put your computer in a nice case that will fit easily on your desk. Recently I’ve taken to using a $50 Raspberry Pi-based computer to read the newspaper in the morning. &nbsp;In recent years AMD has pulled ahead of Intel in the CPU wars; why not shift over to their chips? &nbsp;Maintenance is much easier: computers, like human beings, seldom fail as complete systems; rather, an individual component goes on the fritz and needs to be replaced. &nbsp;Because something has failed on your motherboard does not mean you need to replace your keyboard, mouse, and monitor. &nbsp;If you have built your own machine, you can usually diagnose a problem down the road. &nbsp;For example, if you don’t hear the little “beep” when you turn it on, you know the machine has failed to post and that there’s something wrong with your BIOS. On the other hand, if it posts but hangs up when loading Windows, you suspect your copy of the operating system has been corrupted and needs to be reinstalled.</p><p>From the standpoint of someone who wants to maximize their technological autonomy, Apple computers are an absolute nightmare. &nbsp;Although I still own an Apple laptop, I seldom use it and definitely do not love my iPhone. &nbsp;Apple products were deliberately designed to prevent their users from modifying them, down to the use of proprietary fasteners that require special Apple-only tools. &nbsp;I tried to get into an old Mac laptop with my sons a few years ago; we ended up with a lot of useless bent metal trying to force our way in. &nbsp;Apple does not want you to be able to fix your own computer—rather, it wants you to visit the “Genius Bar” at the Apple Store and look over all the new products while you wait for someone to fix your machine in the back room. &nbsp;The “genius” refers not to you, the helpless customer, but to the marketing guy who thought up this system.</p><p>Apple is constantly making its users adopt proprietary connectors that you are forced to buy from them. &nbsp;An example is the “lightning” connector that was first introduced on the iPhone 7 and replaced the old 3.5mm headphone jack. &nbsp;Apple claims that this change was made to improve the user experience, but really they just want to force you to buy new headphones or adapters. &nbsp;They’ve similarly changed the plug on their power cords so often that you have to discard one from just a couple of years ago in favor of their most recent model. &nbsp;Landfills around the world are brimming with useless Apple power adapters.</p><p>Microsoft, as I well remember, tried to get away with something like this in the 1990s. &nbsp;The programming language Java had been created as a common, open standard that would operate across a variety of platforms—Macs, PCs, Linux, and so on. &nbsp;Microsoft then tried to “fork” the language and create a version that would only run on its own machines, which it could do because so many people used Windows PCs. &nbsp;This became part of the Justice Department’s decade-long antitrust suit against Microsoft, which in the end forced the latter to stand down.</p><p>You can only get away with this sort of behavior if you hold a near-monopolistic position in the marketplace, and the huge scale of tech companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon has become a major challenge for our democracy. Unfortunately, after the Microsoft case, the U.S. stopped trying to enforce antitrust laws against Big Tech. This is a pattern that has only recently been reversed.</p><p>So learning to build your own computer reduces your acquisition costs, keeps down operating expenses, means that you can fix your machine when it breaks down on a weekend, and otherwise gives you the satisfaction of knowing exactly what’s under the hood of your computer. &nbsp;You’ve clawed back a little bit of personal autonomy.</p>

		<div itemprop="articleBody">
			<p><span>U</span>nder a coral ledge, a day octopus and a brown-marbled grouper meet. The grouper was there first, as if waiting, and they emerge together; the octopus zips ahead, skin turning from deep scarlet to purple-blue, and arrives at a boulder. Beneath the boulder is a hollow, a perfect hiding place for small prey. The octopus’s skin flickers and momentarily resembles the grouper’s own mottled scales before reverting to blue. They converge side-by-side in front of the hollow, seeming to consider it.</p> <p>Again the octopus’ skin mottles, and then again, the second time not much resembling the grouper’s patterns but rather a constellation of lights. The octopus swims to the boulder’s far side and makes a barrier with tentacles now spread flat and turned white. The grouper dives into the hollow, looking for fish whose escape routes have been blocked. Never mind the 500-million-year taxonomic gulf that separates them. Hunger, opportunity, and smarts cross that divide easily, hinting at adaptations that could help these unlikely partners navigate lean years ahead and providing an interspecies union to tickle human imaginations.</p> <p>“Crossing a phylum gap like this is almost like a human talking to a snail,” says Daniel Bayley, a marine biologist at University College London. “It’s amazing to watch.” Bayley and Amelia Rose of Oxford University observed octopuses working with brown-marbled grouper—and with peacock grouper and gold-saddle goatfish, too—in sunlit shallows off atolls in the northern Chagos Archipelago, a remote chain of islands in the Indian Ocean. The incidents caught their attention: While multispecies associations are not uncommon in the animal kingdom, it’s unusual to see such them between such different creatures. What’s more, this was a true collaboration.</p>  <figure><iframe width="733" height="412" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m7Ql6CPiGPw?c frameborder=" 0"="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption><span>Daniel Bayley</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The animals were not merely taking advantage of the other’s activities, as happens when fish follow turtles across the seafloor, snapping up critters scattered by their sediment-disturbing foraging. They actively communicated with one another—not unlike <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/02/coyote-badger-video-behavior-friends/" target="_blank">the coyote and badger</a> who starred in a viral video last year, with the coyote making a distinctive canine play bow to invite the badger along. There’s a lot of cognitive sophistication packed into such interactions.</p> <p>That octopuses would be involved is likely no surprise for people attuned to a cephalopod-celebrating <i>zeitgeist</i> inspired by books like Sy Montgomery’s best-selling <i>The Soul of an Octopus</i> and the wildly popular documentary <i>My Octopus Teacher</i>, which showed marvelous behaviors that had yet to be described scientifically: an octopus camouflaging herself with seashells, or playing with schools of fish. Popular footage likewise preceded description with octopus-grouper unions <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5072371/Blue-Planet-fish-octopus-clever-chimps.html" target="_blank">featured in the <i>Blue Planet II</i></a> television series and in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=octopus++and+grouper" target="_blank">a handful of YouTube videos</a>. In the Chagos Archipelago, though, Bayley and Rose had the chance to observe the collaborations in detail.</p><blockquote><p>If you think about it, that’s like us speaking to fish.</p> </blockquote><p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10236244.2020.1746658?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true" target="_blank">As they recount in a study</a> published in the journal <i>Marine and Freshwater Behaviour and Physiology</i>, the researchers even started to decipher some of the signals. When octopuses preceded the hunt with what Bayley and Rose called a “pounce” gesture, engulfing corals with their mantle and turning white, it was their fish partners who ate. When instead octopuses made a “groping” gesture, inserting tentacles into a crack or crevice, it was their turn to dine. “It was very much a give-and-take scenario,” Bayley said. Other gestures and skin-pattern signals remain uninterpreted.

Do octopuses give the go-ahead? Or fish? And how are partners chosen? Brown pointed to research on groupers cooperating with moray eels to hunt. Those fish <a href="https://www.wired.com/?p=1534651" target="_blank">select the most competent eels</a>, demonstrating a collaborative sophistication once thought limited to humans and certain primates. He also noted that, while octopuses seemed to take the lead, the collaborations seen by Bayley and Rose demand quite a bit of intelligence from the fish as well.</p><div>

</div> <p>Bayley’s own specialty is coral reef ecology, and his curiosity is piqued by what the cooperation represents. Though scientists have studied the Chagos Archipelago for decades, he said, no record exists of octopuses and fish hunting together there. He suspects it’s a recent adaptation. In the last several years, climate change-induced coral die-offs have radically disrupted the reefs’ animal populations and changed their very topography. There is much less prey than before; fields of rubble are not ideal for ambush-style hunting tactics that once worked so well.</p> <p>“This could be driving this novel interaction where both fish and octopus are searching for food, but their individual hunting strategies are not best for this flattened environment that’s losing a lot of its structure,” Bayley explained. Partnerships with gold-saddle goatfish are also notable in that they are adapted to find prey buried in sediment. “It’s another skill set to bring in. It’s almost like the octopus is assembling a team with specialist skills,” said Bayley.</p> <p>Another fascinating question, he said, is how knowledge spreads of hunting strategies and mutually understood signals. Perhaps each participating octopus and fish works it out for themselves, through trial and error—or perhaps, following an initial breakthrough, knowledge spreads by observation or even active teaching. That would make it a cultural adaptation, a matter of accumulating knowledge passed between generations, an example of species surviving in a fast-changing world not because of some fortunate genetic mutation but because they are learning. This also suggests a potentially key role for grouper. Unlike day octopuses, who reach a ripe old age at 15 months, brown-marbled and peacock grouper can easily live 40 years or longer. They may be a living library for their short-lived partners.</p> <p>That the Chagos Archipelago is so remote and well-protected—commercial fishing is banned there—may also help these underwater cultures evolve and proliferate, Bayley said. Individuals who would otherwise spread their knowledge don’t end up on a dinner plate. Brown agreed, noting an emerging scientific literature on <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6431/1032.summary" target="_blank">the importance of animal culture to conservation</a> and also the hypothesis that a loss of culture has hindered the recovery of some populations from overfishing. “One of the explanations is that we’ve basically fished out the cultural information about where to forage, where to migrate, where the best breeding grounds are,” he said. “If you’re consistently removing the biggest, the oldest and wisest, from the population, then that information is lost.”</p> <p>That understanding adds new importance to halting overfishing, and also to curbing pollution and excessive underwater noise that can impair learning, in other parts of the ocean—and maybe the sheer wonder of watching octopuses and fish work together can help inspire people to take action. Brown, echoing Bayley, marveled at the cross-phylum communication. “If you think about it, that’s like us speaking to fish,” said Brown, who could not think of an example of humans communicating in such a sophisticated manner with either fish or cephalopods. The closest analogue is people and their dogs. “It’s pretty astonishing,” he said.</p>  <p><i>Brandon Keim (<a href="https://twitter.com/9brandon" target="_blank">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.instagram.com/9brandon/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>) is a science and nature journalist.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><img alt="rails saml abstract" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4e19e5a1a96df85fc6b0aedeb7ec10a2947d23e7/44b01/img/railssaml.jpg"><h3>SAML Background<a href="#saml-background" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>SAML SSO refers to an authentication mechanism preferred by enterprise companies. The SSO part stands for Single Sign-On. From the enterprise’s perspective, they desire a centralized service where their employees can authenticate, which then provides authenticated access to the applications they use for work. These services are called Identity Providers (IDPs), and they are the <em>Single</em> place where enterprise employees <em>Sign-On.</em> This is an alternative to employees using password-based authentication for each of the various applications they use.</p><p>The SAML part stands for Secure Assertion Markup Language. SAML utilizes a domain-specific flavor of XML that describes an authenticated user, encoded to a string and passed to your application in a query parameter. Your application decodes the <code>SAMLResponse</code> using a key that the enterprise provides to you.</p><p>The details of the SAML Response are less important than understanding the general flow. When a user wants to sign in using SAML, you must send that user to their Identity Provider with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> that identifies your application. The user signs in to their IDP, and is redirected back to you with the <code>SAMLResponse</code>. What makes this a tiny bit complicated for a multi-tenant application is routing the user to the correct IDP, as SAML SSO breaks our common understanding of a login flow.</p><p>A typical login screen might have an email and password field, then a few buttons to sign in with OAuth services, like Google or GitHub. But now, you’ll need to gather something from the user who wants to sign in such that you can send them to the correct IDP instance.  We like to say that SAML is <em>instance based</em>, especially when <a href="https://ossoapp.com/blog/saml-vs-oauth">compared to OAuth</a>, which we can think of as <em>class based</em>. Domain is a common key for this process - you can ask a user for their email, grab the domain, and use that as a key to find the correct IDP instance and redirect the user.</p><h3>Let’s Build and Iterate<a href="#lets-build-and-iterate" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Once you wrap your head around understanding the SAML flow, it’s really not challenging to implement SAML in a Rails app - IDPs themselves offer great open source libraries to help with your integration. You can definitely get very far in a day or two. But like most things in engineering, the last 10% can take 90% of the effort, and while we all love to say “I could build that in a weekend,” we often later eat our words when we realize all of the edge cases, documentation needs, scaling challenges and unknown unknowns that make this or any other project worth doing a bit more involved than a quick weekend hack.</p><p>I’m a co-founder of an open source company Osso - our microservice is a Ruby and React app that allows you to onboard SAML SSO customers, generates custom documentation for each customer to perform their onboarding tasks in their IDP, and allows your Rails app to consume Osso using OAuth - we even provide <code>omniauth-osso</code> to make consuming an Osso instance from your Rails app incredibly simple.</p><p>Osso also offers paid plans, and you can skip right to our <a href="https://ossoapp.com/pricing">pricing page</a> to learn more about hosted Osso if you need SAML yesterday. Or you can jump right in to <a href="https://ossoapp.com/docs/deploy/overview">deploying an open source Osso instance</a> from our GitHub repo. There’s certainly the possibility of using <code>osso-rb</code> in your Rails app directly — you’ll want to mount our 3 rack based apps, pull in migrations, etc. — but this post will focus instead on a microservices approach.</p><p><strong>So</strong>, if you’d like to begin from first principles, follow along here as we build up a production-ready SAML SSO integration, starting with a single tenant approach, then layering in multi-tenancy. Once we have multi-tenant support, we’ll address questions about scalability and serviceability — how can we repeatedly add additional tenants, without spending significant engineering or customer support cycles? I <em>will</em> encourage you to use Osso, and show you exactly how, but will also highlight the things you need to be considering in order to roll out a production ready SAML integration <em>without</em> Osso.</p><p>We’ll use a single Rails app repository throughout this tutorial. The <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">main branch</a> is a barebones Rails 6 app with Devise and a User model, and for each of our steps below we’ll move to a feature branch so we can see a full diff. Each step adds more functionality, getting you closer to a production-ready, multi-tenant integration. Each step also uses open source software, where the library used in the previous step is a dependency of the next step’s library. Neat!</p><p>We’ll also make use of Osso’s <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mock IDP</a> and <a href="https://demo.ossoapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo instance</a>, especially when we get into multi-tenancy. You’ll still want to register with an IDP for a developer account in order to have access to an IDP for a second tenant - we recommend an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okta developer account</a>.</p><h3>Base Rails application<a href="#base-rails-application" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We’ll use the same Rails 6 application for each step - the source code is available [here] (<a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails</a>). The <code>main</code> branch adds Devise with a User model to a brand new Rails app using Postgres as the database. The application doesn’t do anything - there is an index route and a logged in route that will tell you the email for the current user. This guide assumes proficiency with Rails, so it will skip some details. We’ll also use some intentionally naive approaches to demonstrate common challenges of SAML SSO. </p><h3>Single tenant<a href="#single-tenant" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h4>With ruby-saml and mock IDP<a href="#with-ruby-saml-and-mock-idp" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>My first experience with SAML was working on <a href="https://medium.com/@tsharon/democratizing-ux-670b95fbc07f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internal software at WeWork</a> where one of my Osso co-founders was a teammate. The IT department required us to use SAML SSO, which I at first was awfully annoyed by. Google OAuth was super easy, and could be restricted to domain, so what’s the deal with this OneLogin thing? Fortunately, single-tenant SAML was just as simple to implement, and admittedly did include some better security. This is a common situation — an enterprise company requires SAML, and it might seem silly to you, but them’s the rules.</p><p>Our project was a Rails app, and we used a Ruby gem from OneLogin to handle the actual SAML encoding and decoding. Since we were building this app for WeWork employees, we had a single tenant, and didn’t need to worry about implementing a scalable solution for multiple tenants, documenting how to set SAML up for the app or training our teammates on how it worked. We also didn’t need to change our login form - we knew every user would be sent to the same IDP instance, so we were able to use a simple <em>Sign in With OneLogin</em> button.</p><p>That’s what we’ll do here, and if you’re building internal software this will be a fine approach for your production release! We’ll use Osso’s mock IDP for this single tenant to keep things simple too.</p><p>First lets install the ruby-saml gem. We’ll include it in our Gemfile and run <code>$ bundle install</code>.</p><p>We’ll use this library in two ways:</p><p>First, when a user wishes to sign in with SAML, we use ruby-saml to generate a url with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> - the URL is where we will send the user to sign in, and the <code>SAMLRequest</code> is sent along as a query param in order to identify our application to the IDP.</p><p>When the user signs in to their IDP, they will be sent back to your application with a <code>SAMLResponse</code> query param. We then use ruby-saml to decode and validate the <code>SAMLResponse</code>, allowing us to access information describing the user, such as their email address.</p><p>Lets define a couple of routes and controller actions to handle this flow.</p><p>In the <code>saml_login</code> action, we create a <code>OneLogin::RubySaml::Authrequest</code> and redirect to the return value. Later, in the callback, we validate and decode the response, and will sign the user in and redirect them if valid. Otherwise we’ll raise the validation errors to understand where our SAML config went wrong.</p><p>This callback route will also need to accept a POST request with <code>www-url-form-encoded</code> parameters, so you will need to skip the Rails <code>verify_authenticity_token</code> <code>before_action</code>:</p><div><p>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</p></div><p>Both of these actions depend on what ruby-saml calls <code>settings</code>. These values are created via the configuration you must perform between your application and the Identity Provider. In a real-world example, your application generates a few values which you provide to your customer. The customer uses these to configure your application in their IDP and returns some data generated by the IDP. We’ll discuss this process in more detail later. Since we are using the Osso Mock IDP we can mostly skip this configuration step, but it’s worth understanding what each of these values represents, how it functions and why it might prevent your user from signing in if misconfigured.</p><p>Each of the controller actions above calls a private method <code>saml_settings</code>. Since we are dealing with a single tenant, we will essentially hardcode the SAML configuration values to support this one IDP instance.</p><div><p>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</p></div><p><strong>Values you provide</strong></p><p><strong>ACS URL</strong> - The Assertion Consumer Service URL is where the IDP will send the user with a SAMLResponse when they log in. Similar to a Redirect URI in OAuth, your application will generate this value according to how your routes are set up.</p><p><strong>SP Entity ID</strong>  - Sometimes called the Audience URI, this is a unique identifier for the tenant in your application. This can get hairy! <strong>Google</strong> requires that they be unique for a customer, so you can't just use domain, while <strong>Azure</strong> won't let you use a UUID and <strong>Ping</strong> won't let you use a url. Those are just <em>some</em> of the edge cases we've found!</p><p><strong>Values the IDP provides</strong></p><p><strong>IDP SSO Target URL</strong> - The single sign on target URL tells your application where to send a user with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> in order to sign in.</p><p><strong>IDP Certificate</strong> - An x509 certificate which includes a public key that your application uses to encode and decode the SAML request and response.</p><p>Since we are using the Mock IDP, these values can be found in the Mock IDP’s federated metadata: <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp/blob/main/metadata.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp/blob/main/metadata.xml</a></p><p>To enforce good security practices, we put the certificate in Rails credentials. We won't show you our whole certificate here, but here's part of an …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After the privacy related changes to WhatsApp, a lot of people are fleeing this popular chat application for other more privacy-aware choices. This development, made me consider Signal, again, as a chat service, but my decision to install it and try to move my contacts was <strong>not a privacy related one</strong>.</p><p>In Greece where me and most of my contacts live, WhatsApp isn’t as popular as Facebook’s Messenger, an app that lacks end-to-end encryption and as a result is considerably worse privacy-wise.</p><p>End-to-end encryption is a technical measure, implemented to make eavesdropping on your chat conversations impossible. It encrypts your messages from the moment they leave your device, till the moment they are received by your friend’s phone. In this way, nobody can use your conversations to sell your information to advertisers and no rogue government can read your messages to enforce laws. But for the average person living in a western democracy, who still (knowingly or unknowningly) uses Facebook and other ad-supported, privacy-invasive social networks, this feature is not as important as it seems.</p><p>Messenger, for me, is the best chat app in the world, because it has the only feature I need from a chat app. <strong>My contacts!</strong></p><p>If I want to contact somebody, I know that he will be there receiving my messages. This feature is enough for me to give up the promise of enchanced privacy.</p><p>It’s something different that should be more important.</p><h2 id="but-why-did-i-install-signal">But why did I install Signal?</h2><p>Although we feel that we can choose our chat service, the direct opposite happens. The best feature mainstream chat apps have, our contacts' usage of them, is the reason we are hostages to these applications. If we want to move to another chat application, we need to pursue all of our contacts to move. This is the great power Facebook is using irresponsibly.</p><p>This power is what takes away from us the right to choose who and why is using our data.</p><p>But more importantly, this power hinders innovation and progress. If a better chat application is released, then most people wouldn’t care to use it. That happens because it wouldn’t have the most important feature, their friends. Eventually, if this application is really better than the current offerings, the best features would be copied by the mainstream apps and the vicious cycle will continue.</p><p>Trying to go against this great power, I installed Signal. I chose Signal because it is in a way the direct opposite of what Facebook’s apps are. It is open-source, people can view and contribute to its code and it’s backed by a non-profit. It’s an app that implements changes based to what its community wants, it’s an app that can care about your opinion and your choices.</p><p><img src="https://chrispanag.com/posts/i-didnt-install-signal-for-privacy/signal-icon.jpg" alt="signal icon"></p><p>I immediately invited my closest contacts to join and… people joined, then agreed that this app is nice and afterwards nobody contacted me a second time through Signal. Everybody still used Messenger.</p><p>At the end, I completely understood their choice, or better, their <strong>lack of choice</strong>. If they wanted to keep in touch with their other friends, they still needed to use Messenger, and who wants to complicate their lives with multiple apps?</p><h2 id="at-the-end-what-can-we-do">At the end, what can we do?</h2><p>When the internet started proliferating, choice was one of its biggest advantages. We could choose the software we use, we could choose the services we access. But now, the massive social networks, with the power they have accumulated by our participation, have narrowed down our choices to the bare minimum.</p><p>The only way to change the situation is to force those social networks to use their powers more responsibly. Europe’s GDPR law with its <a href="https://www.privacypolicies.com/blog/gdpr-eight-user-rights/#6_The_Right_To_Data_Portability">right to data portability</a> is a step in the right direction, but it’s not enough. I believe we need more to regain our right to choose what services we use.</p><p>After portability, we need to discuss about <strong>interoperability</strong>, which in this case is the ability to contact people that are are using different chat applications than the one you are using. The way email and SMS already work.</p><p>Although this is still far-fetched, we need to finally start addressing it.</p><h2 id="further-reads">Further reads</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.jeremydormitzer.com/blog/what-is-activitypub.html">What is ActivityPub?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/signal-app-1148147/">Signal: What is it and why is everyone talking about it?</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-do-you-feel-about-the-right-to-choice">How do you feel about the right to choice?</h2><p>I would love to discuss more about it in the comments.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>I’m pleased to say, that M5Stack did it again. They managed to release another ESP32 based product and keep me on my tosies! From incredible small Atom (review pending), through most feature-packed M5StickC (<a href="https://notenoughtech.com/review/m5stickc-plus/">review</a>) to power development Fire Kit Core  (<a href="https://notenoughtech.com/review/this-esp32-is-on-fire-m5stack-core/">review</a>) – each product brought joy to my eyes despite being basically the same: an ESP32 based all-in-one development board. And they did it again thanks to <a href="https://m5stack.com/products/m5paper-esp32-development-kit-960x540-4-7-eink-display-235-ppi">M5Paper</a> – a unique mashup between ESP32 and e-ink displays.</p>

<p>It’s not the first ESP32 &amp; e-ink display combo, but it’s the first one I really wanted to have. Convincing M5Stack to send me one wasn’t the problem. The device is so high in demand, that I had to wait till Xmas to get mine. It is not just me that likes the concept. M5Paper is in stock right now, but if you are unlucky, it also surfaces on <a href="https://www.banggood.com/custlink/mDvdSKZvLF">Banggood</a> and <a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Af1yn5">AliExpress</a>.</p>



<p>M5Paper nails the design thanks to 4.7-inch, 940*540 multitouch 16 level grayscale e-ink display. It’s not just an e-ink ESP32 module, it’s a well-thought-through product that deserves everyone’s attention.  The phone form factor feels great in my hand and lightning-fast (for an e-ink) display creates this PDA alike impression. </p>




<h3>Inside M5Paper</h3>



<p>While the device doesn’t make it difficult to peak inside, M5Paper isn’t designed to be opened and tinkered with. You won’t find any hidden pins or ways to interact with the board, but there is enough space to swap the LiPo battery for a bigger one, in case 1150mAh isn’t enough. And you get 3 Grove connectors to plug external sensors and other fun add-ons. </p>

<p>Under the hood, M5Paper comes with a very familiar ESP32 module surrounded by pretty decent hardware – just take a look at the specs:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>SP32-D0WDQ6-V3</td><td>240MHz dual core, 600 DMIPS, 520KB SRAM, Wi-Fi, dual mode Bluetooth</td></tr><tr><td>Flash</td><td>16MB</td></tr><tr><td>PSRAM</td><td>8MB</td></tr><tr><td>Ports</td><td>TypeC*1, HY2.0-4P*3 , TF-card(microSD) slot</td></tr><tr><td>E-Ink Display</td><td>Model Number：EPD_ED047TC1 | 540*960@4.7″ | Grayscale : 16 Levels | Display area : 58.32*103.68mm | Display Driver : IT8951</td></tr><tr><td>Physical Button</td><td>Multi-function button*1 ， Reset Button*1</td></tr><tr><td>RTC</td><td>BM8563</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It’s a very clever design to include BM8563 Real-Time Clock, as you can save a lot of power by using RTC to trigger the events rather than sleep policies of ESP32. Combined with the e-ink, M5Paper can last ages on a single charge. This is reinforced by the default firmware as well. The power button at the back of the device disables ESP32 when pressed and the “volume” rocker wakes it up when held for a couple of seconds. </p>




<h3>Putting “kindle” into M5Paper</h3>



<p>The device feels like a small-sized phone in the hand. It has just enough screen estate to break the development board impression and appear as intriguing “kindle” alike device. It’s not an e-reader, M5Paper is even more awesome. The display is simply perfect as far as e-inks go. 16 level greyscale enables images and advanced shading while multitouch (2-point) touchscreen is responsive enough, so I don’t hate using the onscreen keyboard. </p>

<p>Navigating through menus is fairly quick, and even though menus take 2-3 screen refresh cycles to fully materialise, you can quickly jump from screen to screen. Frankly speaking, I played with less responsive LCD screens in the past!</p>



<p>Just remember, there is no backlight. The device is perfectly visible in a full sunshine, but completely useless in the dark.</p>




<h3>The “I’m still all-in-one development board”</h3>



<p>It’s not the first take on e-ink display by M5Stack. They merged it before with their Core INK – an e-ink-equipped take on M5Stick series. Unlike <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5stack-esp32-core-ink-development-kit1-54-elnk-display?variant=37404426174636">Core INK</a>, M5Paper is missing one thing that I really liked – the ability to program the board in the web browser wirelessly. I can only hope that the support will be added soon, as programming M5Stack wirelessly feels like magic.</p>



<p>Update: 23/01/2021: Dev team from M5Stack had confirmed that integration for UIFlow is on the way, we should see M5Paper joining the UIFlow as well soon!</p>

<p>Just like other M5Stack devices, M5Paper supports Arduino IDE &amp; MicroPython. The product is fairly new, so it lacks in community projects, but the documentation explains basics and shows you how to handle an e-ink display with sample projects. Apart from online examples, M5Paper supports M5Stack Burner software. You can try community projects and easily reverse back to the default firmware.</p>

<p>Unless an e-ink is what you really want, I’d pick <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5stack-esp32-core-ink-development-kit1-54-elnk-display?variant=37404426174636">Core INK</a> series if you are getting started. M5Paper expects customers a bit of knowledge to take the advantage of the ESP32 inside. The demo panel promises interesting features, but to my disappointment, the “Home Automation” panel isn’t released as a source code, and I cannot integrate it with my house appliances. It’s a shame. </p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>I’m a little disappointed that M5Paper isn’t compatible with UIFlow, I hope this will change with time. I do love the device and I’m already thinking about potential projects. If you feel comfortable with Arduino IDE programming, go for it. Hardware-wise, <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5paper-esp32-development-kit-960x540-4-7-eink-display-235-ppi">M5Paper</a> is an amazing device worth the money spent on it. But if you are getting started, expect a steeper learning curve, limited tutorial materials, perhaps, you would be better off with <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5stack-core2-esp32-iot-development-kit?variant=35960244109476">M5Stack Core 2 </a>or <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5stack-esp32-core-ink-development-kit1-54-elnk-display?variant=37404426174636">Core INK</a> instead. I will try to get my hands on both!

                    <p>You know that <a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/secrets-credentials-api-git/">adding secrets to your git repository</a> (even a private one) is a bad idea, because doing so <strong>risks exposing confidential information to the world</strong>. But mistakes were made, and now you need to figure out how to excise confidential information from your repo. <strong>Because git keeps a history of <em>everything</em>, it’s not often enough to simply remove the secret, commit, and push</strong>: we might need to do a bit of deep cleaning.</p><p><strong>Thankfully, for simpler cases, git provides commands that make cleaning things up easy</strong>. And in more complicated cases, we can use git-filter-repo, a tool recommended by the core git developers for deep cleaning an entire repository.</p><p>First and foremost, if there is reason to think that the secret has escaped into the world, and you can revoke the secret, do so. How to revoke a secret is going to vary quite a lot depending on what the secret protects. If you don’t know how to revoke it, you will need help from the owner of the resource protected by the secret.</p><blockquote>Need to quickly see what scenario applies to you? <br>check out our cheatsheet flow chart below</blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/da8kiytlc/image/upload/v1611932656/Cheatsheets/RewritingYourGitHistory-Cheatsheet-Final_weq1l2.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/da8kiytlc/image/upload/c_scale,r_6,w_500/v1611932656/Cheatsheets/RewritingYourGitHistory-Cheatsheet-Final_weq1l2.png"></a></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/da8kiytlc/image/upload/v1611932656/Cheatsheets/RewritingYourGitHistory-Cheatsheet-Final_weq1l2.pdf" target="_blank">Download the git history cheatsheet</a></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now, let’s consider different scenarios to see how to clean things up.</p><h2 id="no">NO</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>No? That’s great. Please don’t push it up just yet.If you have any uncommited work, we can use <code>git stash</code> to save it. This sets your work aside in a temporary “stash” so that we can work with the git repository without losing anything you haven’t committed yet. When we’re done cleaning things up, you can use <code>git stash pop</code> to restore your work.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="yes">YES</h2><p>If you have already pushed a commit containing a secret, or just discovered a secret in your existing history, things get more complicated if there are other people working on this branch. If you work alone, there’s nothing to do at this point, you can skip to the next step. If you work as part of a team, things get more complicated because we need everyone to act in a coordinated way.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>First of all, we need to determine who else is affected by the secret’s presence, because we’ll need to coordinate everyone’s actions. If the secret only appears in the branch you’re working on, you only need to coordinate with anyone else who is always working off of that branch. However, if you found the secret lurking further back in git history, perhaps in your <code>master</code> or <code>main</code> branch, you’ll need to coordinate with everyone working in the repository.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Let the others affected know that a secret was found that needs to be excised from everyone’s git history. When you edit the git history to remove a file, it can cause problems with your teammates’ local clones; moreover, they can end up re-inserting the secret back into the public repository when they push their work. So it is important that everyone affected is in sync for the excision to work. This means that everyone needs to stop what they are doing, close outstanding PRs, and push up work that’s in progress.</p><p>Now, let’s make a fresh clone.</p><ul><li>Delete your existing clone in its entirety.</li><li>Make a fresh clone with `git clone [repository URL]`</li><li>Change into the project directory with `cd [project name]`</li><li>Download the entire repository history: `git pull --all --tags`.</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The last step will look a little bit familiar. <code>git pull</code> tells git to grab updates from the remote repository, and apply them in the current branch (when it makes sense to do so, that is, when the local branch is set to track a remote branch). But git is smart, it doesn’t pull everything down, only what’s needed. This is where the <code>--all</code> flag comes in. This flag tells git to grab every branch from the remote repository. And the <code>--tags</code> flag tells git to grab every tag as well. So this command tells git to download the entire repository history, a complete and total clone. We have to do this, because it is possible that the commit containing the secret exists in more than one branch or tag. We need to ensure we don’t just scrub our secret from a portion of the repository history. As a result, this command can take a very long time, if the repository is very large.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Move on to the next step.</p><h2 id="the-secret-is-in-the-last-commit-and-there-s-nothing-else-in-the-last-commit">The secret is in the last commit, and there’s nothing else in the last commit</h2><p>In this case, we can drop the last commit in its entirety. We do this with</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD~1
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>What does this command do? Let’s break it apart a little bit. <code>git reset</code> is how we tell git that we want to undo recent changes. Normally, this command by itself tells git to unstage anything we’ve added with <code>git add</code>, but haven’t committed yet. This version of resetting isn’t sufficient for our purposes. But <code>git reset</code> is more flexible than that. We can tell git to take us back in time to a previous commit as well.We do that by telling git which commit to rewind to. We can use a commit’s identified (it’s “SHA”), or we can use an indirect reference. <code>HEAD</code> is what git calls the most recent commit on the checked out branch. <code>HEAD~1</code> means “the first commit prior to the most recent” (likewise <code>HEAD~2</code> means “two commits prior to the most recent”).<br>
Finally, the <code>--hard</code> tells git to throw away any differences between the current state and the state we’re resetting to. If you leave off the <code>--hard</code> your changes, including the secret, won’t be discarded. With <code>--hard</code>, the differences will be deleted, gone forever (which is precisely what we want!).</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Once you’ve done a hard reset, that’s it! You’re done. Your work has been destructively undone, and you can pick back up where you were.</p><h2 id="the-secret-is-in-the-last-commit-but-there-were-other-changes-too">The secret is in the last commit, but there were other changes too</h2><p>In this case, we don’t want to completely drop the last commit. We want to edit the last commit instead. Edit your code to remove the secrets, and then add your changes as usual. Then, instead of making a new commit, we’ll tell git we want to amend the previous one:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>git add [FILENAME]
git commit --amend
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We all know <code>git commit</code>, but the <code>--amend</code> flag is our friend here. This tells git that we want to edit the previous commit, rather than creating a new one. We can continue to make changes to the last commit in this way, right up until we’re ready to either push our work, or start on a new commit.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Once you’ve amended the commit, you’re done! The secret’s gone, you can carry on as you were.</p><h2 id="the-secret-is-beyond-the-last-commit">The secret is beyond the last commit</h2><p><strong>It’s complicated</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>If you know you committed a secret, but have since committed other changes, things get trickier quickly. In anything but the simplest cases, we are going to want a more powerful tool to help us do a deep clean of the repository We’re going to use <code>git-filter-repo</code>, a tool recommended by the git maintainers that will help us to rewrite history in a more user-friendly way than the native git tooling.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>A technical aside to those familiar with the concept of rebasing. (If you don’t know what that means, feel free to skip this paragraph.) All of the cases covered below can of course be managed using native git tools, particularly by rebasing. Sometimes rebasing is relatively painless, of course, but in the kinds of scenarios we're presenting here, rebasing is going to be a tedious and deeply error-prone process. This is why I am favoring purpose-built tools like git-filter-repo over rebasing. It is far better to avoid opening the possibility for making mistakes. From my own personal experience, recovering from a botched rebase is extremely time consuming, and often nearly impossible. Better to use the right tool for the job.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>First, install </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>git-filter-repo
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Next, let’s assess the situation to determine which technique is right for your situation. Sometimes secrets are files, and sometimes secrets are lines of code. For example, if you accidentally committed an SSH key or TLS certificate file, these are contained in specialized files that you’ll need to excise. On the other hand, maybe you have a single line of code containing an API key that’s part of a larger source file. In that case, you want to modify one or more lines of a file without deleting it.</p><p>Git-filter-repo can handle both cases, but requires different syntax for each case.</p><h2 id="excise-an-entire-file">Excise an entire file</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>To tell <code>git-filter-repo</code> to excise a file from the git history, we need only a single command:</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>git filter-repo --use-base-name --path [FILENAME] --invert-paths
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The <code>--use-base-name</code> option tells <code>git-filter-repo</code> that we are specifying a filename, and not a full path to a file. You can leave off this option if you would rather specify the full path explicitly.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Normally, <code>git-filter-repo</code> works by ignoring the filenames specified (they are, as the name suggests, filtered out). But we want the inverse behavior, we want <code>git-filter-repo</code> to ignore everything except the specified file. So we must pass <code>--invert-paths</code> to tell it this. If you leave off the <code>--invert-paths</code>, you’ll excise everything except the specified file, which is the exact opposite of what we want, and would likely be disastrous. Please don’t do that.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="edit-a-file-without-removing-it">Edit a file without removing it</h3><p>If you only need to edit one or more lines in a file without deleting the file, <code>git-filter-repo</code> takes a sequence of search-and-replace commands (optionally using regular expressions).</p><p>First, identify all the lines containing secrets that need to be excised. You’ll also need to work out a plan for how you will replace those lines. Perhaps just deleting them is enough. But perhaps they need to be modified to prevent a runtime crash.<br>Next, create a file containing the search-and-replace commands, called <code>replacements.txt</code>. Make sure it’s in a folder outside of your repo, for example, the parent folder.</p><p>The format of this file is one search-and-replace command per line, using the format:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>ORIGINAL==&gt;REPLACEMENT
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>For example, suppose that you’ve hard-coded an API token into your code, like this:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>AUTH_TOKEN=’123abc’
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Now suppose that you’ve decided that it’s better to load the API token from an environment variable, as such:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>AUTH_TOKEN=ENV[‘AUTH_TOKEN’]
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We can tell <code>git-filter-repo</code> to search for the hard-coded …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Have you ever felt uncomfortable sharing your opinion on politics — whether online or with friends? If so, you’re not alone. Americans are becoming increasingly cautious about sharing their political opinions. In a recent <a href="https://www.cato.org/publications/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share#introduction" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>survey</span></a>, 62 percent of Americans described today’s political climate as one that “prevents them from saying things they believe because others might find them offensive.” Further, this was not a sentiment limited to one side of the political spectrum. More than half of liberals and three-quarters of conservatives are <a href="https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/62-of-americans-afraid-to-share-political-views/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>hesitant to share</span></a> some of their political views. Both of these percentages have risen in recent years, in tandem with the rising debate over so-called “cancel culture.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it’s not just everyday Americans that feel limited in their speech. In July 2020, 153 notable academics, authors, journalists, and others published “<a href="https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>A Letter on Justice and Open Debate</span></a>” in <em>Harper’s Magazine</em>. In the letter, signees ranging from liberal philosopher Noam Chomsky to conservative author David Brooks voice their concern over “cancel culture” and the preservation of free speech. While the extent to which “cancel culture” endangers free speech is debated, the letter demonstrates that some academics and media professionals consider it a serious threat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This prompts several key questions: Does the media perpetuate the existence of “cancel culture?” What impact might this have on public discourse? In this week's analysis, The Factual reviews 38 articles from 25 sources across the political spectrum to explore the concept of “cancel culture” and how it is reported in the media.<br><!--more--></p>

<h4><strong>What Is “Cancel Culture?”&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>The definition isn’t simple, partially due to a growing contrast between the term’s literal definition and its use in politics and media. “Cancel culture” can be defined as a campaign of public shaming (conducted via social media, news, or in-person confrontation) such that the subject of the “cancellation” suffers devastating personal, monetary, or political consequences that appear to be disproportionate to the subject's offense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often, individuals or businesses will cut ties with the “cancelled” person in rapid succession and across industries. This creates a cascading effect where each person or business that cuts ties with the subject of the cancellation puts more pressure on those who have yet to do so. A person may become a candidate for cancellation if they are alleged to have done something so negative that they should not be afforded an opportunity for redemption. <strong>Central to the debate around “cancel culture” is this subjective threshold for what is worthy of “cancellation.”</strong></p>
<h4><strong>An Uneven Standard </strong></h4>
<p>There is no central authority that issues “cancellations” and oversees appeals. Instead, an amorphous group of internet users, politicians, and media professionals contribute to “cancel culture” on the basis of what happens to be in front of them. This produces a highly stratified environment where backlash is sometimes dispassionately cruel and at other times extremely exaggerated.</p>
<p>The term "cancel culture" has seen renewed debate in response to the Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ban</a> of former President Trump. <span>However, President Trump’s Twitter ban relates to violations of the platform’s terms of service and requires a more specific examination than the general “cancel culture” phenomenon.</span></p>

<h4><strong>Examples Of “Cancel Culture”</strong></h4>
<p>Legitimate examples of “cancel culture” gone overboard often stem from false inferences. One such <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/david-shor-cancel-culture-2020-election-theory-polls.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>example</span></a> occurred when a data scientist, David Shor, <a href="https://twitter.com/jenbrea/status/1271148784316108800" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>retweeted</span></a> a report regarding the effectiveness of various protest methods in regards to achieving policy change. This report was discussed by many as <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/reforming-police-george-floyd-defund" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>protests</span></a> grew in response to the killing of George Floyd. The data scientist was <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/case-for-liberalism-tom-cotton-new-york-times-james-bennet.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>fired</span></a> from his job as some equated his sharing of the report to condemnation of protests taking place. However, the report was originally authored by Omar Wasow, a Black man with a <a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/people/omar-wasow" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>PhD</span></a> in African American Studies. The original <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/136610C8C040C3D92F041BB2EFC3034C/S000305542000009Xa.pdf/agenda_seeding_how_1960s_black_protests_moved_elites_public_opinion_and_voting.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>report</span></a> was an analysis meant to gauge the effectiveness of protest methods in the face of a hostile majority, not to comment on their justifications or level of cost. Jennifer Brea, Omar Wasow’s wife, recently <a href="https://twitter.com/jenbrea/status/1271148784316108800?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>took to Twitter</span></a> to describe her surprise at what had occurred. A collective perception of offense combined with inadequate fact-checking, resulting in the loss of a person’s livelihood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another recent example of overzealous cancellation occurred when Lauren Wolfe, a now-former editor for the <em>New York Times</em> tweeted that she had “chills” watching then President-elect Biden’s plane land for inauguration. The backlash, largely from right-leaning outlets such as the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9176225/New-York-Times-cancels-editors-contract-tweeted-chills-watching-Biden.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em><span>Daily Mail</span></em></a>, <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/01/22/ny-times-ousts-editor-who-said-she-had-chills-watching-biden-plane-land/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em><span>New York Post</span></em></a>, and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/new-york-times-lauren-wolfe-biden-i-have-chills" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Fox News</span></a>, resulted in the <em>New York Times</em> cancelling Ms. Wolfe’s contract. Importantly, these outlets did not explicitly call for Wolfe to be fired. Instead, they magnified ridicule of the <em>New York Times</em> and suggested that she was emblematic of the newspaper’s left-leaning bias. While this was not a call for her to lose her job, it did incentivize the paper to end her employment in pursuit of impartiality. Further, Ms. Wolfe has <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/24/22247390/lauren-wolfe-new-york-times-tweet-chills" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>stated</span></a> that she has received threats and, due to the loss of her job, is now in a precarious financial position.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>In this scenario, the pressure from traditionally right-leaning outlets stands in stark contrast to their <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/search?q=cancel%20culture" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>repeated</span></a> condemnation of "cancel culture." Still, it was the left-leaning <em>New York Times</em>, which has published pieces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/style/is-it-canceled.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>minimizing</span></a> the effects of "cancel culture," that ultimately fired her. In this way, Lauren Wolfe became the victim of hypocrisy from media across the political spectrum.</p></div>
<h4><strong>The Politicization Of The Term</strong></h4>
<p>In contrast to the above, some politicians, such as Senator Josh Hawley, have embraced the media as an outlet for his repetitive claims of “cancel culture” occurring.&nbsp; Last year, he was asserting that <a href="https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1275762902285406210" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>the removal</span></a> of Confederate statues was "cancel culture." These days, he <a href="https://abc7news.com/josh-hawley-fist-capitol-police-simon-and-schuster-book-deal/9468139/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>claims</span></a> that he himself is being “cancelled” over his support for contesting President Biden’s electoral victory. In an essay published by the <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/01/24/its-time-to-stand-up-against-the-muzzling-of-america/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em><span>New York Post</span></em></a>, he emulates the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>’s Peggy Noonan in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/get-ready-for-the-struggle-session-11552003346" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>likening</span></a> “cancel culture” to the state of free speech in China. The strength of this comparison is debatable, as the U.S. <a href="https://rsf.org/en/united-states" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ranks</span></a> 45th in Reporters Without Borders’ press freedom index whereas China <a href="https://rsf.org/en/china" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ranks</span></a> 177th.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>More importantly, Senator Hawley still has his job and key committee <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/committee-assignments" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>assignments</span></a>, a new <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2021-01-18/sen-josh-hawley-book-deal-regnery" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>book deal</span></a>, and access to a <a href="https://twitter.com/HawleyMO" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>platform</span></a> read by millions. Still, articles published in the right-leaning <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9184433/Hawley-claims-hes-canceled-corporate-America-says-wont-muzzled-left.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em><span>Daily Mail</span></em></a> and <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/01/24/its-time-to-stand-up-against-the-muzzling-of-america/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em><span>New York Post </span></em></a>focus on online outrage in response to his actions rather than the lack of actual consequences that seem to be occurring. This selective framing is a key way in which media publications perpetuate a malleable definition of “cancel culture.”</p></div>
<h4><strong>How "Cancel Culture" Is Reported</strong></h4>
<p>Media outlets and publishers that align with the political left or right have palpable differences in how they report incidents of alleged “cancel culture.” Often, however, key perspectives originate from, or are amplified by, elected leaders. For example, Republican Representative Matt Gaetz <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMattGaetz/status/1353772373049282560" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>likened</span></a> the impeachment of former President Trump to “cancel culture.” Across the aisle, Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has minimized fears of "cancel culture" as being <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1281394730232946691" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>overblown</span></a>, citing conservatives' own efforts to get her “cancelled.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the media sphere, this political divide is mirrored by pieces in right-leaning outlets that paint "cancel culture" as a legitimate threat to free speech. <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/06/cancel-cancel-culture/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>There</span></a> <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/01/is-the-wisdom-of-homer-immune-to-cancel-culture/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>are</span></a> <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/prufrock/dangerous-ideas-and-our-cancel-culture/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>many</span></a> <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/concentrated-capital-fuels-cancel-culture/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>examples</span></a> <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/31/obama-is-right-to-criticize-cancel-culture-but-the-left-isnt-listening/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>of</span></a> <a href="https://reason.com/2021/01/07/the-capitol-rioters-were-a-right-wing-cancel-mob/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>such</span></a> <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/07/cancel-culture-is-a-dangerous-totalitarian-trend/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>pieces</span></a>. In one instance, former Republican Senator Orrin Hatch utilized the <em>Wall Street Journal’s</em> Opinion Section to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/higher-ed-and-the-fragmentation-of-america-11595865575" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>equate</span></a> “cancel culture” to the deadly Spanish Inquisition. Going even further, right-leaning publications sometimes claim that this behavior was <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/09/04/rnc-ronna-mcdaniel-cancel-culture-debra-messing-mccormack-frightening/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>deliberately</span></a> unleashed by “the Left” to silence political opposition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the archetypal left-leaning outlet more frequently <a href="https://time.com/5735403/cancel-culture-is-not-real/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>minimizes</span></a> fears over "cancel culture" by suggesting that the incident involves justified repercussions or identifying the ways in which a “cancelled” individual <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/style/is-it-canceled.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>maintained</span></a> their fanbase. This <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/155141/cancel-culture-con-dave-chappelle-shane-gillis" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>piece</span></a> published in the left-leaning <em>New Republic</em> minimizes fears over “cancel culture” by regarding it as “ordinary public disfavor voiced by ordinary people.” Similarly, the <em>New Statesman</em> published an <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2020/07/cancel-culture-does-not-exist" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>article</span></a> bluntly titled “‘Cancel culture’ does not exist.”&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>Indeed, there are few voices who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/17/opinion/sunday/cancel-culture-call-out.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>describe</span></a> "cancel culture" as a legitimate threat to individuals without fame or power but not an existential threat to free speech. One person who promotes this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/07/09/cancel-culture-is-real-problem-not-people-warning-about-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>description</span></a> is Phoebe Maltz Bovy, a signatory of the <em>Harper’s</em> letter. Weeks after signing, she came to realize a central paradox: “the loudest voices on the topic are those with careers as contrarians.” While Ms. Maltz Bovy had signed the letter to protect the everyday author, she later realized she may have also been defending controversial elites.</p></div>
<h4><strong>Striking the Right Balance</strong></h4>
<p>By identifying the haphazard way in which claims of “cancel culture” are promoted in the media, one can more cautiously approach the topic. Readers must demand specific information from stories of this nature and seek out alternate perspectives on the same topic. As the sheer quantity of daily media continues to grow, ensuring <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/why-is-the-news-biased" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>balance</span></a> and quality in our news diet is essential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As society becomes more <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/American-Views-2020-Trust-Media-and-Democracy.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>partisan</span></a>, it's important for all of us to engage in respectful, good-faith discussion across political lines. When moderate Americans are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/20/in-political-correctness-debate-most-americans-think-too-many-people-are-easily-offended/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>afraid</span></a> to voice their views, it allows those who operate at political extremes<span>—</span>often in bad-faith<span>—</span>to dominate the discussion.</p>

			<p><span>R</span>elief coursed through me last week when I learned my 2-year-old daughter’s daycare provider got her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. It left her feeling more groggy than she expected, but that was a good thing, suggesting the vaccine was kicking her immune system into gear.</p><p>While I was grateful her vaccination reduced the risk of exposure in my social pod, I was reading about new genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 from the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil. At a recent press conference, Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to President Biden, said the current Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, when confronting the new mutations, were still “well above the line of not being effective.” That’s reassuring, of course, until you consider that vaccines, battling mutations, can fall below the line of effectiveness. That’s not the fault of vaccine design, it’s the result of nature’s design. As long as the virus continues to find new human hosts, it will continue to evolve mutations to escape our immune defenses.</p><p>“The more people infected, the more likely that we will see new variants,” Michel Nussenzweig, a Rockefeller University immunologist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/25/health/coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-variant.html" target="_blank">told</a> <i>The New York Times</i>. “If we give the virus a chance to do its worst, it will.”</p><blockquote><p>Both the U.K and the South Africa coronavirus variants have high escape potential.</p> </blockquote><p>Thankfully, scientists are on the case figuring out what form the virus’ worst may take next. A team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that includes a biological engineer, a computational biologist, and a mathematician, has come up with a novel way of predicting which SARS-CoV-2 mutations can escape the human immune system. Their research could help vaccine makers stay one step ahead of evolution and cut off deadly mutations at the pass. In a new <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6526/284" target="_blank">paper</a>, published in <i>Science</i> with the enticing title, “Learning the language of viral evolution and escape,” the scientists elucidate a promising bridge between ideas about natural language, like grammar and meaning, and how viruses and bacteria, among other things, evolve. “We’re taking steps toward understanding the language of biology,” said Bonnie Berger, one of the paper’s authors.<br></p><p>Berger and coauthors Bryan Bryson and Brian Hie recently joined me on Zoom to explain their research. Their work stems from the thorny—or perhaps I should say “spikey”—ability of viruses to mutate in ways that allow them to evade our immune system. It is, after all, SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein, a <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-042301" target="_blank">multifunctional molecular machine</a>, that helps the virus break into our cells. As a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00007-4/fulltext" target="_blank">report</a> this month in <i>The Lancet</i> noted, the variant that recently arose in the U.K., which is “rapidly becoming a global threat,” is characterized by “multiple mutations in the spike protein.” The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines work against SARS-CoV-2 by giving our cells <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html" target="_blank">instructions</a> on how to make a harmless piece of the virus’ spike protein; that information sets up our immune system to effectively fight off the virus.&nbsp;When the spike protein changes, however, it can become harder for our immune system to recognize and, ultimately, thwart.</p><p>Berger heads the Computation and Biology group at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab. She explained that mutations in the original Wuhan strand should be investigated for “semantic change,” which “could lead to escape.” A semantic change, or change in meaning, in a protein comes down to its amino-acid sequences, which follow a set of rules. A protein is a polypeptide chain of amino acids, letters in the 20-character protein “alphabet” that code for a particular protein structure and purpose. The sequences of these letters, joined to each other with peptide bonds, are transcribed and translated from DNA and RNA—or, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, just RNA. For the virus’s spike protein to link successfully to our cells, its sequence has to adhere to a syntax. “We think of that as a biological grammar,” said Hie, a doctoral candidate at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT.</p><div>

In 2007, David Smith, a doctor of internal medicine and founder of a company that makes wound dressings, gave a presentation at a medical conference in Maryland.

</div><p>To escape the immune system’s search-and-destroy cells, Hie said, the virus must camouflage itself. In <i>Science</i>, the authors write, “We identified escape mutations as those that preserve viral infectivity but cause a virus to look different to the immune system, akin to word changes that preserve a sentence’s grammaticality but change its meaning.” This clever rewrite, Berger said, is evolution at work. “Evolution is a language,” she said. “Its language developed like English developed—over time. Protein sequences, or nucleic acid sequences, develop over time.”</p><p>The scientists designed machine-learning algorithms, originally created to work with human languages like English, to identify the new “words” in the virus’ protein sequences. “The same principles used to train a language model on a sequence of English words can train a language model on a sequence of amino acids,” they write. Fundamentally, Hie said, the algorithms work like sentence-completion models, such as the autocorrect and autocomplete functions in the iPhone and Google’s Gmail.</p><blockquote><p>If we give the virus a chance to do its worst, it will.</p> </blockquote><p>They trained their language model on 4,172 spike protein sequences, much less than what was available to work with for proteins associated with other viruses, for which the researchers also created language models to predict viral escape—44,851 sequences of a protein in the influenza A virus, and 57,730 sequences of a protein in the HIV virus. They found that the degree of a protein sequence’s grammatical correctness, according to their language models, was significantly correlated with viral fitness “across all strains and across studies that examined single or combinatorial mutations,” despite the fact that their language models “were not given any explicit fitness-related information.” This suggests that a mutation’s “grammaticality” actually captures information about how fit that mutation is for infecting people. It also, the researchers said, increases the dimensions of scientists’ understanding of how a change in meaning can encode the perturbing of a protein’s purpose.<br></p><p>Bryson is a member of the Ragon Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital and heads his own lab at MIT’s Biological Engineering department. He put it this way: “We’ve blasted the doors open with CSCS in terms of an intellectual paradigm.” CSCS stands for constrained semantic change search. It’s the task of looking for mutations to the spike protein with both high grammaticality and high semantic change. There’s not really an analog for doing this usefully on some body of text in the English language. And that’s the point. “Before, people would just look at grammaticality of English or the meaning, the semantics,” Berger said. “But looking for escape—high grammaticality and high semantic change—you wouldn’t do that for the English language, which is why we came up with a new natural-language processing model. Natural-language processing drove the solving of a biological problem.”<br></p><p>In Bryson’s lab, scientists can now experiment with spike-protein mutants. “We’re saying, ‘OK, we can generate this,’” Bryson said. “In our model, it falls in the 98th percentile.” That means if you compare this mutant’s sequence to previously seen coronavirus sequences, then 98 percent of those previously seen coronavirus sequences have lower semantic change, as predicted by the model, than the mutant. “We can see how well it infects cells,” Bryson said. “We can ask, ‘How well does it bind the receptor ACE2?’—the cellular doorway the spike protein opens to cause COVID-19—‘How well does it survive in the presence of antibodies?’ We now have a little bit more understanding of how semantic changes relate to all of the biological features of infection.”</p><blockquote><p>A mutation’s “grammaticality” actually captures information about how fit that mutation is for infecting people.</p> </blockquote><p>Both the U.K and the South Africa variants have, according to the researchers’ model, high escape potential. The latter scored higher for semantic change than the former. “Those may be prone to escape and may not be targeted by the vaccine, but that needs to be experimentally verified,” Berger said. “We’re just doing quantitative prediction.”</p><p>I asked the scientists how the development of our current vaccines might have been different if Moderna and Pfizer knew about this language of viral escape. Bryson said, “I think our model underscores the importance of using the full length of the spike as an immunogen, as opposed to prioritizing particular regions of the protein over others.” He said it is fortunate that a lot of the vaccine designs are focused on the full-length spike protein, which their model suggests is a good move. At the same time, Bryson warned, “our model does quantify certain parts of the protein as having high escape potential.”</p><p>However, with that knowledge, Bryson said, chemists could fine-tune vaccines to target the sequences most likely to escape. “We could say, OK, even as we get more and more sequences, how can we think about designing new vaccine strategies that focus the immune response on this particular region of the protein?” In the computer, he explained, he could generate new spike mutations and determine (to use the language metaphor) whether they change the meaning of the protein sequence and become dangerous. Based on that modeling, Bryson said, “We can do deep virology, immunology, antibody-binding—all these types of experiments that allow us to explore those pieces.”</p><p>The team is looking to take their model to uncharted territory beyond protein sequences. “This conceptual framework is not limited …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                                <p>GameStop, a struggling, mall-based video games retailer, has topped the business news this week. In part, this is because its common stock (ticker: GME) has seen an incredible run-up in price. But the story has also garnered a lot of attention because the media is portraying the company as the latest battleground between populism and the establishment.</p>
<p>On one side are the hedge funds that have bet against GameStop by short selling GME. That’s to say, hedge funds have borrowed the company’s stock, sold it and are betting that they can buy it back at a lower price. On the other side are the investors, including retail investors on Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets, who are betting on GameStop stock to go up. Moreover, they’re buying GME and encouraging other investors to do the same to push up the price of the stock and bankrupt the hedge funds that have shorted it.</p>
<p>Bulls and bears have fought for as long as we’ve had financial markets. The difference now? The increasing availability of derivatives to retail traders, who can use these sophisticated investment products to lever returns. For example, consider a vanilla call option. Owning a call on GME gives me the right (but not the obligation) to purchase a share of GME at a fixed price (called the strike) and on a fixed date (called the expiry).</p>
<p>Let’s use some illustrative numbers. Suppose I bought a call on GME back on Jan. 4 with a strike of $250 and an expiry of Jan. 27. The fair price of this option would have been very cheap, say a few dollars or less. Why? For the call to have a positive payoff, termed being “in the money,” GME would have had to rise from $20 (the price on the 4th) to above $250 (the strike) by the expiry. Essentially, buying the GME call would have been a bet on incredible levels of stock price volatility.</p>
<p>As it turns out, that’s what happened. Since GME closed at about $350 on Jan. 27, the payoff of that single call (purchased for pocket change) would have been $100. That’s because exercising the call gets the owner a share of GME (worth $350) at the strike price ($250). That’s a return of two orders of magnitude greater than the initial investment. In this way, close-to-expiry, far out-of-the-money call options allow for extremely leveraged bets. Like a lottery ticket or roulette wheel spin, these calls may only cost a few dollars but have a possibility of unlimited profit. The allure of stock speculation? Like poker, you’re playing against real humans. If you can outsmart them, then you can eat their lunch. And now we can do it during lunch on our phones.</p>
<p>With GameStop, we have a classic short squeeze. When the price of GME rises, the investment banks and brokerage firms that lent out the stock require that the short sellers provide more collateral. To do this, the shorts might have to sell their existing positions in other stocks at bad prices to quickly raise cash. Worse, the lenders can immediately call the loaned stock back. The short seller is then forced to buy back the stock at a higher price than they originally sold it at, often taking a bath. In the short sellers’ scramble to cover their shorts, the GME price rises further. Because stock prices have unlimited potential to rise, the short seller is exposed to potentially unlimited losses. Therefore, in a short squeeze, the short sellers risk bankruptcy even if they are ultimately right about the fair value of the stock. But, as John Maynard Keynes is reputed to have said, “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.”</p>
<p>But is the run-up in GME price irrational? Does it illustrate the inefficiency of financial markets, like a modern version of tulip mania?</p>
<p>First, we should be skeptical of bite-sized economic history. Case in point: Keynes never made that quip, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MB-32547">according to expert historians</a> Robert Skidelsky and Donald Moggridge. And the tulip mania story might also be bust, as historian Peter Garber explains in <em>Famous First Bubbles: The Fundamentals of Early Manias</em>. History has useful economics, but beware history badly done. Still the question remains: Is GME a bubble, born of irrational exuberance?</p>
<p>Bubbles are a favorite topic of my Mercatus colleague Scott Sumner. In the simplest model of an efficient market, stock prices follow a random walk. Since prices instantly and perfectly reflect all available information, price changes are only caused by unexpected news. And since you can’t predict unexpected news, prices evolve randomly. So as Scott has pointed out, even efficient market prices can exhibit bubble-like patterns by chance. Some stock prices will rapidly rise on good news and subsequently collapse on bad news. But you can’t know which stocks ahead of time.<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.discoursemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Discourse_Graphic_Gamestop-e1611941850710.png" alt="" width="600" height="468"></p>
<p>But there’s a problem applying this reasoning in the GameStop case. What news about the company’s business could have plausibly driven the large swings in GME? The stock price steadily tripled from about $20 at the beginning of January to about $60 roughly three weeks later on the 22nd. Then this week, the stock price and volatility exploded. The share price ran up to nearly $475, amid much bouncing around. For instance, on Thursday, Jan. 28, the stock reached $468 soon after the opening bell, only to fall to $126 about an hour later. To my knowledge, no news about GameStop’s business explains these swings. I suspect the truth mixes rationality and human psychology. Here’s my theory:</p>
<p>For starters, the hedge funds shorting GME got greedy. More shares of GME have been shorted than there are shares of GME outstanding. This fact means that if all the shorts are called in at the same time, they couldn’t all be covered. Moreover, GameStop isn’t obviously destined for failure. I don’t give financial advice and haven’t taken either side of the GME trade. But in the same way that some investors are pessimistic about GME, other investors are optimistic about GME. Both sets of investors try to convince the public of their view. This is perfectly normal. The key difference here? The optimistic GME investors have realized the vulnerable position of the short sellers, and they’ve coordinated to expose it. Why GME and not another stock? Because gamers like GameStop.</p>
<p>In this way, bidding up the price of GME is akin to a bank run or a foreign-exchange speculative attack. Investors realize, often suddenly and simultaneously, “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.” The realization leads to coordinated action by self-interested individuals—<a href="https://www.adamsmithworks.org/documents/spontaneous-order-in-adam-smith">Smithian spontaneous order</a>—causing the unsustainable arrangement to collapse. Some call it creative destruction; others call it financial instability. Your language might depend on whether you’ve gained or lost.</p>
<p>Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/joint-statement-ongoing-market-volatility-2021-01-27">announced</a> that it was “actively monitoring” the situation. And so are Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other Biden administration officials, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-white-house/white-house-monitoring-situation-involving-gamestop-other-firms-idUSKBN29W2I1">according to White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki</a>. The SEC and other securities regulators may be concerned that the GameStop short squeeze is an illegal form of market manipulation, a notoriously vague crime under U.S. securities law. I’m not a lawyer and can’t offer a legal opinion.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, retail investors must not be prosecuted simply because they were on the winning side of a trade and used colorful language on the internet. Hedge funds are sophisticated financial market actors that are responsible for managing their own risk. SEC regulations prohibit the general public from investing in them under their “accredited investor” rules. And as SEC officials regularly point out in their indictments, professional traders also use colorful language in their chats. So, let’s be fair. Absent an underlying crime, when hedge funds leave a free lunch on the table, don’t punish retail traders for eating it.</p>
<p>Like GameStop, I say: Power to the players.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is a wonderful lightweight markup: minimalistic,
easy to read and write. Markdown is supported by GitHub,
Bitbucket, Reddit, Diaspora, Stack Exchange, and many others.
It is not without issues though.  Markdown is precedent-based,
so to say.  It aimed to codify preexisting practices which
were... diverse.  For that reason, it is messy and inconsistent
between implementations.  </p>
<p>StrictMark is a rational <em>subset</em> of Markdown that implements
all the features with the shortest <em>formal</em> grammar possible.
Hence, uniform syntax and no ambiguities.  The idea is that
StrictMark can reuse all the existing Markdown support,
without sharing the weight of the legacy syntax and its
incidental complexity.</p>
<p>StrictMark is Markdown, refactored.</p>
<h2>Markdown critique</h2>
<p>Markdown implementations are inconsistent. Vim highlights it one
way, VS Code does it differently, and the resulting HTML is yet
another thing. A textbook fix for inconsistent implementations
is having a <em>formal grammar</em>.  That might be either a proper
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">eBNF</a> grammar or just some regexes in simpler cases.  There
must be something formal and unambiguous.  HTML has it, CSS has
it, every markup or programming language has it.  But Markdown.
Sadly, the syntax itself is so ambiguous that making a formal
grammar becomes a road of pain. For example, HTML (which is
hardly lightweight) has a uniform syntax for its <code>&lt;/elements&gt;</code>.
With Markdown, every element has its own syntax and those
syntaxes interact.  Markdown formal grammar was attempted in the
past, but if you ask me, the result was underwhelming. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">PEG
based grammar</a> is 700 lines long. For a <em>minimalistic</em>
markup, that is <strong>a lot</strong>. So ironic.</p>
<p><a href="http://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a> is a Markdown codification effort that produced
the most complete spec so far.  Still, that spec is
rule-and-exception based, no grammar.  The text of the spec is
full of "legalese":</p>
<blockquote><p>Â«An indented code block cannot interrupt a paragraph, so
there must be a blank line between a paragraph and a
following indented code blockÂ»</p></blockquote>
<p>Here it describes the specifics of interrelations between two
particular markup elements. But <code>N</code> elements produce <code>N*N</code>
relations!  Consider that ATX headings are always single-line
while Setext headings can be multiline. Why? Because the spec
says so. It is one big heap of rules and another one of
exceptions. That's why it advises a "parsing strategy" and
not a parser generator.</p>
<p>Whether the CommonMak spec has fixed all the corner cases and
ambiguities is unclear.  Or maybe clear, as the spec is actively
revised. So is the code.  The CommonMark C parser is 10KLoC of
hand-written code.  It has plenty of exceptions and tweaks.
While writing <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm">RON</a> docs, I ran into issues immediately;
had to use the HEAD version which has those issues fixed.</p>
<p>Overall, that seemingly theoretical grammar problem causes
plenty of <em>accidental complexity</em>.  Markdown is messy and hard
to reason about;  it is not always clear how to interpret a
given construct.  That combinatorial mess may not be a problem
for its current uses, of course.  (Although, I highly doubt
that.) After all, the existing libcmark parser is fuzzed,
thus reasonably reliable.  Still, Markdown is a very shaky
base if you want to build on top of it.  To build something
more advanced than a README.  Like, full WYSIWYG editing or
diff highlighting or other complex behavior.</p>
<h2>StrictMark principles</h2>
<p>StrictMark's objective is to make a Markdown <em>subset</em> which is a
<em>proper markup language</em>. To  remove that incidental complexity
by rationalizing the grammar and making it formal.  This
document <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/strictmark.sm?@text">is StrictMark</a>.</p>
<p>One may ask, why do I want to make Markdown a proper language?
After all, there is HTML which is proper enough. Yes, HTML is a
widely supported standard, but it is hopelessly elephantine.
Let's think, who can afford to develop/support a proper HTML
engine?  That is roughly one-and-a-half companies in the world.
Hence the interest in a minimalistic hypertext markup language.</p>
<p>The next question is obvious.  If StrictMark is ever used at
some scale, would not it become elephantine, naturally?
Consider Wikipedia/Mediawiki markup.  Once neat and lean like
all such markups, it evolved into an elephantine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sneakers&amp;action=edit">mess</a>.
What about table support, for example?  Some people think it is
necessary, quite deservedly so.</p>
<p>I plan to prevent feature sprawl by enabling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion">transclusion</a>.
A document may reference other documents and objects through
hyperlinks.  It can also <em>include</em> other objects and documents,
through hyperlinks.  The good old <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is an example of
transclusion.  That will not even extend the syntax: StrictMark
reuses the image syntax for the general case of transclusion.
Once you need a table, you transclude a table!  It is up to the
renderer to deal with all those other data types.  CSV is a much
better format for tables than HTML or Markdown.</p>
<p>StrictMark is a backwards compatible subset of CommonMark, for
the most part.  Any existing CommonMark tooling will support
StrictMark reasonably well.  A StrictMark parser may not
understand arbitrary Markdown.</p>
<p>StrictMark principles:</p>
<ol><li><p>A formal grammar.  StrictMark is a <em>regular language</em> in its
structural part (i.e. blocks).  The inline markup syntax is
based on regex-defined <em>markers</em>.  That way, a decent parser
can be implemented in regexes only.</p></li>
<li><p>There is one way to do a thing, as uniform as possible.
Hence: spaces, not tabs!  Because spaces can replace tabs,
not the other way around. ATX headings only. Formatting
brackets are <code>*one char*</code> wide only. All block formatting is
indented uniformly.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize ambiguity. Same character should not denote lists
and emphasis, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>No spooky action-at-a-distance.  Each line can be parsed
separately.  All the structural markup is 4-char-wide, hence
indents are uniform. This restriction makes the nesting
structure clear and unambiguous.</p></li>
<li><p>Inline markup has very limited nesting; it is of secondary
importance anyway.  There is clear markup precedence; a
<code>code</code> span wins over <code>strong</code>, <code>strong</code> wins over <code>emph</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>HTML is not the only output format.  It could be PDF, DOC,
TeX, whatever.  Hence, no HTML inserts. Use transclusion
for other formats.</p></li>
<li><p>If the StrictMark interpretation contradicts CommonMark or
CommonMark has an ambiguity then screw CommonMark.</p></li></ol>
<p>Interestingly enough, <a href="https://johnmacfarlane.net/beyond-markdown.html">similar ideas</a> were proposed in the
CommonMark community some years ago.</p>
<h2>Inline markup</h2>
<p>Markdown inline markup may seem like an easy part. Sadly, it is
not.  Due to very irregular and ambiguous syntax, implementing
it properly is difficult.  For that reason, StrictMark
rationalizes the inline markup in the following ways:</p>
<ol><li><p>All inline markup is seen as bracketing.  Brackets are
matched separately, using regular expressions; e.g.
<code>(?&lt;=\s)[*](?=\S)</code> is the opening bracket for STRONG.
Bracket pairs only become effective if they satisfy the
precedence rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Bracket precedence, lower to higher:</p>
<ol><li><p><code>_emphasized_</code>,</p></li>
<li><p><code>[link][1]</code>,</p></li>
<li><p><code>*strong*</code>,</p></li>
<li><p><code>\* escapes</code>, </p></li>
<li><p>`<code>code</code>`.</p></li></ol></li>
<li><p>An open bracket can be paired with any following closing
bracket of that kind.  A new open bracket will cancel any
preceding unmatched open bracket of its kind.</p></li>
<li><p>In case of overlap, higher-precedence brackets win; in case
of equal-precedence, the earlier range wins.</p></li>
<li><p>Higher-precedence brackets may nest in lower-precedence, but
not the other way around (the lower one is cancelled).  In
case of equal-precedence, the earlier range wins.</p></li>
<li><p>No double symbols, i.e. <code>*strong*</code> not <code>**strong**</code>.</p></li></ol>
<p>Compared to CommonMark, restrictions are many:</p>
<ul><li><p>no double-symbol syntax,</p></li>
<li><p>no arbitrary nesting,</p></li>
<li><p>only reference links, the label is 1 symbol long,</p></li>
<li><p>no way to put backticks inside a code span.</p></li></ul>
<p>That may seem restrictive, but again: inline formatting has a
supplementary role.  It must pull its own weight or it must not
be there.  The accurate bracket patterns are listed in the
grammar appendix.</p>
<h2>Links, images and transclusions</h2>
<p>The only form of links CommonMark supports is full reference
links.  The link label must be exactly one symbol long. This
approach:</p>
<ul><li><p>matches a common established practice of using numbered
references;</p></li>
<li><p>minimizes the visual noise in the text flow;</p></li>
<li><p>keeps reference definitions exactly 4 symbols long.</p></li></ul>
<p>Reference definitions can be placed anywhere.  It is nice to put
them at the end of a section or in the end of the document.
Example:</p>
<pre><code>    see [Replicated Object Notation][1]

    [1]: http://doc.replicated.cc/ron.sm "What is RON"
</code></pre>
<p>If you have more than 10 links, use letters. 
In case you have thousands of links, use Unicode symbols.</p>
<p>Transclusions and images use the same syntax as links, 
with an exclamation mark <code>!</code> prepended.
Example:</p>
<pre><code>    ![here is the table][T]
    [T]: /table?@tab "this might be any object"
</code></pre>
<h2>Block markup</h2>
<p>StrictMark has tree types of blocks:</p>
<ol><li><p>container blocks (lists, blockquotes, divs),</p></li>
<li><p>leaf blocks (paragraphs, headers, rulers, fenced code blocks).</p></li></ol>
<p>Container and entry blocks can contain other blocks, leaf blocks
can not.  Depending on the type of a leaf block, it can contain
text, metadata or nothing at all, </p>
<p>The block-related markup goes in the beginning of the
line, in blocks of four symbols.  That part of a line  is called
a <em>block stack</em>.  The allowed nesting pattern is
<code>(INDENT|QUOTE)* LIST? LEAF?</code>.  In absence of an explicit leaf
block, a formatted text paragraph is implied.</p>
<p>A block can be continued in the following lines; that is
signaled by indents (four spaces) in place of the block markup.
An empty line is considered to be a continuation line for the
container blocks in the stack, but not for the leaf block.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code> #  Multiline
    header

 1. here the entry starts,
    and then it continues

    and continues...
 2. ...till the next entry.
</code></pre>
<p>Changes in blockstack depth cause container nesting changes.
Additional indent of less than 4 spaces is not meaningful.
That allows for easier line-by-line parsing and interpretation.
If an indent level starts with a bare indent, that creates a
generic container block (in other words, a <code>div</code>).  With
CommonMark, that should be a code block.  StrictMark generalizes
that slightly.</p>
<p>In case a block marker ends with a non-space symbol, the next
symbol must be …</p></div>

            Lenovo laptops have a “User-defined Key” on F12 which can be mapped to a limited number of functions
            through the Lenovo Vantage application. Although media controls aren't among the selectable functions, there
            is one option that we can use to our advantage: Open applications or files.

        <p>
            The “Open applications or files” option for the User-defined key allows us to perform custom actions
        </p>
        <p>
            We’re going to create a simple C# application that triggers a virtual keyboard event for the media
            play/pause button present on some keyboards when the application is open and then configure Lenovo
            Vantage to open it when the F12 key is pressed. This allows us to have a play/pause button on our keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            In your plain text editor of choice (I used Notepad++) create a file called <code>f12-play-pause.cs</code>;
            this will be the source code for our application. In it, add the following text:
        </p>
        <pre><code>using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class Program
{
    public const int KEYEVENTF_EXTENTEDKEY = 1;
    public const int KEYEVENTF_KEYUP = 0;
    public const int VK_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE = 0xB3;

    [DllImport("user32.dll")]
    public static extern void keybd_event(byte virtualKey, byte scanCode, uint flags, IntPtr extraInfo);

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        keybd_event(VK_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE, 0, KEYEVENTF_EXTENTEDKEY, IntPtr.Zero);
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>

            When this program is run, it’ll execute the <code>Main()</code> method, which has one command: trigger a
            keyboard event for the <code>MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE</code> key. Once this single command is run, the application
            is closed and you’re returned to what you were doing before. In practice, this happens so quickly that
            there’s virtually no interruption and the only indication that an application is being opened for this is a
            slight flicker in the Taskbar.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we have the source code for our application, we need to compile it into an exe file. If you don’t
            already have a C# development set up, the easiest way I’ve found to compile this application is to use
            <a href="https://github.com/oleg-shilo/cs-script" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CS-Script</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to compile the script using CS-Script you first need to install it; this can be easily done by
            <a href="https://github.com/oleg-shilo/cs-script/releases/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downloading
                the latest release from Github</a>, extracting the folder (you might also need to install 7-Zip to open
            the archive), and double-clicking <code>install.cmd</code>. Once we’re done it can be easily uninstalled by
            double-clicking <code>uninstall.cmd</code> if you won't be needing it again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we have CS-Script installed, we can open a cmd window and navigate to the folder where we saved
            f12-play-pause.cs. First test that your script is working correctly by running:
        </p>
        <pre><code>cscs f12-play-pause.cs</code></pre>
        <p>
            Once you're sure that the script runs correctly using this command, run the following command to compile it
            to a file (<code>-e</code> stands for export, in that it's exporting the compiled application to a file
            instead of just running it):
        </p>
        <pre><code>cscs -e f12-play-pause.cs</code></pre>
        <p>
            This will generate a new file called <code>f12-play-pause.exe</code>, which should simulate a play/pause
            button pressed when open. Make sure this application is working properly and move it to somewhere you’re
            okay with keeping it permanently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, it’s time to connect our new application to the F12/User-defined key. Open Lenovo Vantage and
            select “Input &amp; accessories” from the Device dropdown.
        </p>

        <p>
            Scroll down and select “Open applications or files” option in the Action User Defined Key dropdown. You’ll
            now be presented with two options: Applications to open and Files to open. Interestingly, our new
            application isn’t available through the Applications option, so we need to instead click on the Add button
            in the “Files to open” section and select our <code>f12-play-pause.exe</code> application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our application won't display in the list unless you restart Lenovo Vantage (after which it'll appear as a
            nameless entry in the Applications list), but now when you click F12 on your keyboard your music will toggle
            between play and pause.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am, of course, always looking for ways to improve this setup; feel free to add any comments, questions, or

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the first part of a three part (II, III) discussion of an idea I am going to term (<a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2021/01/warrior-episode-forty-one/">borrowing from one of its proponents</a>) the ‘universal warrior’ – the idea that there is a transcendent sameness about either the warrior experience or warrior values which provides some sort of useful blueprint for today or a fundamental truth about viewing the past (it is generally presented as both).</p>



<p>Of course the ‘universal warrior’ is not meant literally; no one, <a href="https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2016/05/through-a-glass-darkly-george-s-patton.html">save George S. Patton</a>, is claiming that a single warrior was reincarnated through a host of battles, always the same in each case.  <strong>Rather, the claim that there is a ‘universal warrior’ is really a claim that there is a universal <em>war experience</em></strong>, which all combatants in all wars take part of and which remains largely unchanged or that there is fundamentally a <strong>universal set of warrior values, behaviors or attributes</strong> which define combatant through the ages and through different kinds of armies, different kinds of service</p>



<p>And that notion is a popular one, appearing equally at home in <a href="https://youtu.be/A50lVLtSQik">anti-war songs</a> and <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2016/12/14/stop-calling-us-warriors/">military recruitment propaganda </a>(along with<a href="https://youtu.be/62tnJtLBQzQ"> lava monsters</a>).  Most recently, my attention was drawn to it by a series of what are effectively <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">self-help videos</a> framed around the idea by best-selling author Steven Pressfield and I am going to use those videos as the clear form of the argument I want to engage.  In part, this is because Pressfield makes the argument in almost all of its fullness, making many of the implications (‘warrior societies,’ the life advice, the transcendent connection between ‘warriors’ past and present, the implication that ‘warrior’ life is more morally pure and so on) explicit and clear.  And also because Pressfield’s books – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7rdgm4/how_accurate_is_the_depiction_of_spartan_hoplite/">his <em>fiction</em> I should note, for his historical fiction works have at best a tenuous relationship with the historical record</a> – are, among other things, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire">on officer training reading lists</a></em> making it a rather important thing if he is peddling an utterly bunk notion of the past.</p>



<p>And it is not hard to see why the idea of a universal warrior value set or a universal warrior experience is an attractive notion; it offers a transcendent connection, linking the experience of combat – whether that is understood positively, as Pressfield does, or negatively as the famous song does – across generations, centuries and cultures.  And it offers the promise of turning that feeling of transcendent connection into a sense of heroism in everyday life, a blueprint for self-improvement, or a timeless model for political consciousness.</p>



<p>And it <em>feels</em> true.  After all, we call people who fought in wars even at the beginnings of written history ‘soldiers’ and ‘warriors and we call our own war-fighters ‘soldiers’ and (unfortunately) ‘warriors.’  That suggestion of equivalence is built right into our linguistic systems.  Students often marvel at the ludicrous tendency for historical artists to represent conflicts in their own deep past (like medieval manuscript illustrators depicting conflicts from classical antiquity) using present (to them) day arms, armor and tactics.  But those same students will often almost immediately fall into the mistake of assuming that combatants of the past shared the same <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/">attitudes </a>and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/10/collections-antarah-ibn-shaddad-victory-songs/">motivations </a>about war as they do.</p>



<p><strong>Of course a lot of things <em>feel</em> true which aren’t</strong>.  Standing on the ground, the Earth <em>feels</em> flat, it <em>seems</em> the Sun moves across the sky; of course in reality, the Earth is a ball and in a real sense the sky moves across the Sun.  Many things are <em>intuitive</em>, they <em>feel</em> true, without <em>being</em> true.  <strong>So is there a universal combat experience?</strong></p>



<p>To probe that question, we are going to examine it in two ways. <strong> This week, we’re going to look at the <em>kinds</em> of people in war, what the distinctions are between them and if their experience really can be universally applied</strong>.  Then next week, we’re going to look at this question culturally and chronologically, asking if the experience of the same kinds of people in war was really the same in <em>different wars</em>, drawing heavily on the social-military-history lens which concerns itself with the experience of battle (often called the <em>Face of Battle</em>-school after J. Keegan’s <em>The Face of Battle </em>(1976)).  Then the week after that we’ll take a look at the implications (particularly for how manliness and masculinity are understood) that this historical theory and its failures have on the broader cultural constructs built around it.</p>



<p>Because – spoiler alert –<strong> there is no universal warrior </strong>(in case some of you were concerned that I was going to spend two weeks carefully explaining different categories only to conclude that they were meaningless!) and <strong>there is no universal combat experience</strong>.</p>

<p>Alright?  Let’s soldier on!</p>



<h2>Soldiers and Warriors</h2>



<p>We want to start with asking what the distinction is between <em>soldiers</em> and <em>warriors</em>. <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2016/12/14/stop-calling-us-warriors/"> It is a tricky question </a>and even the <a href="https://youtu.be/7TprgnuYfyQ">U.S. Army sometimes gets it badly wrong</a> (Pressfield, I should note, draws a distinction which isn’t <em>entirely</em> wrong but is so wrapped up with <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/09/warrior-episode-seven/">his dodgy effort to use discredited psychology</a> that I think it is best to start from scratch).  We have a sense that while both of these words mean ‘combatant,’ that they are not quite equivalent.</p>



<p>I suspect many of my readers (specifically the native English speakers) will immediately agree, for instance, that this fellow is a warrior, but not a soldier:</p>

<p>While these fellows, volunteers enrolled in an army for just a single conflict, are soldiers but not warriors:</p>

<p><strong>But <em>why</em>?</strong>  The etymologies of the words can actually help push us a bit in the right direction.  Warrior has a fairly obvious etymology, being related to war (itself a derivative of French <em>guerre</em>); as <em>guerre </em>becomes war, so Old French <em>guerreieor</em> became Middle English <em>werreior</em> and because that is obnoxious to say, modern English ‘warrior’ (which is why it is warrior and not ‘warrer’ as we might expect if it was regularly constructed).  By contrast, soldier comes – it has a tortured journey which I am simplifying – from the <em>sold/sould</em> French root meaning ‘pay’ which in turn comes from Latin <em>solidus</em>, a standard Late Roman coin.  So there is clearly something about pay, or the lack of pay involved in this distinction, but clearly it isn’t <em>just</em> pay or the word mercenary would suit just as well.</p>



<p>So here is the difference: <strong>a warrior is an individual who wars, because it is their foundational vocation</strong>, an irremovable part of their identity and social position, pursued for those private ends (status, wealth, place in society).  <strong>So the core of what it is to be a warrior is that it is an element of personal identity and also fundamentally individualistic</strong> (in <em>motivation</em>, to be clear, not in fighting style – many warriors fought with collective tactics, although I think it fair to say that operation in units is much more central to soldiering than the role of a warrior, who may well fight alone).  A warrior remains a warrior when the war ends.  A warrior remains a warrior if fighting alone or for themselves.</p>



<p>By contrast, a soldier is an individual who <em>soldiers</em> (notably a different verb, which includes a sense of drudgery in war-related jobs that aren’t warring <em>per se</em>) as a <em>job</em> which they may one day leave behind, under the authority of and pursued for a larger community which directs their actions, typically through a system of regular discipline.  <strong>So the core of what it is to be a soldier is that it is a not-necessarily-permanent employment and fundamentally build about being both in and in service to a group.  </strong>A soldier, when the war or their term of service ends, becomes a civilian (something a warrior generally does not do!).  A soldier without a community stops being a soldier and starts being a mercenary.</p>



<p>Incidentally, this distinction is not unique to English.  Speaking of the two languages I have the most experience in, both Greek and Latin have this distinction.  Greek has <em>machetes </em>(<em>μαχητής</em>, lit: ‘battler,’ a <em>mache</em> being a battle) and <em>polemistes</em> (πολεμιστής, lit: ‘warrior,’ a <em>polemos</em> being a war); both are more common in poetry than prose, often used to describe mythical heroes.  Interestingly the word for an individual that fights <em>out of battle order</em> (when there is a battle order) is a <em>promachos</em> (πρόμαχος, lit: ‘fore-fighter’), a frequent word in Homer.  But the standard Greek soldier wasn’t generally called any of these things, he was either a <em>hoplite</em> (ὁπλίτης, ‘full-equipped man,’ named after his equipment) or more generally a <em>stratiotes</em> (στρατιώτης, lit, ‘army-man’ but properly ‘soldier’).  That general word, <em>stratiotes</em> is striking, but its root is <em>stratos</em> (στρατός, ‘army’); a <em>stratiotes</em>, a soldier, for the ancient Greeks was defined by his membership in that larger unit, the army.  One could be a <em>machetes</em> or a <em>polemistes</em> alone, but only a <em>stratiotes</em> in an army (<em>stratos</em>), commanded, presumably, by a general (<em>strategos</em>) in service to a community.</p>



<p>Latin has the same division, with similar shades of meaning.  Latin has <em>bellator</em> (‘warrior’) from <em>bellum</em> (‘war’), but Roman soldiers are not generally <em>bellatores</em> (except in a poetic sense and even then only rarely), even when they are actively waging war.  Instead, the soldiers of Rome are <em>milites</em> (sing. <em>miles</em>).  The word is related to the Latin <em>mille</em> (‘thousand’) from the root ‘mil-‘ which indicates a collection or combination of things.  <em>Milites</em> are thus – like <em>stratiotes</em>, <strong>men put together</strong>, defined by their collective action for the community (strikingly, groups acting for individual aims in Latin are not <em>milites</em> but <em>latrones</em>, bandits – a word Roman authors also …</p></div></div>

The vaccine worked better in the U.S. — 72 per cent effective against moderate to severe COVID-19 — compared to 57 per cent in South Africa, where it was up against an easier-to-spread mutated virus.</p>  <p>Dr. Matthew Oughton, an infectious disease&nbsp;specialist at Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, told CBC News the trial data "certainly looks promising for a single dose, which of course will certainly ease a lot of the logistics we've been dealing with so far with the current vaccines that have been granted approval."</p>  <p>He said by examining mixed populations across continents, the J&amp;J trial is not only "looking at differences in how different groups of people respond, that also means that they capture different viral variants, so they have a good sense of the real-world efficacy of this vaccine."</p>  <p>With vaccinations off to a rocky start globally, experts have&nbsp;been counting on a one-dose vaccine that would stretch scarce supplies and avoid the logistics nightmare of getting people to return for boosters.</p>    <h2>Greater protection&nbsp;vs. more shots</h2>  <p>But with some competing vaccines shown to be 95 per cent effective after two doses, the question is whether somewhat less protection is an acceptable tradeoff for getting more shots in arms quickly.</p>  <p>Matthew Miller, an associate professor at the Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster University, told CBC News by email that the decision will depend on multiple factors, including "the procurement timelines for specific vaccines in each country" and how prevalent the newly circulating variants become.</p>  <p>"Some high-risk populations may need vaccines that confer higher degrees of protection, while less efficacious vaccines might be appropriate for lower-risk populations," he said.</p>  <p>The Canadian government signed an agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson for up to 38 million doses of their vaccine, though as of earlier this month, officials said a vaccine schedule had not been finalized.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH \ Dr. Matthew Oughton, infectious diseases specialist, encouraged by data so far:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine 'very promising,' says infectious disease specialist" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1850072131736-metadata-" title="Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine 'very promising,' says infectious disease specialist"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/15/283/JNJ.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>Calling the clinical trial 'thorough,' infectious disease specialist Dr. Matthew Oughton says Johnson &amp; Johnson's single-shot COVID-19 vaccine is also easier to handle logistically compared to approved vaccines in Canada.<!-- --> <!-- -->3:40</span></span></span></p>  <p>J&amp;J said that within a week, it will file an application for emergency use in the U.S., and then abroad. It expects to supply 100 million doses to the U.S. by June, and expects to have some ready to ship as soon as authorities give the green light.</p>  <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has set a 50 per cent threshold for any COVID-19 vaccine to be considered for emergency use authorization.</p>  <h2>No deaths reported in the vaccine group</h2>  <p>The J&amp;J data comes from&nbsp;preliminary findings from a study of 44,000 volunteers that isn't completed yet. Researchers tracked illnesses starting 28 days after vaccination — about the time when people getting a two-dose vaccine would have needed another shot.</p>  <p>After day 28, no one who got vaccinated needed hospitalization or died, regardless of whether they were exposed to "regular COVID or these particularly nasty variants," Dr. Mathai Mammen, global research chief for J&amp;J's Janssen Pharmaceutical unit, told The Associated Press.&nbsp;When the vaccinated did become infected, they had a milder illness.</p>  <p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also was particularly encouraged by the findings with respect to patients with the most serious symptoms.</p>  <p>"This really tells us that we have now a value-added vaccine candidate," said Fauci at a Friday briefing of U.S. health officials in President Joe Biden's administration.</p>    <p>Defeating the scourge that has killed more than two million people worldwide will require vaccinating billions, and the shots currently being rolled out in different countries&nbsp;require two doses a few weeks apart for full protection. Early data is mixed on exactly how well all the different kinds work, but shots made by Pfizer and Moderna appear to be about 95 per cent protective after the second dose.</p>  <p>But amid shortages, some countries have advised delaying the second dose of certain vaccines with little data on how that would affect protection.</p>  <h2>Company also testing 2-shot vaccine</h2>  <p>All COVID-19 vaccines train the body to recognize the new coronavirus, usually by spotting the spike&nbsp;protein that coats it. But they're made in very different ways.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH \ Canadian labs working hard to track new variatns:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Growing concern about COVID-19 variants in Canada" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1848895043807-metadata-" title="Growing concern about COVID-19 variants in Canada"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/940/735/boudjikanian-variant-concerns.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>COVID-19 numbers are falling, but Canadian health officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the presence of two coronavirus variants. A variant first found in the U.K. has been confirmed in three provinces while a variant first discovered in South Africa variant has been found in two provinces.<!-- --> <!-- -->4:15</span></span></span></p>  <p>J&amp;J's shot uses a cold virus like a Trojan horse to carry the spike gene into the body, where cells make harmless copies of the protein to prime the immune system in case the real virus comes along.</p>  <p>Rival AstraZeneca makes a similar cold virus vaccine that requires two doses. Both the AstraZeneca and J&amp;J vaccines can be stored in a refrigerator, making them easier to ship and&nbsp;use in developing countries than the frozen kind made by Pfizer and Moderna.</p>  <p>J&amp;J said its vaccine works consistently in a broad range of people: A third of participants were over age 60, and more than 40 per cent had other illnesses putting them at risk of severe COVID-19, including obesity, diabetes and HIV.</p>  <h2>Vaccine producers need to be 'nimble': Fauci</h2>  <p>J&amp;J said the vaccine is safe, with reactions similar to other COVID-19 shots, such as fever, that occur when the immune system is revved up.</p>  <p>"Gambling on one dose was certainly worthwhile," said&nbsp;Mammen, but J&amp;J has&nbsp;hedged its bets with a study of a two-dose version of its vaccine, which is still underway.</p>  <p>While it released few details, the company said there were no serious allergic reactions. But occasionally other COVID-19 vaccines trigger such reactions, which can be reversed if promptly treated — and authorities have warned people to be on the lookout regardless of which type of vaccine is used.</p>  <p>A handful of coronavirus variants have gained attention in recent weeks, a development that Fauci and the new director of the Centers for Disease Control described as one to be expected.</p>  <p>"I think we should be treating every case right now as if it's a variant," said the CDC's Dr. Rochelle Walensky.</p>  <p>"We will continue to see the evolution of mutants," said&nbsp;Fauci. "We will have to be nimble to adjust to make versions of the vaccine that are actually specifically directed to whatever mutations are prevalent at the time."</p>  <p>Friday's interim results come on the heels of another vaccine in final testing. Novavax reported this week that its vaccine appears 89 per cent effective in a U.K. study, and that it also seems to work — though not as well — against new mutated versions of the virus circulating in Britain and South Africa. A larger study in the U.S. and Mexico is still enrolling volunteers.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

Demand soared after Beijing last year imposed a sweeping new national security law on the former British colony following months of pro-democracy protests.</p>    <p>"The British side's attempt to turn a large number of Hong Kong people into second-class British citizens has completely changed the nature of the two sides' original understanding of BNO," Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing.</p>  <p>"This move seriously infringes on China's sovereignty, grossly interferes in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs, and seriously violates international law and the basic norms of international relations. China will no longer recognize the so-called BNO passport as a travel document and proof of identity starting from Jan. 31, and reserves the right to take further measures."</p>  <h2>Multiple passports</h2>  <p>Many Hong Kongers carry multiple passports and it is unclear what if anything the Chinese government could do to prevent people entering the U.K. through the BNO visa plan. As a further protection of personal privacy, a cellphone app will allow applicants to download their biometric information without having to be&nbsp;seen visiting the British visa office.</p>  <p>The BNO passport was originally a disappointment for Hong Kongers when it was first offered ahead of Hong Kong's handover to Chinese rule in 1997. At the time, it offered only the right to visit for six months with no right to work or become a full citizen. Applicants had to have been born before the handover date.</p>    <p>However, pressure grew to expand such privileges as China increasingly cracked down on civil and political life in Hong Kong in what critics say violates China's commitment to maintain the city's separate way of life for 50 years after the handover. China first declared the 1984 Sino-British Declaration setting out the handover arrangements null and void despite its recognition by the United Nations, then imposed the national security law on the territory after the city's legislature was unable to pass it on its own.</p>  <p>"I am immensely proud that we have brought in this new route for Hong Kong BNOs to live, work and make their home in our country," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement.</p>  <p>"In doing so we have honoured our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong, and we have stood up for freedom and autonomy —&nbsp;values both the U.K. and Hong Kong hold dear."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <header>  <nav> <a href="https://mjj.io/">Home</a> <a href="https://mjj.io/about">About</a> <a href="https://mjj.io/rss.xml">RSS</a> </nav> </header> <section>  <time datetime="2021-01-26T00:00:00+00:00"> Tuesday, January 26, 2021 </time> <p>During the recent holiday season, I decided to put my admittedly limited Haskell skills to use. While the <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/">CIS 194</a> course exercises are excellent for learning and practicing Haskell, and I enjoy working through them when time permits, I wanted to work on a more structured “real world” project this time.</p> <p>I had a few goals in mind for this particular project. First and foremost, it had to be a well-defined and relatively simple problem that I needed to solve. Secondly, I wanted it to require me to handle IO and side effects, and, lastly, I wanted it to offer me an opportunity to integrate third-party libraries in my app.</p> <p>Only a couple of weeks prior to starting this project, I had been reading the <a href="https://www.eff.org/dice">guide</a> by the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> on how to generate strong six-word <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware">Diceware</a> passphrases. Turning their suggested method into a small command-line utility seemed to suit my three goals nicely, so I decided to give it the old college try. In this blog post, I will elaborate on how this method of generating passphrases works and how it can be implemented in Haskell. The entire project can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/majjoha/passphrase">here</a>.</p> <p>The steps needed to generate a passphrase using the directions provided by EFF are fairly simple, and you only need five dice and a <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt">wordlist</a>:</p> <ol> <li>Roll five dice at the same time and write down the five numbers. The numbers might be something like 4, 3, 4, 6, 3.</li> <li>In your wordlist, find the word that matches the number 43463 (in this case, panoramic), and write it down.</li> <li>Repeat these two steps until you have (at least) six words. Once you have repeated the steps, you might have a passphrase such as “whinny daffodil aerobics upheld bankable niece.”</li> </ol> <p>Before detailing the implementation, it should be noted that the project uses <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio"><code>rio</code></a> as a prelude replacement by setting <code>{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}</code> and importing <code>RIO</code> in all files. With our project description in place, we are now ready to implement it.</p> <p>In order to solve the first step, we need to be able to roll five dice and join the numbers into a single digit. To do so, we define a <code>rollDice</code> function:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>rollDice</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Integer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Integer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>[</span><span>Integer</span><span>]</span>
<span>rollDice</span> <span>rolls</span> <span>start</span> <span>end</span> <span>=</span> <span>replicateM</span> <span>rolls</span> <span>$</span> <span>generateBetween</span> <span>start</span> <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p><code>rollDice</code> takes three arguments: <code>rolls</code> which describes how many dice we want to roll, and <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> which respectively describe the start and end of the range of numbers, we will be working with. Here, we rely on <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptonite-0.27/docs/Crypto-Number-Generate.html#v:generateBetween"><code>generateBetween</code></a> from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptonite">Cryptonite</a> library to generate a random number within our range. Since our result is wrapped in a monad, we need to use <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Control-Monad.html#v:replicateM"><code>replicateM</code></a> to repeat this process N times.</p> <p>Next, we need to be able to join these digits into one. To do this, we will define a function <code>joinDigits</code> in the following manner:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>joinDigits</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>Integer</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Integer</span>
<span>joinDigits</span> <span>=</span> <span>L</span><span>.</span><span>foldl'</span> <span>((</span><span>+</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span> <span>10</span><span>))</span> <span>0</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This function takes a list of <code>Integer</code>s and uses <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-List.html#v:foldl-39-"><code>L.foldl'</code></a> to combine them into one.</p> <p>For every element in the list, we multiply our accumulator with 10 and then add the first element in our list to the result. This process is repeated until our list is empty. For instance, given the numbers 5, 2, 3, 1, 6, and 0 as our initial accumulator value, this is how our result is calculated:</p> <div><div><pre><code>0                  # Initial accumulator value
0*10+5    = 5      # The list is now [2, 3, 1, 6]
5*10+2    = 52     # The list is now [3, 1, 6]
52*10+3   = 523    # The list is now [1, 6]
523*10+1  = 5231   # The list is now [6]
5231*10+6 = 52316  # The list is now []
</code></pre></div></div> <p>With these two functions defined, we now have the necessary parts for generating the indices which we will need later when pairing dice rolls with words. To pair indices with words, we will need a function <code>toTuple</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>toTuple</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>String</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>Integer</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span>
<span>toTuple</span> <span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>""</span><span>)</span>
<span>toTuple</span> <span>(</span><span>index</span><span>:</span><span>word</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>fromMaybe</span> <span>0</span> <span>index'</span><span>,</span> <span>fromMaybe</span> <span>""</span> <span>word'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>where</span>
    <span>index'</span> <span>=</span> <span>readMaybe</span> <span>index</span> <span>::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Integer</span>
    <span>word'</span> <span>=</span> <span>L</span><span>.</span><span>headMaybe</span> <span>word</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p><code>toTuple</code> takes a list of <code>String</code>s and returns a tuple of <code>(Integer, String)</code> where the <code>Integer</code> represents an index, and the <code>String</code> represents the corresponding word from the wordlist. We will call this function later when we map over each line in our wordlist.</p> <p>Since a line in our wordlist follows the format “<code>11111 abacus</code>”, we want to read the first string as an <code>Integer</code> and take the first word of the remaining words in our line. As <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Partial.html#v:read"><code>read</code></a> and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-List-Partial.html#v:head"><code>head</code></a> can throw exceptions, we use the safe alternatives <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Prelude.html#v:readMaybe"><code>readMaybe</code></a> and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-List.html#v:headMaybe"><code>L.headMaybe</code></a> instead. To unwrap our <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Prelude-Types.html#t:Maybe"><code>Maybe</code></a> values, we call <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Prelude.html#v:fromMaybe"><code>fromMaybe</code></a> and use <code>0</code> and <code>""</code> as the default values for the index and word, respectively. Lastly, to avoid non-exhaustive patterns, we pattern match on the empty list and return <code>(0, "")</code> for good measure.</p> <p>Now we can finally move on to writing the logic for generating passphrases which is handled by the <code>passphrase</code> function:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>passphrase</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[[</span><span>Integer</span><span>]]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
<span>passphrase</span> <span>wordlist</span> <span>dice</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>unwords</span> <span>$</span> <span>map</span> <span>(</span><span>flip</span> <span>(</span><span>Map</span><span>.</span><span>findWithDefault</span> <span>""</span><span>)</span> <span>wordMap</span><span>)</span> <span>indices</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>To generate a passphrase, we need to pass our wordlist as the first argument and then a list containing a list of our dice rolls as the second argument. The first argument will look like this:</p> <div><div><pre><code>11111 abacus
11112 abdomen
11113 abdominal
11114 abide
11115 abiding
11116 ability
11121 ablaze
11122 able
11123 abnormal
11124 abrasion
11125 abrasive
11126 abreast
11131 abridge
...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>While the second argument, i.e., our dice rolls, might look like this:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>[</span> <span>[</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span>
<span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span>
<span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>]</span>
<span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span>
<span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>6</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>For all the lists in our list of dice rolls, we use our previously defined <code>joinDigits</code> function to join the numbers in the list into single digits. We then store these digits, or indices, in the <code>indices</code> variable, so we can use them later when we need to look up words in our wordlist.</p> <p>As shown above, the wordlist follows the format <code>INDEX WORD</code>, so we split our wordlist on line breaks using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Prelude.html#v:lines"><code>lines</code></a> which gives us a list of <code>String</code>s containing elements such as <code>"11111 abacus"</code> and <code>"11112 abdomen"</code>. We want to further break these elements down so we will end up with a list of tuples. To do so, we map over all the lines in our wordlist and call <code>(toTuple . words)</code> on them. Now that we have a list of tuples, we can convert it to a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Map.html#t:Map"><code>Map</code></a> using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Map.html#v:fromList"><code>Map.fromList</code></a> so we can perform efficient lookups later.</p> <p>For all our indices, we want to find the corresponding word in our wordlist which we do with <code>map (flip (Map.findWithDefault "") wordMap) indices</code>. Since <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Map.html#v:findWithDefault"><code>Map.findWithDefault</code></a> expects the index of the map to be the second argument and the map to be the last, we use two useful techniques here to make our code less convoluted. First, we leverage currying by applying <code>""</code> as the first argument to <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Map.html#v:findWithDefault"><code>Map.findWithDefault</code></a>, and then we use <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Prelude.html#v:flip"><code>flip</code></a> to reverse the order of the last two arguments.</p> <p>By flipping the order, we can now do a simple map over our <code>indices</code> variable and perform a lookup in our <code>wordMap</code> in a slightly more elegant fashion. Once we have all our words, we can join them into a single <code>String</code> using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-List.html#v:unwords"><code>unwords</code></a>.</p> <p>With the fundamental logic now defined, we only need to read our wordlist from a file, throw five dice six times, and pass these two values to our <code>passphrase</code> function. We do so by defining the entry point of our app in <a href="https://github.com/majjoha/passphrase/blob/main/app/Main.hs"><code>Main.hs</code></a> as such:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>wordlist</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>unpack</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>readFileUtf8</span> <span>"data/eff-large-wordlist.txt"</span>
  <span>dice</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>replicateM</span> <span>6</span> <span>$</span> <span>rollDice</span> <span>5</span> <span>1</span> <span>6</span>
  <span>runSimpleApp</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>logInfo</span> <span>.</span> <span>display</span> <span>.</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>pack</span> <span>$</span> <span>passphrase</span> <span>wordlist</span> <span>dice</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This largely resembles the steps listed earlier. To retrieve our wordlist, we call <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO.html#v:readFileUtf8"><code>readFileUtf8</code></a> with the path to our wordlist, and then <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Text.html#v:unpack"><code>T.unpack</code></a> to convert the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Text.html#t:Text"><code>Text</code></a> value into a <code>String</code>.</p> <p>Next, we roll our five dice six times by calling <code>replicateM 6 $ rollDice 5 1 6</code>, and pass our <code>wordlist</code> and <code>dice</code> to the <code>passphrase</code> function.</p> <p>After calling our <code>passphrase</code> function, we now have a passphrase that we need to output in our terminal. Following the conventional structure for how to build apps using <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio"><code>rio</code></a>, we run our app as a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.15.0/docs/RIO-Prelude-Simple.html#t:SimpleApp"><code>SimpleApp</code></a> which provides a convenient default configuration. We convert the result from our <code>passphrase</code> function into a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Text.html#t:Text"><code>Text</code></a> value, then a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.15.0/docs/RIO.html#t:Utf8Builder"><code>Utf8Builder</code></a>, and, lastly, print it in our terminal with <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.15.0/docs/RIO.html#v:logInfo"><code>logInfo</code></a>.</p> <p>With everything in place, we have now reached our goal and can finally build our project by running <code>stack build</code> and generate a passphrase:</p> <div><div><pre><code>% stack exec -- passphrase
polar geek nimble okay appealing trim
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In my experience, the Haskell community is great at sharing their knowledge on both Twitter and in various blog posts. With this blog post, I hope to contribute back to the community and help especially the people newer to the language who might want to move beyond contrived exercises and learn how to build smaller apps. If you are interested, you can find the project on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/majjoha/passphrase">here</a>, and if you have any feedback, I am all ears.</p> </section> </div></div>]]>

<p>Arguably one of the strangest events in European history, to this day the exact cause of the plague is still up for debate.</p>

<p>When one thinks of the great European plagues we imagine the horrors of the <a href="https://www.historytoday.com/ole-j-benedictow/black-death-greatest-catastrophe-ever">Black Death</a>, which rampaged its way across medieval Europe. High born or peasant, all were subject to the misery it brought to our towns and villages.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_plague_of_1518">Dancing Plague</a>, however, appears quite comical at first glance. Its victims displayed signs of delirium and their symptoms were a relentless need to dance and contort their bodies.</p>

<p>The event took place in the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace"> Alsace</a> region – which at the time was part of the<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Holy-Roman-Empire"> Holy Roman Empire</a> – and over 400 people are said to have fallen victim to this mania.</p><p>The first alleged case of the Dancing Plague arose when a Strasbourg native, Mrs Troffea, began to dance in the street. Within a matter of days, others in Strasbourg has joined Mrs Troffea and quickly the numbers began to swell.</p><p>Within a month there were scores of people dancing for up to six days at a time, resulting in death by exhaustion, heart attack or stroke.</p>



<p>As the situation deteriorated, many concerned nobles in the Alsace region sought the advice of physicians and the clergy. Many believed the mania currently being exhibited on their streets were being caused by astrological events or even witchcraft.</p>

<p>Physicians denied the notion of the supernatural and instead believed the cause of this epidemic to be a natural one. ‘Hot blood’ was the prognosis, and in an even stranger turn of events, the physicians actually advised that those suffering continue to dance so as to wear off the effects of the affliction.</p>

<p>Authorities even went so far as to draft in musicians to assist in the affair. The reality, however, is that those affected by this bizarre ‘disease’ were pushing their bodies to the limit of human endurance.</p>

<p>When one considers the strain that long-distance running, swimming or other forms of exercise have upon the body, then dancing near continuously for days on end without hydration or food is very dangerous.</p><h4><strong>Potential Causes</strong></h4>

<p>There are a number of theories that point toward the source of this outbreak in 1518, which was not the first time a dancing epidemic had occurred. In the late 14th century, a similar event took place in modern-day Belgium and Luxembourg.</p>

<p>One cause points toward ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergot">ergot</a>‘, a psychotropic mould that grows on rye crops. This substance is known to cause delusions and spasms, however, it also cuts off blood supply to the extremities, making basic movement very difficult.</p>

<p>Another popular modern hypothesis is that the cause was simply mass-hysteria. The same general region had seen similar occurrences in the past, and on both occasions, the regions in question were blighted by famine, disease and social &amp; religious unrest.</p><p>This was a particularly tumultuous time in European history, and with social upheaval also comes uncertainty and fear.</p>

<p>People in the 16th century were very spiritual and we see on many occasions that superstition can lead to hysteria, unrest, and even violence. Historian John Waller hypothesises that whilst in a distressed psychological state, the people of Strasbourg may have entered a trance. Thereafter, the issue was exacerbated by the superstitious nature of their neighbours and peers.</p>

<p>There is no denying that the Dancing Plague spread very quickly, and almost appears to take the form of a contagious disease. Spreading quickly throughout the peasantry the hysteria brought turmoil to Strasbourg, and it is an event that still baffles many to this day.</p>

"So we think that public rules by Parliament would help clarify these things and obviously apply across the internet."</p>  <p>Chan said Facebook already removes content considered illegal in Canada such as hate speech, revenge porn, and content involving child exploitation or terrorism. It also applies other Canadian laws such as removing ads for things like baby walkers that Health Canada has prohibited for sale in Canada.</p>  <p>Chan said Facebook also goes further and removes content that isn't illegal in Canada such as posts involving nudity, bullying or harassment. While Chan said Facebook has a sophisticated system in place, he said it would welcome a move by Parliament to help draw the line between prohibited and allowable content.</p>  <p>"We would welcome further rules. We would welcome further guidance and we would ... welcome rules that apply to everyone equally."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155004.1587157658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/facebook-canada-public-policy-kevin-chan.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155004.1587157658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/facebook-canada-public-policy-kevin-chan.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155004.1587157658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/facebook-canada-public-policy-kevin-chan.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155004.1587157658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/facebook-canada-public-policy-kevin-chan.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155004.1587157658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/facebook-canada-public-policy-kevin-chan.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155004.1587157658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/facebook-canada-public-policy-kevin-chan.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Facebook Canada's global director and head of public policy Kevin Chan says the tech giant would welcome clearer rules regarding what can - and can't - be posted online.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Chris Wattie/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Chan said Facebook would also like to see stronger privacy legislation and has called for changes in tax provisions such as collecting and remitting sales tax to the government.</p>  <p>However, Chan said it would be a mistake for Canada to try to follow Australia's attempt to force tech giants to pay news media for their content shared on Facebook.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"Some of the ideas that we've seen discussed, such as the ones proposed in Australia where Facebook would be required to pay for links that are shared on our platform that we don't control, is going to be unworkable, we wouldn't be able to make that work because that's just not how things get shared onto Facebook."</p>  <h2>Legislation on tech giants expected</h2>  <p>Chan's comments come as he and Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault are each scheduled to testify separately today before the House of Commons heritage committee on the relationship between Facebook and the government. The hearing was convened following a news report last fall suggesting that the tech giant's relationship with some Canadian government officials was too cozy.</p>  <p>In his latest mandate letter, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau charged Guilbeault with ensuring that the revenues of web giants are shared more fairly with creators and the media. Guilbeault is also tasked with making sure social media companies&nbsp;"take action on combating hate groups and online hate and harassment, ideologically motivated violent extremism and terrorist organizations."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366690.1611961724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/trudeau-cabinet-20191120.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366690.1611961724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/trudeau-cabinet-20191120.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366690.1611961724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/trudeau-cabinet-20191120.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366690.1611961724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/trudeau-cabinet-20191120.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366690.1611961724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/trudeau-cabinet-20191120.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366690.1611961724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/trudeau-cabinet-20191120.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault is set to testify today before the House of Commons heritage committee. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Camille Gagné-Raynault, press secretary to Guilbeault, said the government is planning to introduce two separate pieces of legislation related to tech giants. The first, which they plan to introduce this winter, will address "online harms."</p>  <p>"For the other one, we are currently exploring options for a made-in-Canada formula that would ultimately lead to a comprehensive, coherent and equitable digital framework for both Canadian news publishers and digital platforms."</p>  <h2>Social media platforms scrutinized&nbsp;</h2>  <p>Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have been in the spotlight in recent weeks after right-wing demonstrators stormed Washington's Capitol building. In the wake of the riot, Facebook and Twitter suspended former President Donald Trump's accounts.</p>  <p>However, as social media giants have exerted more control over what is posted on their sites, those whose content was removed have gravitated to other platforms like Parler, Gab, Telegram or Omega Canada.</p>    <p>It is not clear whether the Canadian government could impose Canadian laws on sites that are used by Canadians but which are not located in Canada.</p>  <p>Chan said Facebook has been steadily toughening up its community standards over the past two years, removing groups and individuals that advocate things like white supremacy. More recently, Facebook removed militarized social networks from its platform and QAnon conspiracy sites.</p>    <p>Chan said Facebook is working with Canadian experts like Barbara Perry, director of the Centre on Hate, Bias and Extremism at Ontario Tech University, to identify extremist content and block it. But as Facebook removes things like hate speech, those trying to disseminate it try to find ways to get around Facebook's systems.</p>  <p>"If we start removing certain people, certain presences on Facebook and Instagram, it is very possible that they evolve their tactics and try to work around our enforcement measures," said Chan. "This is an ongoing security matter for us and as they evolve, we will evolve."</p>  <p><em>Elizabeth Thompson can be reached at <a href="mailto:elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca">elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca</a>.</em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="what-is-pony">What is Pony?</h2>

<p>Pony is an open-source, object-oriented, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor-model</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">capabilities-secure</a>, high-performance programming language.</p>

<p>If you are looking to jump in and get started with Pony <em>right now</em>, you can try it in your browser using the <a href="http://playground.ponylang.io/">Pony Playground</a>. Keep reading if you are interested in what makes Pony different and why you should consider using it.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the early history of Pony and how it came into existence, you’re in luck: <a href="https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2017/05/an-early-history-of-pony/">“An Early History of Pony”</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-pony-different">What makes Pony different?</h2>

<h3 id="pony-is-type-safe">Pony is type safe</h3>

<p><em>Really type safe</em>. There’s a mathematical <a href="https://www.ponylang.io/media/papers/fast-cheap-with-proof.pdf">proof</a> and everything.</p>

<h3 id="pony-is-memory-safe">Pony is memory safe</h3>

<p>There are no dangling pointers and no buffer overruns. The language doesn’t even have the concept of null!</p>

<h3 id="exception-safe">Exception-Safe</h3>

<p>There are no runtime exceptions. All exceptions have defined semantics, and they are <em>always</em> caught.</p>

<h3 id="data-race-free">Data-race Free</h3>

<p>Pony doesn’t have locks nor atomic operations or anything like that. Instead, the type system ensures at compile time that your concurrent program can never have data races. So you can write highly concurrent code and never get it wrong.</p>

<h3 id="deadlock-free">Deadlock-Free</h3>

<p>This one is easy because Pony has no locks at all! So they definitely don’t deadlock, because they don’t exist!</p>

<h3 id="native-code">Native Code</h3>

<p>Pony is an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled language. There is no interpreter nor virtual machine.</p>

<h3 id="compatible-with-c">Compatible with C</h3>

<p>Pony programs can natively call C libraries. Our compiler is able to generate a C-header file for Pony libraries. Consequently, C/C++ programs can natively call Pony programs!</p>

<h2 id="why-pony">Why Pony?</h2>

<p>There’s plenty to love about Pony, but more than anything else, what we love most is that Pony makes it easy to write fast, safe, efficient, highly concurrent programs. How? The Pony type system introduces a novel concept: “reference capabilities”. <a href="https://tutorial.ponylang.io/capabilities/reference-capabilities.html">Reference capabilities</a> allow you to label different bits of data based on how that data can be shared. The Pony compiler will then verify that you are in fact correctly using the data based on the labels you provide. Reference capabilities combined with Pony’s actor model of concurrency makes for a powerful pairing. Let’s dig in and take a quick look:</p>

<h3 id="mutable-state-is-hard">Mutable state is hard</h3>

<p>The problem with concurrency is shared mutable data. If two different threads have access to the same piece of data then they might try to update it at the same time. At best this can lead to those two threads having different versions of the data. At worst the updates can interact badly resulting in the data being overwritten with garbage. The standard way to avoid these problems is to use locks to prevent data updates from happening at the same time. This causes big performance hits and is very difficult to get right, so it causes lots of bugs.</p>

<h3 id="immutable-data-can-be-safely-shared">Immutable data can be safely shared</h3>

<p>Any data that is immutable (i.e. it cannot be changed) is safe to use concurrently. Since it is immutable it is never updated and it’s the updates that cause concurrency problems.</p>

<h3 id="isolated-data-is-safe">Isolated data is safe</h3>

<p>If a block of data has only one reference to it then we call it <em>isolated</em>. Since there is only one reference to it, isolated data cannot be <em>shared</em> by multiple threads, so there are no concurrency problems. Isolated data can be passed between multiple threads. As long as only one of them has a reference to it at a time then the data is still safe from concurrency problems.</p>

<h3 id="every-actor-is-single-threaded">Every actor is single threaded</h3>

<p>The code within a single actor is never run concurrently. This means that, within a single actor, data updates cannot cause problems. It’s only when we want to share data between actors that we have problems.</p>

<h3 id="reference-capabilities-enforce-safe-data-handling">Reference capabilities enforce safe data handling</h3>

<p>By sharing only immutable data and exchanging only isolated data we can have safe concurrent programs without locks. The problem is that it’s very difficult to do that correctly. If you accidentally hang on to a reference to some isolated data you’ve handed over or change something you’ve shared as immutable then everything goes wrong. What you need is for the compiler to force you to live up to your promises. Pony reference capabilities allow the compiler to do just that.</p>

<p>If you ask us, that’s pretty damn cool and a hell of a reason to give Pony a try.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-pony">Why not Pony?</h2>

<p>There are many valid reasons to not use Pony. Amongst these are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lack of API stability</li>
<li>Lack of high-quality 3rd party libraries</li>
<li>Limited native tooling</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="api-stability">API stability</h3>

<p>Pony is pre-1.0. We regularly have releases that involve breaking changes. This lack of stability is plenty of reason for many projects to avoid using Pony.</p>

<h3 id="batteries-required">Batteries required</h3>

<p>If your project is going to succeed or fail based on the size of community around the tools you are using, Pony is not a good choice for you. While it’s possible to write stable, high-performance applications using Pony, you will have to do a decent amount of work. The pool of open source, ready to use Pony libraries is very small. If it’s not in the standard library then odds are you are going to have to add it yourself, either by writing it from scratch in Pony or by wrapping an existing C library using Pony’s excellent <a href="https://tutorial.ponylang.io/c-ffi/">C-FFI</a> functionality.</p>

<h3 id="tooling">Tooling</h3>

<p>There’s a wide swath of tooling that some people have come to expect that isn’t currently available for Pony. We don’t have an IDE. You can use standard debuggers like GDB or LLDB but the experience still has some rough edges. If you are comfortable working with a basic text editor and using LLDB, VTune and other tools, you’ll probably be ok. Just don’t expect a full, robust ecosystem. We aren’t there yet.</p>

<p>If your project isn’t going to get a great deal of benefit from any of Pony’s strengths, then you shouldn’t use Pony. If you are writing a single threaded application without any overriding performance concerns, and you need access to a large community and wealth of libraries then you’re much better off selecting another language. However, we hope that you see enough potential in Pony to start playing around with it even if it isn’t right for your current project.</p>

<h2 id="the-pony-philosophy">The Pony Philosophy</h2>

<p>In the spirit of <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">Richard Gabriel</a>, the Pony philosophy is neither “the-right-thing” nor “worse-is-better”. It is “get-stuff-done”.</p>

<h3 id="correctness">Correctness</h3>

<p>Incorrectness is simply not allowed. <em>It’s pointless to try to get stuff done if you can’t guarantee the result is correct.</em></p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>Runtime speed is more important than everything except correctness. If performance must be sacrificed for correctness, try to come up with a new way to do things. <em>The faster the program can get stuff done, the better. This is more important than anything except a correct result.</em></p>

<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>

<p>Simplicity can be sacrificed for performance. It is more important for the interface to be simple than the implementation. <em>The faster the programmer can get stuff done, the better. It’s ok to make things a bit harder on the programmer to improve performance, but it’s more important to make things easier on the programmer than it is to make things easier on the language/runtime.</em></p>

<h3 id="consistency">Consistency</h3>

<p>Consistency can be sacrificed for simplicity or performance.
<em>Don’t let excessive consistency get in the way of getting stuff done.</em></p>

<h3 id="completeness">Completeness</h3>

<p>It’s nice to cover as many things as possible, but completeness can be sacrificed for anything else. <em>It’s better to get some stuff done now than wait until everything can get done later.</em></p>

<p>The “get-stuff-done” approach has the same attitude towards correctness and simplicity as “the-right-thing”, but the same attitude towards consistency and completeness as “worse-is-better”. It also adds performance as a new principle, treating it as the second most important thing (after correctness).</p>

<h2 id="guiding-principles">Guiding Principles</h2>

<p>Throughout the design and development of the language, the following principles should be adhered to.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use the get-stuff-done approach.</p></li>

<li><p>Simple grammar. Language must be trivial to parse for both humans and computers.</p></li>

<li><p>No loadable code. Everything is known to the compiler.</p></li>

<li><p>Fully type safe. There is no “trust me, I know what I’m doing” coercion.</p></li>

<li><p>Fully memory safe. There is no “this random number is really a pointer, honest.”</p></li>

<li><p>No crashes. A program that compiles should never crash (although it may hang or do something unintended).</p></li>

<li><p>Sensible error messages. Where possible use simple error messages for specific error cases. It is fine to assume the programmer knows the definitions of words in our lexicon, but avoid compiler or other computer science jargon.</p></li>

<li><p>Inherent build system. No separate applications required to configure or build.</p></li>

<li><p>Aim to reduce common programming bugs through the use of restrictive syntax.</p></li>

<li><p>Provide a single, clean and clear way to do things rather than catering to every programmer’s preferred prejudices.</p></li>

<li><p>Make upgrades clean. Do not try to merge new features with the ones they are replacing, if something is broken remove it and replace it in one go. Where possible provide rewrite utilities to upgrade source between language versions.</p></li>

<li><p>Reasonable build time. Keeping down build time is important, but less important than runtime performance and correctness.</p></li>

<li><p>Allowing the programmer to omit some things from the code (default arguments, type inference, etc) is fine, but fully specifying should always be allowed.</p></li>

<li><p>No ambiguity. The programmer should never have to guess what the compiler will do, or vice-versa.</p></li>

<li><p>Document required complexity. Not all language features have to be trivial to understand, but complex features must have full explanations in the docs to be allowed in the language.</p></li>

<li><p>Language features should be minimally intrusive when not used.</p></li>

<li><p>Fully defined semantics. The semantics of all language features must be available in the standard language docs. It is not acceptable to leave behavior undefined or “implementation dependent”.</p></li>

<li><p>Efficient hardware access must be available, but this does not have to pervade the whole language.</p></li>

<li><p>The standard library should be implemented in Pony.</p></li>

<li><p>Interoperability. Must be interoperable with other languages, but this may require a shim layer if non-primitive types are …</p></li></ul></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Not long after she got home from a Women’s March event in Jakarta in 2018, Anindya Restuviani opened her Instagram account to find hundreds of follow requests — and a slew of insults. In direct messages, users said she “looked like a dog,” that her genitalia smelled, and that they would remember her face so they could rape her on the street.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Restuviani works for several feminist associations in the Indonesian capital, and a photo of her at the rally had been circulated on the Instagram account of a religious hard-liner with hundreds of thousands of followers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The scare made me take more precautions on social media, [do] more self-censorship,” Restuviani says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As civil rights groups in Indonesia increasingly come to rely on online tools for discussion and organization, female activists in the country are struggling against relentless abuse and discrimination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From a small house on a side street in Jakarta’s Tebet District, veteran human rights activist Dhyta Caturani is trying to reclaim the internet for women and minority groups through her own initiative, PurpleCode Collective.</p>



<p>“At the beginning, there was this imagination that internet technology was a democratic space — equal, open, and a decentralized power. In reality, it is not,” Caturani says.</p>



<p>“Technology is still mostly developed by cisgender, heterosexual white men from the global north countries who have biases, therefore, many women, along with gender and sexual minority groups, are marginalized.”</p>



<p>Caturani, who often wears thick-rimmed, oversized glasses, has been on the frontlines of Indonesian civil movements for more than two decades. In 1999, at a political demonstration against military interference in the country’s politics, <a href="https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/dhyta-caturani-nothing-has-changed-indonesia">she was hospitalized</a> after being shot in the back with a plastic bullet. Since the Reformation — Indonesia’s democratic revival, which spanned the late 1990s and early 2000s — she has led a number of women’s rights campaigns, including the Purple Rose Campaign against sex trafficking; Reclaim the Night, <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/03/11/women-city-reclaim-night.html">which fought the stigma attached to women going out after dark</a>; and One Billion Rising, a movement to raise awareness about violence against women through flash-mob dance parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past few years, she has turned her gaze online, after concluding that women are just as unsafe in digital spaces as they are on the street. Like most women — and particularly activists — on social media, Caturani routinely faces threats of violence and abuse. In 2010,<strong> </strong>after she posted on Facebook about a protest against a government official who publicly blamed a rape victim for wearing a miniskirt on public transport, a man sent her a message saying: “You deserve to be raped. Just wait, there will be someone who comes to rape you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Caturani says the threat was particularly disturbing because the sender wasn’t a random stranger —&nbsp;he had attended a workshop that she had been involved in. “I thought he may have known where I live,” she says.</p>

<p>Most of the threats Caturani received came from male social media users. Women do go on the attack online, but their threats are different, Caturani says. Male users often target women’s bodies and sexuality, usually through rape threats or name-calling.</p>



<p>In 2014, Caturani began to research security techniques for women online. She found that the software she needed to protect herself — even basic products, such as password managers, programs to safeguard sensitive files, and virtual private networks — were out of reach for most people in Indonesia, and especially women and marginalized groups. Getting and using them assumed layers of privilege that may not have occurred to developers — including being able to afford digital tools and being fluent enough in English to use them. “You have to have the knowledge first, and that’s a privilege,” Caturani says. “Digital security was still very masculine, so I had problems when entering the ecosystem.”</p>



<p>Those same biases have led to the creation of unsafe spaces for women, Caturani says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Indonesia, cases of online gender-based violence spiked by 300% in 2019, according to a report by Komnas Perempuan, the national commission on violence against women. Caturani says that social media platforms bear some responsibility for this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The platforms allow people to commit violence because of the way they were created. They never considered safety for women,” she says. “The platforms were built by the biases of their developers, which is why the platforms become unsafe and marginalize many people.”</p>



<p>Caturani was one of 50 activists convened by the Association for Progressive Communications, an independent network of activists, for a 2014 meeting that led to the formulation of the <a href="https://www.apc.org/en/pubs/feminist-principles-internet-version-20">Feminist Principles of the Internet</a>.</p>



<p>The 15 principles — which were updated in 2016 to include two additional points — are designed to reclaim the internet for women and minority groups. They reject surveillance, anonymity restrictions, online gender-based violence, and attempts to control data and women’s expression by the state and corporations. They ask for greater access, greater data protection, inclusion at decision-making tables, more free and open source tech, and embedding the ethics of consent into the design and policies of internet platforms.</p>



<p>In 2015, Caturani founded PurpleCode in Jakarta to help implement these principles. At the time, there was a growing number of online feminist initiatives in Indonesia. There was <a href="https://magdalene.co/"><em>Magdalene</em></a>, a feminist online magazine <a href="https://www.splicemedia.com/magdalene-indonesia/">set up in 2013</a>; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/jakartafeminist">Jakarta Feminist Discussion Group</a>, a Facebook group created in 2014 that <a href="https://www.jakartafeminist.com/">later evolved into a formal association</a>; and <a href="http://indonesiafeminis.com/">Indonesia Feminis</a>, a multiplatform provider of feminist news and events established in 2015.</p>



<p>But unlike those outlets, which simply use technology to disseminate information, Caturani says that PurpleCode’s main purpose is to question technology and disrupt its culture by encouraging more women and minority groups to become developers and to get involved in designing governance structures in tech.</p>



<p>Until the pandemic forced PurpleCode’s physical space to shut, it hosted incubation programs, workshops, and training for women and gender-nonconforming people. When it reopens, Caturani hopes to hold coding classes for middle and high school–age girls.</p>



<p>While the issues that Caturani first identified a decade ago seem as or more prevalent today, Caturani says that is partly because Indonesian women now have the language to articulate their concerns. As it is increasingly common for people to talk publicly about online violence, more women are able to identify experiences they have had as violent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PurpleCode’s work has taken on fresh relevance over the past few months. Demonstrations against the government have been <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/hacking-democracy/">met with a campaign of digital threats against protesters</a>, and the collective’s security tools have been adopted by a number of activists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Caturani says that, as protests increasingly move online, it is vital to remember how the internet is not just a tool for the movement but a place where real people live and interact.</p>



<p>“If the internet is our space to build movements, then [it] must be fought for to be the space we all had imagined it to be at the beginning,” she says.</p>

<p>Though I'm right now not employed as a software engineer I have been writing code under various hats for the last few years (As a data scientist, ML engineer, and software engineer). Naturally me being me I have not just done the thing but also reflected about the thing. Questions like what's good software, what does being a good software engineer mean, how should meetings be ran, and so on. Here are some thoughts on that.</p>

<h2 id="the-cost-of-disagreement">The cost of disagreement</h2>
<p>In many cases a disagreement may be over something that both sides agree is not sizable. I can think something is 80% good whereas you think it's just 75% and I can think the opposite of your solution. But we can agree that the cost to resolve that disagreement can defeat the gains from actually choosing the best solution. So "I disagree but let's go ahead" is something that should be done in these cases, with a coin flip if needed. Consensus-driven decision making may be good at some stages, especially if paired with good processes around meetings but it can lead to gridlock.</p>
<p>I'm of course not the first one in proposing the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit">disagree and commit</a>" principle though I only learned this had a name very recently.</p>
<h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>
<p>Meetings can be terrible, meetings can be great. Bad meetings tend to occur because people show up without having thought much about what is to be discussed in the meeting. Isn't the point of the meeting to do the thinking? That's one way, perhaps the most common way of viewing meetings, and it's a lazy default because they don't impose homework on you. But doing the thinking in real time, with many voices to be sequentially heard and given a constrained time is not great for good decision making. Many times I've seen meetings that dragged on forever where disagreements would keep circling back and forth, or where we would simply be talking past each other.</p>
<p>A better way to run meetings, which I also tried, is to collate whatever is it that the outcome should be before the meeting. If it's an architecture design meeting, do the work, usually the meeting owner can do most of it, even if they know it won't be 100% perfect. Then ask for feedback a week ahead of the meeting. Incorporate the feedback to the document, repeat. Note down disagreements; have a literal "Standing disagreements" section in the document with the key points that are not quite agreed on, plus the reasoning behind them. Having everyone review the disagreements and having time to do so, on (digital) paper sets up a clearer goal for the meeting: Iron out specific points. During the meeting, a moderator would go one by one over those points and ask for a decision, then highlighting in bold which option was chosen. Then we would move to the next point and so on. Everyone liked this kind of meeting.</p>
<h2 id="ownership">Ownership</h2>
<p>Lack of ownership is the root of all evil (ok, some exaggeration here). Everyone's problem is no one's problem. In documentation, lack of ownership means finding obsolete documentation and no one person to go to to get it fixed; or what's worse, no system in place to enforce that the documentation is up to date (i.e. every document could disappear 6 months after it's published unless whoever uploaded or created it says otherwise in an email the system sends them after six months, documents shouldn't live rent free). Or having a team dedicated to tirelessly aggregating information so that everything everyone is doing is visible. We had something like this in my first job at the London Electric Vehicle Company (LEVC) and I suspect this may be more common in automotive or aerospace than in software or in biotech.</p>
<p>Apple had a very clever idea in defining <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1279478277585817600">Directly Responsible Individuals</a> (DRIs) for everything. Having a name accountable instead of a vague "the team" or "the process" makes it easy to make changes. I think many people are reluctant to blame individuals for mistakes they make, but well timed blame (feedback about what mistakes were made, potentially there being consequences for grave mistakes etc) can both help the blamed individual (They can know what to improve) and the team as a whole to succeed.</p>
<p>Something I once thought is that many decisions that involve estimates could be made into bets, either for small amounts of money or some kind of token. If you say X will be finished in a week and it takes longer, then you lose. This could be gamed by overestimating how long things take, but something like this seems like the right way to get better at making decisions involving uncertainty.</p>
<h2 id="questions-as-systemic-failures">Questions as systemic failures</h2>
<p>Every question asked in an internal Slack is a policy failure. It means the existing information systems failed to deliver an answer, and the user falls back to manually asking the hive mind's tacit knowledge. This has various problems: One, it introduces longer delays between question and answer, especially if whoever knows the answer is in another timezone. Two, it embraces tacit knowledge in a distributed and incoherent fashion: If there is no one true answer there can be many answers and that can lead to disagreements and wrong decisions. Instead, ideally there is a centralized repository of information where for each Q there is one and only one A, and a team dedicated to getting owners of various systems to actually codify their knowledge. This should work well with the ownership system above.</p>

<h2 id="good-software">Good software</h2>
<p>Good software is code that is readable, fast, flexible, and scalable. Out of these only speed is the one that is universally agreed on how to measure. The rest are fuzzy, as are most things in life.</p>
<p>Readable code pretty much depends on who is writing it; <a href="https://github.com/jayfoad/aoc2019apl/blob/master/p12.dyalog">Dyalog</a> looks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a> to me, and the many parenthesis in Lisps can make code hard to read to someone who is not a lisper (I did the experiment; I spent some time learning basic Clojure and while I remain not a Clojurian, the parenthesis become less of an issue). Lifetimes in Rust seem obscure until one know how they work.</p>
<p>Flexible code is code that is easier to extend. This is hard to quantify but anyone that has coded knows it when they see it; a given piece of code can just effortlessly do something new with a two line change, or it may need a thousand line change to work again. The former is more flexible than the latter. Moreover this flexibility shouldn't come at the expense of readability though sometimes this can be the case.</p>
<p>Scalable code is code that works well with small as well as big inputs, this can be achieved in a single machine or many.</p>
<p>The extent to which these matter depend on who is developing it (Readable code depends on individual preferences), and flexibility is not really needed if the end result is more or less fixed; but it's really desired in a startup that is constantly adapting. In that environment, speed may be sacrificed for extra flexibility.</p>
<p>The code that should be written absent any constraints is good code, but real life situations means that the right thing to do is to make tradeoffs and move ahead. Those decisions are at the heart of what experience in software engineering is.</p>
<h2 id="static-types">Static types</h2>
<p>Static typing is great. Early on in a codebase in Python back at Aiden.ai, we made the decision of going for static typing using myopia as much as we could. So instead of writing something like</p>
<pre><code><span>def </span><span>sum_one</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):
  </span><span>return </span><span>x+</span><span>1
</span></code></pre>
<p>We would rather much write</p>
<pre><code><span>def </span><span>sum_one</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:int)-&gt;int:
  </span><span>return </span><span>x+</span><span>1
</span></code></pre>
<p>Or even further, in some cases we would use <em>newtypes</em> to make these type annotations more meaningful, dataclasses to bundle data together, as well as exhaustive enumerations to ensure that all variants of an enum get handled, for example:</p>
<pre><code><span>class </span><span>Operation</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):
  </span><span>Multiply="</span><span>Multiply</span><span>"
  Add="</span><span>Add</span><span>"
Value = Union[int,float]
</span><span>def </span><span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>: NoReturn) -&gt; NoReturn:
    </span><span>raise </span><span>AssertionError</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>Invalid value: </span><span>{x</span><span>!r</span><span>}")
</span><span>def </span><span>do_the_op</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:Value,</span><span>b</span><span>: Value, </span><span>op</span><span>:Operation) -&gt; Value:
  </span><span>if </span><span>op is Operation.Multiply:
    </span><span>return </span><span>a*b
  </span><span>else if </span><span>op is Operation.Add:
    </span><span>return </span><span>a+b
  </span><span>else</span><span>:
    </span><span>assert_never</span><span>(op)   
  
</span></code></pre>
<p>So if we ever say remove an operation or add a new one, mypy will force us to handle it. This is enforced dynamically but most importantly also statically so the code won't pass tests if there is a missing variant.</p>
<p>All these typing (Plus a custom pandas typechecker I wrote, but that's another story) made it relatively easy to refactor, and add new features when we needed to do so. It would have been a huge pain to fly blind without the types. Python has a tendency to blow up in your face when you least expect it. Starting with types from day 1 is something I don't regret having gone for, it didn't make the coding any slower and saved a lot of time (Or so we imagine!).</p>
<p>There seems to be a trend now towards types everywhere. Javascript died (for any serious developer) to let Typescript rise and Ruby, while still around with the Sorbet type checker, got Crystal.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Theodore_Kaczynski#:%7E:text=Consistent%20failure%20to%20attain%20goals,low%20self%2Desteem%20or%20depression.&amp;text=text%20on%20wikisource-,The%20Industrial%20Revolution%20and%20its%20consequences%20have,disaster%20for%20the%20human%20race.&amp;text=The%20industrial%2Dtechnological%20system%20may%20survive%20or%20it%20may%20break%20down.">wise man</a> once said, <em>Python and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race</em>. Python has a tendency to blow up in your face, even with all the typing. The typechecker may be happy but it doesn't guarantee that if it thinks something is type T it's actually so, maybe what you thought was a number is actually a string and because of duck typing it can take a few function calls for the error to manifest itself.</p>
<h2 id="yolo-programming-vs-chill-programming">YOLO programming vs chill programming</h2>
<p>I believe there is a tradeoff between writing a lot of code and writing correct code. In a day you could write X lines of code or you could write X/2. Two days of programmer B will produce the same as one day of programmer A but probably the latter will have introduced fewer bugs. You can write more or less tests, you can be more or less sure that something you just wrote is actually correct.</p>
<p>As you can expect from the number of typos here, I'm more of a YOLO programmer than a chill programmer. I'm the guy that was once pushing to prod from a one-handed GitHub hot fix from my phone as I was having dinner in a hotel in Tokyo (That one did work!).</p>
<p>YOLO programming when the programming language …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Nyxt has a new visual-mode (mouseless text selection)!</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-select.png"></p>

<p>Visual mode is a mouseless way of selecting <span>any</span> text on any page (with as few keystrokes as possible). Conceptually based on <code>vi</code>'s visual mode, Nyxt adapts it for the web.</p>

<p>The first step is to run the <code>visual-mode</code> command.</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-enable.png"></p>
<p>After doing so, you will be presented with hints to select a starting paragraph for your cursor.</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-paragraph.png"></p>
<p>Upon selecting a paragraph, a cursor will appear. You can move the cursor around and press <code>shift-space</code> to toggle the mark (start/stop highlighting).</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-cursor.png"></p>
<p>Importantly, you can use all your favorite keybindings (move by word, move to next line, beginning of line, etc.)!</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-select.png"></p>
<p>Eureka! Just like that, we have selected text, no mouse required!</p>

<p>A very special thank you to <span data-cites="kssytsrk">@kssytsrk</span> for this wonderful addition to Nyxt!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading :-)</p>

January 29, 2021 | https://techtinkering.com/2013/03/05/turbo-pascal-a-great-choice-for-programming-under-cpm/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://techtinkering.com/2013/03/05/turbo-pascal-a-great-choice-for-programming-under-cpm/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>CP/M was blessed with many programming languages, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  I think that Turbo Pascal stands out from these and I'm not alone.  When Turbo Pascal was released in 1983 by Borland, as their first software development application, it was quickly adopted by schools, universities, hobbyists and professional software developers.  Turbo Pascal combined ease of use, power, speed and a great manual all for the really low price of $49.95.</p>
<h2>Why Use Turbo Pascal Under CP/M?</h2>
<p>With TP you get an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), so that you can edit, compile and run all from the same application.  Since the IDE is only 34Kb there is plenty of space left on a disk for your source code and compiled programs.  This is particularly handy for single disk machines.  The editor is very functional and uses a subset of the Wordstar key combinations.</p>
<p>Pascal was designed to be easy to compile and because TP uses a single pass compiler, compilation speed is incredibly quick.  The downside of the compilation speed is that the code is quite a literal translation without much optimization.  However, for many applications this won't be much of an issue compared to the increased programmer productivity.</p>
<p>If you need parts of your program to run faster, you can always embed inline machine code into functions/procedures or access functions in external binaries.  The latter option allows you to create libraries in assembly language and use a jump table to access individual functions with the <code>external</code> keyword.</p>
<p>In 1986 Borland released Turbo Pascal 3.0 which added support for <em>overlays</em>.  The running code could now be swapped in and out from disk as needed.  With careful planning, you could escape the normal 64Kb limit and only be constrained by the capacity of the disk you are running the application from.</p>
<p>The standard library offers a good range of functions and TP keeps quite close to Standard Pascal as defined by Jensen &amp; Wirth in their '<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xXSZbSLFTM8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">User Manual and Report</a>'.  As with all Pascal implementations, there are problems porting programs between implementations.  However, if you aren't using any of the operating system specific calls, then you can easily port to the MS-DOS and CP/M-86 versions.  My only gripe is that TP doesn't support procedures and functions passed as parameters.</p>
<p>Finally, Borland included a highly readable and very complete <a href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/borland/turbo_pascal/Turbo_Pascal_Version_3.0_Reference_Manual_1986.pdf">manual</a>.  It covered not just the IDE, language and libraries, but also detailed information on the memory layout and calling conventions from assembly language.  This meant that you could quickly get up and running with few additional resources.</p>
<h2>How to install</h2>
<p>First download <a href="http://www.retroarchive.org/cpm/lang/TP_301A.ZIP">Turbo Pascal 3.01a</a> for CP/M-80 and unzip the archive.</p>
<p>Put at least <code>TINST.*</code> and <code>TURBO.*</code> files onto a disk.  The real advantage of not copying all the files is seen if you only have a single drive.  The extra room will allow you to edit, compile and run your programs all from the same disk.  For instructions on how to create a virtual disk for z80pack look at: <a href="https://techtinkering.com/articles/emulating-a-cpm-system-with-z80pack/">Emulating a CP/M System With z80pack</a>.</p>
<p>Boot up your CP/M system, put in the disk with TP on it and change to this drive if necessary.  In my examples I am using <code>B:</code></p>
<p>Run the <code>TINST</code> program to set up the screen:</p>
<pre><code>B&gt; tinst
</code></pre>
<p>Press <code>S</code> for <em>Screen Installation</em> and select the appropriate terminal for your set up.  I'm using z80pack, so I select ANSI.  You probably don't want to alter this definition so say No to altering it.  Then enter the speed in Mhz of your machine.  If a suitable terminal isn't listed consult the TP manual for advice.</p>
<p>If you want to configure additional editor commands, you can do this via the <em>Command Installation</em> option.  At the very least, if you have them, you'll probably want to configure the page-up, page-down keys as well as the cursor keys to represent character-left, character-right, line-up and line-down.  If not press <code>Q</code> to quit.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To start the IDE run:</p>
<pre><code>B&gt; turbo
</code></pre>
<p>You should now be looking at the Turbo Pascal splash screen, showing the version, copyright message and which terminal is configured.  At the bottom you are asked whether to 'Include error messages'.  For the moment press <code>Y</code>.</p>
<p>Now you will be presented with the main screen.  You have a number of commands on this screen, which are accessed by a single letter.</p>
<p><img src="https://techtinkering.com/img/articles/turbo_pascal_cpm_main.png"></p><p>To work with a pascal source file, first press <code>W</code> and then enter a filename.  This is the file that the editor will open and it is also the file that the compiler will compile if you haven't selected a main file.</p>
<p>To edit the work file, press <code>E</code>.  The editor uses Wordstar key combinations which you can read more about in the manual.  For now the following keys will be useful to know:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><th>Key command</th><th>Action</th></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-s</td><td>Character Left</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-d</td><td>Character Right</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-e</td><td>Character Up</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-x</td><td>Character Down</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-k s</td><td>Save Document</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-k d</td><td>Quit</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>You can also use any keys that you configured above with the <em>Command Installation</em> option in <code>tinst</code>.</p>
<p>Files are edited in memory so to save them to disk you press <code>S</code> from the main menu.</p>
<p>To compile and run the work file, or main file if selected, press <code>R</code>.  Depending on what is set in the compiler options, this will either compile to a <code>com</code> file or will compile to memory.</p>
<h3>Hello, world!</h3>
<p>To try this with the traditional 'Hello, world!' program, set the work file to <code>hello.pas</code>, edit the file and enter the following, then quit the editor.</p>
<pre><code>program helloworld;
begin
  writeln('Hello, world!');
end.
</code></pre>
<p>Compile and run it by pressing <code>R</code> from the main menu.  You should see it compile and then say hello to the world.</p>
<h2>Video</h2>
<p>The following video shows the creation of a FizzBuzz program using Turbo Pascal and allows us to see just how quick and easy it is.</p>
<p>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/acYu0sL9Ol0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<p>The source code for <code>fizzbuzz.pas</code> used in the video is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>program fizzbuzz(output);
var
  i: integer;
begin
  for i := 1 to 100 do
  begin
    if i mod 15 = 0 then
      write('FizzBuzz ')
    else if i mod 3 = 0 then
      write('Fizz ')
    else if i mod 5 = 0 then
      write('Buzz ')
    else
      write(i, ' ');
  end
end.
</code></pre>

<p>Get the <a href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/borland/turbo_pascal/Turbo_Pascal_Version_3.0_Reference_Manual_1986.pdf">Turbo Pascal 3.0 Manual</a> for CP/M-80, CP/M-86 and PC-DOS/MS-DOS from <a href="http://bitsavers.org/">bitsavers.org</a>.  It is a wonderfully well-laid out manual and you should have no problems using this to learn and get the most out of Turbo Pascal.  You may also want to take a look at a copy of the old Borland musuem page: <a href="http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/20792">Antique Software: Turbo Pascal v3.02</a>.</p>
<p>You are now ready to use Turbo Pascal to write and compile applications like it was 1986.</p>

          <p><b>Check out <a href="https://my-qr.art/">My-QR.art</a> for the final result!</b></p>

          <p>QR codes provide a clear and approachable way of translating the physical world to the
          digital world. When I see a QR code, I always want to scan it to find out what is behind
          it, somehow they always fascinate me. But QR codes always look very similar, could there
          be a way to make them look more cool? Make them a certain specific shape or contain pixel
          art?</p>

          <p>People already (ab)use the error correction build into QR codes to embed their logo
          in it, they simply put their logo over a part of the QR code and let the error correction
          handle the missing data. However, you can never obscure more than 30% of the code (and
          usually a lot less) if you choose this approach. But QR codes are mostly a visualisation
          of data. Can we approach the problem from the other side? What if we don't try to
          design a QR code to fit the data, but fit the data to the design of the QR code that we
          want.</p>

          <p>Spoiler, we can. Check out <a href="https://my-qr.art/">My-QR.art</a>. All the code is
          totally free and open source, so feel free to
          contribute <a href="https://github.com/raatmarien/my-qr.art">on GitHub</a></p>

          <h2 id="the-idea">The idea</h2>

          <p>Say, we want to promote our website. And we have a nice grayscale logo. Now we want to
          have an engaging QR code that looks like our logo.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/my-qr.art-logo.svg" alt="My-QR.art logo"></p><p>And we have an URL that we want the QR code to lead us too, for
            example: <a href="https://my-qr.art/">https://my-qr.art</a>.</p>
          
          <p>We set up a web server that can redirect certain URLs to other URLs. Then we can make
          the beginning of the data of our QR code the URL to that web-server and the rest of the
          QR's data can be anything. So we can choose the rest of the data in any way that makes
          our QR code look most like our design!</p>

          <p>For example the QR code could send you
            to <code>https://my-qr.art/r/arbitrary-super-long-string</code>. On the back-end we tell
            the server to redirect any request with the
            URL <code>https://my-qr.art/r/arbitrary-super-long-string</code>
            to <code>https://my-qr.art</code>. And tada! We have a functional QR code that sends us to
            the address we want, while having way more control over how the QR code looks! Up to 80%
            of the code can be freely designed this way!</p>

          <p>When we have this all working, we could even make nice scannable QR gifs. We could make
          each frame separately and let them all redirect to the same page. I admit, most QR codes
          are printed, so gifs might not make the most sense, but they look pretty cool! To keep you
          excited for the rest of the article, here is world's first ever working QR gif (as far
          as I know)!</p>
          
          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr.gif" alt="Animated QR code that shows a running horse"></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Horse_in_Motion">The running horse might
          remind you of some other movie...</a></p>

          <h2 id="qr-codes">How does QR work?</h2>

          <p>Now that we know the concept, lets get started. First we need to know how QR codes
          actually work.</p>

          <p>QR codes encode data by making some blocks dark and other light. The QR scanner can
          then read which are dark and which are light and reconstruct the original data. QR codes
          can have 40 different sizes, from <em>version 1</em> (very small, 17x17) to <em>version
          40</em> (very big, 177x177). QR codes are made of black and white 'modules' and
          each module has one of the following 4 functions:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Help the scanner recognise and orient the QR code</li>
            <li>Give information about the QR code size, type and other internal QR stuff</li>
            <li>Encode the actual data that the QR code represents</li>
            <li>Encode error correction info about the QR code</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 id="drawing">Creating a template</h2>

          <p>Our plan is to allow the user to choose the colour of any module that has function 3. So
          the first step is to let the user know which pixels they can control and which pixels they
          can't control for the QR code size they chose. For now lets try to create an image on
          which the modules with function 3 are coloured white and all other modules are coloured
          grey.</p>

          <p>For this we can colour all the modules and error data. To get this right you really need
          to dive into how QR codes work. We need to think about the data encoding, interleaving,
          extra eyes, error words and more. We'll also need to take into account that we'll
          need to reserve first few characters of our data for the start of our URL. Luckily there
          is a great source on QR codes on the
          internet, <a href="https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/introduction">the QR code
          tutorial from Thonky.com</a>. Putting the work in, we get something like this, for version
          30.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr-template.png" alt="A template for a QR design"></p><h2 id="reading">Reading a design</h2>

          <p>Now let's work on the other side of the puzzle, when we have a design that a user
          has drawn on our template, how do we convert it to a working QR code? QR codes have 4
          possible types of encoding: <em>numeric</em>, <em>alphanumeric</em>, <em>binary</em>
          and <em>kanji</em>. We need something that we can create valid URLs with, so numeric and
          kanji are out. Secondly, we need the random string at the end of our URL to
          be <em>normal</em> enough so that QR scanners will still recognise our code as an
          URL. The <em>binary</em> encoding will create characters that aren't ordinarily found
          in URLs ('\0' for example), which means lots of QR scanners won't let their
          users open our URL. Luckily the <em>alphanumeric</em> encoding has just enough characters
          to let us make valid URLs (although they'll have to be all caps).</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr-design.png" alt="A design for a QR code that contains the My-QR.art logo">

          <img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr-data-order.png" title="Made by Thonky, shared under the CC ANC 4.0" alt="An illustration from Thonky.com that shows how data is encoded in a QR code"></p><p>So with that figured out, lets read that design the user made. First we'll extract
          a bit string from all the data modules in the design. For small QR codes this is quite
          straight forward, the QR code is simply read from right to left, bottom to top and back
          again in double columns, see the illustration from Thonky above. However, when the QR code
          size passes 5, we'll have to take into account interleaving. Then the data words are
          scattered around the QR code, presumably to make the data pattern more random. So
          we'll have to reverse that interleaving procedure. Luckily how it works is explained
          by <a href="https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/error-correction-coding">Thonky.com</a>. At
          last we get a bit string from our design, here we only show the first 80 character, the
          real bit string for this design is 13863 bits long.</p>
          <p><code>01100011010101001100101010001100011110111010100000000001110100111110011101001001</code></p>

          <h3 id="decoding">Decoding the bitstring</h3>
          <p>Now we'll need to decode the bits to an alphanumeric string. Here we group 11 bits
          together every time and then convert that into two alphanumeric characters
          using <a href="https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/alphanumeric-table">this
          table</a>. We get the following data string (again truncated).</p>

          <p><code>KS$#LKAHRDF9H8XQI9AL HRD$OIWHSRE94QX95IFR*IK9HF/ 5NM+/AMIA99LB I5R II98ULR JRD/AR1 IRG8...</code></p>

          <p>We'll just replace the first 20 characters with our URL prefix and we get:</p>

          <p><code>HTTPS://MY-QR.ART/R/ HRD$OIWHSRE94QX95IFR*IK9HF/ 5NM+/AMIA99LB I5R II98ULR JRD/AR1 IRG8...</code></p>

          <h3 id="qr-code">Generating the QR code</h3>

          <p>Now we can use any QR library to create the QR code! The QR library will handle adding
          all the difficult error codes and other boring stuff for us.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/failed-qr.png" alt="A random looking QR code"></p><p>But what is that? Why does it still look all random? The problem is masking. The QR
          code spec includes 5 different masks and the mask that makes the QR code look most random
          is chosen, which is almost certainly not our design. This is done to make the code easier
          to read for scanners. However, in my experience, QR codes scan just fine with more
          structured data. So we don't have to feel too bad about modifying our QR library to
          always use the same mask. Then after we apply the same mask to our design before
          processing it, we finally get the desired image.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/my-qr.art-qr.png" alt="A QR code with the design in it"></p><h2 id="redirecting">Redirecting the request</h2>

          <p>Now to redirect the QR code to the right domain. This should be easy, put the QR URL in
          a database and link it to the redirect URL. When we receive a request, simply look up the
          corresponding URL in a database. However, if we want to use a modern web server, we'll
          have to jump through some hoops... Apache doesn't like most of our URLs, since they
          are technically malformed (ugh, spoil the fun much Apache?). So it throws an <em>Error
          400: Bad request</em>. We can't disable this error anywhere it seems. However, luckily
          there is a workaround, we can set a custom error page for our <em>Error 400</em>, so if we
          just set the redirect page as the error page for <em>Error 400</em>, we are home free!
          Luckily Apache is not so much of a spoilsport that it throws a Bad Request error while
          trying to handle a Bad Request...</p>

          <p>For the back-end I've been using Django, and it has another fun bug that shows up
          with these really weird URLs. It tries to decode the URL as an ISO-8859-1 string, but some
          of the characters passed by Apache aren't in ISO-8859-1. So we have to derive our own
          WSGI handler to workaround
          this, <a href="https://github.com/raatmarien/my-qr.art/blob/main/my_qr_art/custom_wsgi.py">see
          here</a>. But now it works, try to scan the QR we made, it redirects where we want it to
            redirect!</p>

          <p>One small caveat though, QR codes themselves are standardized and we create standard
          compliant QR codes with correct URLs in them, but QR scanners aren't standardized and some
          might not recognize our code as a URL and will see it as plain text instead.</p>

          <h2 id="a-web-app">Custom QR codes for everyone!</h2>

          <p>Just outputting and parsing images isn't very user friendly, so I made a nice web
          app at <a href="https://my-qr.art/">My-QR.art</a> using Django. It
          has <a href="https://my-qr.art/editor">a friendly editor</a> where you can draw, fill or
          upload black and white images to make your QR code. It also has some …</p></div></div></div></article></div>

    <p><strong><em>This is the fifth part of the “Rebuilding the spellchecker” series, dedicated to explaining how the world’s most popular spellchecker Hunspell works.</em></strong></p>

<p>Today, we talk about <strong>edit-based suggestions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Quick recap</strong>: <strong><a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-05-spellchecker-1.html">The first part</a></strong> described what Hunspell is; and why I decided to <a href="https://github.com/zverok/spylls">rewrite it in Python</a>. In <strong><a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-09-spellchecker-2.html">the second</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-14-spellchecker-3.html">the third</a></strong> parts, we’ve talked about <strong>lookup</strong>: checking the word’s correctness.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-21-spellchecker-4.html">The fourth part</a></strong> introduced <strong>suggest</strong>, an algorithm for search for corrections. We described that Hunspell performs suggest in two main stages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate edits and test them for the correctness</li>
  <li>(If the first stage didn’t produce good enough results) Search through the entire dictionary and find similar words</li>
</ol>

<p>So, speaking about the <strong>edit-based suggestions search</strong>: its full behavior is a curious example of emergent complexity. Every single step and every single condition is quite simple, but the resulting behavior is quite sophisticated—and hard to dissect.</p>

<p>Let’s dive into this beautiful mess!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before we proceed, let’s try something new: in this chapter, I’ll show some spylls code to play with and illustrate some points. So, if you want to follow, begin with:</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>…and load spylls into your REPL of choice:</p>
</blockquote>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span>from</span> <span>spylls.hunspell</span> <span>import</span> <span>Dictionary</span>

  <span>english</span> <span>=</span> <span>Dictionary</span><span>.</span><span>from_files</span><span>(</span><span>'en_US'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>To simplify experimenting, a few dictionaries used in examples are distributed with spylls. Other dictionaries to play with can be downloaded from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/language-tools/">Firefox</a> or <a href="https://extensions.libreoffice.org/?Tags%5B%5D=50">LibreOffice</a> extension sites.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once the dictionary is loaded, you can use suggest:</p>
</blockquote>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span># this will return suggestion generator
</span>  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'spylls'</span><span>))</span>
  <span># &lt;generator object Dictionary.suggest at 0x7f62e972d950&gt;
</span>
  <span># ...and this will unpack it into suggestions
</span>  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'spylls'</span><span>))</span>
  <span># spells spills
</span>
  <span># For illustrative purposes, there is also an
</span>  <span># easy-to-use internal method, that produces
</span>  <span># Suggestion objects with an indicator of the
</span>  <span># method it was found with.
</span>  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>'spylls'</span><span>))</span>
  <span># Suggestion[badchar](spells)
</span>  <span># Suggestion[badchar](spills)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-order-of-edits">The order of edits</h2>

<p>As we already mentioned, the “classic” edits for string comparison algorithms are insert, delete, replace, and swap adjacent letters. To contrast, Hunspell’s carefully crafted set of edits is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Change the word to the uppercase (see also “Word case” sub-section below);</li>
  <li>Replace common misspellings, like “f”→”ph” and vice versa, defined by <code>REP</code> table from aff-file;</li>
  <li>Split the word in two parts in every position (with space or dash), to be tested as a <em>single dictionary entry</em>, like “ad hoc” (see also #13 below);</li>
  <li>Replace related chars, like “a”, “å”, “ä”, defined by <code>MAP</code> table from aff-file;</li>
  <li>Swap every two adjacent letters,
    <ul>
      <li>oh, and for 4- and 5-letter words also try <em>two</em> swaps: “ahev” → “have”;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Swap two non-adjacent letters (up to distance 4);</li>
  <li>Replace every letter with the adjacent on the keyboard, e.g. “miraclw” → “miracle”. The keyboard layout is defined by <code>KEY</code> directive in aff-file;
    <ul>
      <li>and, on the same step, with the capitalized version of the character (“paris” → “Paris”, but not vice versa), also considered as a possible keyboard-related error;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Remove every letter in turn;</li>
  <li>Insert every letter from the language’s alphabet (defined by <code>TRY</code> directive in aff-file) into every position;</li>
  <li>Move every letter forward and backward into all possible positions;</li>
  <li>Replace every letter with every other letter from the language’s alphabet;</li>
  <li>Find a duplicated <em>pair</em> of letters and remove it: “chicicken” → “chicken”;</li>
  <li>Split the word in two in every position, to be tested as two separate words (see also #3 above).</li>
</ol>

<p>Phew!</p>

<p>As <del>complicating matters is kinda Hunspell’s shtick</del> there are many edge cases to handle, producing edits in some order is just the beginning!</p>

<h3 id="suggestion-ranking-and-limiting-is-hard-coded">Suggestion ranking and limiting is hard-coded</h3>

<p>Classical spellchecker algorithm papers typically describe the process of ranking of suggestion after they are generated: by edit’s probability, by similarity to the original word, or by word’s popularity. In Hunspell, the ranking is <em>implicit</em>: the order of steps is already considered the best possible order.</p>

<p>So, all suggestions to remove a letter that produce correct words (step 8) will be returned before all suggestions to insert a letter (step 9)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>'haz'</span><span>))</span>
<span># Suggestion[extrachar](ha)       # all "extra character removed" suggestions
# Suggestion[forgotchar](haze)    # then, all "forgotten character inserted"
# Suggestion[forgotchar](hazy)
# Suggestion[badchar](has)        # then, all "bad character replaced"
# Suggestion[badchar](hat)
# Suggestion[badchar](had)
# &lt;...skip, there are lots...&gt;
# Suggestion[twowords](ha z)      # finally, all "should be split in two words"
# Suggestion[twowords](ha-z)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The number of edit-based suggestions is hard-limited to 15. Even if there’s a possibility to produce more, Hunspell does not attempt to balance the number of suggestions from each group: it just stops searching for more after the first 15, no matter how they were produced.</p>

<p>There is also a hard cut-off by certain categories of suggestions: if (3) produces a correct word, no further edit-based and no ngram-based suggestions are tried; if any of (1-2) produce correct words, the rest of edit-based suggestions are produced too, but no ngram suggestions are produced.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a hard cut-off by time: 0.25 seconds for a whole suggestion algorithm, 0.1 seconds for each approach to edit-based algorithm (in each possible word case): once the time limit is reached, the suggestion generation stops. (Spylls doesn’t try to reimplement this, as Python is obviously slower than C.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contrast this rigid ordering/limiting to aspell’s approach: it provides several <a href="http://aspell.net/0.61/man-html/Notes-on-the-Different-Suggestion-Modes.html">suggestion modes</a>, allowing to trade time for breadth or vice versa; and also has a lot of <a href="http://aspell.net/0.50-doc/man-html/4_Customizing.html">fine-tuning options</a> to adjust this behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="non-lowercase-words-increase-the-number-of-searches">Non-lowercase words increase the number of searches</h3>

<p>What if the misspelling is not in the same case as the desired correction is in the dictionary? The answer (as one who already has some gist of this series might imagine) is complicated.</p>

<p>Lowercase word that should be capitalized will be fixed relatively easy, on step (7):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>"london"</span><span>))</span>
<span># [Suggestion[badcharkey](London)]
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The word that should’ve been uppercased will be fixed even easier, on step (1):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>"nasa"</span><span>))</span>
<span># Suggestion[uppercase](NASA)
# Suggestion[forgotchar](nasal)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>But when the misspelling is not in the lowercase (and the target spelling is), the wonders begin. The word is transformed to all cases it <em>could</em> have been if it was spelled correctly; then, for each of the variants, steps 1-13 run, then the final suggestions are capitalized back into the original form of the misspelling<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. For example, let’s misspell a kitten.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>"Kittn"</span><span>))</span>
<span># Suggestion[badchar](Kitty)     |
# Suggestion[twowords](Kit tn)   | Three edit suggestions from "Kittn"
# Suggestion[twowords](Kit-tn)   |
#
# Suggestion[forgotchar](Kitten) | Edit suggestion from "kittn",
#                                | capitalized after it was found
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that, again, suggestions are <em>not</em> reordered: the user receives them in the order they were found.</p>

<h3 id="aff-file-contents-affects-quality-dramatically">Aff-file contents affects quality dramatically</h3>

<p>One might notice that descriptions of some steps refer to the <strong>data defined in aff-file</strong>. It means that some of what is perceived as a suggest <em>algorithm</em> is actually represented by <em>data</em> and is delegated to the dictionary’s maintainer.</p>

<p>Some of the directives are hard to populate—for example, <code>REP</code>, the list of commonly misspelled letter groups (“f/ph”, or “tion/shun”). Many dictionaries omit it or make a very small list, missing the opportunity to cover the most important mistakes. Other directives (like <code>KEY</code> or <code>TRY</code>) are quite trivial and yet are not included in some dictionaries, leading to a sharp drop in suggestion quality.</p>

<p>We’ll discuss dictionaries and their quality in one of the future chapters. For now, just one telling example.</p>

<p>To perform steps like “insert a missing letter” or “replace a letter with another,” Hunspell needs to know <em>the language’s alphabet</em>. Being truly multi-lingual, it can’t assume regular Latinic <code>a-z</code> as a default. So, there is a <strong><code>TRY</code> directive</strong>, which should specify this alphabet. If it is absent,  several of the important steps would be missing<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>russian</span> <span>=</span> <span>Dictionary</span><span>.</span><span>from_files</span><span>(</span><span>'ru_RU'</span><span>)</span>
<span># "кошка" is "female cat", "коша" is informal name/misspelling for it:</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"кошка"</span> <span>in</span> <span>russian</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'коша'</span><span>))</span> <span># "к" is missing</span>
<span># False</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"кошка"</span> <span>in</span> <span>russian</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'тошка'</span><span>))</span> <span># "к" is replaced with "т"</span>
<span># False</span>

<span># Let's fix it!</span>
<span>russian</span><span>.</span><span>aff</span><span>.</span><span>TRY</span> <span>=</span> <span>'абвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя'</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"кошка"</span> <span>in</span> <span>russian</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'коша'</span><span>))</span>
<span># True</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"кошка"</span> <span>in</span> <span>russian</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'тошка'</span><span>))</span>
<span># True</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> In fact, using the alphabetic order of letters to fix the issue is too naive. Hunspell’s documentation advises sorting letters in <code>TRY</code> in the order of frequency (they’ll be actually <em>tried</em> in the order they are specified). Also, we forgot to include <code>-</code> (dash) into the alphabet—which will lead to omitting of all “(good word)-(another good word)” suggestions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="multiword-suggestions-are-cumbersome">Multiword suggestions are cumbersome</h3>

<p>One of the most common spelling mistakes is <strong>accidentally joining two words</strong>: so, every good spellchecker should try to cover this case. Unfortunately, it is frequently overlooked in spellchecking libraries and algorithm explanations (everybody focuses on the distance between one misspelling and one suggestion)<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Usually, we want split suggestions at the end of the suggestion list (thus, the last step). Otherwise, short words will overwhelm the user with possibilities:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>*</span><span>en</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>'Itall'</span><span>)]</span>
<span># Suggestion[extrachar](Tall)
# Suggestion[extrachar](Ital)
# Suggestion[badchar](Stall)
# Suggestion[badchar](Italy)
# Suggestion[twowords](I tall)
# Suggestion[twowords](It all)
# ...
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sometimes, though, we might want to ensure that some …</p></article></div>

        <h2>James O'Grady plays, reviews and mods (!) a game I wrote in Z80 machine code in 1984</h2>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p><img src="https://jamesmead.org/images/graphic-adventures-for-the-spectrum-48k.jpg" alt="Book cover for 'Graphic Adventures for the Spectrum 48K'"></p>

<p>I recently stumbled across <a href="#the-youtube-video">a quirky Youtube video</a> which piqued my interest. In the video <a href="https://twitter.com/JAMOGRAD">James O'Grady</a> demonstrated a 3D maze game. He'd typed in the code for the game from a familiar-sounding book called <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0744700132">Graphic Adventures for the Spectrum 48K</a>.</p>

<p>The nominal author of this book, Richard Hurley, was one of my teachers and he included programs written by me and a number of my friends. The 3D maze game was one I wrote in about 1984 when I was 16. In the video James goes on to critique the game, to explore some ways to improve it, and to read some reviews of the book from magazines of the time.</p>

<p>In my early teens I played a lot of games on the ZX81 and then the Spectrum, but as I got older I became bored of playing the games and more interested in writing them. I learnt a lot about programming games from typing in code from magazines and books.</p>

<p>The first games I developed were written entirely in <a href="https://worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/">Sinclair BASIC</a>, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/floehopper/sub-hunt">Sub Hunt</a> which was published in <a href="https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&amp;id=2000461">an earlier book</a>, but I quickly realised I would need to use machine code to get the performance I wanted. Initially I wrote small bits of machine code to speed up critical bits of the games. However, the 3D Maze game in the video was the first game I wrote pretty much entirely in Z80 machine code using the excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus_Assembler">Zeus assembler</a> and with my trusty copy of <a href="https://archive.org/details/CompleteSpectrumROMDisassemblyThe">The Complete Spectrum ROM Disassembly</a>. It was closely based on the "3D Monster Maze" game by J.K. Greye Software.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Most importantly, from the point of view of video game history, the ZX81 was the computer which hosted the world's first ever 3D game on a home computer - JK Greye's 3D Monster Maze. A simple labyrinth is generated, and the player has to find their way out, all the while being stalked by a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The whole experience was rendered in what is now referred to as 'first person' view - ie, you see what you would see out of the eyes of the character in the maze, as pictured in the ZX81's rather blocky but still effective graphics. A quick play of this game on an emulator is recommended to all fans of Doom, Quake, Unreal, Half Life and all the other FPSs which are now so popular, as it really is the literal grandaddy of them all. It is difficult now to describe the impact this game had on a public who had quite literally never seen anything like it.

<h3 id="my-version">My version</h3>

<p>One slight disappointment was that unlike in "3D Monster Maze" there was no "monster" in my version of the game or at least not in the version James was playing. I know that I did eventually add a Tyrannosaurus Rex to the game, but I vaguely remember having to rush for a publication deadline, so the monster might've have missed the cut! If I recall correctly, a friend with better artistic skills than me drew a T Rex in a series of "frames" walking towards the observer. I then traced the drawings onto graph paper and converted them into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum_character_set">user-defined graphic characters</a>. I do half wonder whether these might be the mystery bytes which James refers to at one point in his video. Otherwise I believe the program uses calls to the ROM, e.g. <a href="https://speccy.xyz/rom/asm/24b7">this line-drawing subroutine</a>, to draw the walls of the maze.</p>

</p>

<h3 id="the-youtube-video">The Youtube video</h3>

<p>James must've been incredibly patient to type in all the raw numbers for the machine code with only very rudimentary checksums. And, given that the game is written entirely in machine code and the assembler source code is lost in the mists of time, I was impressed that James managed to successfully modify the game in a couple of different ways using a load of judicious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEEK_and_POKE"><code>PEEK</code>s and <code>POKE</code>s</a> and apparently without the use of a disassembler. In particular he's written a nice maze editor program which runs on the Spectrum and allows you to design your own maze. I was quite amused to learn that the maze had to be square - I can't imagine it would've been much harder for me to have allowed rectangular ones!</p>

<p>James is very fair in his criticisms of the game - his main observation is that it's not very interesting to play, but it is very fast compared to other similar games. I also enjoyed reading the reviews of the book he'd found in a couple of magazines of the time. I had a lovely exchange with him in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q656CqMIXLY&amp;lc=UgzsXaL19aLWF7T3qCp4AaABAg">the Youtube comments</a> and he <a href="https://twitter.com/JAMOGRAD/status/1351920870621589506">changed the title</a> of the Youtube video to include my name which was a nice gesture. Anyway, this was a brilliant trip down memory lane for me and reminded me of my programming roots!</p>

<h3 id="playing-the-game">Playing the game</h3>

<p>If you feel as if you want the full "type it in" experience, the Portuguese (!) version of the book is available for <a href="https://archive.org/download/World_of_Spectrum_June_2017_Mirror/World%20of%20Spectrum%20June%202017%20Mirror.zip/World%20of%20Spectrum%20June%202017%20Mirror/sinclair/books/g/GraphicAdventuresForTheSpectrum48K(AventurasGraficasParaOSpectrum48K)(TemposLivres).pdf">download</a> from <a href="https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&amp;id=2000168">Spectrum Computing</a> and you can find the game in "Labirinto" (chapter 4, page 105). Otherwise, <a href="https://github.com/floehopper/3d-maze">this GitHub repo</a> includes a set of <a href="https://worldofspectrum.org/faq/reference/formats.htm#TAP">TAP format</a> files which might work in a Spectrum emulator, although I haven't yet had a chance to try them myself.</p>

Each piece of content was 10 minutes or less and optimized for both vertical and horizontal full-screen dimensions.</p><p>Because its co-founders were already so successful in both Hollywood and business, Quibi raised almost $2billion prior to launch. They commissioned top talent to create exclusive content. The app itself was well-designed and easy to use. Switching from vertical to horizontal full-screen worked seamlessly, and felt like a genuinely unique feature.</p><p>But on October 22nd, 2020, Quibi shut down with hardly any users—just six months after launching. An article by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528404/quibi-shut-down-cost-subscribers-content-tv-movies-katzenberg-whitman-tiktok-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> lists some reasons behind this, from the global pandemic to simply bad content. Above all, the author picks out one factor as decisive: “a lack of insight into consumer behavior, wants, and needs.”</p><p>“Quibi didn’t work because no one at Quibi knew what it should be, what people wanted, or how people use their phones. Its entire thesis is wrong.”</p><p>In other words, Quibi didn’t fail because of flaws in the final product or bad user experience—it failed as an <em>idea</em> for a product. The way to avoid this? Product discovery.</p></div><p id="what"><h2>What is product discovery?</h2></p><div><p>Product discovery is the process of closely understanding what your users’ problems and needs are, then validating your ideas for solutions before starting development. By forming a close relationship with your users and letting them guide your design thinking, your overall product strategy is much more likely to end up solving real-user problems.</p><p>The idea of product discovery was originally developed in the 90s, when many of today’s product management best practices were formed. Back then, companies building websites and digital products spent a lot of time and money trying to convince customers that they needed their great products—but not so much time actually listening to them.</p><p>This led to a lot of very expensive failures, as products often made it to full release before their creators realized that people just didn’t need them. Over time, the development of customer-centric ideas—like the <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jobs to be done</a> framework, and early iterative testing based on user feedback—encouraged product teams to put themselves in their users’ shoes more, and to ask what they thought more often.</p><p>These days, we refer to this broad template of activities and approaches as ‘product discovery.’</p></div><p id="framework"><h2>A step-by-step product discovery framework</h2></p><div><p>There’s no singular, defined set of methods that you have to follow with product discovery—you could include customer feedback surveys, interviews, focus groups, journey mapping, insights from product analytics, and various types of <a href="https://maze.design/guides/usability-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usability testing</a> in your approach.</p><p>But whatever modern <a href="https://maze.co/guides/product-discovery/techniques/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product discovery techniques</a> you end up using—more on that in chapter 4—the goals are always the same:</p><ul><li>Form a deep, upfront understanding of what your users need</li><li>Define and validate a solution based on your users’ input</li></ul><p>For this reason, it’s vital to approach product discovery with a mindset that’s open to all possibilities. You might start the process with a really cool idea for a product in the back of your mind, only to find out that your users don’t need a new product after all. Maybe a few specific improvements to your current product are enough. This kind of realization is all part of the ‘discovery’—it’s what makes product discovery both useful and interesting.</p><p>And while the exact methodology is up to you, to achieve your product discovery goals you should combine this open mindset with this basic, step-by-step product discovery framework:</p><h3>1. Learn &amp; understand</h3><p>Before you start thinking about what's next on your product roadmap or even decide which problem you want to solve, spend a decent amount of time communicating with users. Run customer interviews, organize user stories into themes, create journey maps, and form a close relationship with a group of users.</p><p>The information you learn here will help you hone in on pain points to build solutions for. You could spend weeks or months in this stage—however long it takes to start spotting clear themes in your users’ feedback.</p><h3>2. Define &amp; decide</h3><p>Once you’ve got a healthy amount of data and feedback, your team should take a step back and prioritize the most important problems for your users.</p><p>With problems prioritized, you should be able to form a clear, broad hypothesis that can form the foundation of the solutions you develop. This should be a short, simple sentence—often a question—that covers the main problem and related sub-problems you want to solve for your users. Here’s an example:</p><p><em>“Building a commenting feature will increase the amount of time users spend in our product.”</em></p><p>This sounds straightforward, but it will probably take you a few attempts. Take your time—it’s super important to get this part right, as your hypothesis will determine what you build.</p><h3>3. Ideate &amp; prioritize</h3><p>Next, it’s time to get creative and start thinking about what a new product idea might look like. Encourage your team to brainstorm without limits at first, then gradually narrow down to the best ideas. You could even do an ideation hackathon to get the whole team focused on the problem.</p><p>Once you have a few solid options, plan out how each solution could work in practice by assigning scores for predicted value and feasibility to build. There are many ways of prioritizing your options—<a href="https://www.productboard.com/glossary/product-prioritization-frameworks/">some very detailed</a>. The simplest way is the ICE framework: score each solution out of 10 for the Impact (I) it’ll have, your Confidence (C) that it’ll solve the problem, and the Ease (E) of building it, then compare the average scores to get a prioritized list.</p><h3>4. Prototype &amp; test</h3><p>The final stage of product discovery is where you can start prototyping new products or features. But don’t get too carried away—the idea is just to create some quick prototypes for user testing. You could make a working MVP (Minimum Viable Product), a mockup using a design tool, or even a paper prototype.</p><p>With your prototype done, now’s the time to reach out to users again. Run some <a href="https://maze.design/blog/prototype-testing/">prototype tests</a> and collect user feedback to find out if you're building the right product. If your users’ responses validate your hypothesis and early iteration, you’re ready to start development. If not, keep tweaking your prototypes until you’re confident that the solution you’re proposing is really what your users are looking for.</p></div><p id="benefits"><h2>The benefits of product discovery</h2></p><div><p>Like many best practices of modern product development, a lot of the product discovery process seems like common sense. But as the fall of Quibi shows, the benefits of investing time into product discovery are still often overlooked to this day. So let’s take a look at some of the main ones:</p><h4>You’ll save time &amp; money</h4><p>Product teams spending weeks or months doing a lot of thinking and not very much building might seem counterintuitive to the fast startup culture they exist in. The demands of key stakeholders to drive metrics and business goals by shipping new products is a constant pressure for most product teams.&nbsp;</p><p>But cutting corners with <a href="https://maze.design/guides/ux-research">user research</a> to press on with development is a massive—and very expensive—risk. You’re essentially gambling on assumptions about what your users want, which could turn out to be false no matter how experienced you are. Product discovery gives you validation on whether your product needs to exist before spending a lot of money building, polishing, and marketing it. It makes you more agile, not less.</p><p>Sebastien Phlix, Product Manager at N26, sums it up:</p></div><div><div><p color="blue500" font-size="4" font-weight="600" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif">“Think about how much one two-week sprint costs. 10k? 20K? Product discovery is important because engineering and design time is the most precious asset a company has.”</p><div><div><p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/maze-marketing/69724ec4-2cf8-4519-b505-e0b39715ffc9_Seb.jpg?auto=compress,format&amp;rect=52,0,481,481&amp;w=400&amp;h=400"></p></div></div></div></div><div><h4>Your products will be more innovative</h4><p>By incorporating customer viewpoints from the beginning, product discovery inspires your team to challenge their own assumptions and think outside of the box when making product decisions. This doesn’t just lead to more innovative solutions—it also validates which of your ideas are market opportunities.</p><p>Freddie Beesely, VP of Product at Attest, sees innovation as the true value of product discovery:</p></div><div><div><p color="blue500" font-size="4" font-weight="600" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif">“Product discovery helps you expand within your market, move into new ones, stay ahead of competition, and adapt to changing trends. Without discovery, products tend to stagnate by getting stuck focusing on the short-term.”</p><div><div><p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/maze-marketing/0d66aefd-6515-4623-ad64-2042b227b9f4_freddie.jpg?auto=compress,format&amp;rect=0,0,200,200&amp;w=400&amp;h=400"></p><p color="#000000" font-size="1" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif" font-weight="500"><span font-size="16" font-weight="400" color="#000000" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif">Freddie Beesely<!-- -->,</span><span font-size="16" font-weight="400" color="#000000" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif"> <!-- -->VP of Product at Attest</span></p></div></div></div></div><div><h4>Your product designers and development team will thank you</h4><p>Product discovery gives you a good idea of whether your new product or feature will be used. And for product designers and developers, seeing their creations help thousands or even millions of people is one of the best parts of the job. Without product discovery, your team members won’t get the feedback they crave.&nbsp;</p><p>Fadeelah Al-horaibi, Senior Product Manager at Slite, knows the feeling:</p></div><div><div><p color="blue500" font-size="4" font-weight="600" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif">“I've unfortunately been in an environment where product discovery was skipped. No-one was talking about the customer or business opportunities—just product delivery. The scariest part is that once the delivery took place, we were straight on to the next.” </p><div><div><p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/maze-marketing/e6442d46-7134-485f-a972-73dce9fd6a8c_fadeelah.jpg?auto=compress,format&amp;rect=0,333,1333,1333&amp;w=400&amp;h=400"></p><p color="#000000" font-size="1" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif" font-weight="500"><span font-size="16" font-weight="400" color="#000000" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif">Fadeelah Al-horaibi<!-- -->,</span><span font-size="16" font-weight="400" color="#000000" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif"> <!-- -->Senior Product Manager at Slite</span></p></div></div></div></div><div><p>Pivoting late in the development process—or worse, releasing a feature that no one uses—just doesn’t feel good. In many ways, the product development process is all about failing and learning. But without staying close to your customers, it’s hard to even know whether your team succeeded or not.</p><h2>Final notes</h2><p>Before Quibi, co-founder Jeff Katzenberg was CEO of Dreamworks Animation.

<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2021-01-24</span>.</p>
<p>For many years I have been advocating passionately against the so-called "modern web" as it is really nothing more than a poor excuse for not using your brain and instead following the hype and trends of stuffing web applications with unneeded JavaScript and slow and crappy frameworks. But now the time has come when soon the "modern web" will finally die.</p>

<p>Most people don't like to feel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8BkzvP19v4">outside</a>, which is why the majority is always just following hype and trends. This is also why it is so easy for politicians and news media to fill people with lies.</p>

<p>If something is presented as "the right thing to do", most people want to do it. But what happens when the so-called right thing really doesn't make any sense, or the so-called right thing has obvious flaws? Truly independent thinking and responsible people gather information objectively and try to reach a conclusion without any consideration to social conformity, but most people are not truly independent thinking even though they like to believe they are.</p>

<p>Do you know how you can tell if you are really lying to yourself about why you do what you do? One crystal clear sign is if you are blindly following what the majority is doing without truly understanding the consequences of your actions. Another very clear sign is if you passionately and emotionally criticize the opposite opinion without any true personal experience or knowledge and then call what you do as being "modern", as if what you do is the right thing whereas what others are doing is hopelessly outdated.</p>

<p>The fact about the so-called modern web is that there has really never been any modern web. The hardware has become much faster, but that has nothing to do with the modern web. No, the truth is that the so-called modern web was invented as a term by people who like to feel important and smart. They did so by developing software and frameworks and then telling everyone else to stop "re-inventing the wheel" and instead use their clever solutions. And rather than evaluating the claims of these people objectively, the masses where swayed by all their impressive rhetoric's and their popularity.</p>

<p>The result has been absolutely mind bugling and ridicules because even though the real advance in technology has made the hardware many many times faster, both in processing power and data transfer speeds, the Internet has become absolutely stupidly slow. The main reason for that is all the webpages that gets stuffed with useless JavaScript and frameworks.</p>

<p>I have said it <a href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/stop-pushing-javascript.html">before</a>, and I'll say it again: <strong>If you're pushing JavaScript as a dependency for your website to function, you'd better be serving some pretty amazing and special content, otherwise your website is just plain broken!</strong></p>

<p>Today data centers around the world are using more electricity than ever. It takes more than 50 power plants, each capable of generating 500 megawatts of electricity, to power all the data centers in operation in the U.S. alone. And this number will increase dramatically over the years if the current development model doesn't improve drastically.</p>

<p>My prediction is that in only a couple of years from now, it will be socially and environmentally unacceptable for any kind of company to have a high carbon footprint! And this doesn't mean that a company can simple go all green and start using windmills e.g. The reason for that is that even the production of windmills leaves a pretty high carbon footprint. No, what companies need to do is to reduce power consumption as much as possible. And when it comes to the software industry, then there is only one sure way forward, and that is to improve application performance as much as possible. This is especially important with gaming, web applications and other Internet related services such as gaming server applications. Video providers such as YouTube will eventually have to disallow content that doesn't generate any revenue for them because storage servers requires huge amounts of power.</p>

<p>I believe that in the near future companies will actually begin to compete with each other about who has the most performant applications, web or otherwise.</p>

<p>Just like responsible and grown up people don't throw trash on the street, responsible and grown up people also take care when they develop software. This is actually nothing new at all, it has just been ignored by the staggering careless approach of just "throwing more hardware at the problem because hardware is cheap". The fact is that hardware has never been cheap! Hardware production has always had a huge negative impact on the environment, not only in the form of carbon footprint during production, but also pollution and the thoughtless behavior of simply <a href="https://envibrary.com/electronic-pollution/">throwing away fully working machines</a>.</p>

<p>In 2018 electronic waste in America represented about 2% of the trash in landfills, but it equaled 70% of overall toxic waste.</p>

<p>In the near future public attention will drive government policy and carbon footprints will become a subject of worldwide scrutiny. Individuals, companies and countries will have to seek the fastest and most affordable ways to achieve a net-zero carbon footprint.</p>

<p>This will also mean that careless use of technology in web development, such as JavaScript and frameworks, needs to be a thing of the past and our current way of developing web applications will in the future look like the "dark ages".</p>

<p>For years I have worked as an independent contractor with a main focus on improving performance and security in web applications. My work has not been about throwing more hardware at the problems, but rather to remove hardware! This has been achieved in one very simple way each and every time: Remove all unnecessary JavaScript and re-build the application using a fast programming language without a framework and without stupid and slow design patterns. Absolutely no hype or trends allowed here!</p>

<p>I have argued for years against the irresponsible behavior of software developers who could care less about the future of a company by careless design choices, but for some strange reason many people believe that if you don't use a framework, then you have to reinvent the wheel each time you build something. But nobody does that! What you do instead is that you study and understand the technology you're using and then you put together small pieces of performant and reusable code and use that.</p>

<p>Other people argue against building web applications from the ground up because if you work in a team, then you need to read other peoples code, and without a framework, then nobody knows how to structure the code or understand what other people are doing. Well, guess what, that's what software development is about! Reading and understanding other peoples code, writing really good and quality documentation, commenting your code and following a clear and concise code style guide. If you cannot do that, then you shouldn't be a software developer. This is what we used to call "good programming".</p>

<p>It's time to take responsibility. Be a part of the solution, not the problem!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the first part of a three part (II, III) discussion of an idea I am going to term (<a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2021/01/warrior-episode-forty-one/">borrowing from one of its proponents</a>) the ‘universal warrior’ – the idea that there is a transcendent sameness about either the warrior experience or warrior values which provides some sort of useful blueprint for today or a fundamental truth about viewing the past (it is generally presented as both).</p>



<p>Of course the ‘universal warrior’ is not meant literally; no one, <a href="https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2016/05/through-a-glass-darkly-george-s-patton.html">save George S. Patton</a>, is claiming that a single warrior was reincarnated through a host of battles, always the same in each case.  <strong>Rather, the claim that there is a ‘universal warrior’ is really a claim that there is a universal <em>war experience</em></strong>, which all combatants in all wars take part of and which remains largely unchanged or that there is fundamentally a <strong>universal set of warrior values, behaviors or attributes</strong> which define combatant through the ages and through different kinds of armies, different kinds of service</p>



<p>And that notion is a popular one, appearing equally at home in <a href="https://youtu.be/A50lVLtSQik">anti-war songs</a> and <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2016/12/14/stop-calling-us-warriors/">military recruitment propaganda </a>(along with<a href="https://youtu.be/62tnJtLBQzQ"> lava monsters</a>).  Most recently, my attention was drawn to it by a series of what are effectively <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">self-help videos</a> framed around the idea by best-selling author Steven Pressfield and I am going to use those videos as the clear form of the argument I want to engage.  In part, this is because Pressfield makes the argument in almost all of its fullness, making many of the implications (‘warrior societies,’ the life advice, the transcendent connection between ‘warriors’ past and present, the implication that ‘warrior’ life is more morally pure and so on) explicit and clear.  And also because Pressfield’s books – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7rdgm4/how_accurate_is_the_depiction_of_spartan_hoplite/">his <em>fiction</em> I should note, for his historical fiction works have at best a tenuous relationship with the historical record</a> – are, among other things, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire">on officer training reading lists</a></em> making it a rather important thing if he is peddling an utterly bunk notion of the past.</p>



<p>And it is not hard to see why the idea of a universal warrior value set or a universal warrior experience is an attractive notion; it offers a transcendent connection, linking the experience of combat – whether that is understood positively, as Pressfield does, or negatively as the famous song does – across generations, centuries and cultures.  And it offers the promise of turning that feeling of transcendent connection into a sense of heroism in everyday life, a blueprint for self-improvement, or a timeless model for political consciousness.</p>



<p>And it <em>feels</em> true.  After all, we call people who fought in wars even at the beginnings of written history ‘soldiers’ and ‘warriors and we call our own war-fighters ‘soldiers’ and (unfortunately) ‘warriors.’  That suggestion of equivalence is built right into our linguistic systems.  Students often marvel at the ludicrous tendency for historical artists to represent conflicts in their own deep past (like medieval manuscript illustrators depicting conflicts from classical antiquity) using present (to them) day arms, armor and tactics.  But those same students will often almost immediately fall into the mistake of assuming that combatants of the past shared the same <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/">attitudes </a>and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/10/collections-antarah-ibn-shaddad-victory-songs/">motivations </a>about war as they do.</p>



<p><strong>Of course a lot of things <em>feel</em> true which aren’t</strong>.  Standing on the ground, the Earth <em>feels</em> flat, it <em>seems</em> the Sun moves across the sky; of course in reality, the Earth is a ball and in a real sense the sky moves across the Sun.  Many things are <em>intuitive</em>, they <em>feel</em> true, without <em>being</em> true.  <strong>So is there a universal combat experience?</strong></p>



<p>To probe that question, we are going to examine it in two ways. <strong> This week, we’re going to look at the <em>kinds</em> of people in war, what the distinctions are between them and if their experience really can be universally applied</strong>.  Then next week, we’re going to look at this question culturally and chronologically, asking if the experience of the same kinds of people in war was really the same in <em>different wars</em>, drawing heavily on the social-military-history lens which concerns itself with the experience of battle (often called the <em>Face of Battle</em>-school after J. Keegan’s <em>The Face of Battle </em>(1976)).  Then the week after that we’ll take a look at the implications (particularly for how manliness and masculinity are understood) that this historical theory and its failures have on the broader cultural constructs built around it.</p>



<p>Because – spoiler alert –<strong> there is no universal warrior </strong>(in case some of you were concerned that I was going to spend two weeks carefully explaining different categories only to conclude that they were meaningless!) and <strong>there is no universal combat experience</strong>.</p>

<p>Alright?  Let’s soldier on!</p>



<h2>Soldiers and Warriors</h2>



<p>We want to start with asking what the distinction is between <em>soldiers</em> and <em>warriors</em>. <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2016/12/14/stop-calling-us-warriors/"> It is a tricky question </a>and even the <a href="https://youtu.be/7TprgnuYfyQ">U.S. Army sometimes gets it badly wrong</a> (Pressfield, I should note, draws a distinction which isn’t <em>entirely</em> wrong but is so wrapped up with <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/09/warrior-episode-seven/">his dodgy effort to use discredited psychology</a> that I think it is best to start from scratch).  We have a sense that while both of these words mean ‘combatant,’ that they are not quite equivalent.</p>



<p>I suspect many of my readers (specifically the native English speakers) will immediately agree, for instance, that this fellow is a warrior, but not a soldier:</p>

<p><strong>But <em>why</em>?</strong>  The etymologies of the words can actually help push us a bit in the right direction.  Warrior has a fairly obvious etymology, being related to war (itself a derivative of French <em>guerre</em>); as <em>guerre </em>becomes war, so Old French <em>guerreieor</em> became Middle English <em>werreior</em> and because that is obnoxious to say, modern English ‘warrior’ (which is why it is warrior and not ‘warrer’ as we might expect if it was regularly constructed).  By contrast, soldier comes – it has a tortured journey which I am simplifying – from the <em>sold/sould</em> French root meaning ‘pay’ which in turn comes from Latin <em>solidus</em>, a standard Late Roman coin.  So there is clearly something about pay, or the lack of pay involved in this distinction, but clearly it isn’t <em>just</em> pay or the word mercenary would suit just as well.</p>



<p>So here is the difference: <strong>a warrior is an individual who wars, because it is their foundational vocation</strong>, an irremovable part of their identity and social position, pursued for those private ends (status, wealth, place in society).  <strong>So the core of what it is to be a warrior is that it is an element of personal identity and also fundamentally individualistic</strong> (in <em>motivation</em>, to be clear, not in fighting style – many warriors fought with collective tactics, although I think it fair to say that operation in units is much more central to soldiering than the role of a warrior, who may well fight alone).  A warrior remains a warrior when the war ends.  A warrior remains a warrior if fighting alone or for themselves.</p>



<p>By contrast, a soldier is an individual who <em>soldiers</em> (notably a different verb, which includes a sense of drudgery in war-related jobs that aren’t warring <em>per se</em>) as a <em>job</em> which they may one day leave behind, under the authority of and pursued for a larger community which directs their actions, typically through a system of regular discipline.  <strong>So the core of what it is to be a soldier is that it is a not-necessarily-permanent employment and fundamentally build about being both in and in service to a group.  </strong>A soldier, when the war or their term of service ends, becomes a civilian (something a warrior generally does not do!).  A soldier without a community stops being a soldier and starts being a mercenary.</p>



<p>Incidentally, this distinction is not unique to English.  Speaking of the two languages I have the most experience in, both Greek and Latin have this distinction.  Greek has <em>machetes </em>(<em>μαχητής</em>, lit: ‘battler,’ a <em>mache</em> being a battle) and <em>polemistes</em> (πολεμιστής, lit: ‘warrior,’ a <em>polemos</em> being a war); both are more common in poetry than prose, often used to describe mythical heroes.  Interestingly the word for an individual that fights <em>out of battle order</em> (when there is a battle order) is a <em>promachos</em> (πρόμαχος, lit: ‘fore-fighter’), a frequent word in Homer.  But the standard Greek soldier wasn’t generally called any of these things, he was either a <em>hoplite</em> (ὁπλίτης, ‘full-equipped man,’ named after his equipment) or more generally a <em>stratiotes</em> (στρατιώτης, lit, ‘army-man’ but properly ‘soldier’).  That general word, <em>stratiotes</em> is striking, but its root is <em>stratos</em> (στρατός, ‘army’); a <em>stratiotes</em>, a soldier, for the ancient Greeks was defined by his membership in that larger unit, the army.  One could be a <em>machetes</em> or a <em>polemistes</em> alone, but only a <em>stratiotes</em> in an army (<em>stratos</em>), commanded, presumably, by a general (<em>strategos</em>) in service to a community.</p>



<p>Latin has the same division, with similar shades of meaning.  Latin has <em>bellator</em> (‘warrior’) from <em>bellum</em> (‘war’), but Roman soldiers are not generally <em>bellatores</em> (except in a poetic sense and even then only rarely), even when they are actively waging war.  Instead, the soldiers of Rome are <em>milites</em> (sing. <em>miles</em>).  The word is related to the Latin <em>mille</em> (‘thousand’) from the root ‘mil-‘ which indicates a collection or combination of things.  <em>Milites</em> are thus – like <em>stratiotes</em>, <strong>men put together</strong>, defined by their collective action for the community (strikingly, groups acting for individual aims in Latin are not <em>milites</em> but <em>latrones</em>, bandits – a word Roman authors also …</p></div></div>

<p><span>2020, the most fascinating and boring year of my life, is over, and despite one of the most violent market crashes in history and the sharpest recession of all time, US equity investors clocked in another good year on the calendar. The S&amp;P 500 index finished the year up 18.4%; this despite being down by as much as 30% in March, making 2020 one of the wildest swinging markets in history.</span></p>

<p><span>But if you didn’t earn double digit returns last year you were in good company. The bull market was extremely concentrated in a narrow subset of stocks and most others floundered over the year. By my count, of the top 5,000 stocks trading on US exchanges (this includes over a thousand foreign stocks with US listings), only a little over half finished 2020 in positive territory and the median return was only 4.3%. If you didn’t have the good fortune to buy the few winners you were left behind, as happened with some of the industry’s best. Many of the world’s largest and previously most successful hedge funds and institutional money managers had a terrible 2020, including the top two: Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates and Jim Simon’s Renaissance Technologies, each famous for their billionaire visionary founders, uniquely<span> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/the-unsolved-mystery-of-the-medallion-fund-s-success">secretive</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbsVbFAczg">creepy</a></span> company culture, and astounding market-beating performance over decades, each suffered <em>negative double-digit</em> returns in their main funds in 2020. Similarly, some of the industry’s most highly regarded names such as <span><a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1p9nxxx1d47xk/AQR-to-Liquidate-Some-Funds-After-Persistent-Outflows">AQR</a></span>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/renaissance-two-sigma-see-losses-as-quant-giants-navigate-chaos"><span>Two Sigma</span></a>, and <span><a href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1012650/dfa-is-paying-the-price-for-its-conviction">Dimensional Fund Advisors</a></span> all suffered massive investor redemptions in the face of substantial underperformance in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>All these fund managers pursue a variety of different strategies in a variety of different markets, but they all have one thing in common: they’re quants. They take a data-driven approach to investing, using mathematical models based typically on decades of market returns to execute their strategy, often employing teams of Ph.D mathematicians, computer scientists, and economists to crunch the numbers. They generally pay little attention to the “human interest” elements of investing like the executive bio or squishy concepts like “product market fit” or five year strategic plans. There are a lot of different ways to be a quant, but if you are one, or invested with one in 2020, you probably had a bad year. 2020 was the year of the swashbuckling stock-picker. As Bloomberg declared in a year-end article, <span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-30/human-run-hedge-funds-trounce-quants-in-year-defined-by-pandemic">Human-Run Hedge Funds Trounce Quants in Covid Year</a></span>. 2020 was the revenge&nbsp;<em>against</em> the nerds.</span></p>
<p><span>So what happened? Leo Tolstoy famously wrote, “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” So it was with investing in 2020, there were many different investing strategies that went unhappily in 2020, and all the strategies that went happily looked pretty much the same. Let’s look at the unhappy families first and then return to the one thing that went well in 2020.</span></p>
<h3>Diversification</h3>
<p>2020 saw a repeat of something we’ve witnessed a few times in the last decade, not only did US stocks have an especially good year, they did substantially better than pretty much every other market. Investors who diversified across multiple asset classes therefore had much weaker returns.</p>
<p><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-1024x619.png" alt="" width="1024" height="619" srcset="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-200x121.png 200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-300x181.png 300w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-400x242.png 400w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-600x363.png 600w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-768x464.png 768w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-800x484.png 800w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-1024x619.png 1024w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-1200x726.png 1200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020.png 1470w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p><span>Just about the only major asset that beat the S&amp;P 500 last year was gold. The shiny metal held its weight during the crisis in March and powered through the rest of the year. Emerging market stocks also put in a solid year, virtually tied with the US market, despite suffering an even harder crash in March. Most other major assets, however, had much more modest returns, including the stock markets of most other rich, industrialized nations. Investors diversified across these major markets still likely had reasonably positive returns, but were a far cry from the meteoric rise of the S&amp;P 500.</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, how investors allocated both across and within these asset classes was of tantamount importance to their outcomes in 2020, and generally these outcomes frustrated quants at every turn. Whether picking stocks within a market or allocating across asset classes, quants often rely on measures of valuation, volatility, or momentum to guide their process, based on the historical success of these metrics in predicting returns, and in nearly every case following the numbers led investors astray in 2020, starting with perhaps the most time-tested of financial strategies, value investing.</span></p>
<h3><span>Value and Fundamentals</span></h3>
<p><span>For investors like yours truly who believe markets ultimately have to have some <span><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/2020/08/11/does-reality-matter-stock-market-2020/">relation to reality</a></span>, the following joke tweet from December is a little too on the nose.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="395" srcset="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-200x82.jpg 200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-300x123.jpg 300w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-400x165.jpg 400w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-600x247.jpg 600w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-768x316.jpg 768w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-800x329.jpg 800w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></a></p>
<p><span>Value investors ask the same seemingly reasonable question of investments we all ask when we’re considering buying a good or service: is the price I have to pay a good deal compared to the quality I’m getting? In practice this generally means value investors seek to buy assets whose prices are low relative to their cashflows or other economic fundamentals. Value investing has an intellectual pedigree going back to at least the 1920s with the classic writings of Graham and Dodd and is perhaps most famous for their most successful student, Warren Buffett (who also didn’t do so well last year). Value investing has been out of favor for several years now, especially in the US market, something I documented extensively in my <span><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/2020/08/11/does-reality-matter-stock-market-2020/">two part</a> <a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/2020/08/19/does-reality-matter-part2/">series</a></span> last year on market valuations.</span></p>
<p><span>Last year was a miserable one for value investors. Within the US market, value stocks lagged the market in the first couple months, fell further during the crash, and recovered slower than the rest of the market. Though they rallied harder in the last two months of the year, value stock both large and small finished the year finished the year just barely above zero, as judged by the commonly followed Russell 1000 Value (large stocks) and Russell 2000 Value (small stocks) indexes.</span></p>

<p><span>Applying the value effect around the world gave even worse results. Choosing between stock markets, the US started the year the most expensive market in the world, and those in Europe were among the cheapest. But as we saw, the US market became more expensive still, and European stock investors barely ended the year in positive territory. Value stocks within foreign markets similarly failed to keep up with their broader market aggregates. One index of value stocks around the world, the MSCI ACWI Value Index, finished the year up a mere 0.42%. Taking an even more expansive view of valuation and applying it across global assets, buying those stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies measured as cheap and selling those measured as expensive would have lost you about 12% in 2020 (through November) according to <span><a href="https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Datasets/Value-and-Momentum-Everywhere-Factors-Monthly">AQR’s methodology</a></span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Skeptics of value investing often point out that value stocks are usually cheap for a reason: they’re junk. Indeed, if you simply sort the market based on a simple valuation metric like price to book ratio you’ll often find that the most undervalued stocks are in declining industries, have weak balance sheets and margins, and are projected to lose market share. Value investors often try to avoid “value traps” like this by augmenting their value factors with metrics to score some measure of “quality”, looking at profitability measures like return on equity, for example. Adding such quality filters would have only made things worse in 2020. Among the cheapest stocks in the market, the most profitable among them did the worst last year.</span></p>
<p><span>Professor Ken French keeps an invaluable <span><a href="https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html">online database</a></span> to quants that records the track records to different portfolios of stocks sorted on a variety of metrics. Looking at a double-sorted portfolio of the stocks that are in the lowest quintile of valuation and the highest quintile of profitability, here’s how such a portfolio did last year (through November) compared to the S&amp;P 500.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-1024x546.png" alt="" width="1024" height="546" srcset="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-200x107.png 200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-300x160.png 300w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-400x213.png 400w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-600x320.png 600w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-768x409.png 768w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-800x426.png 800w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-1024x546.png 1024w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-1200x639.png 1200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value.png 1490w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><span>The most profitable, cheapest stocks in the US lost more than half of their value in the crash last year, before recovering to end up down “only” about 20% last year, a staggering 33.8% behind the S&amp;P 500.</span></p>
<p><span>Take a moment to consider how counterintuitive this ought to seem. I think most people, even without much financial savvy, would consider the strategy of “buy highly profitable companies at attractive valuations” to seem like a fairly reasonable one, the sort of things that might actually deliver superior results over the long run, and indeed if we look at the long run data it has, as we’ll see further down the page. You might even suspect that such a prudent strategy might shine especially during a period of great economic tumult and uncertainty, and indeed it often has historically. But that is absolutely&nbsp;<em>not</em> what happened during the chaos of 2020. And that wasn’t the only curveball 2020 threw quants either.</span></p>
<h3><span>Low Volatility/Risk Parity</span></h3>
<p><span>After value, low volatility strategies are some of the most commonly used quant approaches of the last decade. Research going back to the 70s shows that those stocks whose prices are relatively more stable tend to roughly keep up with the rest of the market or nearly so when times are good, but lose far less value during panics and bear markets. Thus, over the long run they’ve done about as good or better as the rest of the market with a lot less risk. That is… decidedly not what happened last year. Within the US market, two of the most popular quant funds of recent years have been the iShares US Minimum Volatility ETF and the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility ETF, two ETFs that use a quantitative approach to pick the least volatile stocks within the US market. With tens of billions of dollars between them, here’s how these two flavors of low volatility stock investing did last year.</span></p>

<h3>When the pipe bursts</h3>



<p>7am every Wednesday, it was time to release the code. I’d take a weeks worth of code that I knew nothing about, by 2 dozen people, and ship it to production. We tested the code in isolation. We tested it together in our lower environments.  But even then when it was up on production who knew what was going to happen. Even if the release itself went well, there was always a chance that a feature was not ready for users. Finding that out at the last minute could push a release to a later day. This would delay other important releases that teams worked hard on.</p>



<p> <br>By batching up releases, we thought we were doing everyone a favor.  Customer success only has to learn about the release once a week! One person can own the release process and be an authority on it! We can test everything together all at once, and know for sure that it will work!. We were so wrong. </p>



<p><br>By batching up releases, we introduced a ton of risk. The release became an all or nothing affair. If any feature in a release wasn’t ready for customers, everything we had already communicated to customers was at risk. We would mitigate that risk by creating new problems. Rushing through something or introducing new issues. </p>



<p><br>The person (me) who was doing the deployment had no context for what exactly I was deploying. Sure the steps we could document the steps and what was in the release. But if something went wrong,, all I knew I could do was stop the whole train. If anything broke, it was impossible to figure out what may have caused it. Even if you are an expert of a system, a week’s worth of work by 20+ people is impossible to isolate defects. </p>



<p><br>After a few too many stressful releases, we decided one of the best investments we could make quickly was feature flags. With feature flags, you separate the release of code to customers from the deployment to production. Code for a new feature can live in a production environment for any duration of time without disruption to your customer. When the feature is ready, any team member can turn it on. If there is an issue for any reason, Anyone can shut the feature off, limiting impact. </p>



<p><br>We saw improvements to our process right away.  We stopped batching deployments, instead we would deploy to production regularly. Each change getting sent to production was easy to discern, it could be as small as a couple lines of code. If there was an issue it would be easy to track and identify. </p>



<p><br>When a feature was  ready for customers, anyone on our team, especially our product owners, could turn it on. We even went further. To deliver value customers sooner, we could build smaller features and only release it to users who had no known edge cases.  Once we had more time to identify how to approach the edge cases those customers would receive the updates. Teams became more confident, less stressed, and could get feedback on their work in a much shorter timeframe. </p>



<p><br>This was a transformative experience for me. I’ve been preaching the gospel ever since. I knew I could help get teams to work faster by enabling feature flags for more teams. </p>



<p><br>That’s why I built Molasses. <br></p>

<p>I started building in June. I focused on the problems I saw with the current tools. I surveyed those who had used feature flagging and A/B testing services in the past to get their opinion. What I found was that while there are great solutions here and there, but there was space for improvement. </p>



<p><br>Despite being a developer focused tool,  so many feature flag services are developer hostile. They can be slow, and make blocking remote calls. They are naive in their ability to target users, sometimes only by IP address or one parameter.  They had no way to audit changes. They lacked integrations with platforms for planning, chatops or observability.   Teams are slow to remove feature flags, accumulating technical debt. The gaps in these feature flag systems are  filled with custom software. Taking away from expensive developer and operations resources. </p>



<p><br><a href="https://www.molasses.app/">Molasses</a> allows teams to get up and running with feature flags right away. It supports many different languages and frameworks.  Molasses’ clients are fast, non-blocking, and the service pushes updates to the client instantly, no waiting.  You can roll out features to specific users and target specific groups. Molasses lets teams focus on the features they are building, not building feature flag technology. </p>



<p><br>Molasses unlocks A/B testing. We can examine the effectiveness  of a change right away. Want to start rolling out a feature to a set of alpha or beta users? No problem! Molasses will let you adjust who receives a feature over time.</p>

<p><br>Molasses isn’t the only tool in your toolchain. It integrates with the systems you already use, like Datadog or Slack. You can use those updates to know if a recent change is causing issues. When your feature is finally rolled out, Molasses has the code clean itself up. It opens a PR in your Github repo removing any stale code. </p>

January 28, 2021 | https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/constant-folding-python | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/constant-folding-python">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Every programming language aims to be performant in its niche and achieving superior performance requires a lot of compiler level optimizations. One famous optimization technique is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">Constant Folding</a> where during compile time the engine tries to recognize constant expressions, evaluate them, and replaces the expression with this newly evaluated value, making the runtime leaner.</p>
<p>In this essay, we dive deep and find what exactly is Constant Folding, understand the scope of it in the world of Python and finally go through Python's source code - <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/">CPython</a> - and find out how elegantly Python actually implements it.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">Constant Folding</a>, the engine finds and evaluates constant expressions at compile time rather than computing them at runtime, making the runtime leaner and faster.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>day_sec = <span>24</span> * <span>60</span> * <span>60</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When the compiler encounters a constant expression, like above, it evaluates the expression and replaces it with the evaluated value. The expression is usually replaced by the evaluated value in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree</a>, but the implementation is totally up to the language. Hence the above expression is effectively executed as</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>day_sec = <span>86400</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In Python, we could use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#module-dis">Disassembler module</a> to get the CPython bytecode giving us a good peek at how things will be executed. When we disassemble the above constant expression using the <code>dis</code> module, we get the following bytecode</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>import</span> dis
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>dis.dis(<span>"day_sec = 24 * 60 * 60"</span>)

        <span>0</span> LOAD_CONST               <span>0</span> (<span>86400</span>)
        <span>2</span> STORE_NAME               <span>0</span> (day_sec)
        <span>4</span> LOAD_CONST               <span>1</span> (<span>None</span>)
        <span>6</span> RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre>
<p>We see that the bytecode, instead of having two binary multiply operations followed by one <code>LOAD_CONST</code>, is having just one <code>LOAD_CONST</code> with the already evaluated value of <code>86400</code>. This indicates that the CPython interpreter during parsing and building of Abstract Syntax Tree folded the constant expression, <code>24 * 60 * 60</code> and replaced it with the evaluated value <code>86400</code>.</p>
<h3>Scope of Constant Folding</h3>
<p>Python tries to fold every single constant expression present but there are some cases where even though the expression is constant, but Python chooses not to fold it. For example, Python does not fold <code>x = 4 ** 64</code> while it does fold <code>x = 2 ** 64</code>.</p>
<p>Apart from the arithmetic expressions, Python also folds expressions involving Strings and Tuples, where constant string expressions till the length <code>4096</code> are folded.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"-"</span> * <span>4096</span>   
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"-"</span> * <span>4097</span>   
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"--"</span> * <span>4096</span>  
</code></pre>

<p>Now we shift our focus to the internals and find exactly where and how CPython implements Constant Folding. All AST optimizations, including Constant Folding, can be found in file <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/ast_opt.c">ast_opt.c</a>. The base function starting it all is <code>astfold_expr</code> which folds any and every expression that Python source has. The function recursively goes through the AST and tries to fold every constant expression, as seen in the snippet below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898628-38922200-511b-11eb-965f-fb4d46d3c45c.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898628-38922200-511b-11eb-965f-fb4d46d3c45c.png"></p>
<p>The <code>astfold_expr</code> before folding the expression at hand, tries to fold its child expressions (operands) and then delegates the folding to the corresponding specific expression folding function. The operation-specific folding function evaluates the expression and returns the evaluated constant value, which is then put into the AST.</p>
<p>For example, whenever <code>astfold_expr</code> encounters a binary operation, it recursively folds the two child operands (expressions) before evaluating the expression at hand using <code>fold_binop</code>. The function <code>fold_binop</code> returns the evaluated constant value as seen in the snippet below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898745-670ffd00-511b-11eb-88a9-f741157473b3.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898745-670ffd00-511b-11eb-88a9-f741157473b3.png"></p>
<p><code>fold_binop</code> function folds the binary operation by checking the kind of operator at hand and then invoking the corresponding evaluation function on them. For example, if the operation at hand is an addition then, to evaluate the final value, it invokes <code>PyNumber_Add</code> on both its left and right operands.</p>
<h3>What makes this elegant?</h3>
<p>Instead of writing special logic to handle certain patterns or types to fold constant expressions efficiently, CPython invokes the same general code. For example, it invokes the same usual <code>PyNumber_Add</code> function while folding that it does to perform the usual addition operation.</p>
<p>CPython has thus eradicated the need to write special functions to handle constant folding by making sure its code and evaluation process is structured in such a way that the general-purpose code itself can handle the evaluation of constant expressions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Imagine you're sitting in your office, and you start noticing emails coming in asking if you'd like to buy your domain.</p><p>"Huh, that's weird, I already own that domain" you think to yourself.</p><p>A few more emails come in, and they're getting past the spam filter, so you decide to double check your domain manager. Doubt starts creeping into your mind, you start <em>panicking</em>, and you frantically scroll down to where the domain should be, and...</p><p>It's gone.</p><p>The only option you have is to pay the person that grabbed your domain $3000 USD.</p><p><em>Hold up, rewind...</em></p><p>This sort of scenario can be avoided, yet an entire industry of domain squatters exists due to how commonly it occurs.</p><p>In this article, I'll provide advice you can do <strong>today</strong> to keep your domain secure in the long run.</p><p><strong>Table of contents</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#enable-2fa">Enable 2FA</a></li><li><a href="#check-that-your-domain-is-set-to-auto-renew">Check that your domain is set to auto renew</a></li><li><a href="#lock-your-domain-from-transfer">Lock your domain from transfer</a></li><li><a href="#check-your-payment-details">Check your payment details</a></li><li><a href="#use-a-reputable-domain-registrar">Use a reputable domain registrar</a></li><li><a href="#be-sure-you-own-your-domain">Be sure you own your domain</a></li><li><a href="#extend-your-domain-registration">Extend your domain registration</a></li><li><a href="#be-aware-of-any-tld-specific-rules-around-renewals">Be aware of any TLD-specific rules around renewals</a></li></ul><h2 id="enable-2fa"><a href="#enable-2fa" aria-label="guidelines to help avoid losing your domain permalink"></a>Enable 2FA</h2><p>If your domain registrar supports it, enable 2FA (two-factor authentication, also known as MFA/multi-factor authentication). It'll send you an email/SMS/push notification when logging into your domain manager.</p><p>While not a foolproof way of stopping hackers, it'll slow them down <strong>and</strong> alert you if your account has been compromised.</p><h2 id="check-that-your-domain-is-set-to-auto-renew"><a href="#check-that-your-domain-is-set-to-auto-renew" aria-label="guidelines to help avoid losing your domain permalink"></a>Check that your domain is set to auto renew</h2><p>Some domain registrars don't enable auto renew by default, particularly when transferring domains.</p><p>Check your domain manager to see that it's enabled.</p><h2 id="lock-your-domain-from-transfer"><a href="#lock-your-domain-from-transfer" aria-label="guidelines to help avoid losing your domain permalink"></a>Lock your domain from transfer</h2><p>While you're checking your domain manager has auto renewal enabled, also double check that your domain's "transfer lock" is also enabled.</p><p>Enabling transfer lock for your domain is effectively like a car alarm for your domain. If someone manages to get into your domain manager account, and tries to transfer the domain, you'll receive quite a few emails about it.</p><h2 id="check-your-payment-details"><a href="#check-your-payment-details" aria-label="guidelines to help avoid losing your domain permalink"></a>Check your payment details</h2><p>I know this one sounds obvious, but if the payment fails, your domain doesn't get renewed.</p><p>The most common mistake is that your credit card expires, and you forget to update the payment details your domain registrar has on file.</p><p>On the off-chance your domain registrar accepts Paypal (or similar), also double check that the payment details that they have are also up to date.</p><h2 id="use-a-reputable-domain-registrar"><a href="#use-a-reputable-domain-registrar" aria-label="guidelines to help avoid losing your domain permalink"></a>Use a reputable domain registrar</h2><p>There are a few ways to interpret "reputable" - I mean large companies trust them with their services, and the business itself is trustworthy. Certain domain registrars also own companies that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_drop_catching">"drop catch"</a> domains that expire from their services. Would <strong>you</strong> want to use a domain registrar that's financially incentivised to let your domain expire?</p><p>Here are some reputable domain registrars that immediately come to mind:</p><ul><li>AWS<ul><li>Some of the largest internet companies trust AWS to host their services</li></ul></li><li>NameCheap<ul><li>Decent reputation, has been around a very long time, used to make you pay for privacy, now doesn't</li></ul></li><li>Gandi<ul><li>Decent reputation, has been around a very long time</li></ul></li><li>Google Domains<ul><li>I hesitated to put this one on the list. Google has a reputation for <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">killing products</a> once it realises it won't be a billion dollar business. Despite this, I've heard Google's Support has been slowly improving over time.</li></ul></li></ul><p>I've personally had negative experiences with GoDaddy and CrazyDomains (in Australia), and would strongly recommend to anyone reading this: transfer your domain ASAP to somewhere like AWS.</p><h2 id="be-sure-you-own-your-domain"><a href="#be-sure-you-own-your-domain" aria-label="guidelines to help avoid losing your domain permalink"></a>Be sure you own your domain</h2><p>If you purchased your domain through a third-party, like Wix, WordPress, or maybe the agency or contractor that helped build your site, chances are you're not fully in control of your domain.</p><p>Sure, it might be easier for you to have them manage the domain for you, and pass the bill along each year, however this sort of arrangement can become problematic when you want to cancel the service, or move to another provider.</p><p>If you're having an agency or contractors build your site for you, and they become unresponsive, you risk losing the domain if you also let them manage it for you.</p><p>By keeping the login to your domain manager to yourself, you can cut ties with rogue third-parties and move to a different provider.</p><h2 id="extend-your-domain-registration"><a href="#extend-your-domain-registration" aria-label="guidelines to help avoid losing your domain permalink"></a>Extend your domain registration</h2><p>Most domain registrars will let you extend your registration for around $12 USD per year for .com domains. This lets you remove the risk of your automatic renewal not going through by manually renewing.</p><p>For example, AWS offers the following:</p><p><img src="https://onlineornot.com/assets/guidelines-to-help-avoid-losing-your-domain/extend-domain-registration.png" alt="AWS Extend Domain Registration"></p><p>Considering the amount of money domain squatters will try to get from you if you let your domain expire, it's a pretty good deal.</p><h2 id="be-aware-of-any-tld-specific-rules-around-renewals"><a href="#be-aware-of-any-tld-specific-rules-around-renewals" aria-label="guidelines to help avoid losing your domain permalink"></a>Be aware of any TLD-specific rules around renewals</h2><p>While it's great fun to grab a domain from a country half way across the world from you so you can spell out your brand, different countries have different rules around domain renewals.</p><p>As an example, Spain (.es) charges a renewal fee on top of an annual fee. As well as that, if you let the domain expire, there's another renewal fee that ranges from 30 USD to hundreds of dollars (depending on your registrar).</p><p><strong>Got any tips I'm missing?</strong> Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/RozenMD">tweet them at me</a>!</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>On December 13, 2020, Reuters broke the story that the Treasury Department has been compromised by sophisticated hackers, and afterwords numerous organize confirm the story. Washington Post attributed hack to cozy bear (Russian SVR). To understand Solarwinds hack, first need to understand what <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solarwinds</a> does.</p>

<h2><span id="What_Solarwinds_does"></span>What Solarwinds does?<span></span></h2>
<p>Solarwinds is a software company which has numerous software offering for systems managements. These software programs are primarily managed by IT professionals at large institutions.</p>
<h2><span id="What_Solarwinds_Oroin_NMS_does"></span>What Solarwinds Oroin NMS does?<span></span></h2>
<p>Orion<strong> NMS (Network Management Systems)</strong> is the most popular software of Solarwinds and has capabilities of managing and monitoring a wide variety of devices such as servers, desktop, laptop, network devices etc. </p>

<p>The Company has 300,000+ customers worldwide, including 425 of US Fortune 500 companies. </p>

<h2><span id="How_hacker_compromises_Solarwinds_systems_And_Why_Solarwinds_hack_spread_for_so_long_without_detection"></span>How hacker compromises Solarwinds systems? And Why Solarwinds hack spread for so long without detection?<span></span></h2>
<p>Since Solarwinds NMS has access to so many devices in an institution and so many institutions use Solarwinds NMS, it becomes a prime target of hackers.</p>
<p>NMS are run on two modes. First is monitoring and second is monitoring/managing. Many of the systems are configured to do both. So if NMS compromised, attacker can do what NMS can do. </p>
<p>According to SEC filling by Solarwinds, hackers infiltrated as early as March 2020, and It took almost 9 months to detect <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first instance of hack</a>, so why it took so long to figure out even tough 425 out of Fortunes 500 companies were using it.</p>
<p>Hacker compromise build server of Solarwinds and added malware(named sunburst) to existing software during build process and signed with Solarwinds digital signature. As once software signed by official signature, many of the anti-malware and anti-virus software accept that software behavior as normal, As anti-malware and anti-virus companies don’t know Solarwinds signature has been compromised. This is still evolving situation and some argue only build process was compromise. (But anyhow digital signature became useless). </p>
<p>Sophistication does not stop here. Malware was written in away, so it will stay dormant for first 15 days or so anti-malware and anti-virus can’t associate changes in network pattern to change in Solarwinds software version.</p>
<p>Not just that, Hackers make sure that sunburst maleware’s outgoing traffic look very similar to typical Solarwinds traffic. It seems like the hackers’ goal was to stay in the infected systems as long as possible. </p>
<p>The story gets even crazy, before executing sunburst malware, hacker will make sure it is not private IP or Microsoft IP ranges as it seems like hackers were aware that Microsoft has capabilities to capture this kind of activity, so hackers make sure malware does not connect to Microsoft IP. Kudos to Microsoft. </p>
<h2><span id="What_can_you_do_to_protect_your_institute_against_Solarwinds_hack"></span>What can you do to protect your institute against Solarwinds hack?<span></span></h2>
<p>The situation is still evolving so the current best solution is to work with Solarwinds help desk to resolve the threat. You can get the latest information through twitter hashtag:</p>

<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has also issued <a href="https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">guidelines</a>. Here is a summary of what DHS guidelines</p>
<ol><li>Make image of memory and OS of all instance which are hosting Solarwinds Orion NMS</li><li>Analyze unusual activity like new users, service/app account and privileges. </li><li>Analyze unusual traffic like new external DNS and other <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2020/12/13/active-exploitation-solarwinds-software" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">indications of compromise</a>.</li><li><strong>Disconnect or power down SolarWinds Orion products, versions 2019.4 through 2020.2.1 HF1, from their network</strong>. Future communication from CISA will clarify which version to install and how to obtain securely. </li><li>Block all traffic from and to hosts, external to enterprise where Solarwinds Orion was installed.</li><li><strong>Identify and remove</strong> all threat actor-controlled accounts</li><li><strong>After (and only after) all threat actor-controlled accounts and identified persistence mechanisms have been removed</strong>:<ol><li> Treat all hosts monitored by the SolarWinds Orion monitoring software as compromised by threat actors and assume that further persistence mechanisms have been deployed.</li><li>Rebuild hosts monitored by the SolarWinds Orion monitoring software using trusted sources.</li><li> Reset all credentials used by or stored in SolarWinds software. Such credentials should be considered compromised.</li><li> Take actions to remediate kerberoasting, including, as necessary or appropriate, engaging with a 3rd party with experience eradicating APTs from enterprise networks. </li></ol></li></ol>
<h2><span id="My_2cents"></span>My 2cents<span></span></h2>
<ol><li>Assume all Solarwinds Orion is compromise (even releases before March), so contentiously monitor till proven otherwise.</li><li>Block Internet traffic to as many servers as you can.</li><li>If you are paranoid, and you have the right to be paranoid even after applying Solarwinds patch. There is possibility that hackers could have created an additional backdoor, so the nuclear option is to rebuild your most critical servers from scratch using NIST-850 and CIS benchmark in a separate network.</li></ol>

		<p>A key defence of appeasement, and especially the 1938 Munich Agreement, is that it gave Britain and France time to rearm against the Nazi threat. It is actually an ex-post argument: Chamberlain himself sold his policies as a bid for peace, not time. He launched no rearmament effort until March 1939, when Hitler reneged on Munich. The idea has nevertheless achieved a surprising degree of acceptance, especially in Britain. It was worthwhile sacrificing Czechoslovakia in 1938 the better to be able to face Germany militarily in 1939/40, so it goes. Except it wasn’t.</p>
<p>In this post I set out why the Entente partners actually <em>lost&nbsp;</em>time at Munich in as few words as possible. The long argument can be found in <em>The Bell of Treason</em>or in my <em>International History Review&nbsp;</em>article on the subject. It is touched upon in the rest of the Munich literature, of course, though not with the full data.</p>
<p>The first reason Britain and France were worse off in 1939 than 1938 is that in 1939 they got a far weaker set of allies. In September 1938, they could count on Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. In September 1939, they only had Poland. Czechoslovakia had fully mobilised, possessed a well-equipped army, and could base its defence on a long fortification barrier. Poland was surprised in the middle of mobilization, its army was ill equipped, and – thanks to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of August 1939 – it was invaded from both sides. The longer explanation, again, is in my book.</p>

<p><em>Nuremberg Panzer factory (Ullstein Bild – Photo12 / Collection Bernard Crochet)</em></p>
<p>The key data is military. France, and with it Britain, lost time because the one to one-and-a-half years between 1938 and 1939/40 helped Germany far more than it helped them. This was partly because the Germans were able to seized the large Czechoslovak stockpiles and factories. A third of the tanks that pierced the French front in May 1940, causing the French collapse, were built in Czechoslovakia. Germany faced dire raw-material and production bottlenecks in 1938, which were relieved through time gained, the Czech annexation, and the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. Meanwhile, German rearmament proper had only begun in 1935 when Hitler had reintroduced conscription. By 1938, Germany had thus been forming new army divisions for three years. By 1939 this was four years and by 1940 almost five: half as long again as by 1938.</p>
<p>I set out the relative army numbers, in simplified form, in the table below. France did not need to re-arm because it was already armed at or close to its full potential. Its accretion in military strength between 1938 and 1939 was limited. Germany’s accrued power was considerable. The difference became even more marked by 1940. This does not count the relative value of the Czechoslovak or Polish armies nor any Soviet contribution. Britain’s expeditionary force only increased from two to five divisions in the interval, so it can be ignored.</p>

<p>After the war started, France was able to put together another twenty divisions, while Germany assembled another forty. So France’s position changed from an advantage of fifteen divisions in 1938, to a disadvantage of twenty-four by 1939, which became forty-five in May 1940. This is a quantitative, not a qualitative overview, but two additional factors are worth mentioning. First, the 1938 German tanks were all Panzer I and II models, fitted with inferior armour and firepower. The mark I Panzer did not even possess a canon, just a machinegun. The tanks that pierced the French front in 1940 were mark III and IV – still at the prototype stage in 1938. Second, the German army was only able to push through Belgium, in 1940, by taking its border fortresses with glider and parachute units. In 1938, these elite units were still being assembled.</p>
<p>Germany lacked the firepower to defeat France in 1938. Indeed, it faced defeat at the hands of a stronger coalition, possibly in short order. It also follows, finally, that it was not in a position to launch an attack on Britain. This goes to the core of the theory that Chamberlain bought time by helping muster the country’s air defences. Actually in 1938 Britain was already producing Spitfires and Hurricanes, and output rhythms were not sped up until the spring of 1939 – and even then still less than to a wartime pace – so that the time gained was close to nil. But the key is that the <em>Luftwaffe</em>, even in 1940, could only launch an assault on Britain from bases in Belgium and northern France. It was not possible to do that from Germany. So until France fell, there could be no Battle of Britain. And if Germany lacked the land forces to defeat France in 1938 or 39…</p>
<p>The Battle of Britain was this incredibly romantic moment, immortalized by Churchill. Seen more coldly, though, it was only one of many turning points in WWII, the first among which were the falls of Poland, then France. The Battle of Britain was not even “the end of the beginning” (that was reserved to El Alamein). I want to close this post with Churchill’s own words, making exactly the point I make in the preceding paragraph.</p>
<p>“The German armies were not capable of defeating the French in 1938 or 1939. The vast tank production with which they broke the French front did not come into existence until 1940, and, in the face of French superiority in the West and an unconquered Poland in the East, they could certainly not have concentrated the whole of their air-power against England as they were able to do when France had been forced to surrender. This takes no account either of the attitude of Russia or of whatever resistance Czechoslovakia might have made. I have thought it right to set out the figures of relative air-power in the period concerned, but they do not in any way alter the conclusions which I have recorded. For all the above reasons, the year’s breathing-space said to be “gained” by Munich left Britain and France in a much worse position compared with Hitler’s Germany than they had been at the Munich crisis.”</p>

<p>Earlier, I had written about controversial court cases, such as the trials of George Zimmerman, Dominique Strauss Kahn &amp; the Duke Lacrosse Team. We discussed our <a rel="noopener" href="https://outlookzen.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/acknowledging-our-ignorance/" target="_blank">tendency to jump to conclusions</a> and assume what must have really happened, based on flimsy pieces of evidence and our own preconceived notions and biases. In truth, this isn’t isolated to sensational current events. This is endemic to the way we live our lives &amp; perceive the world every single day.</p>



<p>All too often, we see people who are so unwaveringly certain. Certain that their lifestyle &amp; way of doing things is best. Certain that their God is the one true God &amp; all others are heathens or infidels. Certain that their political beliefs are correct, and their opponents represent everything that is wrong with the country. Certain that they are right &amp; anyone who disagrees with them is wrong.</p>



<p>Personally, I find this certainty to be unbearably stifling. Even when I’m with like minded peers who subscribe to my political or lifestyle beliefs, I often find myself ill at ease with how certain they are of themselves, and how dismissive they are of anyone or anything that disagrees with their mental model of how the world works. Isn’t it possible to believe in something, while still holding reservations about the possibility of being wrong?</p>



<p>Hence why I found the <a rel="noopener" href="http://nyti.ms/1k1pB7c" target="_blank">following article so refreshing and insightful</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“One aim of the physical sciences has been to give an actual picture of the material world. One achievement of physics in the 20th century has been to show that such an aim is unattainable.” For Dr. Bronowski, there was no absolute knowledge and anyone who claims it — whether a scientist, a politician or a religious believer — opens the door to tragedy. All scientific information is imperfect and we have to treat it with humility. Such, for him, was the human condition.</em></p><p><em>This is the condition for what we can know, but it is also, crucially, a moral lesson. It is the lesson of 20th-century painting from Cubism onwards, but also that of quantum physics. All we can do is to push deeper and deeper into better approximations of an ever-evasive reality. The goal of complete understanding seems to recede as we approach it.</em></p><p><em>There is no God’s eye view, Dr. Bronowski insisted, and the people who claim that there is and that they possess it are not just wrong, they are morally pernicious. Errors are inextricably bound up with pursuit of human knowledge, which requires not just mathematical calculation but insight, interpretation and a personal act of judgment for which we are responsible.</em></p><p><em>… the genesis of Werner Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle in the hugely creative milieu that surrounded the physicist Max Born in the 1920s. Dr. Bronowski insisted that the principle of uncertainty was a misnomer, because it gives the impression that in science (and outside of it) we are always uncertain. But this is wrong. Knowledge is precise, but that precision is confined within a certain toleration of uncertainty.</em></p><p><em>… Dr. Bronowski thought that the uncertainty principle should therefore be called the principle of tolerance. Pursuing knowledge means accepting uncertainty. Heisenberg’s principle has the consequence that no physical events can ultimately be described with absolute certainty or with “zero tolerance,” as it were. The more we know, the less certain we are.</em></p><p><em>In the everyday world, we do not just accept a lack of ultimate exactitude with a melancholic shrug, but we constantly employ such inexactitude in our relations with other people. Our relations with others also require a principle of tolerance. We encounter other people across a gray area of negotiation and approximation. Such is the business of listening and the back and forth of conversation and social interaction.</em></p><p><em>For Dr. Bronowski, the moral consequence of knowledge is that we must never judge others on the basis of some absolute, God-like conception of certainty. All knowledge, all information that passes between human beings, can be exchanged only within what we might call “a play of tolerance,” whether in science, literature, politics or religion. As he eloquently put it, “Human knowledge is personal and responsible, an unending adventure at the edge of uncertainty.”</em></p><p><em>The relationship between humans and nature and humans and other humans can take place only within a certain play of tolerance. Insisting on certainty, by contrast, leads ineluctably to arrogance and dogma based on ignorance.</em></p><p><em>At this point, in the final minutes of the show, the scene suddenly shifts to Auschwitz, where many members of Bronowski’s family were murdered… The play of tolerance opposes the principle of monstrous certainty that is endemic to fascism and, sadly, not just fascism but all the various faces of fundamentalism. When we think we have certainty, when we aspire to the knowledge of the gods, then Auschwitz can happen and can repeat itself. Arguably, it has repeated itself in the genocidal certainties of past decades.</em></p><p><em>The pursuit of scientific knowledge is as personal an act as lifting a paintbrush or writing a poem, and they are both profoundly human. If the human condition is defined by limitedness, then this is a glorious fact because it is a moral limitedness rooted in a faith in the power of the imagination, our sense of responsibility and our acceptance of our fallibility. We always have to acknowledge that we might be mistaken. When we forget that, then we forget ourselves and the worst can happen.</em></p></blockquote>



<hr>



<p>To me, the central message from above is one of humility, and admitting the fallibility of our knowledge. The truth is, we live in an extraordinarily complicated world, and we ourselves are such humble, small and flawed creatures in comparison with the size, breadth and depth of our universe. Any certainty that we may ever hold, reflects more on our conceit, than on the world we live in. No human knowledge is ever certain, not even scientific knowledge. For centuries, Newtonian laws of physics were extremely well tested and formed the cornerstone of science… But they too were proven wrong by Einstein’s &nbsp;theory of relativity.</p>



<p>Of course we should still act and make the best decisions possible in the face of limited knowledge, but we should be aware of the lack of certainty. For a patient with heart disease, getting open-heart surgery is the right decision to take. Not because of absolute certainty in its effectiveness, but because it’s reasonably well proven and better than the alternative of doing nothing. Even with something as small as driving to work, we have to accept that there is no certainty of us reaching there safely. You could meet with an accident and die any day. This is very unlikely since we’ve made this same drive thousands of times safely, but we still have to acknowledge its possibility.</p>



<p>Living under the false delusion of absolute certainty will lead one to drive recklessly and not pay close attention to danger signs. The belief in absolute certainty closes off our minds, and stops us from learning anything new. Only by acknowledging the fallibility of our knowledge can we avoid making catastrophic mistakes, correct our mistaken prejudices, and continue bettering ourselves.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2>Searching the web</h2>
        <p>"Searching" is the most common action performed on the internet everyday. Google alone receives <a href="https://ardorseo.com/blog/how-many-google-searches-per-day-2019/#targetText=This%20translates%20to%20over%2040%2C000,listed%20by%20Internet%20Live%20Stats.">40,000 search queries every second (3.5 billion searches per day on average)</a>. That is a <i>lot</i> of queries. That also means there is a great deal of user interaction taking place between what is essentially a single text input and a list of outputted data. So, why has barely any UI/UX improvements been introduced over the years? I find it difficult to assume that the current "search engine design" has achieved <i>perfection</i> since there are so many obvious flaws.</p>
        <p>Let's take a stab at enhancing this extremely important user interface and see if we can evolve the search engine experience.</p>
        <h2>Default search engine results (DuckDuckGo)</h2>
        <p>For our baseline example we will use the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> search engine. If you aren't currently using DDG as your default search engine, I recommend that you make the switch. Google has continually proven that they shouldn't be trusted with user data, nor do they have their customers' well being and privacy at the forefront of their priorities. I've <a href="https://bradleytaunt.com/stop-crawling-google/">talked about ditching Google in the past</a> if you're interested. &lt;/End rant&gt;</p>
        <p>This is what a default search result for the term "canada" returns:</p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/default-search-results.png" alt="Default Search Results">
        </p>
        <p>Overall the design is clean and focuses on exactly what the user cares about: the content. A quick, detailed pane is presented to the right of the top list results, giving the user an easy overview of the searched query. I have no real complaints about the visuals. The overall UX is a different story.</p>

        <h2>Respecting user limitations</h2>
        <p>Not everyone has unlimited data usage or fast internet. In fact, reliable internet is more of a first-world luxury that is often taken for granted. Many people (specifically those on restricted mobile plans or low-end, under-powered devices) can't afford to eat through their data caps when performing something as simple as an internet search. For some, these under-powered devices may be their only way to connect to the web. By forcing items like tracking scripts or injected advertisement media onto the users' devices, you're stealing away what little available data they have. You're also doing this while providing zero positive gain for the users themselves.</p>

        <h2>Introducing page size results</h2>
        <p>Why not give the user the ability to instantly know how much data each listing will consume <i>before</i> they commit to actually visiting that website? By introducing a simple toggle filter at the top of the search results (I would advocate to have this <i>active</i> by default) you give the user a quick-and-easy way to see each listing's total page size. Take a look at the concept of this idea below:</p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/page-size-results.png" alt="Page Size Search Results">
        </p>
        <p>In the top right section of each listing the user can now see how "heavy" each webpage item is. By displaying the page weight, users have a better understanding of which sites will be faster and easier on their data caps - based on a very simple addition.</p>
        <p>An indirect consequence (but overall a great bonus) of this page weight element being standard, is companies would be forced to review their current websites/apps, as to avoid being flagged.</p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/search-item-details.png" alt="Search Item Details">
        </p>
        <h3>• Page Size Indicator</h3>
        <p>This element would show the final size of the entire webpage the listing is linked to. Default styling would display this as a minimal, grey text item. Webpages with a total webpage size of <a href="https://www.machmetrics.com/speed-blog/website-size-the-average-web-page-size-is-more-than-2mb-twice-the-size-of-the-average-page-just-3-years-ago/">1MB or greater</a> would be styled in a way to warn the user of a large download requirement. (Light red background to attract immediate attention)</p>

        <h2>Scanning results</h2>
        <p>Having the ability to know the weight of a given listing is great, but what about privacy? Including an option to tell the user which listings will track, send your data to 3rd-party services, or display obnoxious ads should be more important than your data consumption. This can also be implemented with a simple UI:</p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/scan-results.png" alt="Scan Search Results">
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/search-item-scan.png" alt="Search Item Scanned">
        </p>
        <h3>• Ads Indicator</h3>
        <p>This tag element is added to listings that contain certain flagged advertisement scripts (Google adsense, carbon ads, buysellads, etc.). Advertisements don't necessarily mean a <i>bad</i> experience, so their styling is designed as more informational.</p>
        <h3>• 3rd-Party Scripts Indicator</h3>
        <p>The tracking tag element is designed in a way to indicate a warning to the user. These scripts tend to ignore user privacy, so they have more importance to the user's security. These would include (but not be limited to) Google Analytics, Kissmetrics, Mixpanel, Chartbeat, etc. This element might also be a good way to "upsell" the user on using script blocking extensions like Ghostery or uBlock.</p>

        <h2>Companies reliant on advertisements</h2>
        <p>Won't companies dependent on embedded advertisements and tracking scripts push-back against this design concept? Probably.</p>
        <p>But too bad. My message to companies who rely on beefy ads and follower their users wherever they go, as a means to make a profit: <strong>Adapt or die.</strong></p>
        <p>Ruining your users' experience for the sake of monetizing your business is bad for said business in the long run. Personally, I believe it's border-line unethical. Your users never consent to these 3rd-party tracking scripts or give permission for you to force-download megabytes of data.</p> 
        <p>Stop feeding your customers garbage and you won't have to worry about more detailed search results. You'll be one of the <strong>good guys</strong> 👍. Figure out a way to make money without screwing over your users. It's just lazy to say "there is no other way" before even trying something else.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s, dramatic shifts in radio spectrum allocation for mobile data applications, combined with advances in radio transmission and receiving prompted some networking engineers to propose a radical rethink of radio.</p>
<p>Our current spectrum management assumes that senders and receivers have characteristics that are fixed at the point of manufacture, determined by things like the shape of an antenna and the type of quartz crystal used as an oscillator.</p>
<p>But software-defined radios (SDRs) and software-tunable phased-array antennas make those assumptions obsolete. Today, a radio can be a commodity computer that can sense other devices' RF use and transmit and receive on multiple frequencies to share the airwaves.</p>
<p>This was dubbed "cognitive radio" and its proponents imagined a world where the exclusive spectrum allocations handed out to telcos, broadcasters and other powerful entities would be replaced by a cooperative spectrum model.</p>
<p>Two radios that needed to talk to one another might make contact in one band, switch to another, or ask a third receiver to relay messages for them, using just enough power to reach one another, avoiding the bands that were already in use.</p>
<p>These proposals – which would vastly increase wireless data capacity – were met with fierce resistance, from incumbent licensors, from spectrum speculators, and from HAMs, who are brilliant but also tend to be conservative about spectrum allocation.</p>
<p>These debates inevitably ran up against a hard limit: no one had ever built any kind of serious cognitive radio network. Just trying it would likely trigger massive, brutal FCC enforcement action, as it would trample all that exclusive spectrum.</p>
<p>But that didn't cool the ardor of cognitive radio's fiercest proponents. People like Dwayne Hendricks roamed the world, looking for spectrum havens – places where cognitive radio could be tried. The King of Tonga greenlit one project!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/">https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/</a></p>
<p>But the most promising on-shore spectrum laboratories were First Nations territories – sovereign nations whose treaties predated any understanding of electromagnetic spectrum and thus did not cede spectrum rights to settler colonial powers.</p>
<p>Though the legal theory was as untested as the technical one, some First Nations bands dallied with it, wondering if they leverage their position to race past the hidebound rules in the US and Canada to bring money and connectivity to their communities.</p>
<p>I wrote a short story about this in 2002, "Liberation Spectrum," which Salon published in 2003:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.salon.com/2003/01/16/liberation_spectrum/">https://www.salon.com/2003/01/16/liberation_spectrum/</a></p>
<p>Making sovereign spectrum policy is one of the better interpretations of treaty law; it has the potential to be as lucrative as, say, casinos – and could also bridge the digital divide for First Nations communities.</p>
<p>Certainly, it's a better idea than the pharma trolls who briefly experimented with transfering patent portfolios to sovereign bands in the hopes of of muddying the jurisdictional questions so that their profiteering would be harder to shut down.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/how-a-native-american-tribe-ended-up-owning-six-key-patents-on-an-eye-drug/">https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/how-a-native-american-tribe-ended-up-owning-six-key-patents-on-an-eye-drug/</a></p>
<p>Thankfully, that plan petered out. Likewise, First Nations experiments with spectrum policy seem also to have lost momentum, since then – at least, none have crossed my radar.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>On Jan 13, the Mexican Supreme Court found in favor of Indigenous Community Telecommunications (TIC), unanimously finding that community groups like TIC were entitled to free "social use" spectrum licenses.</p>
<p><a href="https://globalvoices.org/2021/01/27/indigenous-led-telecommunications-organization-wins-historic-legal-battle-in-mexico/">https://globalvoices.org/2021/01/27/indigenous-led-telecommunications-organization-wins-historic-legal-battle-in-mexico/</a></p>
<p>The decision did not rely on treaty rights, but rather upon a carve out in Mexican spectrum policy that gives free spectrum to community groups. TIC is an incredibly effective network of 80 towns in 18 Indigenous communities operating voice and data mobile networks.</p>
<p>Since 2018, TIC has been under threat, with the regulator demanding 1m pesos for continued access to spectrum; a demand the Supreme Court unanimously voided.</p>
<p>The decision will ease expansions of TIC's service into the vast majority of Indigenous communities that lack reliable mobile service.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ift.org.mx/sites/default/files/reporte-coberturapueblosindigenas_finalpublicar.pdf">http://www.ift.org.mx/sites/default/files/reporte-coberturapueblosindigenas_finalpublicar.pdf</a></p>
<p>And it also allows for services beyond telephony. As TIC's Erick Huerta says, this paves the way for other Indigenous media being exempted from regulatory barriers.</p>

<p>A new research report from Sean O'Brien and Expressvpn in honor Data Privacy Day reveals the incredible extent of commercial location tracking hidden in everyday apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/digital-security-lab/investigation-xoth">https://www.expressvpn.com/digital-security-lab/investigation-xoth</a></p>
<p>App vendors use free software development kits (SDKs) to build their products, not realizing (or not caring) that the SDKs come from commercial surveillance companies that harvest all their users' data and sell it in hidden, sprawling commercial markets.</p>
<p>That's how the US military was able to buy location data on users of a Muslim prayer app: the app was built with one of these surveillance SDKs, so the data was extracted, packaged and sold on the cheap to the Pentagon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x">https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x</a></p>
<p>The survey encompasses 450 apps with 1.7b downloads. It found that messenger apps (including many masquerading as Wechat, FB Messenger, and Telegram) were rife with location tracking. Other major offenders include dating and social apps.</p>
<p>The sleaziest SDK vendors are also the most prolific. X-Mode (a company that is theoretically banned from app stores) is in 44% of the analyzed apps. X-Mode is especially prevalent in religious apps, especially Islamic ones.</p>
<p>The researchers did me the honor of naming their report Project Xoth – Xoth is the name of one of the sinister commercial surveillance companies in Attack Surface, the third Little Brother book.</p>

<p>There is no shortage of takes about what's going on with Gamestop (and other surging stocks), Robinhood and Reddit's r/wallstreetbets, many of them contradictory – at least on the face of them. But I think it's possible for most of these takes to be right. Here's how.</p>
<p>First you need to understand the underlying mechanics of the story. Stock markets are fundamentally a way of making bets, including bets on the outcome of other peoples' bets, and bets on the outcomes of <em>those</em> bets.</p>
<p>All this complexity creates lots of exploitable opportunities. Some of these opportunities are considered legitimate and are given respectable names like "arbitrage." Others are considered illegitimate, and are called disreputable things like "stock manipulation."</p>
<p>A hypothetical Martian observing all this through a telescope could not tell you which kinds of bets were honest and which were dishonest, because the difference isn't about any objective standard, but rather, about power.</p>
<p>The strategies of powerful people are legit, while the strategies of their would-be dethroners are not legit. Sometimes, even outright frauds are OK if they're done by people with enough power.</p>
<p>If your scam pays out quickly enough, you can sometimes parlay the resulting cash into retrospective legitimization, so even the strategies of the out-group can end up being retconned as legit, if they're successful enough.</p>
<p>That's why Amway isn't illegal: Betsy DeVos's father-in-law was simultaneously the boss of Amway and head of the US Chamber of Commerce, and Gerry Ford was his Congressman, who was then elevated to president in time to legalize its business model.</p>
<p>To understand the Gamestop rise, you have to understand a couple of different kinds of bets.</p>
<p>"Shorting": this is a bet that a stock will go down. There's a complicated backstory to how you make this bet, but it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>The thing to know here is that shorting a stock can make you rich…if the stock goes down. But if the stock goes up, you lose money. There's not really any limit to how much you can lose here.</p>
<p>Every time the stock goes up, the shorts have to pony up more money to keep their bet alive (in the hopes that it will go down again later), or they have to take their losses, pay out the winner of the bet and surrender any chance of winning later.</p>
<p>Shorting isn't just a bet on someone else's failure – it's a way to fund bullshit-detection. If you know (or suspect) that a company is lying about its prospects, you can bet against it.</p>
<p>Shorts fund a lot of research into defective products and scammy businesses, because they win when bad companies are exposed and their stocks go down. Some of the scary security research you read about bad IoT software is funded by shorts.</p>
<p>That's why habitual bullshitters like Elon Musk <em>hate</em> shorts. Musk leads a cult of credulous worshippers who buy whatever he's selling. Shorts make bets that Musk's cultists will get deprogrammed. Musk uses this to sharpen his cultists' resolve: "they want us to fail!"</p>
<p>"Options": many different bets get lumped in as "options" but for the purposes of this discussion, buying an option means buying the right to buy stocks later. The people who sell you the option usually go out and buy the stock right away so they'll have it to sell.</p>
<p>"Front-running": Cheating. Front-runners insert themselves into transactions by spying. If I know that Alice is buying a bunch …</p></div></article></div>

<p><i>January 28, 2021</i></p>


<p>
I sometimes get asked whether it makes sense to implement <i>XYZ</i> in C,
especially compared to using some language that is more advanced
(C++, Julia, Python, Haskell or Rust) or perfect (Lisp).
</p>

<p>
I suspect that a lot of people are a bit intimidated by C and believe that
it requires some kind of superhuman hacker ability to wield.
That's at least how I felt about C
before I started really using it.
Other people believe that C is a horrible
language that inherently produces defective software
and which should be cast back into the abysses of UNIX from whence it came
(they are not necessarily wrong).
I personally think that C's simplicity
is an advantage that
often outweighs its disadvantages,
but there are clearly domains where C is a bad choice.
In domains where C works well, there are also good
alternatives, and choosing C then just comes
down to personal preference.
</p>

<p>
In this post, I will attempt to answer why you should or shouldn't use C,
and I will give some general advice that may be helpful if you end up using C.
This is based on my own experience developing
mathematical software in C (mainly <a href="https://flintlib.org/">Flint</a>,
<a href="https://arblib.org/">Arb</a> and <a href="https://fredrikj.net/calcium/">Calcium</a>), in an academic setting.
This experience will not necessarily transfer well to other settings.
</p>

<h2>Why you should use C</h2>

<p>Why should you write your next library
in C, or perhaps contribute to some existing C library?
I will offer four simple arguments.</p>

<h3>Availability</h3>

<p>
Reason number one is that C is stable, universally supported,
and has reliable tooling.
Your plain C library will compile and run
almost anywhere, can be developed anywhere,
and will require minimal dependencies. Users of virtually
any other programming language can easily interface with your code
through their language's C foreign function interface,
at least if you take basic precautions to design a decent external API.
Not only will your C library run anywhere
<i>right now</i>; it will still run 20 years from now,
and if you had a time machine, probably 20 years ago too.
</p>

<h3>Speed</h3>

<p>
Reason number two is that it will run very, very fast.
I don't just mean that
benchmark loops will
go <i>VROOOM</i>; your software will also start up instantly
(no need to load a bloated dynamic runtime or JIT-compile code),
and there will be no hidden overhead for things like automatic
garbage collection
(well-written C code spends a negligible fraction of its overall
execution time doing allocations and deallocations,
precisely at the points in time where they are needed).
This is, of course, <i>if you know what you are doing</i>.
Writing efficient C, while not exactly rocket surgery, does require
proficiency with the language and a solid understanding
of fundamental algorithms and data structures.
</p>

<h3>Readability</h3>

<p>Reason number three is that you will be able to read your
own code, and others will incidentally be able to read it too.
Some people are going to disagree with me here, arguing that higher
level languages are better for readibility.
That is trivially true in the sense that higher level languages
provide abstractions that allow expressing complex ideas more
succinctly.
A simple example is providing operator overloading so that you
can write <tt>a + b * c</tt> instead of something like <tt>add(a, mul(b, c))</tt>,
or in C, often something even more verbose like the following typical <a href="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> snippet:
</p>

<pre>mpz_t tmp;
mpz_init(tmp);
mpz_mul(tmp, b, c);
mpz_add(a, a, tmp);
mpz_clear(tmp);
</pre>

<p>This
would seem like an especially important point for mathematical software.
However, hiding details can also
hide useful information.
In an object-oriented, memory-managed,
operator-overloaded language, information that may be
hidden by the infix arithmetic notation includes
where and how memory is allocated;
how methods are resolved and how coercions are made
when the operands have different types
or when class hierarchies are involved;
what algorithms are used to perform the arithmetic operations
(irrelevant for machine integers, but potentially very important
details if you are multiplying huge matrices).
The infix notation is usually good for understanding the intent
of the code, but something more verbose can be
better for reasoning about performance
and for dealing with cracks in the abstractions.
Put concisely, C is good for making implementation details explicit
when implementation details matter.
</p>

<p>Viewed in this light, C's omission of certain conveniences
such as namespaces, overloading and generics is actually a feature,
not a bug.
Figuring out what any given piece of C code does tends to be
a straightforward process because of, and not despite, the fact
that it is verbose: everything that happens is explicit and functions and types can only have a
single definition which is easy to grep for.
I can't recall ever really having trouble diving into someone else's C code
or reading C code that I wrote a long time ago.
The same can't be said for Python, for example, where it can be
a real struggle to understand which method on which class gets called and how
and when and in what context.
Granted, you <i>can</i> obfuscate C code by abusing macros, doing
complicated runtime generics, or using cryptic names,
but even something like the rather dense
and idiosyncratic <a href="https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/">Pari/GP</a>
codebase is penetrable after a short familiarization process.
</p>

<h3>Educational value</h3>

<p>
Reason number four is that you will learn a lot in the process of writing C.
Implementing algorithms in C instead of a higher-level language
can lead to a deeper understanding since you have
to do more of the groundwork yourself. You will also probably have to
think things through more carefully; when I write Python, I can often
get away with implementing something half-broken and fixing it piecemeal,
but C more often forces me to be correct up-front.
</p>

<h2>Why you shouldn't use C</h2>

<p>Now on to the far more interesting case <i>against</i> C,
or rather, a fair and balanced evaluation of C's weaknesses.</p>

<h3>Mathematical understanding</h3>

<p>
Since we are talking about <i>mathematical</i> software, it is likely
that implementing <i>XYZ</i> actually involves solving two problems: understanding the
mathematics of <i>XYZ</i>, and translating that understanding
to concrete algorithms and code. If you don't understand the mathematics,
you might be better off exploring the problem
using a high-level language or a computer algebra system
and postponing a C implementation (if you need it) until
your mathematical understanding has crystallized.
If you decide to start a C project right away
to figure out the mathematics in parallel with the software development,
you will probably still want to use
another language for experimentation (more on this later).
Be prepared to continuously reevaluate your assumptions, and
expect having to rewrite code from scratch more than once.
</p>

<h3>Portability and deployment</h3>

<p>The following comments mainly apply to starting a new project
intended to be used by other people.</p>

<p>
In practice, the claims about C's amazing portability are somewhat
exaggerated.
As a C library maintainer,
you will have a lot of fun gradually discovering
new inconsistencies in build systems and standard library implementations
between different operating systems and hardware configurations.
You will probably run into the occasional rare compiler bug (though C might be
one of the better languages in this regard).
Over time, your header files will probably accumulate hundreds
of <tt>#ifdef</tt>s intended to work around compatibility problems
that may or may not still exist.</p>

<p>The large majority of your prospective users will probably
be unable or unwilling to
build and install your library from source, so
you will either have to distribute binaries yourself or
rely on distribution via third-party
package repositories such as those of the major Linux distributions.
In the interest of stability
or because of a lack of manpower,
such repositories typically keep software 1-10 years out of date.
(Yes, I once found <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>'s default Ubuntu configuration sporting a nearly 10 years old
Flint-1.6.)
In other words, you can't count on users having access to the latest features
and bugfixes
in your library, and it goes without saying that you should work
very hard to preserve backward compatibility.
I suppose this lag in deployment has one advantage for reproducible research: if
you submit a journal paper based on the cutting edge version of your software,
readers will probably still have access to that version in Debian LTS
by the time the publishing process completes three years later
(hi, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/toms">ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software</a>).</p>

<p>
A good idea for widespread deployment is to get your mathematical library into
<a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>.
SageMath is maintained by a large community
and tested on many platforms, and packages in SageMath are usually only several months out of date.
</p>

<p>Deploying software written in more modern programming languages is
typically easier since they have more sane build processes
and standard libraries that eliminate most of C's platform-dependent
headaches.
Nowadays many languages also have their own easy-to-use packaging systems
and centralized package repositories.
In practice, the best languages for portability and easy distribution
right now are probably (1) JavaScript (in the browser), and (2) Python.
Julia is not far behind, and in many respects better designed than Python,
but Python currently has the benefit of being preinstalled on many systems.
All of this being said,
<a href="https://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a> is a promising
alternative distribution method for C code which may change the equation,
especially if you think a browser-based interface makes more
sense than linking together libraries and running code
in the terminal in the traditional way.
</p>

<h3>Safety</h3>

<p>
C has a reputation of leading to buggy, crash-prone software
and disastrous security vulnerabilities.
Commonly criticized aspects of C include its
manual memory management, weak type system, and
deviously undefined or implementation-defined semantics.
This reputation is generally deserved,
though in C's defense, I think the problems often</p></div></div>

<h4><em>29.01.2021</em></h4>
<p>After recent <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/alerts/unescape_overflow.html">sudo vulnerability</a>
I was left wondering with obvious question: how such things could be unnoticed for almost 10 years?
Are they are really so hard to find, unlikely to be found by fuzzing, or just nobody attempted it?</p>
<p>I was curious whether this bug could have been discovered in reasonable time
using well-known <a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">afl</a> fuzzer.</p>
<p>First, obviously sudo is setuid binary. Running potentially bugged
binaries with random input as root isn’t safest idea. In order to avoid any potential
accidental system damage, I set up fresh virtual machine for this purpose.
I picked sudo 1.9.5.p1 for this test. afl is designed to generate output into file
or stdout, but we want to fuzz command line arguments. So we need to patch sudo ourselves
to ignore real argv and load it from stdin instead.</p>
<p>afl source helpfully provides appropiate function in <code>argv-fuzz-inl.h</code>, though author himself <a href="https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/afl-users/c/ZBWq0LdHBzw/m/zBlo7q9LBAAJ">isn’t so sure about usefulness of this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AFL doesn’t support argv
fuzzing, because TBH, it’s just not horribly useful in practice. There
is an example in experimental/argv_fuzzing/ showing how to do it in a
general case if you really want to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well.. does it? Let’s see.</p>
<p>Example supplied by <code>argv-fuzz-inl.h</code> reads NUL-separated arguments from stdin.
Note that sudo provides both <code>sudo</code> and <code>sudoedit</code> utilities in single binary,
so to test both we need to expose to fuzzer <code>argv[0]</code> as well. Code in
<code>argv-fuzz-inl.h</code> doesn’t do this, so it needs to be fixed:</p>
<pre><code>  int   rc  = 0; /* start at argv[0] */
</code></pre>
<p>In sudo itself patch is straightforward, just wire AFL_INIT_ARGV at the beginning of main:</p>

<p>Quick test shows that sudo/sudoedit selection doesn’t work correctly from testcases passed
in stdin, because for some reason it uses <code>__progname</code>. Quick workaround:</p>

<p>Sure enough, this is crash exploiting <code>sudoedit -s</code>. Given I ran 4 instances in parallel,
answer to the question from title is: around 2 hours of CPU time.</p>
<p>Yep. 2 hours of CPU time is enough to find critical security bug in widely used setuid utility.</p>
<p>Does nobody fuzzed sudo in the last decade, or, maybe sudo was tested but sudoedit was forgotten?
(honestly, before this I didn’t know that sudoedit existed). I guess the conclusion is that there still are serious bugs in widely used utilities that can be found by quick fuzzer run.</p>

<p>Currently, the most popular package manager in Python is Pip, which was introduced after Python 2.7.9. Before Pip, the predominant tool for package management was <code>disutils</code> or its third-party extension, <code>easy_install</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at all of these one by one and start with explaining what a package is here. In Python, a package is defined as a module that contains other modules or packages. These are the packages you import in your Python code. However, these are not the packages that are being discussed here. </p>
<p>The packages being mentioned here are the Distribution Packages, which are versioned archive files that contain modules, packages and other files that are important for the distribution of a particular release. </p>
<p>These archive files are what the users and you download when you install a package using Pip or any of the other package managers. Creating distributions is how you allow users to use your Python projects. </p>
<p>In this tutorial, you’ll first learn about the tools that are available to create Python distributions. Then you’ll learn about the tools you can use to install these distributions. In short, you’ll learn everything about maintaining Python packages that you’ll come across while working as a Data Scientist. </p>
<p>To start off this tutorial, you will begin with installing Python on your system, then you will learn about Python Package Index and discover more about disutils and how you can use it to register and upload your packages. Next up, you will learn about Setuptools and Easy Install, which is a third-party application that uses Setuptools. </p>
<p>You will finally learn about Pip and finally, a little bit about Conda, which comes pre-installed with Anaconda. Conda is much more powerful than Pip since it supports environment and package management, allowing you to create and delete environments. You can learn about how to install Anaconda from here.</p>
<h2 id="check-for-python"><a href="#check-for-python" aria-label="check for python permalink"></a>Check for Python</h2>
<p>Before proceeding with package management. The first step is to check whether you have Python installed on your system. Checking this is easy but depends on how you have installed Python. </p>
<p>If you installed Anaconda on Windows, then search for <code>Anaconda Prompt</code> in the Windows search and open the command prompt. In there, just type: </p>

<p>If you had installed and configured everything correctly, you should get the version of Python installed as output: </p>

<p>Otherwise, if you’re running the command on a command prompt or terminal without installing Python then you’ll get something like: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>Traceback <span>(</span>most recent call last<span>)</span><span>:</span>
  File <span>"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span><span>,</span> line <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>in</span> <span>&lt;</span>module<span>&gt;</span>
NameError<span>:</span> name <span>'python'</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> defined</code></pre></div>
<p>If you’re using an interactive notebook like Jupyter to use Python then you can use the same command with an exclamation mark at the start to check the version of Python installed on your system. </p>

<p>You’ll get the version of Python installed as an output, similar to how it ran on the anaconda prompt. The figure one shows the output in case of a Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickmccullum.com/images/blog/history-python-package-managers/jupyter.png" alt="Testing Your Python version in a Jupyter Notebook"></p>
<p>Fig 1: Jupyter Notebook Output</p>
<h2 id="python-package-index-pypi"><a href="#python-package-index-pypi" aria-label="python package index pypi permalink"></a>Python Package Index (PyPi)</h2>
<p>The Python Package Index (PyPi) is basically a huge third-party repository for Python packages. It is also known as the Cheese Shop and holds packages in the form of archives called sdists (source distributions) or alternatively in the form of precompiled Wheels. </p>
<p>PyPi allows you to version your Python package distribution, allowing you to update the repository as much as you would like. Anytime you update the metadata, a new version is updated on the PyPi repository. </p>
<p>The end user can search for relevant packages via keywords or the metadata of the packages. Thus, the PyPi repository acts like an index, which stores more than 113,000 Python packages. </p>
<p>PyPi is the repository that Pip searches through when you try to install a package using Pip or easy_install. It is an efficient distribution channel that even a novice developer can use to share their Python projects.</p>
<h2 id="disutils"><a href="#disutils" aria-label="disutils permalink"></a>Disutils</h2>
<p>Disutils is the standard tool for packaging in Python, it was developed by the core team and is included in standard Python libraries. It has two main commands for packaging and uploading data to PyPi. </p>
<p>The <code>register</code> command is used for sending metadata to PyPi while the <code>upload</code> command is used for uploading the submitted distribution files. </p>
<p>This tutorial will not be getting into details of how to package your Python project and upload it on PyPi. If you want to learn about how you can upload your Python project using disutils, read the official guide from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/distutils/packageindex.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>While disutils allows you to package your Python projects, it only offers very limited features. Disutils was built by the Python core team and only implements the core standards and the minimal necessary compilation. </p>
<p>For more advanced and useful features, there is setuptools, which offers extended compiler, package format and other support to effectively package Python projects. Since setuptools is a third party package, it does not come pre-installed with a Python library. </p>
<p>This tutorial will not discuss how to package Python projects with setuptools. To learn about using setuptools, you can follow this <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#developer-s-guide">developers guide</a> to using setuptools. The guide mentions all the important commands and keywords you will need to know to start using setuptools. </p>
<h3 id="easy-install"><a href="#easy-install" aria-label="easy install permalink"></a>Easy Install</h3>
<p>Before there was Pip, there was easy install, which was also a package manager for Python. Easy install allows for automatic downloads, builds, installs and updates for Python packages. </p>
<p>Using easy install was quite similar to Pip, you had to provide the URL, filename or PyPi project name to get the designated Python package. After you have entered the appropriate package name, easy install will try to get the latest available version of Python package for you. </p>
<p>Easy install recognizes files with extensions of .zip, .tar.bz2, .tar.gz and a few others. It also supports the already built .egg and .win2.exe distributions that are built using disutils.</p>
<p>Let’s highlight some of the basic commands of easy install. You can install a Python package by using the following easy install command: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>This is how you can install a Python package if you know its URL and package name: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install <span>-</span>f URL package_name</code></pre></div>
<p> Upgrading an installed package is pretty simple with easy install: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install <span>-</span><span>-</span>upgrade package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>If you want to install a specific version of the package, you can do so by including the version name: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install ‘package_name<span>==</span><span>1.3</span><span>.2</span>’</code></pre></div>
<p>You can revert back to a previous version of a package by entering the following command: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install package_name<span>==</span><span>=</span><span>1.2</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To uninstall a package, you use the following command to remove all references to that package: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install <span>-</span>m package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>After running the command, you can manually remove the .egg and any other associated files from your system. </p>
<p>To learn more about easy install and how you can easily manage your Python packages, head to the official documentation <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/easy_install.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pip"><a href="#pip" aria-label="pip permalink"></a>Pip</h2>
<p>Pip installs packages or Pip as it is commonly known is the most well-known Python package manager. It enables for convenient installation and maintenance of Python packages found in the Python Package Index (PyPi). </p>
<p>Python versions later than 2.7.9 come with a pre-installed pip. It was built on setuptools as well and was released in 2008 as a direct replacement of easy installs. One notable feature of pip when it was released was that it did not install packages as eggs, rather installed them through requirement files, allowing users to conveniently replicate environments. You can read more about the difference between pip and easy tools <a href="https://packaging.python.org/discussions/pip-vs-easy-install/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since pip was built to replace easy tools, most of the pip commands are very similar to easy installs. Let’s check some of the most common pip commands. </p>
<p>Here’s how you can install the latest version of a package using pip: </p>

<p>If you want to install a specific version of the package, you can do so by including the version name: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>pip install ‘package_name<span>==</span><span>1.3</span><span>.2</span>’</code></pre></div>
<p>You can easily upgrade a package using pip: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>pip install <span>-</span><span>-</span>upgrade package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>To uninstall a package:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>pip uninstall package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>A great feature of pip is that it supports the installation of packages by using a <code>requirements.txt</code> file. The text files include a list of packages and their version numbers required to run the project. </p>
<p>Here’s a sample <code>requirements.txt</code> file, which installs some machine learning related packages: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>tensorflow<span>==</span><span>1.7</span>

scipy

scikit<span>-</span>learn

opencv<span>-</span>python</code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s how you can run the requirements file to install all of these packages: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>pip install <span>-</span>r requirements<span>.</span>txt</code></pre></div>
<p>To learn more about requirements files, read <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files">this</a> official guide.</p>
<h3 id="conda"><a href="#conda" aria-label="conda permalink"></a>Conda</h3>
<p>Conda is included when you install Anaconda, which is a free and open source distribution of Python. Conda allows you to install packages and manage environments as well. It comes with a default environment <code>base</code>, which is activated whenever you use Python in Anaconda. </p>
<p>It is advised that you do not use the base environment and create your own to isolate your Python projects. This tutorial is just giving an honorary mention to Conda, as it is the leading Python package manager. There is a lot more to it and you can learn it from the official Conda <a href="https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments">tutorial</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/LLVM_Logo.svg" alt="LLVM"></p>
<center><small><small>This dragon image is owned by Apple Inc.</small></small></center>
<p>The Moritz Systems team has started a new contract on LLDB FreeBSD CPU target support and userland debugging improvements.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://lldb.llvm.org/">LLDB project</a> builds on libraries provided by
<a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> and <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> to provide a great
modern debugger. It uses the Clang ASTs and expression parser, LLVM JIT,
LLVM disassembler, etc so that it provides an experience that “just works”.
It is also blazing fast and more permissively licensed than GDB, the GNU Debugger.</p>
<p>LLDB is the default debugger in Xcode on macOS and supports debugging C,
Objective-C and C++ on the desktop and iOS devices and simulator.</p>
<p>FreeBSD includes LLDB, the debugger in the LLVM family, in the base
system. At present it has some limitations in comparison with the GNU
GDB debugger, and does not yet provide a complete replacement. It
relies on an obsolete plugin model in LLDB that causes growing
technical debt. This project aims to bring LLDB closer to a fully
featured replacement for GDB, and therefore for FreeBSD to feature a
modern debugger for software developers.</p>
<p>The legacy monolithic target support, still in use in non-x86 targets, executed the frontend and backend of the debugger
in the same process space. The modern LLDB
plugin approach, used on other supported targets, executes the
target process under a separate lldb-server process. This improves
reliability and simplifies the process / thread model in LLDB itself.
In addition, remote and local debugging will both be performed using
the same approach.</p>
<p>First, we are going to work on enhancing the FreeBSD support in LLDB, reusing the prior art already done for
FreeBSD LLDB/x86 and expanding it to other CPUs. We are going to switch all the CPUs to the new remote process
plugin framework and remove the old native-debugging process plugin altogether. Once the port is complete, we
would like to focus on reiterating all LLDB tests on ARM64 addressing the detected bugs as time permits, and
marking non-trivial issues as known failures. The verification of the remaining CPUs and the new remote process
plugin is expected to be deferred to the user community.</p>
<p>Next, we plan to implement the support for follow-fork and follow-vfork operations on par with the GNU GDB
support and cover this functionality with LLDB regression tests. We anticipate that we could implement follow-spawn
in one go, featuring enhanced support for tracing process events on NetBSD as well.</p>
<p>Next, we plan to implement the SaveCore functionality for FreeBSD, allowing users to create core dump files on
demand and enhance the regression testing of core files in LLDB, validating that they are operational on cross-OS and
cross-ABI basis.</p>
<p>Finally, we intend to update the FreeBSD manual to update it for the improved LLDB support.</p>
<p>The Project Schedule is divided into four milestones, each taking
approximately one month:</p>
<ul>
<li>M1 Switch all the non-x86 CPUs to the LLDB FreeBSD Remote-Process-Plugin</li>
<li>M2 Iteration over regression tests on ARM64 and fixing known bugs, marking the non-trivial ones for future work. Remove the old local-only Process-Plugin.</li>
<li>M3 Implement follow-fork and follow-vfork operations on par with the GNU GDB support. Cover the functionality with LLDB regression tests.</li>
<li>M4 Implement SaveCore functionality for FreeBSD and enhance the regression testing of core files in LLDB. Update the FreeBSD manual.</li>
</ul>
<p>This work is sponsored by <a href="https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/">The FreeBSD Foundation</a>.</p>

      <p><span>Robinhood has become a central player in the story of r/wallstreetbets and the rise of “meme stocks” like </span><a href="https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/gamestop-stock-rally-wallstreetbets-reddit/"><span>GameStop</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/wallstreetbets-reddit-amc-gme-stock-robinhood/"><span>AMC</span></a><span>. If you’ve been online this week, you know that a group of Reddit users turned amateur traders coordinated on social media to explode the share prices of low-valued companies, losing billions for hedge funds who were profiting off betting against them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Wallstreetbets largely made their investments through apps like Robinhood, TDAmeritrade and CashApp. GameStop and AMC’s share prices sunk this morning as Robinhood and other apps </span><a href="https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/robinhood-halts-trading-hides-searches-meme-stocks/"><span>blocked users</span></a><span> from buying the stocks boosted by Reddit and even hiding search results for them, “in light of recent volatility.” Naturally, given Robinhood’s steal-from-the-rich branding (their </span><a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/our-mission/"><span>mission statement</span></a><span> is “to democratize finance for all”), the company is now under fire for putting Wall Street’s interests over users’ and manipulating the market themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>What's Robinhood's origin story?</b></p>
<p><span>Robinhood was a pioneering no-commissions trading app, on which users can invest in stocks, ETFs, options and cryptocurrencies. The company was founded in 2013 in Menlo Park by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, who’d both previously worked on finance software for Wall Street. The pitch was that Robinhood would eliminate the bar of entry to the world of investing, by eliminating pricey brokers fees.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The app paved the way for a wave of free online investing platforms like Acorn, Webull, Stockpile, Invstr and more. Retail stock-trading has been booming during the pandemic, as bored quarantiners picked up stock trading as a hobby, with Robinhood picking up the most growth of any online broker. Robinhood’s </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b208cbbe-579c-4cbf-9358-01ae02b4381b"><span>valuation</span></a><span> hit $11 billion in August, up 50% from before the pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>How does Robinhood make money?</b></p>
<p><span>Since Robinhood doesn’t charge users to place trades or make any kind of comission, their business model relies on something called “payment for order flow.” Payments for order flow are the fees that Robinhood receives for executing their orders through third party firms called market-makers — high-frequency trading firms that hold a wide inventory of shares, serving as a kind of middle man between investing apps and the actual market. These firms pay public-facing broker platforms for the right to place their trades.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Robinhood also has a $5 per month premium service called Robinhood Gold, that gives users access to a $1,000 margin for trading, however, the company hasn’t revealed if the feature turns a profit.</span></p>
<p><b>How does “payment for order flow” work?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Every time a Robinhood user places an order, Robinhood sends the order one of their market-maker partners, who then pay Robinhood for the right to execute the order. Robinhood might only make a few cents off each order, but with 13 million users and </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02A-uoNvKyuBAaiIkOwE3Fs_MDV6w%3A1611858310611&amp;ei=hgETYKzhJIuY_Qa-v4bwAw&amp;q=robinhood+darts&amp;oq=robinhood+darts&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzICCAA6BAgjECc6CggAELEDEIMBEEM6BQgAEJECOgQIABBDOggIABCxAxCDAToECC4QQzoNCAAQsQMQgwEQFBCHAjoLCAAQsQMQgwEQkQI6BwgAEBQQhwI6BggAEBYQHlDZQ1iET2DqT2gAcAF4AIABiwGIAacMkgEDNi45mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesABAQ&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisvKCQoL_uAhULTN8KHb6fAT4Q4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5"><span>4.3 million trades on average per day</span></a><span> as of August, the cash adds up, hence the $11 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span>In the case of Robinhood, they make nearly half their revenue from just firms, Two Sigma Securities and Citadel Securities. Robinhood takes in one of the highest payment for order flow rates in the industry, at 17 cents per hundred shares for equity trades, and 58 cents for options, outpacing rivals like Charles Schwab which brings home 11 cents and 37 cents per hundred shares, respectively, for the same categories.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The business model of farming out client trading orders to high-speed, high-volume trading firms dates back to the very beginning of electronic trading. It was </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/payment-for-order-flow"><span>invented</span></a><span> by none other than Bernie Madoff, at his securities firm back in the 1980s, which would pay Fidelity or Charles Schwab to make their trades for them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Payment for order flow” is the backbone the retail stock trading industry — nearly every free investment app’s bottom line depends on it. However, perhaps unsurprisingly given its founder, Bloomberg </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-15/robinhood-gets-almost-half-its-revenue-in-controversial-bargain-with-high-speed-traders"><span>calls</span></a><span> it “one of the most controversial practices on Wall Street.” The system has been criticized for a lack of transparency and potential conflicts of interest, since broker platforms make more off some trades than others, specifically options trading. Robinhood made more than $111 million of its $180 million second quarter revenue off options trades. Tim Welsh, a CEO of wealth management firm Nexus Strategy, told </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/13/how-robinhood-makes-money-on-customer-trades-despite-making-it-free.html"><span>CNBC</span></a><span> that retail trading apps “without a doubt” steer customers towards options trades. The company, however, put more checks on its options trading this summer, after a 20-year-old Robinhood user committed suicide, after believing he’d lost $730,000 (the interface made it confusing to tell the difference between his negative buying power and his actual account balance, which was positive).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Understanding the backlash</b></p>
<p><span>Since some see “payment for order flow” as anti-consumer and Wall Street-friendly, the app’s “for the people” ethos was already </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgYd5Hm7Eb0&amp;ab_channel=BloombergMarketsandFinance"><span>under scrutiny</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, the app’s mission statement is coming back duly to haunt them. Robinhood says in banning GameStop trades, that it was simply trying to tamp down a speculative frenzy. But Reddit investors —&nbsp;who frame themselves as class warriors, who are literally redistributing wealth from hedge funds to regular people and teaching Wall Street a lesson about market manipulation — claim the company is doing Wall Street’s bidding.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Soundbites and screenshots of interviews in which Robinhood’s founders </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c3ed6758-e51c-48b1-b6a6-a17ccb265b28"><span>recount their origin story</span></a><span> of being disenchanted with Wall Street and inspired by Occupy Wall Street are&nbsp;</span><a href="https://twitter.com/tonytula/status/1354843970405355520"><span>circulating</span></a><span> on Twitter. High profile figures as diverse as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ted Cruz, entrepreneur Mark Cuban and rapper JaRule have called out Robinhood for undermining free trade</span></p>
<p><span>While many other investment apps made the same call, Robinhood is taking much of the heat. Within hours of blocking GameStop trades, Robinhood was hit with a class action lawsuit, filed in New York on Thursday, </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/536320-class-action-lawsuit-filed-against-robinhood-for-restricting-trading"><span>alleging</span></a><span> that the company “deprived their customers of the ability to use their service,” in an effort “to manipulate the market for the benefit of people and financial intuitions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the meantime, Reddit investors are boycotting Robinhood on principal —&nbsp;and desperately seeking any alternative platform that will let them hit “Buy” on Gamestop, AMC and others. As of late this afternoon, Robinhood competitors WeBull and Public have removed restrictions and are freely trading the “meme stocks” once again.</span></p>
<hr>

<p><span></span>Over on the Apple App Store, despite reports on social media that users were bombarding the app with one-star reviews, Robinhood's rating (and total rating count) remain up and to the right:</p>

<p>It's a different story on Google, where the app has tanked in the Google Play App Store:</p>

      

      
      <h3>About the Data:</h3>
      <p>
        Thinknum tracks companies using the information they post online, jobs, social and web traffic, product sales, and app ratings, and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue, and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Oh, what a January it was. One incident after another has <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2021/01/25/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-industry-where-this-regularly-happens/">shown the public in the US</a> (and <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2021/01/25/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-industry-where-this-regularly-happens/">other countries</a>) that they are conducting all their conversations, public discourse, collaboration and transactions on <strong><a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2021/01/15/open-source-communities/">platforms that are owned by others</a></strong>, and can be shut down at any moment. It is a sort of digital Feudalism, and people are starting to realize that the “real owners” can show up and stop the game any time they want. Whether it’s ad-supported “Free” social platforms booting entire communities from their platforms for wrong speech, or hedge-fund-supported “Free” trading platforms closing down entire stock trades for wrong trades, the story here is that “free” often isn’t. The owners are the ones who pay the bills, and they also play in the casino.</p>
<p><strong>Social Platforms</strong></p>
<p>As the year began, various sectors of the American political landscape became alarmed at <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/01/16/big-tech-and-censorship">Big Tech and their coordinated censorship of free speech</a>, after Parler was shut down by Google, Apple, and even Amazon. A few days later, millions of WhatsApp users were spooked by the company apparently changing its terms of service, leading <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9183553/WhatsApp-loses-MILLIONS-users-rivals-Telegram-Signal-ahead-privacy-policy-update.html">millions to jump ship</a> and move to Signal or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/telegram-hits-500-million-users-after-whatsapp-backlash-2021-1">Telegram</a>, which helped it reach <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/telegram-crosses-500-million-monthly-active-users-some-25-million-joined-in-last-72-hours-7143792/">half a billion users</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Trading Platforms</strong></p>
<p>Not to be outdone, the financial industry had its own version of that this past week. Online communities 2 million strong, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/28/gamestop-fun-turns-deadly-serious-reddit-wallstreetbets">united and coordinated their purchase of GameStop and AMC Entertainment</a> shares to drive the price up and squeeze the hedge funds who had a massive short-selling position, forcing them to buy the stocks back to cover their positions and drive the stock price even higher. In short, the public organized on Reddit, noticed that hedge funds had taken massive short positions totaling 140% of all outstanding stock, and cleaned them out with one continuous, coordinated action. Melvin Capital was given emergency infusions of $2B, which evaporated quickly, and they were left holding the short end of the stick.</p>
<p>But what happened next was a “hold my beer” analogue in the financial industry of what we saw in the social media industry. All of a sudden, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/webull-blocks-gamestop-amc-transactions-stock-market-robinhood-1565172">Robin Hood, WeBull and other “no fee” stock trading apps blocked any further purchases of the stock</a>, forcing the buyers to “unwind their position” (i.e. sell it) to pretty much the only game in town: the very hedge funds who needed to cover their position before Friday, when many of their margin loans or put options got called. In fact, trading was halted even on other hyped stocks, such as AMC and even Nokia! [1]</p>
<p><strong>Those who pay the bills control the music</strong></p>
<p>All of a sudden, the fourth wall was broken, and the public got a peek behind the curtain. The hedge funds are the ones who pay the bills at Robin Hood: despite its name, Robin Hood makes its money by selling trading data of the retail investors, to hedge funds who get to take advantage and trade against it. When the shoe was suddenly on the other foot, these hedge funds must have placed some calls to the management at Robin Hood and WeBull and reminded them who pays the bills. “If you don’t let us cover those shorts by Friday, your platform will go bankrupt too.” Suddenly people realized something about these “free” markets: they’re actually <em>owned</em> by entities whose buddies play in the casino, and when push comes to shove and you take the other side of the transaction, they won’t let you bankrupt them, no matter how many of you there are.</p>
<p>The same goes for the “free” social networks and media that is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch/n2H8wx1aBiQ">supported by advertisers</a>. They – or their algorithms – always select for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent">the content that will make them the most money</a>, regardless of <strong><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224">their effect on society</a></strong>.<br>
</p>
<p>Whether you’re winning too much against the house at the casino, or you’re saying the wrong things on stage at an event, the pretense of “free speech” or “free trade” disappears for those who break the fourth wall.</p>
<p><strong>How we as as society can solve these problems</strong></p>
<p>Within the same day, Robin Hood was hit with a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robinhood-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-after-halting-gamestop-stock">class action lawsuit</a> for their actions. But State action is just a band-aid on the real problem. While the government argues over whether to break up <a href="https://observer.com/2020/10/house-democrat-antitrust-amazon-facebook-google-breakup/">Facebook, Amazon and Google</a>, and federal courts argue about whether to Apple should <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-google-alphabet-telegram-app-store-2021-1">kick Telegram out of its app store</a>, the <em>libertarian</em> solution has been in front of us the whole time: <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2021/01/15/open-source-communities/">build open source platforms that are <em>not</em> owned by a select few elites</a>.</p>
<p>That is what cryptocurrency can bring about. The old way is to sell shares to investors who urge you to own the whole platform, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-competition-is-for-losers-1410535536">build a monopoly and eliminate competition</a>, as Peter Thiel did with Facebook. The new way is selling tokens, so the network be <a href="https://continuations.com/post/187279569830/is-ethereum-the-aol-of-crypto">owned by the participants themselves</a>, after the founders sold their tokens in the initial sale. This ability to release currencies owned by the community is one of the <strong><a href="http://intercoin.org/applications">many applications of Intercoin</a></strong>.</p>

January 28, 2021 | https://thesoloadmin.com/exploring-my-bashrc-in-2021/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thesoloadmin.com/exploring-my-bashrc-in-2021/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>I read a great <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/bashrc-VS-profile-VS-bash_profile/">post</a> on HN written by Lei Mao talking about the differences between the various "profile" scripts - .bashrc, .profile, .bash_profile - and it made me realize just how long it's been since I looked at my personal Bash profile. I figure the beginning of the year is as good a time as any to take a walk through my personal .bashrc file and see if I can even remember what everything does ;) If you'd like a copy to follow along or for your own personal use, here you go - my <a href="https://thesoloadmin.com/uploads/bashrc">bashrc</a>. </p><p>I want to start with a couple of caveats - first, I'm sure my profile isn't nearly as interesting or cutting-edge as some others. Yes, it's kind of simple, but I've been using it for almost 7 years now and it's performed solidly. Second, in order to use it on your box you will need to install a couple of applications (we'll go over those below). Finally, I'm a Debian guy and so is my profile; it should work on the most recent Debian-based distros including Ubuntu, but YMMV (if I can find my old Gentoo .bashrc I'll write it up in a separate article).</p><p>Ok, so let's jump right in!</p><p>First off, a couple of comments and then we set the prompts - green and blue and "$" for regular users, red and blue and "#" for root. As you can see from the <code>debian_chroot</code> reference, this section is a leftover from the original Debian file:</p><figure><pre><code># Matt's .bashrc
# System Requirements: color-capable terminal

if [ $EUID -eq 0 ]; then
	PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;31m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]\[\033[01;34m\] [\w]\[\033[00m\]\$ '
else	
	PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]\[\033[01;34m\] [\w]\[\033[00m\]\$ '
fi

# If this is an xterm set the title to user@host:dir
case "$TERM" in
xterm*|rxvt*)
    PS1="\[\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h: \w\a\]$PS1"
    ;;
*)
    ;;
esac
</code></pre><figcaption>Configure the Prompt</figcaption></figure><p>Next, I like my terminals to have a lot of color. By aliasing some commands and using <code>dircolors</code> and the application grc I can add color to some of the commands I use most frequently:</p><figure><pre><code># Alias grep to egrep and configure color output and line numbers
alias grep="egrep --color=always -n"

# Colorize output from ls
export LS_OPTIONS='--color=auto'
eval "`dircolors`"
alias ls='ls $LS_OPTIONS'
alias ll='ls $LS_OPTIONS -l'
alias l='ls $LS_OPTIONS -lA'

#Configure grc to provide colorized output for system commands
GRC=`which grc`
alias colourify="$GRC -es --colour=auto"
alias netstat='colourify netstat'
alias ping='colourify ping'
alias traceroute='colourify traceroute'
alias dig='colourify dig'
alias df='colourify df'
alias mount='colourify mount'
alias ps='colourify ps'
</code></pre><figcaption>Colorful Output</figcaption></figure><p>Next up, due to my tendency to work long hours and general brain fuzziness, I set up some bumper rails for myself:</p><figure><pre><code># Alias commands for safety
alias rm='rm -i'
alias cp='cp -i'
alias mv='mv -i'</code></pre><figcaption>Safety Bumpers</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, I added two other function aliases that I found myself using frequently - rsync-over-SSH and using the <code>pandoc</code> command to read Markdown files in the terminal:</p><figure><pre><code># Create rsync-over-SSH function command, using SSH port tcp/22222.
function rsynssh() {
	rsync -r -a -v -e "ssh -p 22222" --progress $1 $2
}

# Create a function to read Markdown files in the terminal 
function rmd() {
	pandoc $1 | lynx -stdin
}</code></pre><figcaption>Function aliases</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wanting to recreate my .bashrc on your system, you will need to install the applications grc, rsync, and pandoc (I'm assuming SSH is already installed):</p><pre><code>apt-get install grc rsync pandoc</code></pre><p>It's not flashy and it may not win any awards, but it's one of the fundamental tools in my toolkit. Anytime I'm building a new server, after setting up my .ssh directory and <code>authorized_keys</code> file, I install the helper apps and copy over my .bashrc. If nothing else, feel free to use my example to build a bigger and better profile to suit your daily admin needs.</p>

In an <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/heres-2020-democrats-differ-gun-control/story?id=62970498" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>ABC News analysis</u></span></a> of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary field and their stances on gun control, a common trope reveals itself: the progressives limit their gun policies to popular, common-sense restrictions, such as waiting periods and registries, and the moderates favor large, sweeping actions such as nationwide gun buybacks. </span></p><p id="viewer-ao6rs"><span>This was best exemplified in the standard-bearers for each faction of the Democratic Party: moderate President Joe Biden turned gun buybacks and a complete ban on assault weapons into a <a href="https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>cornerstone</u></span></a> of his campaign, and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), the progressive, has scorned the “unconstitutional” idea of policies like buybacks, wrenching praise even from outlets like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bernie-sanders-gun-buyback-confiscation-iowa-rally" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Fox News</u></span></a>. </span></p><p id="viewer-81hkr"><span>The rise of the Progressives has undoubtedly changed the face of American politics for a good long while. The Progressives, who represent one of the leftmost factions of the modern American political scene, have many <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/why-socialism-is-back" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>openly socialist</u></span></a> members, as well as others aligned with members of modern leftist organizations. One unexpected side effect of the growth of this new faction is the increased presence of gun owners and firearm advocates that sing the praises of guns from a very left-leaning perspective. </span></p><p id="viewer-d4lvi"><span>Much of the far-left approaches gun politics from a Marxist perspective. They view attempts to limit gun ownership and other restrictions on firearms as attempts to disarm the working class. Progressive firearm proponents view gun ownership rights as they view most policies: through the lens of class. In their eyes, a gun-less population is at the mercy of a government with a “monopoly on violence,” as one leftist puts it in an interview with <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/gy5ex9/the-leftist-argument-against-gun-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Vice Magazine</u></span></a>. They argue that their primary rival, the far-right, has access to guns, so <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/11/how-liberal-gun-owners-see-2020-self-defense-is-self-care.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>they should, too</u></span></a>. </span></p><p id="viewer-e4a02"><span>The far-left has a long, proud tradition of being pro-firearm. Nowhere is this more true than in the US. Take the Black Panther Party—the famous (or infamous) Black Power group that was founded as a pushback to the widespread anti-Black violence in Civil Rights-era America. The group was infamous for their prolific use of firearms and their <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/03/black-panther-party-revolution-fred-hampton" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>socialist beliefs</u></span></a>—so much so that they scared then-California Governor Ronald Reagan into passing some of the <a href="https://www.history.com/news/black-panthers-gun-control-nra-support-mulford-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>strictest gun control</u></span></a> legislation the US had ever seen.</span></p><p id="viewer-5u6rh"><span>As leftism has become more prominent in modern US politics, pro-gun groups in the spirit of the Black Panthers have emerged. Take the <a href="https://socialistra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Socialist Rifle Association</u></span></a>, a far-left firearms group founded in Wichita, Kansas, which has a membership of 10,000 people across 33 states. Also hailing from Kansas is the group <a href="https://www.redneckrevolt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Redneck Revolt</u></span></a>, an anti-capitalism, pro-Second Amendment group of working-class people with chapters in 30 states. </span></p><p id="viewer-46sie"><span>These gun groups all have several characteristics that decidedly separate leftist gun enthusiasts from their right-wing counterparts. For one, a common theme among these organizations is the <a href="https://www.flatlandkc.org/news-issues/left-wing-groups-take-up-arms-in-name-of-abolitionist-john-brown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>veneration of John Brown</u></span></a>, a fervent, radical abolitionist from the 1850s whose fight against slavery was so rabid that it led him to kill several slave masters during Bleeding Kansas, and, alongside a band of likeminded abolitionists, to unsuccessfully raid a federal munitions site in Harper’s Ferry, Virginia. It comes as no surprise that Brown, a native Kansan, would appeal to groups that were founded in Kansas, where Brown is something of a local hero (<a href="https://www.voanews.com/usa/debate-still-rages-over-controversial-american-abolitionist-john-brown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>for some</u></span></a>). </span></p><p id="viewer-bppfi"><span>Another characteristic unique to far-left gun groups is their protectiveness of the LGBTQ+ community. Transgender Pride flags are common affixtures to the firearms of groups like the Socialist Rifle Association (SRA), 33% of whose members are members of the LGBTQ+ community. In fact, members of the leftist Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club have a history of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/22/if-others-have-rifles-well-have-rifles-why-leftist-groups-are-taking-up-arms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>showing up</u></span></a> to LGBTQ+ Pride marches in order to ‘defend’ the paraders from far-right organizations that tend to make themselves present at such events. </span></p><p id="viewer-eu8kc"><span>This new paradigm of socialist groups being pro-firearm has deep roots, but this entrance into the mainstream is very new. The SRA and Redneck Revolt were founded in 2018 and 2016, respectively, and their memberships have proliferated across the nation in the years since. The slow march of radical leftist gun groups is a political trend that threatens to upend the normal classification of the parties and their stances on gun control. One thing is for certain, however: the Second Amendment has nothing to lose but its stereotypes. </span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

	<h2>How the software becomes unmaintainable? – a practical example</h2>
<p>(<em>Everyday Code – instead of keeping our knowledge in a README.md let’s share it with the internet)</em></p>



<p>An ugly, sometimes over neglected truth of the industry is that the software that we work on does not become unmaintainable and tedious and difficult to work with overnight. It becomes like this with every change we introduce. While each individual change might not be “that bad” when they pile up we no longer have a well decoupled, maintainable system. We end up with a mess, which we than re-write with a new framework, a new team, new concepts and architecture just trying to do better. But the problem most of the time is in the single change that we do today – is it making the software system better or worse?</p>



<p>This article is about a practical example of today and how we got to stop it.</p>



<h2>To better or worse </h2>



<p>When developing software incrementally we introduce changes. There are basically two options – the new changes would make the system better or they will make it worse. </p>



<p>Here is the change from today</p>



<pre><code>--- a/file1.rb

<p>The logic is not important. We basically get the video for a material. What’s important is the code is practically the same in all 3 places. 4 calls in three files and they are all the same. </p>



<p>In the past I was leading a class in Software Development. One thing I tried to teach each student was:</p>



<blockquote><p>When you copy and paste you introduce a bug. That’s a fact of the industry.</p></blockquote>



<p>The reason is that once you copy/paste you would have to support the same logic in more than one place and you would simply forget about the second place the next time you would like to change the logic. It might not be you, it might be colleagues working years from now on the same code, but they will forget to change both places. That’s the problem with redundancy. </p>



<div><div>
<blockquote><p>Remove the redundancy, and you remove most of the bugs</p></blockquote>
</div></div>



<h2>How did we stop it?</h2>



<p>Simple review. Just ask a second person to check your commit. This simple review process protects you from a large portion of the other bugs that are still left after you’ve cleared all the redundancies (of course).</p>



<h2>Enjoy</h2>



<p>The code in question is part of the logic delivering these instructions. See how the video is displayed. That’s what the feature was about. Enjoy.</p>

        <article>
          <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine">plotnine</a> is a data visualisation package for Python based on the grammar of graphics, created by Hassan Kibirige. Its API is similar to <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>, a widely successful R package by <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/authors.html">Hadley Wickham and others</a>.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I’m a staunch proponent of ggplot2. The underlying grammar of graphics is accompanied by a consistent API that allows you to quickly and iteratively create different types of beautiful data visualisations while rarely having to consult the documentation. A welcoming set of properties when doing exploratory data analysis.</p>

<p>I must admit that I haven’t tried every data visualisation package there is for Python, but when it comes to the most popular ones, I personally find them either
convenient but limited (<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html">pandas</a>),
flexible but complicated (<a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>), or
beautiful but inconsistent (<a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">seaborn</a>). Your mileage may vary. plotnine, on the other hand, shows a lot of promise.
I estimate it currently has a 95% coverage of ggplot2’s functionality, and it’s still actively being developed.
All in all, as someone who uses both R and Python, I’m very pleased to be able to transfer my ggplot2 knowledge to the Python ecosystem.</p>

<p>I figured that plotnine could use a good tutorial so that perhaps more Pythonistas would give this package a shot.
Instead of writing one from scratch, I turned to the, in my opinion, best free tutorial for ggplot2: <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a> by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, published by O’Reilly Media in 2016.</p>

<p><img src="https://datascienceworkshops.com/assets/img/blog/plotnine-grammar-of-graphics-for-python/cover.png"></p>

<p>All I had to do was translate<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> the visualization chapters (chapter 3 and 28) from R and ggplot2 to Python and plotnine.
I would like to thank Hadley, Garrett, and O’Reilly Media, for granting me permission to do so.
Translating an existing text is quicker than writing a new one, and has the benefit that it becomes possible to compare both the syntax and coverage of plotnine to ggplot2.</p>

<p>However, while quicker, translating is not always straightforward.
I have tried to change as little as possible to the original text while making sure that the text and the code are still in sync.
In case any errors or falsehoods have been introduced due to translation, then I’m the one to blame.
For example, to the best of my knowledge, neither authors have made any claims about plotnine.
If you find such an error and think it is fixable, then it would be greatly appreciated if you’d let me know by <a href="https://github.com/datascienceworkshops/r4ds-python-plotnine/issues">creating an issue on Github</a>. Thank you.
The section numbers in this tutorial link back to the corresponding section of the original text, in case you want to compare them.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> Only this preface and the few footnotes scattered among the text are entirely mine.</p>

<p>This tutorial is also available as a <a href="https://github.com/datascienceworkshops/r4ds-python-plotnine/blob/master/output/r4ds-python-plotnine.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/datascienceworkshops/r4ds-python-plotnine/blob/master/output/r4ds-python-plotnine.Rmd">R notebook</a> in case you want to follow along.
If you clone the <a href="https://github.com/datascienceworkshops/r4ds-python-plotnine">Github repository</a> then you can find the notebooks in the <code>output</code> directory.
The <a href="https://github.com/datascienceworkshops/r4ds-python-plotnine/blob/master/README.md">README</a> contains instructions on how to run the notebooks.
The Jupyter notebook is also available on <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/datascienceworkshops/r4ds-python-plotnine/master?filepath=output%2Fr4ds-python-plotnine.ipynb">Binder</a>, but keep in mind that the interactive version may take a while to launch.</p>

<p>Without further ado, let’s start learning about plotnine!</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Jeroen</p>



<h2 id="31introduction"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#introduction-1">3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s mind
than any other device.” — John Tukey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This tutorial will teach you how to visualise your data using plotnine. Python has many packages for making graphs, but plotnine is one of the most elegant and most versatile. plotnine implements the <strong>grammar of graphics</strong>, a coherent system for describing and building graphs. With plotnine, you can do more faster by learning one system and applying it in many places.</p>

<p>If you’d like to learn more about the theoretical underpinnings of plotnine before you start, I’d recommend reading <a href="http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf">The Layered Grammar of Graphics</a>.</p>

<h3 id="311prerequisites"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#prerequisites-1">3.1.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prerequisites</h3>

<p>This tutorial focusses on plotnine. We’ll also use a little numpy and pandas for data manipulation. To access the datasets, help pages, and functions that we will use in this tutorial, import<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> the necessary packages by running this code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>plotnine</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span>
<span>from</span> <span>plotnine.data</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span>

<span>import</span> <span>numpy</span> <span>as</span> <span>np</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you run this code and get the error message <code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'plotnine'</code>, you’ll need to first install it<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>, then run the code once again.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>! pip install plotnine[all]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You only need to install a package once, but you need to import it every time you run your script or (re)start the kernel.</p>

<h2 id="32first-steps"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#first-steps">3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First steps</h2>

<p>Let’s use our first graph to answer a question: Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines? You probably already have an answer, but try to make your answer precise. What does the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency look like? Is it positive? Negative? Linear? Nonlinear?</p>

<h3 id="321the-mpg-dataframe"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#the-mpg-data-frame">3.2.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <code>mpg</code> DataFrame</h3>

<p>You can test your answer with the <code>mpg</code> DataFrame found in <code>plotnine.data</code>. A DataFrame is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and observations (in the rows). <code>mpg</code> contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 models of car.</p>

<p>Among the variables in <code>mpg</code> are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>displ</code>, a car’s engine size, in litres.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>hwy</code>, a car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg).
  A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high
  fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To learn more about <code>mpg</code>, open its help page by running <code>?mpg</code>.</p>

<h3 id="322creating-a-ggplot"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#creating-a-ggplot">3.2.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a ggplot</h3>

<p>To plot <code>mpg</code>, run this code<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> to put <code>displ</code> on the x-axis and <code>hwy</code> on the y-axis:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ggplot</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>=</span><span>mpg</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>\
<span>geom_point</span><span>(</span><span>mapping</span><span>=</span><span>aes</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>=</span><span>"displ"</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>=</span><span>"hwy"</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://datascienceworkshops.com/assets/img/blog/plotnine-grammar-of-graphics-for-python/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png"></p>

<p>The plot shows a negative relationship between engine size (<code>displ</code>) and fuel efficiency (<code>hwy</code>). In other words, cars with big engines use more fuel. Does this confirm or refute your hypothesis about fuel efficiency and engine size?</p>

<p>With plotnine, you begin a plot with the function <code>ggplot()</code>. <code>ggplot()</code> creates a coordinate system that you can add layers to. The first argument of <code>ggplot()</code> is the dataset to use in the graph. So <code>ggplot(data=mpg)</code> creates an empty graph, but it’s not very interesting so I’m not going to show it here.</p>

<p>You complete your graph by adding one or more layers to <code>ggplot()</code>. The function <code>geom_point()</code> adds a layer of points to your plot, which creates a scatterplot. plotnine comes with many geom functions that each add a different type of layer to a plot. You’ll learn a whole bunch of them throughout this tutorial.</p>

<p>Each geom function in plotnine takes a <code>mapping</code> argument. This defines how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties. The <code>mapping</code> argument is always paired with <code>aes()</code>, and the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> arguments of <code>aes()</code> specify which variables to map to the x and y axes. plotnine looks for the mapped variables in the <code>data</code> argument, in this case, <code>mpg</code>.</p>

<h3 id="323a-graphing-template"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#a-graphing-template">3.2.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A graphing template</h3>

<p>Let’s turn this code into a reusable template for making graphs with plotnine. To make a graph, replace the bracketed sections in the code below with a dataset, a geom function, or a collection of mappings.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ggplot(data=&lt;DATA&gt;) +\
&lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;(mapping=aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;))

<p>The rest of this tutorial will show you how to complete and extend this template to make different types of graphs. We will begin with the <code>&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;</code> component.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we
never expected to see.” — John Tukey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the plot below, one group of points (highlighted in red) seems to fall outside of the linear trend. These cars have a higher mileage than you might expect. How can you explain these cars?</p>

<p><img src="https://datascienceworkshops.com/assets/img/blog/plotnine-grammar-of-graphics-for-python/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png"></p>

<p>Let’s hypothesize that the cars are hybrids. One way to test this hypothesis is to look at the <code>class</code> value for each car. The <code>class</code> variable of the <code>mpg</code> dataset classifies cars into groups such as compact, midsize, and SUV. If the outlying points are hybrids, they should be classified as compact cars or, perhaps, subcompact cars (keep in mind that this data was collected before hybrid trucks and SUVs became popular).</p>

<p>You can add a third variable, like <code>class</code>, to a two dimensional scatterplot by mapping it to an <strong>aesthetic</strong>. An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot. Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points. You can display a point (like the one below) in different ways by changing the values of its aesthetic properties. Since we already use the word “value” to describe data, let’s use the word “level” to describe aesthetic properties. Here we change the levels of a point’s size, shape, and color to make the point small, triangular, or blue:</p>

<p>You can convey information about your data by mapping the aesthetics in …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-field="body">
<section name="898d"><div><div><h3 name="92f1" id="92f1">Silicon Valley hasn’t innovated since&nbsp;1978</h3><p name="8f6e" id="8f6e">I’m serious. Name one thing in computing that showed up after 1978 that wasn’t either an incremental improvement on a pre-1978 technology or a crappier but cheaper version of a pre-1978 technology. I’m not trying to produce sophistry here. There’s a huge difference in the level of novelty of original research in computing tech during the span 1940–1980 and the level of novelty in the same after 1980, &amp; it relates directly to economics.</p><p name="03e4" id="03e4">From 1940 to 1980, computer science was being done by folks with doctorates &amp; experience in other disciplines, funded by government money to do pure research &amp; moonshot shit — especially ARPA funding starting in the wake of Sputnik for ed-tech. When that funding dried up, so did productivity in original research, because the ability to continue to be employed depended on profitability in a consumer market (which means racing to market… which means avoiding risky detours).</p><p name="5abb" id="5abb">The exact same people have drastically different productivity levels with the two models. Kay at PARC in the 70s went from having seen a sketchpad demo to having a complete functioning live-editable GUI with network transparency in 10 years, because of government ed-tech money. In the early 80s, Kay moved to Atari &amp; tried to continue the kind of work he had been doing. And then he got laid off, and went to Apple, got laid off again. The work he started in the 70s has been treading water because short term profits can’t support deep research.</p><p name="2b49" id="2b49">This isn’t to say that what has happened since isn’t valuable. The computing technologies developed prior to 1980 have mostly become cheap enough that they have become accessible to a mass audience, in part because of iteration on manufacturing techniques, &amp; mostly because of cheap labor (in the form of fresh-out-of-college CS students who will write bad code for half of what you’d pay the PhDs to refuse to write bad code, and will work unpaid overtime if you give them a ball pit and a superiority complex). But, using 70s tech to make 60s tech bigger (ex., deep neural networks) isn’t innovation — it’s doing the absolute most obvious thing under the circumstances, which is all that can be defended in a context of short-term profitability.</p><p name="b094" id="b094">What armies of clerks were doing in the 30s was ‘computation’, sure, but it’s very different. The pointing devices we use, the look and feel of our UIs, and our UI metaphors haven’t changed since the 70s except in terms of resolution. Our network protocols haven’t much either.</p><p name="a323" id="a323">This is to say:</p><p name="73b3" id="73b3">Somebody who had used an Alto in 1979 could travel through time and sit down at a modern PC and know basically how to do most tasks — they would think of a modern PC as a faster but less featureful stripped down Alto clone, like the Star was. They could probably even code on it — they would have been familiar with UNIX shells &amp; C, &amp; with SGML-style markup. They would find it disappointingly awkard compared to Interlisp-D and Smalltalk environments they’re used to, but they could make it work.</p><p name="bae4" id="bae4">Meanwhile, to somebody from 1940, home computer tech of 1980 would be mind-blowing. Such a person, even if they were in computing, would not be familiar with the concept of a programming language (since stored program computers didn’t exist yet).</p><p name="abd5" id="abd5">The VC model ties into this difference. The best possible outcome, under the VC model, is that actual costs are low &amp; the VCs get wild profits in the short term, after which they sell their stakes &amp; don’t need to care anymore. The easiest &amp; most reliable way to do that is a ponzi scheme (or, to be more technically correct, the pyramid-selling of hype — in this case, to other, marginally less savvy investors). With enough cash floating around, you can keep a company that provides no service &amp; has no income afloat indefinitely, and everyone involved becomes a paper millionaire.</p><p name="19e5" id="19e5">The goal of ARPA from ’57 to ’78 was quite different: to encourage children to become engineers in order to have an edge in a high-tech hot-war that never really ended up coming, and to build tech that lets them bootstrap new tech more easily. Massive short-term losses in that. (It obviously didn’t exactly work: we did end up getting a lot of cheap engineers, but few of them had the background to be able to more-than-iteratively improve upon the tech they grew up on, even had they been allowed to by management.)</p><p name="0b05" id="0b05">The difference in development between the first 40 years of CS and the second 40 is absolutely not the result of the low-hanging fruit all being picked. The most interesting technical work is being done by individuals and small groups still. Important features &amp; useful tools that were well known in the late 70s are actually missing from modern tech because of gaps in education &amp; because having them prevents some avenues toward monetization. (Ex., you can’t live-edit software if the software is closed source.)</p><p name="647f" id="647f">I really hate the “silicon valley is a center of innovation” memeplex &amp; feel the need to inject some historical context whenever I see it. It’s weird, masturbatory, Wired Magazine bullshit &amp; it leads to the lionization of no-talent con artists like Steve Jobs. Making money &amp; making tech are very different skills, often fundamentally at odds: good tech is very often not profitable and the most profitable tech is just varying reframings of rentseeking. Very few people can do both well, and SV has a bias toward profit. Because of this, in most cases, the product isn’t actually the tech but the techwashing. Apple’s an excellent case in point. After they dropped the Apple ][ line, their main product was hype &amp; terminology stolen from PARC with a free underpowered home computer thrown in (for the low low price of 8 grand).</p><p name="f01a" id="f01a">In an environment where cash is king, when you can make bank on PR, it’s foolish to try to innovate — and the valley has learned this lesson better than it has learned anything else.</p></div></div></section>

		<p>This is just a short post about something I recently discovered in the Rust ecosystem:</p>
<p><code>Criterion</code> + <code>pprof</code> = 🔥</p>
<p>If you have a Medium subscription and want to support me, you can <a href="https://jibbow.medium.com/automatic-flamegraphs-for-benchmarks-with-criterion-f8e59499cc2a">read this post on Medium</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs">Criterion</a> is a well-known and often-used benchmarking framework in the Rust ecosystem.
If you’ve not yet heard of it, definitely check it out!</p>
<p>Since <code>v0.3</code>, Criterion supports <a href="https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/user_guide/profiling.html#implementing-in-process-profiling-hooks">in-process profiling hooks</a>.
They allow us to use a custom profiler while running benchmarks.
After registering a custom profiler, we can enable them by running the benchmark suite with the <code>--profile-time</code> flag.</p>
<p>Having hooks for a custom profiler for your benchmarks allows you to do <em>awesome</em> stuff, for example generating flamegraphs for every benchmark with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pprof"><code>pprof</code></a>.</p>

<p>One question I often ask myself when looking at benchmarks is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These numbers are great. But how can we do this faster? Where do we spend the most time?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question can often be answered by looking at flamegraphs.</p>
<p>Previously, I got my hands dirty using <a href="https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph"><code>cargo-flamegraph</code></a>, which is a really good tool on its own.
But the problem is that when using <a href="https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph"><code>cargo-flamegraph</code></a> with benchmarks, you will usually get some unnecessary clutter, e.g. the setup routine for your benchmark and the enclosing framework code from Criterion.</p>
<p>And here comes another cool Rust library into play: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pprof"><code>pprof</code></a> with the <code>flamegraph</code> feature!</p>
<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/pprof"><code>pprof</code></a> is a CPU profiler that can be used to profile specific parts of your program on Linux.
The best of all: It even supports generating flamegraphs with the feature flag <code>flamegraph</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s directly dive in and create a <code>pprof</code> integration for Criterion!</p>

<p>We will now create a custom profiler for <code>criterion</code> with <code>pprof</code> that will print flamegraphs for each benchmark.</p>
<p>First, add the following dependencies to your <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>[</span><span>dev</span><span>-</span><span>dependencies</span><span>]</span>
<span>pprof</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.3"</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"flamegraph"</span><span>]</span> <span>}</span>
<span>criterion</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.3"</span>
<span># criterion-macro = "0.3"  # optional, if you use custom test frameworks</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Now create a new file in your <code>benches/</code> folder. Let’s call it <code>perf.rs</code>.
Here we will implement our new <code>FlamegraphProfiler</code>.</p>
<p>The interface for implementing a custom profiler is actually quite straight-forward.
We only need to implement the <a href="https://docs.rs/criterion/*/criterion/profiler/trait.Profiler.html"><code>criterion::profiler::Profiler</code></a> trait from Criterion and we are good to go.</p>

</span><span>/// Also see [the Criterion documentation on this][custom-profiler].
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// ## Example on how to enable the custom profiler:
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// ```
</span><span>/// mod perf;
</span><span>/// use perf::FlamegraphProfiler;
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// fn fibonacci_profiled(criterion: &amp;mut Criterion) {

</span><span>///
</span><span>/// fn custom() -&gt; Criterion {

</span><span>/// }
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// criterion_group! {

</span><span>/// ```
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// The neat thing about this is that it will sample _only_ the benchmark, and not other stuff like
</span><span>/// the setup process.
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// Further, it will only kick in if `--profile-time &lt;time&gt;` is passed to the benchmark binary.
</span><span>/// A flamegraph will be created for each individual benchmark in its report directory under

<h3>The Battle of the Indus: Genghis Khan at India’s Doorstep</h3>
<p>799 years ago, in the year 1221, the great Mongol conqueror <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Genghis-Khan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genghis Khan</a> [1] stood victorious at the western bank of the Indus river with 50,000 soldiers, having just defeated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jalal_ad-Din_Mingburnu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jalal-ad-Din</a> [2], the Shah of Khwarazm. Jalal-ad-Din’s army was completely destroyed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_the_Indus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this battle</a> [3], which took place near the town of Kalabagh in Punjab.</p>
<p>Across the river lay the richest country in the history of the world: India. A land of fabulous wealth. A land that accounted for over <a href="https://archive.org/details/contoursworldeco00madd/page/n393/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a third</a> of the entire world’s GDP [4]. A land that would-be invaders fantasized about. A land that was groaning under foreign, Islamic occupation: Northern India was ruled at the time by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iltutmish" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shams ud-Din Iltutmish</a> [5], the third sultan of the Turkic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mamluk_dynasty_(Delhi)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mamluk dynasty</a> [6], which was founded by Qutb al-Din Aibak in 1206.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>A few months before this battle, Genghis Khan had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mongol_conquest_of_the_Khwarazmian_Empire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conquered</a> [7] Jalal-ad-Din’s vast Empire of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khwarazmian_dynasty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khwarazm</a> [8]. Khwarazm was a Turkic Empire that ruled Iran. It consisted of Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, parts of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and much of north-western India, which is today’s Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Genghis Khan sacked and destroyed the great cities of Samarkand, Bukhara, Nishapur, Otrar, and Gurganj. He laid the Islamic heartland to waste. His army burned Islamic libraries and replaced mosques with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070512201848/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/mongols/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buddhist temples</a> [9]. It devastated Iran and Afghanistan. And he pursued Jalal-ad-Din all the way from Uzbekistan into western India.</p>
<p>Jalal-ad-Din had the same Turkic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mamluk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mamluk</a> [10] ancestry as the invaders who ruled northern India at the time, which is why he hoped that Iltutmish would grant him asylum in India. He was a foreign Turkic invader who ruled Iran, the same way that Iltutmish was a foreign Turkic invader who ruled India. The Iranian people do not look upon Jalal-ad-Din as one of their own, the same way the people of India do not see Iltutmish as one of their own. Or Babur, Akbar, Aurangzeb, or Bahadur Shah Zafar.</p>
<p>So, being granted refuge in India was Jalal-ad Din’s only hope.</p>
<p>He had chosen an excellent defensive position for the battle with the Mongols. It was flanked by high mountains on two sides and the great river on the third side. He had prayed fervently for deliverance, but the miracle never came. His army proved no match for the polytheistic warriors who came from 2000 miles away. It was swept away and slaughtered to the last man.</p>
<h3>Genghis Khan Turns Back</h3>
<p>Genghis Khan watched as Jalal-ad-Din frantically rode his horse across the Indus in a desperate bid to escape. All he had to do was cross the river. If he crossed the river, not only would he be able to kill his enemy, he would also have the opportunity to smash the Delhi sultanate and conquer the world’s richest country.</p>
<p>He had at his command the Mongol army, which he had personally forged into the greatest and deadliest fighting force in the world. It had already done the unthinkable by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mongol_conquest_of_China" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conquering China</a> [11] and <a href="https://www.historytoday.com/archive/genghis-khan-takes-beijing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capturing Beijing</a> [12]. It had conquered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Qara_Khitai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qara Khitai Empire</a> [13] in Central Asia. It had conquered the enormous Empire of Khwarazm. This was an unstoppable, all-conquering war machine. The Delhi Sultanate was no match for it.</p>
<p>Genghis Khan is the greatest conqueror in recorded history. He did not lose a single military campaign in his life. He could simply have walked into India, made short work of the Delhi Sultanate, and become the wealthiest man in the world.</p>
<p>Instead, to make a long story short, he turned back. He spurned the heaven-sent, once-in-a-lifetime chance to conquer India. He chose to retreat all the way back to Mongolia. He did leave behind administrators and soldiers to govern Afghanistan. These were the ancestors of today’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hazaras" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hazaras</a> [14].</p>
<h3>Theories: Not Quite Right</h3>
<p>His decision to not invade India has perplexed historians for centuries. It remains an enduring mystery to this day. There are a number of theories about why he made that decision.</p>
<p>Biographies of one of his <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Yelu-Chucai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chinese advisers</a> [15] claim that a <a href="https://www.historytoday.com/chinggis-khan-versus-unicorn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking unicorn</a> [16] appeared to Genghis at <a href="https://uzbekistan.travel/en/o/iron-gates-sogdiana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the border of Uzbekistan and India</a> [17] (present-day Afghanistan), and instructed him to return early from India.</p>
<p>Some historians, such as the Persian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Minhaj-i-Siraj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Juzjani</a> [18], believe that India’s hot climate was <a href="https://www.historytoday.com/chinggis-khan-versus-unicorn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too harsh</a> for the Mongol army [16], which was accustomed to fighting in cold weather. This problem with this theory is that the Mamluks, who established the Delhi Sultanate in 1206, also came from a cold climate. Future Islamic invaders of India such as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Timur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Timur</a> [19] and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Babur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Babur</a> [20] would also come from cold climates. If they could invade India successfully, why couldn’t the far superior Mongols?</p>
<p>It’s therefore clear that these theories don’t hold up to close scrutiny.</p>
<h3>Cultural Affinity with India?</h3>
<p>And then there are claims that Genghis Khan refused to invade India for religious reasons. Mongolia’s ancient polytheistic belief system, which is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tengrism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tengrism</a> [21] in English, has interesting commonalities with Hinduism. And Buddhism, which is another form of Hinduism, has had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Buddhism_in_Mongolia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a presence</a> [22] in Mongolia for nearly two thousand years. His grandson <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kublai-Khan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kublai Khan</a> [23] would go on to adopt Buddhism as the Mongol Empire’s de-facto state religion. Most Mongols today are Buddhists.</p>
<p>Because of this, it is speculated that he may not have wanted to spill blood in the land that gave birth to Hinduism and Buddhism. This is possible, but it’s also true that by conquering India, he would have freed the land of the genocidal barbarians who had not only destroyed Buddhism in Afghanistan, but were also doing their best to eradicate Hinduism from the rest of India.</p>
<h3>The Key to Understanding the Conqueror and His Motivations</h3>
<p>So how do we deduce the reasons for his decision? To do that, we must understand him as a person, and as a leader.</p>
<p>Now, Genghis Khan is an enigmatic personality. Despite his immense fame and reputation, we don’t really know a lot about him. He did not seek to explain his actions and decisions. He did not leave behind a memoir or account of his career, the way <a href="https://www.livius.org/articles/person/caesar/caesar-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Julius Caesar</a> [24], <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meditations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marcus Aurelius</a> [25], or <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3567/3567-h/3567-h.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> [26] did.</p>
<p>What we know about him comes from two sources. The first is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Secret_History_of_the_Mongols" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Secret History of the Mongols</a> [27], which was written after his death. And the second is the accounts of the people he conquered. The accounts of his enemies.</p>
<p>These sources tell us about the man’s deeds, but not much about his motivations. We know what he did, but we don’t know why he did those things.</p>
<p>To understand why he decided against invading India, we need to gain an insight into his motivations. And to do that, we must examine his life and his career, because therein lie the clues to what motivated him. Let’s do that.</p>
<h3>The Old Enemy: China</h3>
<p>Genghis Khan was born in Mongolia, sometime around the year 1158. His birth name was Temujin. His father <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yesugei" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yesugei</a> [28], the leader of the Borjigin tribe, was a wealthy and powerful man.</p>
<p>The Mongols were a nomadic people, and the Mongolia that Temujin was born in was a disunited, fragmented nation whose tribes were perpetually in conflict. This conflict was engineered by the Empire to the south of Mongolia: China.</p>
<p>Chinese rulers collected tribute from the Mongolian tribes and encouraged rivalries between them. Whenever the Mongols tried to unite, the Chinese launched punitive expeditions against them, either enslaving them, or killing them. One of Temujin’s relatives, the Khan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ambaghai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambaghai</a> [29], who attempted to create a confederation of several tribes, was captured, brought to China, and executed by crucifixion and dismemberment a few years before Temujin was born. The Chinese kept the Mongols fighting each other for centuries in this manner.</p>
<h3>Temujin: Genghis Khan’s Early Life and Struggle</h3>
<p>When Temujin was about 12 or 13 years old, his father was murdered by Turkic tribesmen, and his family was abandoned by his tribe and left to die in the harsh Mongolian winter. Mongolia is a vast, frigid, mostly barren land. Very little grows there, and the temperature routinely goes below 30 Celsius in winter. It is almost impossible for a family to survive alone in this environment without the support system and division of labor that a tribal group provides. Being abandoned in this manner was a death sentence.</p>
<p>The family did manage to survive, just barely. It was a harsh and brutal childhood. Temujin realized that although his father was a powerful &amp; wealthy man, his wealth proved to be of no use after he died. It was casually stolen away.</p>
<p>He realized that power can make you wealthy, but wealth cannot buy you power. When you are powerful, wealth can buy you more power, but when you have no power, wealth cannot protect you from those who have it. Power trumps wealth every time. Timeless wisdom.</p>
<p>This is something he never forgot. For the rest of his life, he sought only one thing: power. He disdained wealth, using it as nothing more than a tool.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, he spent the best part of three decades fighting and raiding and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rise_of_Genghis_Khan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaining power</a> [30]. He began at the very bottom, with absolutely nothing to his name. Over the years, he learned the secrets of power. He acquired a profound understanding of the levers of power and how to wield them. By the year 1206, when Temujin was in his late 40s, he had conquered every Mongol tribe and created a unified Mongol nation. They gave him the title of Chinggis Khan, which means “Universal Ruler”.</p>
<h3>Genghis Khan’s Career as a Conqueror</h3>
<p>Now, when you have a newly-created nation whose tribes have been fighting each other for centuries, it is essential to integrate them and keep them occupied, so that old divisions don’t crop up. It is essential to give them an overarching common purpose. That’s what Genghis did. He took them on an invasion of China.</p>
<p>This was a retaliatory invasion. Its purpose was to avenge the murder of Ambaghai and to punish the Chinese for centuries of interference and atrocities.</p>
<p>China was ruled at the time by two dynasties: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Western_Xia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Western Xia dynasty</a> [31] in …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div></div>

<p>If you’ve been exposed to any financial news in the last few days, you’ll have heard of <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/">Gamestop</a>, the mostly brick and mortar video gaming retailer who’s stock has been caught between many retail investors on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets">the subreddit r/WallstreetBets</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_capital">hedge fund Melvin Capital</a> which had been actively betting against the company. The resulting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze">short squeeze</a> (where a rising stock price forces investors betting against a company to buy shares to cover their own potential losses — which itself can push the stock price even higher) has been amazing to behold with the worth of Gamestop shares increasing over 10-fold in a matter of months.</p>

<p>While it’s hard not to get swept up in the idea of “the little guy winning one over on a hedge fund”, the narrative that this is Main Street winning over Wall Street is overblown.</p>



<figure><figcaption>A brief sampling of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HoldTheLine">#HoldTheLine</a> on Twitter</figcaption></figure>



<p>First, speaking practically, it’s hard to argue that giving one hedge fund a black eye by making <a href="https://news.gamestop.com/corporate-governance/highlights">Gamestop executives &amp; directors</a> and <a href="https://news.gamestop.com/stock-information/institutional-ownership">large investment funds holding $100M’s of Gamestop prior to the increase</a> wealthier is anyone winning anything over on Wall Street. And that’s not even accounting for the fact that hedge funds are usually managing a significant amount of money on behalf of pension funds and foundation / university endowments.</p>







<p>Second, while the paper value of recent investments in Gamestop has clearly jumped through the roof, what these investors will actually “win” is unclear. Even holding aside <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/tax-for-trading-stocks-robinhood-investors-confused-over-how-much-they-must-pay">short-term capital gains taxes that many retail investors are unclear on</a>, the reality is that, to make money on an investment, <strong>you not only have to buy low, you have to successfully sell high</strong>. By definition, any company experiencing a short-squeeze is volume-limited — meaning that it’s the lack of sellers that is causing the increase in price (the only way to get someone to sell is to offer them a higher price). If the stock price changes direction, it could trigger a flood of investors flocking to sell to try to hold on to their gains which can create the opposite problem: too many people trying to sell relative to people trying to buy which can cause the price to crater. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="500" src="https://benjamintseng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/buyhighselllow.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://benjamintseng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/buyhighselllow.jpg 650w, https://benjamintseng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/buyhighselllow-300x231.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-lazy-srcset="https://benjamintseng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/buyhighselllow.jpg 650w, https://benjamintseng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/buyhighselllow-300x231.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://benjamintseng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/buyhighselllow.jpg?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Buy high sell low? <a href="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/Buff-Doge-vs-Cheems">Created using Imgflip</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Regulatory and legal experts are better suited to weigh in on whether or not this constitutes market manipulation that needs to be regulated. For whatever it’s worth, I personally feel that Redditors egging each other on is no different than an institutional investor hyping their investments on cable TV. </p>



<p>But <strong>what is not in doubt is that these sorts of trades are extremely risky for all parties involved</strong> — whether you’re betting against a popular stock or trying to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HoldTheLine">“hold the line”</a> on a short-squeeze. For that reason, I’m sympathetic to <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/keeping-customers-informed-through-market-volatility">the brokerages which are limiting investor activity in some of these speculative tickers</a>. </p>



<p>While many retail investors view these restrictions as a move by Wall Street to screw the little guy, there’s a practical reality here that the brokerages are probably fearful of:</p>



<ul><li>Lawsuits from investors, some of whom will eventually lose quite a bit of money here</li><li>SEC actions and punishments due to eventual outcry from investors losing money</li></ul>



<p>This is the third reason I’m worried the Gamestop story will ultimately be a bad thing for Main Street. If the resulting lawsuits and/or regulatory actions cause brokerages to put more restrictions on investors, this could put additional friction on investors in terms of how they can <a href="https://benjamintseng.com/2020/08/visualizing-how-market-volatility-impacts-risk-and-returns/">participate in long-term wealth creation</a>, something <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/the-average-retirement-savings-by-age-and-why-you-need-more">more households need given the paltry state of retirement savings</a>. </p>



<p>I love stories of hedge funds facing the consequences of the risks they take on — but the idea that this is a clear win for Main Street is suspect (as is the idea that the right answer for most retail investors is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodl">HODL</a> through thick and through thin). </p>

<p>In the early 2000s, dramatic shifts in radio spectrum allocation for mobile data applications, combined with advances in radio transmission and receiving prompted some networking engineers to propose a radical rethink of radio.</p>
<p>Our current spectrum management assumes that senders and receivers have characteristics that are fixed at the point of manufacture, determined by things like the shape of an antenna and the type of quartz crystal used as an oscillator.</p>
<p>But software-defined radios (SDRs) and software-tunable phased-array antennas make those assumptions obsolete. Today, a radio can be a commodity computer that can sense other devices' RF use and transmit and receive on multiple frequencies to share the airwaves.</p>
<p>This was dubbed "cognitive radio" and its proponents imagined a world where the exclusive spectrum allocations handed out to telcos, broadcasters and other powerful entities would be replaced by a cooperative spectrum model.</p>
<p>Two radios that needed to talk to one another might make contact in one band, switch to another, or ask a third receiver to relay messages for them, using just enough power to reach one another, avoiding the bands that were already in use.</p>
<p>These proposals – which would vastly increase wireless data capacity – were met with fierce resistance, from incumbent licensors, from spectrum speculators, and from HAMs, who are brilliant but also tend to be conservative about spectrum allocation.</p>
<p>These debates inevitably ran up against a hard limit: no one had ever built any kind of serious cognitive radio network. Just trying it would likely trigger massive, brutal FCC enforcement action, as it would trample all that exclusive spectrum.</p>
<p>But that didn't cool the ardor of cognitive radio's fiercest proponents. People like Dwayne Hendricks roamed the world, looking for spectrum havens – places where cognitive radio could be tried. The King of Tonga greenlit one project!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/">https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/</a></p>
<p>But the most promising on-shore spectrum laboratories were First Nations territories – sovereign nations whose treaties predated any understanding of electromagnetic spectrum and thus did not cede spectrum rights to settler colonial powers.</p>
<p>Though the legal theory was as untested as the technical one, some First Nations bands dallied with it, wondering if they leverage their position to race past the hidebound rules in the US and Canada to bring money and connectivity to their communities.</p>
<p>I wrote a short story about this in 2002, "Liberation Spectrum," which Salon published in 2003:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.salon.com/2003/01/16/liberation_spectrum/">https://www.salon.com/2003/01/16/liberation_spectrum/</a></p>
<p>Making sovereign spectrum policy is one of the better interpretations of treaty law; it has the potential to be as lucrative as, say, casinos – and could also bridge the digital divide for First Nations communities.</p>
<p>Certainly, it's a better idea than the pharma trolls who briefly experimented with transfering patent portfolios to sovereign bands in the hopes of of muddying the jurisdictional questions so that their profiteering would be harder to shut down.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/how-a-native-american-tribe-ended-up-owning-six-key-patents-on-an-eye-drug/">https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/how-a-native-american-tribe-ended-up-owning-six-key-patents-on-an-eye-drug/</a></p>
<p>Thankfully, that plan petered out. Likewise, First Nations experiments with spectrum policy seem also to have lost momentum, since then – at least, none have crossed my radar.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>On Jan 13, the Mexican Supreme Court found in favor of Indigenous Community Telecommunications (TIC), unanimously finding that community groups like TIC were entitled to free "social use" spectrum licenses.</p>
<p><a href="https://globalvoices.org/2021/01/27/indigenous-led-telecommunications-organization-wins-historic-legal-battle-in-mexico/">https://globalvoices.org/2021/01/27/indigenous-led-telecommunications-organization-wins-historic-legal-battle-in-mexico/</a></p>
<p>The decision did not rely on treaty rights, but rather upon a carve out in Mexican spectrum policy that gives free spectrum to community groups. TIC is an incredibly effective network of 80 towns in 18 Indigenous communities operating voice and data mobile networks.</p>
<p>Since 2018, TIC has been under threat, with the regulator demanding 1m pesos for continued access to spectrum; a demand the Supreme Court unanimously voided.</p>
<p>The decision will ease expansions of TIC's service into the vast majority of Indigenous communities that lack reliable mobile service.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ift.org.mx/sites/default/files/reporte-coberturapueblosindigenas_finalpublicar.pdf">http://www.ift.org.mx/sites/default/files/reporte-coberturapueblosindigenas_finalpublicar.pdf</a></p>
<p>And it also allows for services beyond telephony. As TIC's Erick Huerta says, this paves the way for other Indigenous media being exempted from regulatory barriers.</p>

<p>A new research report from Sean O'Brien and Expressvpn in honor Data Privacy Day reveals the incredible extent of commercial location tracking hidden in everyday apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/digital-security-lab/investigation-xoth">https://www.expressvpn.com/digital-security-lab/investigation-xoth</a></p>
<p>App vendors use free software development kits (SDKs) to build their products, not realizing (or not caring) that the SDKs come from commercial surveillance companies that harvest all their users' data and sell it in hidden, sprawling commercial markets.</p>
<p>That's how the US military was able to buy location data on users of a Muslim prayer app: the app was built with one of these surveillance SDKs, so the data was extracted, packaged and sold on the cheap to the Pentagon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x">https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x</a></p>
<p>The survey encompasses 450 apps with 1.7b downloads. It found that messenger apps (including many masquerading as Wechat, FB Messenger, and Telegram) were rife with location tracking. Other major offenders include dating and social apps.</p>
<p>The sleaziest SDK vendors are also the most prolific. X-Mode (a company that is theoretically banned from app stores) is in 44% of the analyzed apps. X-Mode is especially prevalent in religious apps, especially Islamic ones.</p>

<p>There is no shortage of takes about what's going on with Gamestop (and other surging stocks), Robinhood and Reddit's r/wallstreetbets, many of them contradictory – at least on the face of them. But I think it's possible for most of these takes to be right. Here's how.</p>
<p>First you need to understand the underlying mechanics of the story. Stock markets are fundamentally a way of making bets, including bets on the outcome of other peoples' bets, and bets on the outcomes of <em>those</em> bets.</p>
<p>All this complexity creates lots of exploitable opportunities. Some of these opportunities are considered legitimate and are given respectable names like "arbitrage." Others are considered illegitimate, and are called disreputable things like "stock manipulation."</p>
<p>A hypothetical Martian observing all this through a telescope could not tell you which kinds of bets were honest and which were dishonest, because the difference isn't about any objective standard, but rather, about power.</p>
<p>The strategies of powerful people are legit, while the strategies of their would-be dethroners are not legit. Sometimes, even outright frauds are OK if they're done by people with enough power.</p>
<p>If your scam pays out quickly enough, you can sometimes parlay the resulting cash into retrospective legitimization, so even the strategies of the out-group can end up being retconned as legit, if they're successful enough.</p>
<p>That's why Amway isn't illegal: Betsy DeVos's father-in-law was simultaneously the boss of Amway and head of the US Chamber of Commerce, and Gerry Ford was his Congressman, who was then elevated to president in time to legalize its business model.</p>
<p>To understand the Gamestop rise, you have to understand a couple of different kinds of bets.</p>
<p>"Shorting": this is a bet that a stock will go down. There's a complicated backstory to how you make this bet, but it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>The thing to know here is that shorting a stock can make you rich…if the stock goes down. But if the stock goes up, you lose money. There's not really any limit to how much you can lose here.</p>
<p>Every time the stock goes up, the shorts have to pony up more money to keep their bet alive (in the hopes that it will go down again later), or they have to take their losses, pay out the winner of the bet and surrender any chance of winning later.</p>
<p>Shorting isn't just a bet on someone else's failure – it's a way to fund bullshit-detection. If you know (or suspect) that a company is lying about its prospects, you can bet against it.</p>
<p>Shorts fund a lot of research into defective products and scammy businesses, because they win when bad companies are exposed and their stocks go down. Some of the scary security research you read about bad IoT software is funded by shorts.</p>
<p>That's why habitual bullshitters like Elon Musk <em>hate</em> shorts. Musk leads a cult of credulous worshippers who buy whatever he's selling. Shorts make bets that Musk's cultists will get deprogrammed. Musk uses this to sharpen his cultists' resolve: "they want us to fail!"</p>
<p>"Options": many different bets get lumped in as "options" but for the purposes of this discussion, buying an option means buying the right to buy stocks later. The people who sell you the option usually go out and buy the stock right away so they'll have it to sell.</p>
<p>"Front-running": Cheating. Front-runners insert themselves into transactions by spying. If I know that Alice is buying a bunch …</p></div></article></div>

      <div>
  
  <p><span>12 Mar 2018</span></p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Analyzing and breaking external encrypted HDD has been a “hobby” of mine for
quite some time. With my colleagues Joffrey Czarny and Julien Lenoir we looked
at several models <a href="https://syscall.eu/#Confs">in the past</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Zalman VE-400</li>
  <li>Zalman ZM-SHE500</li>
  <li>Zalman ZM-VE500</li>
</ul>

<p>Here I am going to detail how I had fun with one drive a colleague gave me: the
Chinese Aigo “Patriot” SK8671, which follows the classical design for external
encrypted HDDs: a LCD for information diplay and a keyboard to enter the PIN.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: This research was done on my <strong>personal time</strong> and is not related
to my employer.</p>



<p>The user must input a password to access data, which is supposedly encrypted.</p>

<p>Note that the options are <em>very</em> limited:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the PIN can be changed by pressing <code>F1</code> before unlocking</li>
  <li>the PIN must be between 6 and 9 digits</li>
  <li>there is a <em>wrong PIN</em> counter, which (I think) destroys data when it reaches 15 tries.</li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, F2, F3 and F4 are useless.</p>

<h2 id="hardware-design">Hardware design</h2>

<p>Of course one of the first things we do is tear down everything to identify the
various components.</p>

<p>Removing the case is actually boring, with lots of very small screws and
plastic to break.</p>

<p>In the end, we get this (note that I soldered the 5 pins header):</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/disk.jpg"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/disk-small.jpg" alt="disk"></a></p>

<h3 id="main-pcb">Main PCB</h3>

<p>The main PCB is pretty simple:</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/main-pcb.jpg"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/main-pcb-small.jpg" alt="main PCB"></a></p>

<p>Important parts, from top to bottom:</p>

<ul>
  <li>connector to the LCD PCB (<code>CN1</code>)</li>
  <li>beeper (<code>SP1</code>)</li>
  <li>Pm25LD010 (<a href="http://www.issiusa.com/pdf/Pm25LD512_010_020.pdf">datasheet</a>) SPI flash (<code>U2</code>)</li>
  <li>Jmicron JMS539 (<a href="http://www.doc88.com/p-994237049795.html">datasheet</a>) USB-SATA controller (<code>U1</code>)</li>
  <li>USB 3 connector (<code>J1</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The SPI flash stores the JMS539 firmware and some settings.</p>

<h3 id="lcd-pcb">LCD PCB</h3>

<p>The LCD PCB is not really interesting:</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/lcd.jpg"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/lcd-small.jpg" alt="LCD view"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/lcd-pcb.jpg"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/lcd-pcb-small.jpg" alt="LCD PCB"></a></p>

<p>It has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an unknown LCD character display (with Chinese fonts probably), with serial control</li>
  <li>a ribbon connector to the keyboard PCB</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="keyboard-pcb">Keyboard PCB</h3>

<p>Things get more interesting when we start to look at the keyboard PCB:</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/kbd-pcb.jpg"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/kbd-pcb-small.jpg" alt="Keyboard PCB, back"></a></p>

<p>Here, on the back we can see the ribbon connector and a Cypress CY8C21434 PSoC
1 microcontroller (I’ll mostly refer to it as “µC” or “PSoC”):
<img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/CY8C21434-24LTXI.jpg" alt="CY8C21434"></p>

<p>The CY8C21434 is using the <code>M8C</code> instruction set, which is documented in the
<a href="http://www.cypress.com/file/72341/download">Assembly Language User Guide</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cypress.com/part/cy8c21434-24ltxi">product page</a> states it
supports <a href="http://www.cypress.com/products/capsense-controllers"><em>CapSense</em></a>,
Cypress’ technology for capacitive keyboards, the technology in use here.</p>

<p>You can see the header I soldered, which is the standard ISSP programming header.</p>

<h3 id="following-wires">Following wires</h3>

<p>It is always useful to get an idea of what’s connected to what. Here the PCB
has rather big connectors and using a multimeter in continuity testing mode is
enough to identify the connections:</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/wires.png"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/wires.png" alt="hand drawn schematic"></a></p>

<p>Some help to read this poorly drawn figure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the PSoC is represented as in the datasheet</li>
  <li>the next connector on the right is the ISSP header, which thankfully matches what we can <a href="http://www.cypress.com/sites/default/files/inline/ui/2_5/images/kb/userimage/Miniprog1%20connector.JPG">find online</a></li>
  <li>the right most connector is the clip for the ribbon, still on the keyboard PCB</li>
  <li>the black square contains a drawing of the <code>CN1</code> connector from the main PCB,
where the cable goes to the LCD PCB. P11, P13 and P4 are linked to the PSoC
pins 11, 13 and 4 through the LCD PCB.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="attack-steps">Attack steps</h2>

<p>Now that we know what are the different parts, the basic steps would be the
same as for the drives analyzed in previous research :</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure basic encryption functionnality is there</li>
  <li>find how the encryption keys are generated / stored</li>
  <li>find out where the PIN is verified</li>
</ul>

<p>However, in practice I was not really focused on breaking the security but more
on having fun. So, I did the following steps instead:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dump the SPI flash content</li>
  <li>try to dump PSoC flash memory (see part 2)</li>
  <li>start writing the blog post</li>
  <li>realize that the communications between the Cypress PSoC and the JMS539
actually contains keyboard presses</li>
  <li>verify that nothing is stored in the SPI when the password is changed</li>
  <li>be too lazy to reverse the 8051 firmware of the JMS539</li>
  <li>TBD: finish analyzing the overall security of the drive (in part 3 ?)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dumping-the-spi-flash">Dumping the SPI flash</h3>

<p>Dumping the flash is rather easy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>connect probes to the <code>CLK</code>, <code>MOSI</code>, <code>MISO</code> and (optionally) <code>EN</code> pins of the flash</li>
  <li>sniff the communications using a logic analyzer (I used a <a href="https://www.saleae.com/">Saleae Logic Pro 16</a>)</li>
  <li>decode the SPI protocol and export the results in CSV</li>
  <li>use <a href="https://github.com/trou/saleae-spi">decode_spi.rb</a> to parse the results and get a dump</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this works very well with the JMS539 as it loads its whole firmware
from flash at boot time.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ decode_spi.rb boot_spi1.csv dump
0.039776 : WRITE DISABLE
0.039777 : JEDEC READ ID
0.039784 : ID 0x7f 0x9d 0x21
---------------------
0.039788 : READ @ 0x0
0x12,0x42,0x00,0xd3,0x22,0x00,
[...]
$ ls --size --block-size=1 dump
49152 dump
$ sha1sum dump
3d9db0dde7b4aadd2b7705a46b5d04e1a1f3b125  dump
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately it does not seem obviously useful as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the content did not change after changing the PIN</li>
  <li>the flash is actually never accessed after boot</li>
</ul>

<p>So it probably only holds the firmware for the JMicron controller, which embeds
a 8051 microcontroller.</p>

<h3 id="sniffing-communications">Sniffing communications</h3>

<p>One way to find which chip is responsible for what is to check communications
for interesting timing/content.</p>

<p>As we know, the USB-SATA controller is connected to the screen and the Cypress
µC through the <code>CN1</code> connector and the two ribbons. So, we hook probes to the 3
relevant pins:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P4, generic I/O in the datasheet</li>
  <li>P11, I²C SCL in the datasheet</li>
  <li>P13, I²C SDA in the datasheet</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/probes.jpg"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/probes-small.jpg" alt="probes"></a></p>

<p>We then launch Saleae logic analyzer, set the trigger and enter “123456✓”
on the keyboard. Which gives us the following view:</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae-fail_123456.png"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae-fail_123456.png" alt="Saleae logic analyzer screenshot"></a></p>

<p>You can see 3 differents types of communications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on the P4 channel, some short bursts</li>
  <li>on P11 and P13, almost continuous exchanges</li>
</ul>

<p>Zooming on the first P4 burst (blue rectangle in previous picture), we get this :</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae_beep.png"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae_beep.png" alt="P4 zoom"></a></p>

<p>You can see here that P4 is almost 70ms of pure regular signal, which could be
a clock. However, after spending some time making sense of this, I realized
that it was actually a signal for the “beep” that goes off every time a key is
touched… So it is not very useful in itself, however, it is a good marker to
know when a keypress was registered by the PSoC.</p>

<p>However, we have on extra “beep” in the first picture, which is slightly
different: the sound for “wrong pin” !</p>

<p>Going back to our keypresses, when zooming at the end of the beep (see the blue
rectangle again), we get: <a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae_end_of_beep.png"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae_end_of_beep.png" alt="end of beep zoom"></a></p>

<p>Where we have a regular pattern, with a (probable) clock on P11 and data on P13.
Note how the pattern changes after the end of the beep. It could be interesting
to see what’s going on here.</p>

<p>2-wires protocols are usually SPI or I²C, and the Cypress datasheet says the
pins correspond to I²C, which is apparently the case:
<a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae_i2c_key1.png"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae_i2c_key1.png" alt="i2c decoding of '1' keypress"></a></p>

<p>The USB-SATA chipset constantly polls the PSoC to read the key state, which is
‘0’ by default. It then changes to ‘1’ when key ‘1’ was pressed.</p>

<p>The final communication, right after pressing “✓”, is different if a valid PIN
is entered.
However, for now I have not checked what the actual transmission is and it does
not seem that an encryption key is transmitted.</p>

<p>Anyway, see <a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/2018/03/12/aigo_part2/">part 2</a> to read how I
did dump the PSoC internal flash.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ant Group, the financial-services company established and controlled by the ecommerce mogul, <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/jackma">Jack Ma</a>, has considered restructuring itself after demands and pressure from Chinese officials who have faced his business empire&nbsp;.</p>
<p>People who are familiar with the issue told the Journal that Ant Group plans to change to a financial holding firm which will be overseen by Central Bank, China, and plans have been submitted already to regulators.</p>
<p>This change was as a result of continuous demand from Chinese regulators. The effect of this is that , it will stop Ant from going further with some of its plans, and be open for the rest of its work to be overseen more tightly.</p>
<p>This signals a remarkable restriction from Chinese officials, who are controlling one of the most flamboyant, successful, and well-known figures in Chinese business.</p>

<p>Jack Ma made his wealth working with Alibaba, the e-commerce company founded by him in 1999 and that made him one of the richest in China, with a net worth as high as $53.9bn.</p>
<p>However, Ma is no more the head of Alibaba, but has remained a major shareholder.</p>
<p>Ma’s conflict with the state got intense when he spoke against China’s financial regulatory system on October 24, as Ant Group was preparing itself for an IPO.</p>
<p>He said that China was going on the path of global rules which are part of “an old people’s club.”</p>
<p>At a point, Ma then went off public scene for months, after an October-31 event. He re-emerged in a video-conference clip on January 20.</p>
<p>His absence from the public after his clash with the government indicated the disappearance of famous Chinese actress, Fan Bingbing , who had disappeared for 4 months in 2019 while authorities was investigating her for evasion of tax .</p>
<p>When she later came back, she was, reportedly, praising the Chinese state.</p>
<p>On November 2, China came up with new regulations that got the Ant Group IPO suspended.</p>
<p>It was also reported, in December, Ma tried to end the conflict by offering the Chinese government parts of Ant Group. But the offer wasn’t accepted, that was how Ant’s hopes of an IPO ended.</p>
<p>On December 23, Chinese regulators introduced an antitrust investigation into Alibaba, widening the trouble for Jack Ma.</p>
<p>People who are familiar with the whole issue told <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-eyes-shrinking-jack-mas-business-empire-11609260092" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wall Street Journal</a> that plans to change the company into a financial holding company could be concluded by mid-February.</p>

Because Telegram does not use end-to-end encryption by default.</p><p>One example is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/telegram-encryption-whatsapp-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this WIRED article</a>.</p><p>On the one hand, it takes just a single (!) step more to start a secret chat (above the contact list is this option, which then displays a contact list again), and on the other hand, these articles often give the impression that messages are not encrypted at all.</p><blockquote><p>“In terms of encryption, Telegram is just not as good as WhatsApp,” says Kobeissi. “The fact that encryption is not enabled by default already puts it way behind WhatsApp.”</p></blockquote><p>Telegram messages are actually encrypted, just not end-to-end encrypted!</p><p>Furthermore, these articles suggest that people are switching from WhatsApp to other messengers because WhatsApp is not secure. However, many users simply don’t want their data to be misused by Facebook for advertising. It’s not about the security at all.</p><p>This is all then underlined by the fear that the Telegram founder is a Russian and that Telegram is currently based in the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>But first, the Telegram founder actually fled from Russia, fearing the authorities, and second, Telegram is based in the UAE precisely because there is less risk of them being pressured by authorities to hand over data.</p><blockquote><p>He added that its “lean Dubai-based team is ready to move to a different location if it ever faces pressure.”</p></blockquote><p>If you are really afraid that messages could fall into the wrong hands, you won’t be better off with Signal. Signal is based in the USA and could be forced by a secret service to install a backdoor. The argument that everything is open source is also no longer true, since the <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published source code</a> is outdated and it is impossible to check whether the code on the servers is really the published code anyway.</p><p>In this case, a messenger like <a href="https://briarproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Briar</a> is recommended.</p><p>Since all these discussions about (silo) messengers and which messenger is the best generally annoy me, <a href="https://jlelse.blog/posts/email-messenger-delta-chat">I recommend Delta Chat</a>. Delta Chat is basically just an email client, but it gives email a messenger interface and automatically ensures that messages are encrypted end-to-end.</p></div><p><b>Tags</b>:

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has generated many headlines for remote work. <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/10/09/embracing-a-flexible-workplace/">Microsoft</a> is letting employees work up to 50% of their time from home. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-15/stripe-employees-who-relocate-to-get-20-000-bonus-and-a-pay-cut">Stripe</a> is paying a $20k bonus for employees to relocate out of cities with high cost of living. <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/dropbox-goes-virtual-first">Dropbox</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-21/shopify-is-joining-twitter-in-permanent-work-from-home-shift">Shopify</a> are foregoing headquarters in the traditional sense altogether to become remote first.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed it sure feels like everyone is leaning into remote work. But how is it backed up by data? Can we quantify the remote shift? Can we observe the data over time? Can we extrapolate the data to form views about the post-pandemic world?</p><p>To answer these questions, I parsed "<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whoishiring">Who is Hiring</a>" posts on Hacker News. The monthly hiring thread goes live on the 1st of every month and on average 500+ companies respond with job openings. Companies are encouraged to specify whether a position is remote or onsite. This dataset is interesting because it captures temporal shifts and represents a broad sampling of the tech industry.</p><h3><strong>Chronicling the Remote Shift</strong></h3><p>Let's start by looking at how many companies advertised permanent remote positions as well as the proportion of those companies in relation to all companies. Note that a pandemic remote position that is expected to revert to onsite is not a permanent remote position and not tracked in this analysis. From here on, remote means permanent remote.</p><figure id="w-node-443c3c51e579-587ef276"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e12757f0227d019c07ef2b9/6012e673be33239a31e95023_am_m65Mp7l-xCQywM73df7Byjbatr1dVImrwmf_EeR3Cxozmr47iC5tmDWP9G2zSkTzoisRndM8mmu2-F2KlvRsKbcp5eNihQvFUX4fIQ0a45lYqVUeA00rKsLZfpbcWqhpa66Cy.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The data naturally lends itself to splitting into four periods.</p><p><strong>January–March: The pre-pandemic business as usual</strong></p><p>The first three months of 2020 are essentially free of the impacts of COVID-19. During these months 33-34% of companies posting jobs on Hacker News were hiring remote positions. These months serve as a baseline.</p><p><strong>April–July: The hiring freeze</strong></p><p>Job post volumes dropped 33% MoM in April and stayed subdued for the following three months as companies grappled with macroeconomic uncertainties and remote transition disruptions. However, the drop in companies advertising remote positions was much less severe (20% MoM drop in April) compared to those that were hiring onsite only (40% MoM drop in April).&nbsp;</p><p>Simultaneously a rapid mix shift took place as companies changed their stance on hiring remote employees. In March, the last unaffected month, only 34% of companies advertised remote positions. By July, that number ballooned to 54%.</p><p><strong>August–November: The new normal</strong></p><p>Hiring roared back from August onward with job post volumes exceeding Q1 months. The shift towards remote continued during these months and eventually stabilized with 67<strong>–</strong>68% of companies posting remote jobs by October and November. Overall, the proportion had more than doubled from 33% — truly a sea change in the hiring landscape in the short span of a year.</p><p><strong>December–January: Post vaccine announcement</strong></p><p>With Pfizer-BioNTech announcing landmark COVID-19 vaccine trial results in November and the vaccine receiving FDA approval in December, companies could finally start creating a timeline for a return to normalcy.&nbsp;</p><p>However, this did not translate to a reversion in hiring trends where more companies asked candidates to report to the office post-COVID. If anything, the remote hiring trend continued edging upwards, with 70% of companies posting remote jobs in January 2021.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Blossoming of Remote First</strong></h3><p>A progressive subset of remote hiring companies are remote first companies. Remote first companies assume by default that employees work remotely though they may still have onsite employees for various reasons. Their workflows and internal processes are built around remote work. For a discussion on various flavors of remote first, refer to "<a href="http://www.shinkim.io/posts/why-remote-friendly-wont-do">Why Remote Friendly Won’t Do</a>".</p><p>Remote first companies are a rare breed — they were rare before the pandemic and they still are. But their numbers have doubled during the pandemic.</p><figure id="w-node-2e72fe1f6e11-587ef276"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e12757f0227d019c07ef2b9/6012e673a1776333fb5e8db6_coJgs3a7zIkpLMUI6rA0HFZjy1Uzs6VzPv_pPfxsHOJIQKk2V1WI1QvJh8McD-9xTl7h-Bm3DNIA7WybZMuWJXTuW9Ufk1_WtRU0JAgcKPstMeMMEt_sUhJX-QTJco80tIyh5gqs.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>In January, 6% of companies — or 34 out of 545 companies — were describing themselves as remote first. That number doubled by December, 12% of companies — or 75 out of 644 — claimed being remote first.&nbsp;</p><p>If the first chart was significant for showing remote-resistant companies becoming open to permanent remote work, this second chart is significant because it shows companies that were already remote friendly going further to establish remote as the default mode of work.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Drivers Behind the Remote Shift</strong></h3><p>What are the drivers behind this shift? There is no easy way to extract intent from the Hacker News data. However, the job posts occasionally offer glimpses into the thinking processes. Here's an attempt to distill anecdotes into takeaways:</p><p>First, companies are increasingly accepting remote candidates because they sense the broader market is shifting. Job posts mention "cultural tides shift[ing]" and a sense of "doubt [that] it will ever go back". Hiring managers realize that remote work is quickly becoming a necessity to remain competitive in the talent market.</p><p>Second, everyone was thrust into remote work and many teams thrived almost unexpectedly. Companies wrote in job posts that they "went fully remote when COVID-19 hit and ... aren't going back" and that "it's been going great". For these companies the pandemic was an unforeseen opportunity to reassess their office policy with fresh eyes.</p><p>Third, some companies had been gradually adding more remote employees to their ranks over time and the pandemic provided a catalyzing moment to formalize their remote stance. For example, FullStory started the pandemic with 25% of its employees remote. In September they announced the decision "go remote" because they felt they "needed to take a more long-term stance".</p><p>Lastly, though not a pandemic-specific driver, the strategic benefits of remote hiring is broadly resonating. Companies cite access to world class talent, diversity in thinking, and proximity to local customers as key advantages for going remote. These benefits are likely to be amplified for companies headquartered in smaller talent markets and those that serve a distributed customer base.</p><h3><strong>What will Happen in 2021?</strong></h3><p>The big question is whether the shift to remote hiring has staying power. As companies eventually start re-opening offices in 2021, will they revert back to onsite only hiring? Will the newly remote first companies roll back their stance? No one can say for sure, but here are a few observations that make me think the new baseline for remote work will be much higher:</p><p>First, the above analysis captures only permanent and not temporarily remote positions. These hires are not expected to report to the office after the pandemic. Companies that have welcomed permanent remote employees for the first time to their ranks will be held to their commitments to supporting them even once the office reopens. And once you allow a part of your team to be permanently remote it becomes hard to disallow it for further team members.</p><p>Second, I expect the shift to remote first in particular to be sticky. These were highly deliberate decisions on company culture that required re-writing the social contract with employees. Imagine having to ask your team to relocate back to headquarters after your remote first announcement gave them the green light to move out. Reducing organizational entropy will require much more effort than increasing it.</p><p>Third, remote work tools are getting better and teams are developing, adopting, and spreading best practices that will reduce friction in remote work. Everything from running payroll to whiteboarding will get dramatically easier as the ecosystem matures. More workers that have experienced the benefit of remote work will ask for it and companies will have less reasons to refuse it.</p><p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/_shinkim">Twitter @_shinkim</a> as I&nbsp;continue exploring these trends.</p><p>Thanks to Yin Wu and Chris Cheng for reviewing drafts of this article.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whoishiring">Hacker News: Who is Hiring</a>. All data saved <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jlLJkZJz3NBeyjylzTYAH-jTUog18Wqr_wi-OytK7EA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>, please report any data errors to shin@shinkim.io.</p><p>[1] I use companies as the atomic unit instead of positions or job posts. For example, multiple positions advertised within a single post or across several posts are consolidated as one record.</p><p>[2] If a company is open to both onsite and remote (even if the preference is towards onsite), the position is still a remote position for this analysis.</p><p>[3] The March data is not impacted by COVID-19 given most companies respond to the Hacker News thread in the first few days of the month. Many parts of Europe and the United States went into lockdown in mid-to-late March.</p><p>[4] For the purposes of this analysis, remote first includes remote equal (very few), remote first, and remote only companies. I did not count remote friendly companies as the descriptor is ambiguous. Read “How Remote is Remote Enough?” for a full discussion of the different types.</p><p>[5] Remote first disclosures are voluntary and unprompted on Hacker News. So it is possible that some remote first companies do not mention this attribute in their hiring advertisement on any given month. As a result, the uptick in data may partially represent more remote first companies merely including this information in their job post.</p><p>[6] FullStory’s December post on Hacker News says that they strive to be remote equal.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<div><b>For the TL;DR crowd:</b>
I desperately needed to extract the complete (and very lengthy) command line I had written 6 months ago in a bash shell - which was still running under <tt>screen</tt>. Read on to see how I eventually made it...
</div>

<p>Let's assume you are using bash as your daily shell. You've heard lots of worrying things lately about it's <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)">safety</a>. But that's not what's bothering you.</p>

<p>What's bothering you is that some months ago you abused the holy UNIX principles with it. It couldn't be helped. You were asked to implement a daemon that monitors a folder for incoming "stuff". The clients upload files there, and you were expected to do various things with them.</p>

<p>And the daemon was supposed to be delivered <em>yesterday</em> - as always...</p>

<p>So you hacked at a frantic pace, and made a lengthy bash pipeline that did it all. Loops over the input files, pipes, redirects - you name it. And having no time to fool around with <code>supervisord</code>, you pasted "The Magic CmdLine (TM)" inside a <code>screen</code>, where your bash patiently started chugging along...  And you moved to the next emergency on your list - which naturally, was scheduled for yesterday too...</p>

<h2>Alzheimer sets in - seeking help</h2>

<p>The Magic CmdLine (TM) obediently worked and worked. You checked its behaviour during the first couple of weeks - and just as expected, any errors on incoming files sent by the clients, were reported on its stderr, which your invocation conveniently redirected to some error log file. All was well.</p>

<p>6 months passed. No news is good news.</p>

<p>And suddenly, you remembered it. Only now (you moron!) you realize - horror of horrors - that you've forgotten all about The Magic CmdLine (TM). Arguments, redirects, everything down the mental drain. Gulp.</p>

<p>You are a single reboot away from, erm, a well-deserved flogging from your boss (translation: <code>screen</code> or no <code>screen</code>, The Magic CmdLine (TM) that you painstakingly investigated 6 months ago, will be forever lost... when the next reboot happens).</p>

<p>Oh God.</p>

<p>You reattach to the magic <code>screen</code>, fingers crossed. You hit ESC and scroll back up, hoping to see the magic line invocation...  but to no avail. The error reports it generated were written all over <code>screen</code>'s scrollback buffer - you can't scroll all the way up to the invocation line.</p>

<p>Heck, there <em>has</em> to be a way to get to that line. <code>ps aux | grep ...</code> doesn't help - it shows the currently running <em>piece</em> of the command you wrote. You want the whole shebang.</p>

<p>Desperate, you seek help at StackOverflow's gathering of <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/159010/how-can-i-see-the-exact-command-line-being-executed-inside-some-bash-instance">UNIX gods</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a long running bash instance (inside a screen session) that is executing a complex set of commands inside a loop (with each loop doing pipes, redirects, etc). The long command line was written inside the terminal - it's not inside any script. Now, I know the bash process ID, and I have root access - how can I see the exact command line being executed inside that bash?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You also add a nice and simple example of the problem:</p>

<div>
<pre><tt>

<span>$ echo </span><span>$$</span>
<span>8909</span>

<span>$ </span><span>while</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span> </span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span> echo </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>;</span><span> echo </span><span>2</span><span>&gt;</span><span>/dev/null </span><span>;</span><span> sleep </span><span>30</span><span> </span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>done</span>



</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>And the answers start pouring in... but they are useless. </p>

<p>One tells you to search the process list - which would only give <code>sleep</code> in this example (<em>and in your real case, the currently running part of your complex Magic CmdLine (TM)</em>). </p>

<p>Another one suggests <code>cat /proc/8909/cmdline</code> - which of course just gives <code>bash</code>.</p>

<p>Another offers <code>ps -p 8909 --no-headers -o cmd</code> - which also gives <code>bash</code>.</p>

<p>(Sigh)</p>

<h2>Use the Source, Luke</h2>

<p>Desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>

<p>You download the bash source code, untar, and hoping you can somehow recover the history information kept inside the running instance of bash, you <code>grep</code> for dear life:</p>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>$ find </span><span>.</span><span> -iname </span><span>\*.</span><span>c </span><span>|</span><span> grep hist</span>
<span>.</span><span>/lib/readline/history</span><span>.</span><span>c</span>
<span>.</span><span>/lib/readline/examples/histexamp</span><span>.</span><span>c</span>
<span>.</span><span>/lib/readline/histexpand</span><span>.</span><span>c</span>
<span>.</span><span>/lib/readline/histsearch</span><span>.</span><span>c</span>
<span>.</span><span>/lib/readline/histfile</span><span>.</span><span>c</span>
<span>.</span><span>/bashhist</span><span>.</span><span>c</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>Hmm... <code>histfile.c</code> - isn't our dear beloved <code>bash</code> saving history into a file? Opening inside VIM, searching...</p>

<p>Well, would you look at that!...</p>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>...</span>
<span>int</span>
<span>write_history</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>filename</span><span>)</span>
<span>     </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>char</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>filename</span><span>;</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>history_do_write</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>filename</span><span>,</span><span> history_length</span><span>,</span><span> HISTORY_OVERWRITE</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>...</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>Saints be praised, we are saved!</p>

<p>Spawn GDB - and activate God mode! That is, attach to the running bash, and call <code>write_history</code> on our own - it conveniently takes the filename to save in as an argument!</p>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>$ gdb --pid </span><span>8909</span>

<p>Gotcha! The Magic CmdLine (TM) is yours again!</p>

<p>You answer your own question in StackOverflow. The other answers are somehow deleted, apparently ashamed of your monstrous luck.</p>

<p>The moderator there stars your answer.</p>

<p>Life is good again. It is time...</p>

<h2>The Empire Strikes Back</h2>

<p>You SSH into the remote machine running the thing. The bash process running the thing has PID 53165.</p>

<p>You spawn GDB... hands trembling.. and attach...</p>

<p>Say what?!?</p>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>$ ssh IamInHell</span>

</div>

<p>No!...</p>

<p>The stupid ShellShock thingie forced everyone to update their bash... 
The automatic updates in that machine <em>removed</em> the binary of the old bash, and installed a new one.</p>

<p>So even though the process is still up, 6 months later... the binary file
from which it was spawned (and which GDB searches for, to get the address of <code>write_history</code>) can't be found.</p>

<p>I don't believe this - I am cursed.</p>

<p>(Yes, I switched from 'you' to 'I' - who am I kidding)</p>

<h2>Return of the Jedi</h2>

<p>But I also know my OS - I know it well. I can get the content of that old binary <em>from memory</em> - via the <code>proc</code> interface:</p>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>[</span><span>root@IamInHell</span><span>]</span><span> lsof </span><span>+</span><span>L1 </span><span>|</span><span> grep bash </span><span>|</span><span> grep </span><span>53165</span>

<span>[</span><span>root@IamInHell</span><span>]</span><span> cat /proc</span><span>/</span><span>53165</span><span>/exe </span><span>&gt;</span><span> /tmp/oldBash</span>

<p><em>Dancing around my desk. The people around me are looking at me, puzzled and wondering about my mental state</em>.</p>

<p>But I don't care - I am a friggin Jedi Master :-)</p>

<h2>Sharing my good fortune</h2>

<p>To ease the pain of my future self - and potentially the pain of other fellow coders / admins, I <a href="https://github.com/ttsiodras/utils/blob/master/showBashCmdline.sh">write a script automating all this</a>.</p>

<p>And decide it's been quite a while since I posted something on my blog :-)</p>



<div>
<p><em>
<b>Update, many years later</b>: A question that keeps re-appearing every time this post shows up in places like Hacker News or Reddit: "Why didn't you just "Ctrl-c", up arrow?"... Or: "Why didn't you just "Ctrl-z", up arrow, down-arrow, "fg"?
<p>
Remember: <b>The script was running in production, doing actual work.</b> Stopping it with Ctrl-c, when you don't remember anything about it and what it spawns, was not a safe option.  If you think about it, you'll realize there are plenty of things that don't recover from Ctrl-C... Batch processes in network operations that affect state, API calls... I am sure you know what I mean.
</p><p>
As for Ctrl-z: try running this in your <tt>bash</tt>, and applying the "Ctrl-z/fg" approach to it: <tt>while true ; do sleep 1 ; done</tt>. You'll see that the loop won't recover - it won't resume its proper operation...
</p></em></p><p><em>
So, to put it simply: sending signals to processes I had no recollection of, <b>was not as safe</b> as reading my shell's memory with the god of debuggers.

       <p>Bell Labs is dead. It remains dead. And we have killed it.</p>
<p>In fact, even the concept seems to be dead. The top result in Google for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=industrial+research+lab">Industrial Research Lab</a> is a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.iteea.org/File.aspx?id=80231&amp;v=abace77c">retrospective history</a>. Pluralize the query as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=industrial+research+labs">Industrial Research Labs</a> and the top result is a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18663/industrial-research-laboratories-of-the-united-states-including-consulting-research-laboratories">1946 index of the many labs that used to exist</a>. Try <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=corporate+research+lab">Corporate Research Lab</a> and you’ll get the cheery article <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.dshr.org/2020/05/the-death-of-corporate-research-labs.html">The Death Of Corporate Research Labs</a>.</p>
<p>Summarized in this last piece, Rosenthal determines the cause of death:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lack of anti-trust enforcement, pervasive short-termism, driven by Wall Street’s focus on quarterly results, and management’s focus on manipulating the stock price to maximize the value of their options</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking backwards, this is a tragedy. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers?</p>
<p>But looking forward, it’s an immense opportunity! So long as we remedy the underlying causes, the great industrial lab may rise again. We may already be on the right track. Antitrust pressure is rising, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_private_non-governmental_companies_by_revenue">privately held companies</a> not subject to Wall Street’s demands are booming.</p>
<p>What about short-termism? Via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/07/how-bad-a-problem-is-quarterly-capitalism.html">Tyler Cowen</a>, Warren (2014) finds “no clear evidence of flawed short-term oriented management practices”. </p>
<p>This is good news! The industrial research lab has fallen, but with the causes gone, it will rise again.</p>
<p>As <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-american-rd-lab/">Ben Southwood concludes</a> his piece for Works in Progress “we will see the return of various large in-house labs.” [1]</p>
<hr>
<p>I am not so optimistic. Regardless of the antitrust situation, industrial research labs will not return.</p>
<p>Southwood and Rosenthal’s findings are both derived from Ashish Arora, Sharon Belenzon, et al.’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25893">The Changing Structure of American Innovation</a>, worth reading in full. As he concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems unlikely that corporate research will rediscover its glory days… For some time, quick wins from low-hanging fruit (such as optimizing auction or advertising formats) may cover up the problem, but the fundamental challenge of managing long-run research inside a for-profit corporation remains a formidable one… incumbent firms continue to rely on outside inventions to fuel their growth. In the longer run, therefore, university research will remain the principal source of new ideas for such inventions. [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words: why bother innovating when you can let someone else do it for you? Firms will still engage in the development half of R&amp;D, but this will take the form of translating existing findings into products, rather than breakthrough fundamental research. Arora &amp; Belenzon again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, the new innovation ecosystem exhibits a deepening division of labor between universities that specialize in basic research, small start-ups converting promising new findings into inventions, and larger, more established firms specializing in product development and commercialization (Arora and Gambardella, 1994). Indeed, in a survey of over 6,000 manufacturing- and service-sector firms in the U.S., Arora et al. (2016) find that 49 percent of the innovating firms between 2007 and 2009 reported that their most important new product originated from an external source.</p>
<p>…As a result, federal research dollars for the university sector grew from an estimated level of $420 million (1982 dollars) in 1935-1936 to more than $2 billion (1982 dollars) in 1960 and $8.5 billion in 1985. Between 1960 and 1985, the share of university research of GNP grew almost twofold from 0.13 to 0.25…. Corporate labs historically operated in an environment where university research and start-up inventions were scarce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arora &amp; Belenzon cites a 4.25x increase from 1960 to 1985. What about the years since? Courtesy of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20202/academic-r-d-in-the-united-states#:~:text=and%20Engineering%20Indicators-,Federal%20Support,HERD%202018%3A%20Table%201">NSF</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/h05J66oad5CGaw0QU4RYo-tix3lcIhDjg9pMjLiXXmbxryl0Vqdeu92A-zgqjHpsN4gcAnqWl-h3YJmwFzVwYhWoIOl4kFPyszyEL_9IrdBkt6qXSw38b7RRrHrNoOwE2XKwn6Nw"></p>
<p>Federal funding has continued to increase rapidly, up another 3.5x since 1985. For its part, institutional funding (meaning internal funding in the form of endowments, gifts and so on) has grown over 6x. Faced with this bounty, it’s no wonder firms lost their appetite for footing the bill themselves.</p>
<hr>
<p>To some extent, this is great news! The industrial research lab may be dead, but that doesn’t mean innovation is over, it’s just coming from universities instead. More funding means more science can get done, and who cares if it happens in industry or academia?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the research we see today is of a different nature. In a section titled “Inventions originating from large corporate labs are different”, Arora &amp; Belenzon enumerate the kinds of innovations we’ve lost in the shift towards university labs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corporate labs work on general purpose technologies</li>
<li>Corporate labs solve practical problems</li>
<li>Corporate labs are multi-disciplinary and have more resources</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, the paper is worth consulting for full details, but it suffices to say that different mechanisms for attracting, nurturing, and managing talent will result in different types of outputs. None of this is to say that the corporate labs were on balance superior to today’s university labs, merely that we are missing out on some innovations (and likely getting others in return).</p>
<p>Though more sensationally, it’s worth worrying that there’s been a profound exodus of top talent from research into industry. As <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rxS6kj5Zt0&amp;t=13m">Patrick Collison describes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing that I think is underemphasized is that [corporate research labs] competed on the basis of compensation. They just paid more than other potential sources of unemployment. PARC’s strategy for aggregating the best computer scientists in the world was to pay them more than they would be earning in academia. And in the 70s, you couldn’t Google and earn millions of dollars a year, Silicon Valley hadn’t really left the launchpad.</p>
<p>To a significant extent, the same thing applies to Bell Labs. They were quite explicit that their strategy was to compensate really well and present more favorable employment than academia… It could be the case that because there are so many high return loci for super talent people to go and deploy their talents, you could never quite aggregate talent to the same extent.</p>
<p>…it’s hard to think of any major successes from these kinds of labs over the last 10 or 15 years. [lightly paraphrased for clarity]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-04-14/this-tech-bubble-is-different">lamentation</a> goes, “The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.” It’s hard to prove that there has been a brain drain, but if so, it would indicate a strict loss in quality, as opposed to the more stylistic shifts Arora &amp; Belenzon describes.</p>
<hr>
<p>Bell Labs is dead, and it’s not coming back. Since  corporate labs are uniquely suited to some kinds of valuable research, this loss is troubling.</p>
<p>Where does that leave us?</p>
<p>One option is to attempt a massive overhaul of the entire system. If corporate labs have dwindled in the face of the government funded university system, we ought to redirect some portion of those tax dollars to industry instead and seek a better balance. To some extent, this already happens. DARPA awards funding to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2019-03-01">small businesses</a> through it’s Small Business Innovation Research grants, as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sbir.nih.gov/">does the NIH</a>.</p>
<p>Even here, corporate labs won’t have the same incentives they had in the glory days from 1940-1970. So long as the university system thrives, firms will pursue growth through innovations discovered externally.</p>
<p>In that light, I have a different proposal: Instead of reviving the corporate research lab out of nostalgia, we should consider the more specific goals these labs accomplished, and then target them directly. If we are eager for more multi-disciplinary or research more closely tied to practical problems, we ought to build institutions to pursue those particular aims.</p>
<p>Even more broadly, we can think of institutions as just one of many possible mechanisms to allocate human capital. Nadia’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.heliumgrant.org/">Helium Grants</a> are also a mechanism for talent allocation, as is venture capital, and as is Substack.</p>
<p>The scientific world is not merely a collection of modules that produce research in hermetic isolation. Rather, it is better understood as an interconnected ecosystem. Increased profitability in software may cause cost disease elsewhere. An exciting new topic in one field could cause a genius exodus in another. Without this understanding of how it all interacts, attempts to recreate a single piece of the 1960s without the supporting context are doomed from the start.</p>
<p>We should seek to understand conditions as they exist today, think deeply about the particular aims we wish to satisfy, then design improved mechanisms within a contemporary environment.</p>

<p><strong>Footnotes</strong><br>[1] Ben Southwood read the same paper as Rosenthal and came to the opposite conclusion: the decline was the result of too much antitrust enforcement. The two only appear correlated because success driven by corporate research leads to antitrust. His full quote is “Perhaps antitrust bodies will be restrained, and we will see the return of various large in-house labs.”, but my summary of the conclusion as optimistic still stands.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Frequently-Asked-Questions"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions" title="Frequently Asked Questions"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>What about Google Quantum?</strong><br>I’m horrifically unqualified to make this judgement, but this does stand out as an important achivement.</p>
<p>Jack Hidary of Google’s quantum computing initiatives <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wired.com/story/alphabet-second-secretive-quantum-computing-team/">once said</a>: “We literally created a spreadsheet of the experts in this space. We only came up with 800 names globally.” So maybe this is the exception that proves the rule, and Google was able to succeed precisely because there is not a thriving university system for quantum computing.</p>
<p>It’s also worth understanding the achievement as a result of Google’s partnership with NASA, though I don’t know the details of each party’s contributions.</p>
<p><strong>What about AI?</strong><br>Again, I’m not really confident here, but as I understand it, breakthroughs in AI consist largely of scaling up existing techniques, or inventing new techniques to enable greater scale.</p>

<p>You can spend a lot of time coming up with tactics and strategies for your communication, but the most valuable tool you can use is also the simplest: clarity.</p>



<p>If you communicate with clarity, people will spend less time trying to interpret what you’re saying. As a result, they’ll understand you faster, with less effort. </p>



<p>Make what you’re saying easy and quick to read and understand, and people will respond by reading more of it, and asking you fewer questions afterwards.</p>



<p>It helps to try and be a bit user-centered, or reader-centered. </p>



<span id="more-2242"></span>



<h2>Think about what your readers might already know</h2>



<p>The thing you want to communicate about already makes sense to you, and everyone on your team, because you’re immersed in it every day. You already have a crystal clear mental model to refer to.</p>



<p>But you can – and should – never assume that people reading about your work will have the same mental model. They might have a different model, if they are colleagues in the same organisation but not in the same team. They might have the same model, but see it from a different angle, if they are the leaders you report to.</p>



<p>Or they might have no mental model at all, if they are members of the public or strangers on the internet, or customers whose only model of your work is the end result that they see, from their end.</p>



<p>Every time you write something or create something that communicates about your work, you need to consider these varying mental models. Just as good web content is written for a reading age of 9, you will probably need to simplify your communication for most people, to make it as accessible as possible.</p>



<p>Try to understand their mental model of your work, and write to accommodate that. </p>



<h2>Write shorter sentences, with simpler words</h2>



<p>Writing with clarity doesn’t come naturally to everyone, but it’s something that develops with practice.</p>



<p>It’s hard to turn something complicated and full of nuance into short, simple statements. People tend to try and add lots of caveats, just in case. The result is often long sentences with lots of commas and clauses. Stuff that’s hard to read.</p>



<p>Your goal is to make everything easy to read.</p>



<p>If you’re struggling to picture what clear writing looks like, buy a copy of the <a href="https://ft.com/">Financial Times</a> or <a href="https://economist.com/">The Economist</a>. Pay attention to the way articles their are written, to the word choices and sentence structures. These are publications aimed at wealthy, educated people, but when you analyse <em>how</em> they’re written, you’ll see the goal is clarity. They take complicated news stories and make them easy to understand. Try to copy this style where you can.</p>



<h2>Constantly think about audiences</h2>



<p>A lot of communication fails because the same thing – a piece of text, or a video clip, or a presentation – is used over and over again to communicate to different audiences.</p>



<p>Understandably, writing separate texts for every different audience means more work, and most people don’t have time for that, so they skip it.</p>



<p>But that’s often the cause of the failure.</p>



<p>Communicating a team’s progress to a leader in the same organisation probably shouldn’t be the same as communicating a product’s progress to users. The messages are similar, and they overlap, but they’re not the same, and they shouldn’t be expressed in the same ways.</p>



<p>Communicating about an idea, or a proposal, to a prospective new client should not be the same as communicating the same idea to your team once you’ve won the work: again, the messages are similar and they overlap, but they’ll work better and be clearer if they’re written separately, with some thought given to the audience in each cast.</p>



<p>Good communication happens when you spend more time thinking about your different audiences, and more time preparing new variants of materials you’ve used before. Each new variant written with specific focus on what that audience needs to know.</p>



<h2>Communicate with purpose</h2>



<p>Before starting any new piece of communication work, I always ask: “What’s the purpose? What’s the point?”</p>



<p>Always start by thinking about what you want an audience to <strong>understand</strong>, <strong>know</strong>, or <strong>do</strong> after they’ve seen a piece of communication.</p>



<p>Knowing that helps you see the end result more clearly, sooner. It helps you avoid going down the wrong path, and focus the content of the comms on that goal, for that audience.</p>



<p>If you can’t identify and clearly express the purpose up front, stop working on it and find out why the purpose is so muddy. Sometimes, that will mean you stop completely; other times, it will help you and your colleagues re-think what this piece of comms is for, and create something better as a result.</p>



<h2>Clear communication helps teams solve problems</h2>



<p>Those audiences I’ve described: they might be your customers. Your funders. Your boss. Your boss’s boss.</p>



<p>They might be colleagues in your organisation, who want to make sure they’re not repeating work that you’re already doing.</p>



<p>They might be people in other organisations, who would love to learn from your mistakes.</p>



<p>They might be potential new recruits, who are keeping a close eye on your organisation and want to know what it’s really like to work there.</p>



<p>Every audience has slightly different needs, and knows slightly different things about you and your work. The only way to meet all these needs for all these people is to simplify.</p>



<p>Think about your audiences. Communicate often, in short bursts, about one thing at a time. Make sure there’s a reason for each new piece of communication to exist. Say what you mean. Be as clear as you can be. Your team will be more successful as a result.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago one of my brother-in-laws asked me about investing in Bitcoin (he knows I’m gearing up a <a href="https://bombthrower.com/newsletters/the-crypto-equity-advisor/">newsletter specifically about crypto equities</a>) and it made me wonder if we were near the top of this cycle. Sure enough, BTC has come off a good 25% off the peak, Ethereum is still holding up near all-time-highs. But it was that everyman-talking-Bitcoin dynamic that is almost a trope now. Starting with the possibly apocryphal story of Joseph Kennedy top-ticking the stock market in 1929 upon receiving hot tips from the shoe-shine boy ,the idea that when <strong>“normal people are getting rich, something has to be off”</strong> was almost conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>Now it’s not conventional wisdom, it’s Establishment Canon.</p>

<p>I trust you already know the story of <a href="https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets">/r/WallStreetBets</a> because even more everyday people are talking to me about Gamestop over the last 72 hours than Bitcoin (cryptos skyrocketing a mere 50% or 100% is quaint now. The slow lane).</p>
<p>Gamestop (et al) is where the action is now. At least until this morning.</p>
<p>The epic short squeezes had some hedge funds being carried out because their naked shorts have blown up. Reddit clamped down on WallStreetBets, briefly making the subreddit private and then re-opening it. I actually expect Reddit to suspend them, any second now. <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/reddits-wallstbets-goes-private-shortly-after-discord-shuts-down-server-51611792059">WallStreetBet’s Discord was shut down</a> (for “hate speech” – get used to hearing that one from now on) and as of this morning, Robinhood has suspended new long positions in Gamestop, AMC and a few other garbage stocks that hedge funds were shorting the hell out of.</p>
<p>As many are quick to comment…</p>
<h3>The hypocrisy at work this week is manyfold</h3>
<p>Barstool Dave Portnoy <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/you-can-not-purchase-additional-shares-robinhood-reportedly-removed-shuts-down-buying">is roasting RobinHood on Twitter</a> while another noted</p>
<blockquote>

<p>And in his letter this morning <a href="https://tomwoods.com/">Tom Woods</a> called it “<strong>The Gamestop Rebellion”</strong>, observing:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the average American suffers a loss, that’s a darn shame. If big players suffer a loss, shut everything down!</p></blockquote>
<p>Mike Swanson at WallStreetWindow<a href="https://wallstreetwindow.com/2021/01/we-saw-the-stock-market-dump-like-this-just-a-few-weeks-ago-mike-swanson-01-28-20210/"> assembled a truly dizzying set of charts</a> of the issues affected and noted the juxtaposition:</p>
<blockquote><p>These are all epic short squeezes and the traders on the internet, many of whom are apparently Robinhood traders, are celebrating and going wild, <strong>but on CNBC and much of the mainstream media there is outrage and a call for regulation as the short squeezes are crushing big money hedge funds short these stocks.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This is all indicative of a creeping two-tier system I’ve been writing about for years, and talk about <a href="https://bombthrower.com/join">on my mailing list</a>. Thanks <a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/get-used-to-living-under-subsidiarity-after-the-great-reset/">to The Great Reset</a>&nbsp; this now looks to be veritably enshrined in law under this asymmetrical governance structure euphemistically<a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/get-used-to-living-under-subsidiarity-after-the-great-reset/"> called The New Normal</a>.</p>
<p>The New Normal means the Fed will <a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/wait-why-is-the-fed-buying-my-biggest-competitors-bonds/">print up money to buy the bonds of worlds largest companies</a>, career politicians (or their spouses) <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/nancy-pelosi-husband-bought-apple-tesla-disney-stock-options-51611496598">will make millions buying up call options</a> of those very same companies.</p>
<p>The New Normal means that big box stores get to stay open while small and independent businesses are declared non-essential and ordered closed, indefinitely.</p>
<p>And then when the people on the wrong end of this stick get paid a pittance that amounts to asswipe money, and they push it into the stock market and end up making a killing, what happens?</p>
<p>The ref throws a penalty flag from the sidelines and the rules get changed.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZHTm0N59Rc">Jim Cramer talking with Pacific Capital’s Herb Greenberg</a> who vehemently calls what is happening “manipulation” and “illegal”, going so far to trot out the “<em>this could be the work of foreign powers”</em> card. Uh huh.</p>
<p>Cramer, for his part is being a bit more stoic about it, perhaps because he knows he’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI">on record and on film</a> describing how&nbsp;<em>he </em>routinely manipulated stocks back in his hedge fund days:</p>
<blockquote><p>“You know a lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund and I was positioned short meaning I needed it to open up, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures. It doesn’t take much money.</p>
<p>Similarly&nbsp; if I were long and I would want to make things a little bit rosy I would go in and take a bunch of stocks and make sure that they are higher,&nbsp; you know maybe commit five million in capital do it.</p>
<p><strong>And I could affect it.</strong> What you’re seeing now is maybe it probably is bigger market now, maybe any ten million capital <strong>and knock the stuff down</strong> <em><strong>but it’s a fun game and it’s a lucrative game “</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>No better example exists of&nbsp; <a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/jackpot-chronicles-3-the-great-bifurcation/">The Great Bifurcation</a> between Wall Street and Main Street than CNBC and Jim Cramer:</p>
<p>When Main Street companies lay off workers, it’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmSZaov9riU">the way of the world but the stock could be a buy</a>, but when a bunch of bankers and hedge funds blow themselves up because they levered up on bullshit derivatives that unceremoniously imploded, as Cramer’s now legendary meltdown during the GFC illustrates: <em>that’s</em> a crime against humanity.</p>
<center><br>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SWksEJQEYVU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><br>
This clip never gets old. It bears noting that in the opening seconds of Cramer’s meltdown were the words <em>“forget the investors”.</em> He’s beside himself with anxiety and rage <em>because it’s the bankers that are going down.</em>
<p>You don’t have to be reminded of this anymore, because WallStreetBets has forced it out into the open.</p>
<p>The system is structured so that Joe Public loses, and the Establishment always wins, even if they have to change the rules or endlessly move the goalposts to do it.</p>
<h3>Will WSB Be The Tipping Point that Changes Investor Psychology?</h3>
<p>I wonder if this entire chapter could be the tipping point toward a larger change in investor psychology. Not necessarily warning of an impending crash, but we are trading up here at heights that make nosebleed levels look rather tame.</p>
<p>How are the stunts pulled by WallStreetBets any different from money-losing unicorn pumps, SPACs, <em>ETFs of SPACs</em>?</p>
<p>Until now, investors were happy to go along with all this and pretend it was normal and sustainable. One of things WSB has done is shine a light on the insanity and manic euphoria. If what&nbsp;<em>they’re&nbsp;</em>doing is somehow offside or crazy, <em>so is everything else.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>In the 2008 GFC I was amazed at how fast the overall sentiment flipped over from&nbsp;<em>greed&nbsp;</em>to&nbsp;<em>fear.&nbsp;</em>What if one of the unexpected side effects of all this that investor sentiment shifts ever so slightly, as enough people think about getting more defensive, maybe taking some profits off the table, and looking sidelong toward the exits….?</p>

				<p>With in-person concerts on pause this past year, we at Genius have been working on <a href="https://live.genius.com/">Genius Live</a>, a new live streaming platform where fans control the show.</p><p>Polls are one of the core features, letting fans decide parts of the artist's setlist in real time. The format isn't set in stone yet, and we've been experimenting with the number of song choices and other factors.</p><figure><img src="https://genius.engineering/content/images/2021/01/poll_preview-3.png" alt="Cropped view of the Genius live interface for our show with Mariah the Scientist, highlighting the poll feature" srcset="https://genius.engineering/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/poll_preview-3.png 600w, https://genius.engineering/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/poll_preview-3.png 1000w, https://genius.engineering/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/poll_preview-3.png 1600w, https://genius.engineering/content/images/2021/01/poll_preview-3.png 1733w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A pre-show poll from our concert with Mariah the Scientist</figcaption></figure><h3 id="tie-breaking">Tie breaking</h3><p>During our <a href="https://genius.com/a/watch-wiz-khalifa-perform-in-the-first-ever-genius-live-interactive-concert">first show with Wiz Khalifa</a>, one of these setlist polls ended in a tie– 218 votes each for <a href="https://genius.com/Wiz-khalifa-medicated-lyrics">"Medicated"</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/Wiz-khalifa-the-kid-frankie-lyrics">"The Kid Frankie"</a>.</p><p>Our production team ended up resolving things behind the scenes, but the poll results still showed there had been a tie, confusing (and somewhat infuriating 😬) the audience. </p><figure><img src="https://genius.engineering/content/images/2021/01/comments_tiebreaker-3.png" alt="multiple YouTube chat messages: &quot;I SEE A TIE KID FRANKIE DID NOT LOSE&quot; and &quot;Tie play em both Gang Gang&quot;" srcset="https://genius.engineering/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/comments_tiebreaker-3.png 600w, https://genius.engineering/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/comments_tiebreaker-3.png 1000w, https://genius.engineering/content/images/2021/01/comments_tiebreaker-3.png 1467w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>In the weeks following the event, we spent a lot of time figuring out how to reduce the platform's overhead for our producers, and that had to apply to how we solved the tie problem as well. </p><p>As nice as it would be to have a human consider how to break a tie, I realized that it would not only burden the production team with extra responsibilities, but complicate all of the workflows that are supposed to be run when a poll ends. Not only does the artist have to perform one of these songs, but we have to update our data and video feeds accordingly. It's also just not very transparent! </p><p>We decided it'd be much simpler to have the system decide how to resolve a tie deterministically, using the timestamps of the most recent vote on each option.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure>

There are quite a few approaches detailed in the answers, all dealing with how to distribute the remainder and minimize statistical errors. </p><p>One of the most popular methods is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_remainder_method">Largest Remainder Method</a>. There are a couple of variations, but we went with a relatively simple one.</p><ol><li>Round each percentage down, and keep track of the decimal remainder</li><li>Take the sum of all the rounded percentages and get the margin of error from 100 </li><li>Distribute that margin to the percentages that had the highest decimal remainders</li></ol><p>Unfortunately, there are still edge cases where this doesn't work. What if all the decimal remainders are the same, like a 2-option poll with remainders of <code>0.5</code>, or a 3-way tie? Some proposed solutions include calculating and minimizing the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/34959983">relative error rate</a> (rounded-up percentage / total percentage - 1) instead, but even the mathiest solutions can't solve a 3-way tie on their own. 🤔</p><p>In writing test implementations, I realized we have a secondary factor that none of these algorithms do– the tie breaker logic! Combine this with a simplified approach to the relative error rate method, and we have a fairly straightforward way to distribute the margin of error. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure>

</p>
</figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>First we sort by the decimal remainder, then by the total vote count (this has basically the same effect as using the relative error rate, but is way simpler to implement), and finally by the last vote time.</p><p>Now we have an algorithm that can resolve ties in a way that's fair, consistent, and always adds up to 100%!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In recent years, drivers, activists, and entrepreneurs have envisioned what a fairer rideshare platform than Uber and Lyft might look like. The aim is to empower the individuals who sustain such services by creating an alternative that can deliver the convenience and benefits of peer-to-peer ridesharing without the exploitation that has become emblematic of the industry.</p>
            <p>Some observers wonder if Uber and Lyft are digging their own grave, with or without competition — or rather, that they’re doomed because of market forces and the venture-capital model that both companies are locked into. Uber lost <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/06/tech/uber-q4-earnings/index.html#:~:text=In%20total%2C%20Uber%20lost%20a,statement%20with%20the%20earnings%20report.">$8.5 billion</a> in 2019, the year it went public in an offering that was widely deemed a flop. Although the companies have diversified their businesses, branching out into services like urban bike rentals and restaurant delivery, they remain unprofitable, and with the self-driving cars that threaten to replace drivers nowhere near ready for market, it’s unclear how that will change.</p>
            <p>“It’s just a model that’s ripe for collapse,” said Trebor Scholz, an associate professor at the New School who chronicled gig workers’ travails in his 2016 book, <em>Uberworked and Underpaid</em>. “It’s not because somebody else outcompetes them. It’s just because you can’t run a business that loses that much money without having a clear perspective, and they don’t have that.”</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, many rideshare drivers are fed up with years of plummeting pay and being treated like commodities. A <a href="https://irle.berkeley.edu/files/2020/07/Parrott-Reich-Seattle-Report_July-2020.pdf">study</a> published last July found that Seattle drivers were averaging less than $10 an hour after expenses — below minimum wage. But successful alternative rideshare experiments remain “pretty few and far between,” according to transportation researcher Adam Stocker. He spent over a year <a href="https://arcade.city/files/ArcadeCity_FinalReport.pdf">studying</a> one such organization: <a href="https://arcade.city/">Arcade City</a>, a rideshare project whose flagship network in Austin, Texas, has become one of the most successful local alternative services in the US.</p>

            <p>Among those drawn to the challenge of creating a “decentralized Uber” are blockchain enthusiasts who imagine that distributed ledger technology can replace opaque corporate algorithms and empower drivers. The idea has been floated in crypto-enthusiast circles as a use case for blockchain since at least the early days of Ethereum, and has cropped up in <a href="https://uberpeople.net/threads/what-comes-after-uber-and-lyft.409535/">driver forums</a>. Though Christopher David, Arcade City’s founder, was initially <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/arcade-city-decentralized-blockchain-based-answer-to-uber">bullish</a> about the idea of establishing a rideshare service on something like Ethereum, the reality of the service ended up being quite different, and he acknowledges that decentralized technologies aren’t necessarily a silver bullet for the rideshare industry’s problems.</p>
            <p>“There’s this fantasy that riders and drivers are going to be connecting and a blockchain is going to be the only thing mediating their interactions, and I think that’s unrealistic,” he said. “That may happen at some point, but there’s a real need and desire for community, for people to feel that they are supported in this type of activity, which is inherently risky.”</p>
            <p>Arcade City launched in Austin in 2016, after Uber and Lyft lost an expensive battle against a local law requiring their drivers in the area to be fingerprinted. Complaining that such rules needlessly complicated the onboarding of new drivers, the companies had followed through on a threat to withdraw from the city. Thousands of drivers were suddenly unemployed, and riders were left stranded.</p>
            <p>A former Uber driver, David moved to Austin from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, after hearing about what was happening there. (“Horror stories of drunk people banging on windows waving cash, trying to get rides home,” he recalled. “It was that bad.”) While others eager to capitalize on Uber and Lyft’s Austin exit were still scrambling, he launched Arcade City as a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ArcadeCityAustin">Facebook group</a> with a driver who had previously run a small rideshare message board elsewhere, and their venture attracted thousands of members in the first few weeks. The technology was rudimentary — riders posted requests that drivers would respond to — but it worked well.</p>
            <div>
    
<figure><blockquote><p>Apart from devising rideshare technology and attracting riders and drivers away from the rideshare giants, the challenge of building equitable alternatives to Uber and Lyft involves determining how to structure a sustainable business model.</p></blockquote></figure>
  </div>
            <p>Although Uber and Lyft returned to Austin in 2017 after Texas passed a law overriding the local regulation of “transportation network companies” (following a regulatory model that the companies have successfully advocated for in most other states), Arcade City is the only alternative service remaining from Austin’s Uber-less period. “I think the fact that they’re the only service that survived the return of Uber and Lyft speaks volumes to the sustainability of a potential decentralized model for rideshare that’s not necessarily 100 percent profit-driven,” Stocker said.</p>
            <p>Arcade City fares in Austin ($2-3 per mile, $10 minimum) are typically more expensive than Uber or Lyft, which heavily subsidize rides, have larger driver networks, and rely on highly efficient algorithms. Still, the service has developed a loyal clientele, particularly among local service workers, many of whom like having the option to pay cash. It also has a loyal core of drivers; though many of them also drive for Uber, Stocker found that most prioritize Arcade City rides because they keep all of those fares versus only a fraction of Uber fares. And it includes a feature highly popular among riders and drivers alike: the option for riders to rebook a preferred driver, which gives drivers the ability to develop “regulars.”</p>
            <p>This feature, which Arcade City isn’t the only aspiring Uber competitor to offer, highlights the sometimes contradictory demands of customer satisfaction and Uber’s business model. Stocker notes that no technical barrier prevents Uber and Lyft from incorporating it, but doing so would chafe against their aim for maximum efficiency while complicating their position as privileged intermediaries. “The more you make truly peer-to-peer connections, the less transactions go directly through the platform,” he explained. “If you’re not trying to extract as much profit from every ride transaction as possible, you don’t necessarily need every transaction to go through your platform.”</p>

            <p>Today, Arcade City’s Austin network is still entirely operated by its drivers as a Facebook group. David is no longer involved in its day-to-day management, but he has tried experimenting with ways to adapt its model to decentralized technology and expand it elsewhere. A longtime cryptocurrency enthusiast, he did an Arcade City token sale in 2017 and <a href="https://arcade.city/state-of-the-city">has been working</a> on a corresponding app incorporating token functionality — projects that have <a href="https://medium.com/@CTUAgentIvan/arcade-city-is-a-scam-98c22c557f18">elicited controversy</a> online. But the enduring success of the Austin operation shows how community-based initiatives can take root.</p>
            <p>Last year, advocates of rideshare alternatives had hoped that California’s recent move to force Uber and Lyft to classify their workers as employees rather than independent contractors would lead the companies to withdraw from the state as they had from Austin, giving them a statewide opening that they could seize. The prospect of defeating <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_22,_App-Based_Drivers_as_Contractors_and_Labor_Policies_Initiative_(2020)">Prop 22</a>, a ballot initiative supported by the companies that would exempt them from the new law, looked like a potential watershed for the movement. Voters ultimately approved the measure, so this golden opportunity didn’t pan out, but the setback hasn’t dampened enthusiasm for developing rideshare alternatives. For many drivers, Uber and Lyft’s threat to leave California highlighted the precariousness of their livelihoods like never before.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Apart from devising rideshare technology and attracting riders and drivers away from the rideshare giants, the challenge of building equitable alternatives to Uber and Lyft involves determining how to structure a sustainable business model. The longest-lived Austin experiment after Arcade City, a service called Ride Austin, attempted a nonprofit structure <a href="https://communityimpact.com/austin/central-austin/impacts/2020/06/12/rideaustin-shuts-down-operations/">before shutting down</a> last summer. But Boston College sociologist Juliet Schor, whose recent book <em>After the Gig</em> reflects a decade of researching various “sharing economy” platforms, thinks another model is better: a cooperative. This basically refers to a democratically governed, worker-owned business as an alternative to shareholder-controlled companies. Under a cooperative, the operation of the business is dictated by the people who depend on it most.</p>
            <p>Arcade City is more of a peer-to-peer network than a proper co-op. While it seems to have done something right, Stocker realized in the course of his research that its weak point was its lack of effective governance; tensions among drivers ran high, and drivers complained that the service’s moderators sometimes deleted messages, picked favorites, or claimed rides for themselves. “Honestly, if someone was running the driver side who had a basic understanding of how to govern a company or a cooperative, I think that this group could be at a much larger scale than they are currently and just be operating much more smoothly,” Stocker said.</p>

                    <p>In 2018, Stripe released a study called the <a href="https://stripe.com/reports/developer-coefficient-2018">developer coefficient</a>. The report concluded that software engineering efficiency would cost 3 Trillion in GDP over the next ten years.</p><p>There are lots of great information in the paper, if you have time, you should take a look, but one statistic stood out for me as a developer.</p><blockquote>On average, 41% of developer's time is working on bugs, maintenance, and technical debt.</blockquote><p>As developers, you are most likely nodding your head in agreement or saying at my place of employment, it is more like 60% or 70%, or it should be because our system is drowning in complexity.</p><p>Some teams are known as high performing teams that regularly spend less than 20% of their time dealing with technical debt. How?</p><ul><li>At some point in the project, they implemented firm boundaries between their systems, separating standard services from application business logic.</li><li>Implemented automated, resilient test coverage</li><li>Implemented automated lifecycle deployment</li><li>And automated software lifecycle metrics</li></ul><p>Guess what? Without the first bullet, the next three are very hard to implement. There are plenty of buzz words about architecture styles, and preferences and those are excellent patterns for the specific use cases. Regardless of technology or architecture design, if you do not separate your business logic and rules from your implementation details, you will reach a point where the technical debt takes 41% and above your developer's time. As a result, the developer culture becomes an unproductive environment for most developers.</p><blockquote>hyper63 is a service framework that creates a firm boundary between your business logic/rules and your services (implementation details) so that development teams can focus on the work that drives value into the business.</blockquote><p>Whether you use hyper63 or implement service boundaries on your own, convince your team as early as possible to think about how developers should organize the application code so that you don't let technical debt become the bottleneck to your productivity and developer happiness.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.hyper63.com/content/images/2021/01/business-logic-with-api-hyper63-1.png"></figure>

If you appreciated this post, please consider <a href="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/signup">signing up here</a> for premium access to all posts.</strong></em></p><p>In early January, GameStop was trading around $18. By close today, it had reached $364.15. An intense buzz has formed in the stock thanks to discussion on the Reddit forum Wall Street Bets, further enhanced by dominant coverage in the media. At least one hedge fund, Melvin Capital, that was shorting GameStop (betting the price would fall) got <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/melvin-capital-closes-out-its-gamestop-position-cnbc-reports">utterly crushed</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.52.14-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.52.14-PM.png 600w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.52.14-PM.png 1000w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.52.14-PM.png 1600w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.52.14-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Some cheered the victory of Reddit and Robinhood over Wall Street.</p><p>But it isn't so simple.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>(If you'd like to skip the explanation and <a href="#questions">jump to my suggestions for the future, go here.</a>)</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>This mania started when a popular Reddit forum called Wall Street Bets began writing about some of the most "shorted" retail stocks. </p><blockquote>You can bet that the price of a stock will <em>fall</em> by taking on a short position. This requires you to <strong>borrow the stock </strong>from someone else first. Your broker then immediately sells the stock. Since you think the price will fall further, you're calm, cool, and collected. You wait to the price to fall more, and then you buy the stock <strong>back</strong> at a lower price, so you can return the shares to whoever you borrowed it from. </blockquote><p>Wall Street Bets publicly hatched a plan on the forum to buy and <strong>hold </strong>GameStop stock, and GameStop call options, in order to drive the price up so high, it would create a "short squeeze." A "short squeeze" is when a price jumps so high that the short sellers are forced to buy <em>back </em>the stock to close out their position (usually due to their broker requiring them to put up more cash because they're losing money so fast. This is a "margin call"). </p><p>All the attention and momentum from the press brought in more retail traders buying GameStop, and Wall Street itself hopped in for the ride. So many people buying call options also caused the people <em>selling</em> the Robinhood crowd those options to buy the stock in order to "hedge" their bets. </p><blockquote>One of the byproducts of both Robinhood and Wall Street Bets has been the popularization of trading options by retail traders. </blockquote><blockquote>A stock option is a derivative that gives you the <strong>right</strong> to buy or sell 100 shares of stock in the <strong>future</strong> at a set price. The price you have the right to buy or sell it at is the "strike price." The option has an <strong>expiration </strong>date. It also can be either a Call option (which gives you the right to buy the stock) or a Put option (which gives you the right to sell it). </blockquote><p>When you buy a Call option from a market maker, if that market maker doesn't already own the stock, they have to hedge their bet by buying the stock. So not only did you have all of these people on Robinhood buying GameStop stock, many were also buying GameStop call options. That meant the market makers on Wall Street were <strong><em>also</em></strong> buying GameStop stock in order to hedge their position.</p><p>It's worth noting that since the start of the pandemic, there's actually been a monumental <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-retail-investing-shorts-trading-options-deutsche-bank-2021-1-1030005344">increase</a> in retail traders buying call options:</p><figure><img src="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.58.10-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.58.10-PM.png 600w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.58.10-PM.png 1000w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.58.10-PM.png 1230w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>All of this drove the price of GameStop into the stratosphere.</p><p>We know that many Robinhood and Redditors are profiting off this. But they aren't the only ones. </p><h3 id="citadel-pays-for-order-flow-from-robin-hood-">Citadel pays for order flow from Robin Hood. </h3><p>Citadel is a massive hedge fund (founded by billionaire Ken Griffin) with three different firms: a tech firm, an asset manager, and a market maker. The market maker, <strong>Citadel Securities</strong>, pays Robinhood a pre-set fee for every trade they execute. &nbsp;(It's worth noting that Citadel isn't just <em>any </em>market maker. They're massive: handling <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-25/citadel-securities-expands-an-already-dominant-options-business?sref=f7rH2jWS">almost a quarter</a> of all listed (aka, exchange-traded) stock options.)</p><p>This is what's called a <strong>Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) </strong>arrangement.</p><p>Market markers can profit from these arrangements in a few different ways (read more <a href="https://centerpointsecurities.com/payment-for-order-flow-guide/">here</a> if you want the full details). But the best way to summarize it is this: Citadel can batch the Robinhood orders together, leverage its sophisticated high-frequency trading (HFT) algorithms to "front run" (buy shares "in front of" or before your client does) Robinhood trades. </p><p>Robinhood traders are generally not buying or selling options in "lots" (batches of 100); they're usually buying one or two or ten options at a time. So Citadel may batch a number of Robinhood users' options together, buy multiple "lots" themselves from another dealer, then fill the batch of Robinhood orders at a slightly worse price that what Citadel paid for it. </p><figure><img src="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.29.46-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.29.46-PM.png 600w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.29.46-PM.png 1000w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.29.46-PM.png 1566w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Image via<a href="https://centerpointsecurities.com/payment-for-order-flow-guide/"> Center Point Securities</a></figcaption></figure><p>Historically, there's been debate about whether or not Payment for Order Flow should even be allowed. The practice was actually originated by none other than Bernie Madoff (the famous ponzi scheme fraudster) in the 1980s. During the Obama administration, the SEC asked one of its market advisory commitees if Payment for Order Flow <a href="https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/equity-market-structure/issues-affecting-customers-emsac-012616.pdf">should be banned</a>. </p><p>Citadel has also gotten into trouble with the SEC in the past for the way it handled its Payment for Order Flow: In 2017, they <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-13/citadel-unit-to-pay-22-6-million-in-sec-settlement-over-trades">fined</a> Citadel Securities $22.6 million, "saying the firm inaccurately described how it handled trades placed by small investors," according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/payment-for-order-flow">Bloomberg</a>.</p><p>Some, like Institutional Investor magazine (a major Wall Street trade publication) have asked, essentially "who cares?" They <a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1m2p1cv68bx56/Twitter-Freaked-Out-Over-Robinhood-Selling-Its-Trade-Flow-But-the-App-and-Others-Have-Been-Doing-It-for-Years">noted in June 2020</a> that "payment-for-order-flow is nothing new" and that the practice is used by "<a href="https://capitalmarkets.fidelity.com/app/literature/item/9886428.html">Fidelity</a>, <a href="https://content.etrade.com/etrade/powerpage/pdf/OrderRouting11AC6.pdf">e*Trade</a>, <a href="https://content.schwab.com/drupal_dependencies/psr/606/final.pdf">Charles Schwab</a>, and <a href="https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/606_disclosure/tdainc-TDA2055-q1-2020.pdf">TD Ameritrade</a>, among others, SEC Rule 606 disclosures show." </p><p>But unlike the other firms that use this technique—Robinhood <strong>doesn’t publish data</strong> on how much price improvement it gives customers.</p><p>Not only that, but Robinhood wasn't initially honest about this arrangement:</p><ul><li>In December 2020, the SEC charged Robinhood with <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321">failing to disclose</a> that it was using this Payment for Order Flow model at all. The SEC also found that Robinhood was failing to provide "best execution" to its clients, thus <strong>costing them over $34 million</strong> due to "inferior trade prices," even when you factored in zero commissions. </li><li>Even FINRA, Wall Street's <em>self-regulating</em> overseer, also <a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2019/finra-fines-robinhood-financial-llc-125-million-best-execution">fined Robinhood in 2019</a> for “best execution violations related to its customers’ equity orders and related supervisory failures.” Robinhood paid a $1.25 million fine, but did not admit or deny any wrongdoing.</li></ul><blockquote>Robinhood is a broker, and as such, is obligated to provide its clients with "best execution" on their trade. This means the broker must put their clients' interests first, and try and get either the best price or fastest execution, and not send their orders to the market maker paying them the best price for order flow. </blockquote><h3 id="citadel-is-the-dominant-market-maker-used-by-robinhood">Citadel is the dominant Market Maker Used by Robinhood</h3><p>Citadel is not the <em>only </em>market maker that Robinhood uses, but it's the largest one. It accounts for the majority of its stock executions, and more than 55% of its equity option executions, <a href="https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf">as of July 2020</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.34.25-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.34.25-PM.png 600w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.34.25-PM.png 1000w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.34.25-PM.png 1600w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.34.25-PM.png 2122w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf" rel="noopener">Robinhood Securities SEC Rule 606 and 607 Disclosure</a>, July 2020</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>Sidebar: What's a market marker?</em></strong></p><blockquote>Market makers are the people who sit as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. When you want to buy, they're there to sell to you. When you want to sell, they stand ready to buy. They make money off of the "flow," and they carefully hedge all the positions they take on in order to manage the risk of their portfolio. </blockquote><h3 id="robinhood-citadel-melvin-capital-and-point72">Robinhood, Citadel, Melvin Capital, and Point72</h3><p>So Citadel is a hedge fund whose Market Making arm is handling the majority of Robinhood orders. Meanwhile, another hedge fund, Melvin Capital, was one of the funds caught in the GameStop short squeeze. This week, they finally had enough, and had to close out their short position for a big loss. </p><p>Who stepped in to buy up a piece of Melvin Capital after that happened? </p><p>None other than Citadel Securities' parent, Citadel LLC. The WSJ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340">reported on Monday</a>:</p><blockquote>Citadel LLC and Point72 Asset Management are investing $2.75 billion in hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, an emergency influx of cash that is expected to stabilize what has been one of the top performing funds on Wall Street.</blockquote><p>Who's the other party that gave cash to Melvin Capital? Point72, the new investment advisory firm for Steve Cohen. Cohen's former hedge fund SAC Capital, the firm that <a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/11/04/after-a-decade-sac-capital-blinks/">pled guilty to insider trading</a> in 2013 (though Cohen himself emerged without admitting guilt). It's also worth noting that Melvin Capital is run by Gabriel Plotkin, who was one of SAC capital's top traders. Cam Karsan has some <a href="https://twitter.com/jam_croissant/status/1353991973342998528">further thoughts</a> on the Citadel/Point72 rescue of Melvin <a href="https://twitter.com/jam_croissant/status/1353991973342998528">here</a>.</p><h3 id="wall-street-loves-data">Wall Street Loves Data</h3><p>It's important to remember that Wall Street is a data machine. Wall Street will use data from every avenue it can to try to make predictions about what is going to happen next in the market. They hoover up data to feed their models, in order to make valuation decisions, and in order to arrive at what is the best most accurate price of something. I remember one of the traders that I used to work with used to pull up every lot of different news sources including the Drudge Report, which I thought was ridiculous. But he said, "look, I want to get news from every place I can and I want to understand what people from all different kinds of points of view are thinking." Traders seek information and rumors and tips like heat-seeking missiles. </p><p>Usually, traders use expensive vendors to supply them with quotes to feed into their models. Some of those quotes come from financial intermediaries (called "inter-dealer brokers") whose only purpose in life is to mask the orders of the big banks, so they can trade with each other with some degree of anonymity. (I learned in my time on Wall Street that with enough pressure, some inter-dealer brokers would admit who was on the other side of the trade).</p><p>Wall Street loves data, but they also loathe other people finding out their data and their order flow.

      <p><img src="https://matthealy.com/assets/images/posts/2021-01-03-kindle/kindle.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p>From a piece my friend Naveen wrote a while back called <a href="https://x.naveen.com/post/82921168991/wearables-versus-thereables" target="_blank">Wearables versus there-ables</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>What if we didn’t have to / weren’t meant to carry our technology with us as we moved around town?</p>
        <p>What if the technology was actually already in the room when we got there?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>As he points out, a lot of tools that used to be separate have now converged into one: the phone. You might not buy another camera again, and you probably won’t buy a calculator. For the most part, it’s a good trade-off: what we lose in the tactile pleasures of a good single-purpose device, we gain back tenfold in having all those devices in our pocket all the time.</p>
      <p>That’s all fine for calculators, cameras, music players, and the like —&nbsp;things that are there when we need to use them, and can forget about when we don’t. But our phones are also the nexus of all kinds of data we want pushed to us —&nbsp;news, messages, notifications, alerts, status updates. Things we want to know about without going looking for them.</p>
      <p>A phone isn’t actually great for this kind of ambient awareness. It’s usually in a pocket or purse, so the ways it can get our attention are limited: a buzz, a notification on the lock screen, a red dot on an app icon. I can choose to let myself be interrupted, or I can compulsively check in to see what the latest alerts might be.</p>
      <p>I’ve found myself wanting a less intrusive channel for ambient data. Something I can glance at in passing, without giving my full attention or opening myself up to whatever other interruptions my phone might have in store. It should be easy to check, but just as easy to ignore.</p>
      <p>This is the device I landed on: a wifi-connected Kindle 4, mounted on the wall in a simple laser-cut acrylic frame. Once a minute, it loads a screenshot of a web page I built that shows a few different kinds of data I want easy access to: calendar events, weather, the status of packages I’ve ordered, etc.</p>
      <p><img src="https://matthealy.com/assets/images/posts/2021-01-03-kindle/kindle-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p>I experimented a lot before landing on this setup. I’m very happy with the result, and even more happy with how easy it is to put together. A used Kindle is the only hardware required, and you can pick up a serviceable one from eBay or <a href="https://www.backmarket.com/search?q=kindle%204&amp;ga_search=kindle%204">BackMarket</a> for $30 or less.</p>
      <p>The setup process has a few steps, but if you’ve used a command line before, you can totally do it.</p>
      <p>But first, some explanation:</p>
      <p><a href="#build-your-own">I don’t care, just skip to the instructions</a></p>
      <h3 id="why-e-ink">Why e-ink?</h3>
      <p>For me, an e-ink screen is the most important part of this device. E-ink has some limitations (it’s black and white, it’s slow to refresh), but for my purposes here those are fine. The beauty of e-ink is its ability to fade into the background. It doesn’t give off light like a backlit screen would. When the light in the room is dim, it doesn’t call attention to itself.</p>
      <p>An e-ink display feels more like a poster on your wall than a computer. When you don’t need to look at it, you can forget it’s there, unlike a backlit screen.</p>
      <h3 id="why-a-kindle">Why a Kindle?</h3>
      <p>This device needs a few things: a good-sized e-ink screen, a processor to put stuff on that screen, and a wi-fi connection. A jailbroken Kindle (more on what jailbreaking is later) is perfect for the job: it packs all of these things into an impressively small package, and it’s super cheap. You could build something similar with e.g. a Raspberry Pi and a standalone e-ink screen, but the parts would cost at least $150, and the final product would be much bulkier.</p>
      <h3 id="why-a-screenshot-of-a-web-page">Why a screenshot of a web page?</h3>
      <p>The Kindle is actually a pretty capable little computer. It runs a Linux-based OS, and once it’s jailbroken, you can access a command line and do lots of things you could do in Linux anywhere else. In previous iterations of this project, I had a lot of code running on the Kindle itself, fetching data and drawing stuff to the screen. There are limitations though, and also updating the code on the device is kind of a pain in the butt.</p>
      <p>The nice thing about having it just display a web page is I can easily make updates without having to mess with the Kindle itself. Also, it’s way easier to make a flexible layout in HTML and CSS than when you’re drawing things on the screen manually.</p>
      <p>The Kindle actually has a built-in web browser, which would ALMOST be enough on its own. You could just build a web page, point the browser to it, and stick it up on the wall. There are three problems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Left to its own devices, the Kindle will go to sleep after a while, and show its screensaver.</li>
        <li>If you want to be able to update the data on the screen, the page needs to automatically reload itself.</li>
        <li>The Kindle browser has some unsightly elements (the header and URL bar) that can’t be hidden. Not the worst, but not as pretty as I’d like.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My solution was to run a server that takes a screenshot of a webpage (easier than it sounds), and have the Kindle download that screenshot once a minute.</p>
      <p>There are services that will take screenshots of a website for you, but they tend to charge per screenshot, which gets pretty pricey (I like to just have the Kindle refresh once a minute, which means more than 40,000 times per month). Instead, I wrote my own little server that uses Puppeteer to take screenshots and ImageMagick to convert them. It’s open source, and you can run it yourself on Heroku for free. One-click installation instructions below.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="build-your-own">Build your own</h3>
      <p>If you’re even a little bit familiar with using a command line, you can make your own. I’ll focus on how to get a screenshot of a web page displaying on the Kindle. The display I built for myself shows a few different kinds of data I like having easy access to, each of which warrants its own blog post. You can get started with something simple, like your favorite weather or news site.</p>
      <p>The only fiddly part is setting up the Kindle itself, which is why we’ll make sure you only have to do it once.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Get a Kindle</strong></p>
          <p>I’ve mostly used the 4th generation (non-touchscreen) Kindle, because it gets the job done and can be found pretty cheap on eBay. You can also check <a href="https://www.backmarket.com/tested-and-certified-used-e-reader-amazon-kindle-4th-gen-wifi-2gb-gray/102143.html#l=0">BackMarket</a>, where the stock varies a bit but I’ve often seen 4th-gen Kindles for around $30.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Set up the image server</strong></p>
          <p>You can use my script to do this —&nbsp;the source for it is <a href="https://github.com/lankybutmacho/web-to-kindle">here</a> if you’d like to host it somewhere yourself, but the easiest option is to create a free Heroku account and then click this button to deploy it:</p>
          <p><a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/lankybutmacho/web-to-kindle" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy"></a></p>
          <p>You’ll be prompted to name your project (call it whatever you want), and to enter the URL of the page you want to display on your Kindle. You can change that URL later by opening your Heroku project and going to Settings &gt; Config Vars.</p>
          <p>Once you’re done deploying, take note of the server’s URL. If you used Heroku, it’ll be something like <code>https://the-name-you-picked.herokuapp.com/</code></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Connect your Kindle to Wi-fi</strong></p>
          <p>Press the Menu button (☰), then choose “View” next to “Wi-fi Networks”. Select your home network, and enter the password if there is one.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Jailbreak your Kindle</strong></p>
          <p>We need to be able to run custom software on the Kindle, which you can’t do out of the box, so we’ll need to “jailbreak” it. This is where it might start to sound daunting, but it’s not actually very hard —&nbsp;in part because there’s a very devoted community of nerds who have figured out how to do it for every Kindle model, and fastidiously maintain instructions with no promise of reward or recognition. You gotta love the internet sometimes.</p>
          <p><a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle_Hacks_Information#Jail_break_JB">This wiki page</a> has a lot of Kindle-hacking information, but all we care about is the Jailbreak section. It links to two different forum posts, which are where the jailbreak info is kept up to date. There’s one for older Kindles (Kindle 2, DX, DXG, Kindle 3, and Kindle 4), and one for more modern Kindles — make sure you get the right one. The instructions in the forum post change from time to time, but you’re looking to download the zip file with “jailbreak” in the name that’s the one for your Kindle model.</p>
          <p>You’ll follow the included instructions, but the TL;DR version is that you open the zip file, plug your Kindle in via USB, copy files over, and then restart it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Install USBNetwork</strong></p>
          <p>Once the Kindle is jailbroken, we’ll need one more thing in order to access it via command line: USBNetwork. You’ll find it in the same forum post where you found the Jailbreak download link. The process for installing is slightly different here —&nbsp;read the instructions, but what you’ll need to do is plug the Kindle in, copy the <code>.bin</code> file over, and then launch it by going to [Menu] -&gt; Settings -&gt; [Menu] -&gt; Update Your Kindle.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Add the script to download images</strong></p>
          <p>Next up is to access the Kindle via the command line so we can set up our script to download images. First, we need to enable USBNetwork to allow command-line access via USB:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Disconnect your Kindle from your computer</li>
            <li>Press the keyboard button on the Kindle, and type <code>;debugOn</code> (make sure to get the semicolon at the beginning), and then enter (↵) to enable debug mode.</li>
            <li>Press the keyboard button again, and type <code>~usbNetwork</code> and hit enter (↵). It may pause for a second. Once it’s done, press keyboard, type <code>;debugOff</code> and hit enter.</li>
            <li>Reconnect your Kindle to your computer via USB.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>From a command line on your computer (i.e. in the Terminal app on a Mac):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Type <code>ssh <a href="https://matthealy.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="3f4d50504b7f0e060d110e0907110e0a110d0b0b">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code> and hit enter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>You’ll be prompted for a password. The default password is <code>mario</code>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>You’re in! One more thing before we can do anything: by default, the Kindle’s drive is mounted in read-only mode. To make it writeable, type <code>mntroot rw</code> and hit enter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Create the image-downloading script:</p>
              
              <p>This will create an empty file for your script and open it …</p></li></ul></li></ol></article></div>

Hosts like these build your website automatically every time you push changes to a connected online <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git</a> repository, rather than forcing you to put together your own build chain as is required by the slightly older <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare Workers Sites</a> as well as Google’s <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase</a>.</p><p>That said, it’s obvious from looking at the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation</a> that Cloudflare Pages is built on a lot of the same “plumbing” as are Workers Sites. That’s good news. Workers Sites, thanks to Cloudflare’s <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-kv-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workers KV storage</a>, put websites’ content out on the network’s worldwide “edge” with Cloudflare’s <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of points of presence (POPs)</a> and, thus, enhance those sites’ performance.</p><p>Intrigued by what I perceived as the promise of Cloudflare Pages (hereafter abbreviated as <em>CFP</em>), I signed up for its beta program on the day of the announcement; and, earlier this week, I finally gained access. Here’s a summary of my first impressions. Please keep in mind as you read these, as well as any other such preliminary reviews you may find right now, that <strong>this product is in beta</strong>.</p><h2 id="slow-build-process">Slow build process</h2><p>I have two for-testing-only repositories that I use on multiple vendors, so tests among them are as “apples-<em>vs.</em>-apples” as possible. One is based on <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo</a> and the other on <a href="https://11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eleventy</a>.</p><p>I figured building the Hugo-based site might be more problematic since the build process couldn’t simply rely on a <code>package.json</code> file’s dependencies list, as in the case of the Eleventy-based site. In truth, once I followed the documentation sufficiently, the Hugo site’s build went fine, with one exception: CFP’s default Hugo version at the time I was testing was a relatively ancient 0.54.0. Fortunately, the CFP UI lets you add environment variables to the build process, so I added one that set <code>HUGO_VERSION</code> to <code>0.80.0</code> (the current Hugo version as of this post’s initial publication). While the docs didn’t specify that particular variable as an option, it worked; and, to CFP’s credit, it grabbed the <em>extended</em> version of Hugo, which is necessary for the SCSS I use in that particular repo.</p><p>The Eleventy-based repo did, indeed, build with no problems due to the build process’s reading and following the <code>package.json</code> file.</p><p>So much for the good stuff about the build process; now for the bad stuff. Right now, the beta build process is <strong>really slow</strong>. Here’s a breakdown of the first successful build for each repo, with each time segment in <code>min:sec</code> form. The titles for each action are directly from the CFP logs for these builds, except that I capitalized “Git” and the logs didn’t.</p><h3 id="hugo">Hugo</h3><p><em>(Note that this repo uses only SCSS, while the other repo includes PostCSS and Tailwind CSS, so it’s understandable that this one builds more quickly than the other.)</em></p><ul><li>Initializing build environment: 2:31</li><li>Cloning Git repository: 0:03</li><li>Building application: 0:07</li><li>Deploying to Cloudflare’s global network: 0:25</li><li><strong>Total build time: 3:07</strong></li></ul><h3 id="eleventy">Eleventy</h3><ul><li>Initializing build environment: 3:07</li><li>Cloning Git repository: 0:04</li><li>Building application: 0:53</li><li>Deploying to Cloudflare’s global network: 0:19</li><li><strong>Total build time: 4:24</strong></li></ul><h3 id="comparisons">Comparisons</h3><p>So how do these compare with CFP’s eventual competitors? Here’s how a virtually identical<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Eleventy-based repo did on its most recent builds on them:</p><ul><li><strong>Netlify</strong>: 0:26</li><li><strong>Vercel</strong>: 0:23</li><li><strong>Render</strong>: 0:37</li><li><strong>DigitalOcean App Platform</strong>: 0:40</li></ul><p>As for the less “automatic” ones that I handle via <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Actions</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Cloudflare Workers Sites</strong>: 1:55</li><li><strong>Firebase</strong>: 1:24</li></ul><p>So, clearly, the CFP folks have a lot of work to do on this part of it; and, based on a conversation I had with a Cloudflare staffer on the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/meet-the-workers-team-over-discord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare Workers Discord server</a>, they’re all too aware of that.</p><h2 id="fine-online-performance">Fine online performance</h2><p>However, once you do get your repo past that slow build, the resulting site does very well online. Here are some of the results I got for the Eleventy-based repo, and please be assured these are <em>very</em> good as compared to how a virtually identical repo does on Vercel, Netlify, Render, DigitalOcean App Platform, Cloudflare Workers Sites, and Firebase.</p><ul><li><p><strong>webpagetest.org</strong>, median from three runs</p><ul><li><strong>Site: California (EC2).</strong></li><li><a href="https://web.dev/time-to-first-byte/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Time to first byte</a>: 75 milliseconds.</li><li>Document complete: 311 milliseconds.</li><li>Document fully loaded: 337 milliseconds.</li><li><a href="https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First contentful paint</a>: 381 milliseconds.</li><li><a href="https://web.dev/speed-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speed index</a>: 471 milliseconds.</li><li><a href="https://web.dev/lcp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Largest contentful paint</a>: 931 mulliseconds.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>GTMetrix</strong>, second of two runs</p><ul><li><strong>Site: San Antonio, Texas.</strong></li><li>Time to first byte: 144 milliseconds.</li><li>Onload time: 350 milliseconds.</li><li>First contentful paint: 364 milliseconds.</li><li>Time to interactive: 365 milliseconds.</li><li>Speed index: 0.5 seconds.</li><li>Largest contentful paint: 1.0 second.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Dotcom-Monitor Dotcom-Tools</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Site: San Francisco.</strong><ul><li><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google PageSpeed</a> performance score: 100.</li><li>Load time, first visit: 0.5 seconds.</li><li>Load time, second visit: 0.7 seconds.</li><li>First contentful paint: 0.5 seconds.</li><li>Time to interactive: 0.5 seconds.</li><li>Speed index: 0.6 seconds.</li><li>First meaningful paint: 0.5 seconds.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Site: Northern Virginia.</strong><ul><li>Google PageSpeed performance score: 100.</li><li>Load time, first visit: 1.1 seconds.</li><li>Load time, second visit: 0.5 seconds.</li><li>First contentful paint: 1.5 seconds.</li><li>Time to interactive: 1.5 seconds.</li><li>Speed index: 1.6 seconds.</li><li>First meaningful paint: 1.5 seconds.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Site: London.</strong><ul><li>Google PageSpeed performance score: 100.</li><li>Load time, first visit: 1.0 seconds.</li><li>Load time, second visit: 0.9 seconds.</li><li>First contentful paint: 0.9 seconds.</li><li>Time to interactive: 0.9 seconds.</li><li>Speed index: 1.2 seconds.</li><li>First meaningful paint: 0.9 seconds.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Site: Mumbai.</strong><ul><li>Google PageSpeed performance score: 100.</li><li>Load time, first visit: 2.0 seconds.</li><li>Load time, second visit: 1.0 seconds.</li><li>First contentful paint: 1.3 seconds.</li><li>Time to interactive: 1.3 seconds.</li><li>Speed index: 2.1 seconds.</li><li>First meaningful paint: 1.3 seconds.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Site: Brisbane.</strong><ul><li>Google PageSpeed performance score: 100.</li><li>Load time, first visit: 1.5 seconds.</li><li>Load time, second visit: 0.3 seconds.</li><li>First contentful paint: 0.9 seconds.</li><li>Time to interactive: 0.9 seconds.</li><li>Speed index: 1.1 seconds.</li><li>First meaningful paint: 0.9 seconds.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>One thing that CFP doesn’t yet let you do (and, to Cloudflare’s credit, you’re warned about it in the CFP docs) is set up cache-handling for static assets. I suspect that will come, especially since there are ways to do it in Cloudflare Workers Sites, but it’s not there yet.</p><h2 id="getting-ready-to-lead">Getting ready to lead?</h2><p>Once Cloudflare gets CFP’s build processes up to snuff, CFP should give its competitors a serious run for their respective money, especially when you consider its free tier’s <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/limits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generous limits</a>. (The Netlify free tier, in particular, doesn’t fare well in that comparison.) With the built-in advantages of Cloudflare’s CDN and what Cloudflare has already established for Workers Sites and KV storage, the Cloudflare Pages offering should be able to make some major waves as it joins what already is a highly competitive group.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Slightly related side note</strong></em>: Looks like Render is completing its <a href="https://community.render.com/t/cdn-vendor-change-timing-and-choice/71" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously touted</a> CDN vendor transition to <a href="https://fastly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fastly</a>. Earlier this week, as part of testing CFP, I compared the <code>ping</code> times of my CFP test sites with those of my comparable sites on other vendors. When I got to the Render-based site, I noticed that the returning data mentioned <code>render.map.fastly.net</code>. In my own tests so far, I could definitely see improved performance over what I was getting a few weeks back. While Render still has some issues that prevent me from rating it higher in this hosting category, its move to Fastly (a move which may still be unfinished for some accounts) is an unalloyed win.</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>It’s not <em>the</em> same repo that I use with the other hosts because that repo is already set up for Cloudflare Workers, and the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/migrations/migrating-from-workers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare Pages documentation suggests that’s a bad idea</a>. I thus cloned that repo and removed all the Workers stuff, after which I used the “new” repo with only CFP. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><h2 id="420b">What is Ballista and what kind of problems does it solve?</h2><p id="76fd">Ballista is a distributed compute platform with a current focus on executing ETL (extract, transform, and load) jobs based on queries which are defined using either a DataFrame API, SQL, or a combination of both.</p><p id="60ee">Ballista is implemented in Rust and powered by Apache Arrow.</p><h2 id="af24">What are the main advantages of using Apache Arrow technologies?</h2><p id="4c2c">In my opinion, there are quite a few advantages in using Apache Arrow for this project.</p><p id="c200">The Arrow memory format is optimized to support vectorized processing of columnar data and therefore enables significant performance improvements over row-based processing, especially when taking advantage of hardware that natively supports vectorized processing, such as SIMD and GPU.</p><p id="6615">Arrow also provides a â€œFlightâ€� protocol, designed to enable Arrow data to be streamed efficiently (without <a href="https://docs.serde.rs/serde/" rel="noopener">serde</a> overhead) between processes, and Ballistaâ€™s executors implement this protocol.</p><p id="5443">In addition to these benefits, Arrow is a standard that is becoming adopted more widely over time, so designing Ballista from the ground-up to be Arrow-native helps ensure compatibility with other projects in the ecosystem.</p><h2 id="8e2a">What are advantages of an implementation based on Apache Arrow over native data structures?</h2><p id="0571">Arrow offers a mature type system and in-memory format for representing columnar data that has been tested and refined over many years, so I think this helps accelerate the development of the Ballista platform since there is no need to reinvent the wheel. It also ensures efficient compatibility with other projects that have also adopted Apache Arrow.</p><h2 id="71ba">Can you tell us more about the Ballista query engine?</h2><p id="8ed7">Sure. Ballista is based on the Volcano design but has less overhead as a result of being designed to process batches of columnar data. Its design is very much inspired by Apache Spark but with a focus on being language-agnostic so that it can efficiently support popular programming languages such Python, Java, and C++.</p><h2 id="f606">Ballista has a very similar usage to Apache Spark, what are the main advantages of Ballista over it?</h2><p id="e3aa">The main advantages of Ballista (at least, once it is more mature) are:</p><p id="ddf3"><strong>Columnar Design</strong></p><p id="3168">Although Apache Spark does have some support for columnar processing, it is still largely row-based. Because Ballista is natively columnar and is implemented in a systems level language, it can take advantage of vectorized processing with SIMD and GPU.</p><p id="2eed"><strong>Language Agnostic</strong></p><p id="941a">Apache Spark is implemented in Scala and tends to have a Scala-first approach, with other languages paying a penalty to interact with Spark due to overheads of serde. Ballista has been architected to use language-agnostic protocols and serialization formats to avoid this.</p><p id="7cfd"><strong>Memory Efficiency</strong></p><p id="2d16">Because Ballista is implemented in Rust, there are no GC pauses, and performance is very consistent and predictable. The combination of Rust and Arrow also results in much lower memory usage than Apache Spark â€” up to 5x lower memory usage in some cases. This means that more processing can fit on a single node, reducing the overhead of distributed compute.</p><h2 id="f9a8">How does it compare to Dask?</h2><p id="4a9a">I actually do not have any experience with Dask yet, although it has been on my â€œto doâ€� list for a while now. I have heard a lot of positive things about Dask and I am sure that I could learn a lot from this project.</p><p id="b951">Dask is obviously Python-centric, so I suspect that is going to be the main differentiator. Although the Ballista scheduler is being implemented in Rust, it is designed to work with executors implemented in any language due to the use of Arrowâ€™s Flight protocol, and Google Protocol Buffers to represent query plans and scheduler tasks.</p><h2 id="181d">What are the reasons behind the choice of Rust as the main execution language?</h2><p id="1f4b">The reason that I started this project (first with DataFusion at the start of 2018, and now with Ballista) is that I have become frustrated over the years with the proliferation of Big Data tools built in JVM languages. I understand the reasons for this â€” Java, and especially Kotlin and Scala, are productive languages to work in, the ecosystem is very mature, and skills are widespread. However, it really isnâ€™t the best language for these platforms. The most obvious alternative has been C++ for a long time, but I thought it would be really interesting to see what was possible with Rust.</p><p id="4392">I see Rust as being a good compromise between Java and C++. It has the memory-safety of Java (but implemented in a very different way) and the performance and predictability of C++.</p><p id="4ece">The cost of compute can be very high with Big Data platforms, so it makes sense to use a language that can make efficient use of the available memory and processing power on each node. In some cases, Ballista uses a fraction of the memory of an equivalent Apache Spark job, and this means that each node in a cluster can process a multiple of the amount of data that Spark can support, resulting in smaller clusters that are utilized more effectively.</p><h2 id="4134">Apache Spark has MLlib, a library for handling Machine Learning projects. What features does Ballista offer for these tasks?</h2><p id="6f95">So far, the focus of Ballista has very much been on ETL workloads. There have been some discussions about supporting ML workloads but this is an area that I do not have experience with so I am hoping that once Ballista is a little more mature in terms of ETL processing then we can start to look at other areas like ML and listen to what the current pain points are.</p><h2 id="fe64">What will be the main areas of focus for future releases?</h2><p id="07d9">The main focus now is getting the platform to a level of maturity where users can run real-world ETL workloads, using the TPC-H benchmarks to measure progress.</p><h2 id="a959">Beyond performance, what are the next goals for the Ballista project?</h2><p id="bec6">Personally, I think that the most important goal for the Ballista project is to build a community around it. It started out as a personal side-project but I can only commit a relatively small number of hours each weekend to work on the project, and that time is better spent on writing requirements and building a community than trying to code everything myself.</p><p id="ab1d">To this end, I have started a weekly newsletter, named <a href="https://ballistacompute.org/this-week-in-ballista/" rel="noopener">â€œThis Week in Ballistaâ€�,</a> to share news about progress and where help is needed. I am mostly spending my time on the project on tasks such as filing issues and responding to questions in Discord. I am also prototyping new features and then asking for help from the community to complete them.</p><h2 id="d4da">Do you have any book recommendations on distributed computing?</h2><p id="d112">Last year, I wrote <a href="https://www.andygrove.io/2020/02/how-query-engines-work/" rel="noopener">â€œHow Query Engines Workâ€�</a>, which is an introductory guide to query engines and it does cover distributed computing at a high level. I would be hesitant in recommending this book specifically to learn about distributed computing though, since it doesnâ€™t have very much content on this subject yet, although I do plan on extending the content once Ballista is farther along.</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

      <article>
        

        <p>It was a slow descent, after a childhood of abusive parents and trauma.</p>

<p>In the years before John’s flight to Syria and eventual death in a drone strike, his Facebook posts devolved into angry YouTube videos and hatred toward “infidels” in Canada and the USA.</p>

<figure>
    <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1t0YesVmizM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center>
</figure>

<p>The last time I talked to John, I knew the secret service had been investigating him for months and that he had already left for Syria. Our last chat is surreal to read in hindsight; I come off as extremely nonchalant at his mention of Syria. I remember trying hard to stay cool and play it off, fearful of John’s wrath should he come back—after all, he knew where my family lived and my little sister was still at home.</p>

<p>John and I connected because we were jazzed about biology. He wanted to major in it at McGill while I did biochem and we tried our hand at a pharma company. We’d play pickup hockey, jam in my basement, make YouTube videos, and cook up startup schemes. But a year and a half out of high school found him converted to Islam and us locked in debate for hours, now about whether the Qur’an was the only true science left in the world. By this time John had changed his name to Yahya, grown a beard, stopped playing music—now a sin, the devil’s work designed to distract us from our purpose—and had developed an Arabic accent as you can hear in the video.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://jaan.io/images/dont-become-data-for-AI/chat.svg">
    <figcaption>My last chat with one of my best friends John (Yahya).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I sometimes wonder what we could learn from an audit of John’s Facebook newsfeed over the course of his radicalization, considering that I did research internships at Google Brain and DeepMind and completed a significant part of my PhD on recommender systems. While the Facebook posts we saw from John were increasingly extreme, what were the machine learning algorithms behind the newsfeed predicting he would search for and click on?</p>

<p>The machine learning systems that power social media can have significant negative effects, especially when Facebook <a href="https://apnews.com/article/3479209d927946f7a284a71d66e431c7">auto-generates</a> extremist content or when ISIS <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/islamic-state-terrorism-facebook">continues to recruit</a> on social media with the help of automatic recommendation systems. Radicalization is not going away. In the past few weeks we’ve seen how powerful algorithms can contribute to people inciting insurrections in America. As I watched a mob batter down the windows of the Capitol, inspired by online echo chambers in tweets and newsfeeds, I thought of my work in machine learning, thought of that drone strike, and wondered ‘did I unwittingly help create this?’</p>

<p>We’re used to machine learning running our world through the interfaces in virtual assistants, newsfeeds, or navigation systems that change our behavior every day. But here I aim to provide a measured perspective on the risks we take when choosing to support companies and tools that are powered by machine learning. After exploring the risks that make the boons of machine learning less rosy, we discuss how we might mitigate risk and hold power to account in an environment where business incentives limit our ability to have this discussion.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="what-is-machine-learning">What is machine learning?</h2>

<p>One of the tools for deploying artificial intelligence is machine learning. A machine learning algorithm is a set of instructions that helps a machine learn from patterns in data. Those patterns can then be used to help people make decisions.</p>

<p>A newsfeed, for example, can be created using a machine learning method called a recommender system. The pattern for the machine to learn in a recommender system could be which ads are most likely to be clicked on that are least likely to cause the user to navigate away from the newsfeed, losing potential revenue. To keep the user engaged with the system and maximize the chance that they click on an ad, the machine learning algorithm should provide enough interesting content similar to what the user has clicked on and read before.</p>

<p>An example of a machine-learnt pattern: I navigated to news.google.com and was presented with an article on <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/apple-logo-iphone-tap">how to use the Apple logo on the back of my iPhone as a button</a>. This pattern may have been learned because I’ve been searching for how to perform simple tasks in iOS, having recently switched from a Google phone to an iPhone. The machine learning algorithm learned to associate the text in the article I was recommended with my recent searches, and the algorithm predicted that I was likely to click the link. Similar systems power <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2017/using-deep-learning-at-scale-in-twitters-timelines.html">Twitter’s newsfeed</a>, <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/">Google search</a>, <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45530.pdf">YouTube recommendations</a>, and the <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/online-and-offline-tests-to-improve-news-feed-ranking/">Facebook newsfeed</a>.</p>

<p>Besides helping us find information, machine learning algorithms run the voice recognition of Siri, Alexa, and the Google Assistant; they power photo and document apps alongside countless other tools we interact with every day. (Twitter’s machine learning algorithms helped me <a href="https://jaan.io/images/dont-become-data-for-AI/twitter-optimize.png">choose a headline</a> for this article.) AI and machine learning may also help us <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4">understand biology</a>, reduce road accidents thanks to <a href="https://www.tesla.com/autopilotAI">autonomous vehicles</a>, diagnose disease <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00376-2">more accurately</a>, understand and remedy <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01192-7">health disparity</a>, or beat pandemics with <a href="https://digital.hbs.edu/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning/ai-puts-moderna-within-striking-distance-of-beating-covid-19/">better vaccines</a>.</p>

<hr>


<p>But behind the benefits of machine learning are incentives and power structures, such as those in the business models of the six FAANGM companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, and Microsoft) that make up a <a href="https://www.yardeni.com/pub/yardenifangoverview.pdf">quarter of the S&amp;P index</a> and were responsible for the majority of its gains in 2020. Folks at these big companies, with a median salary of <a href="https://aipaygrad.es/">$339,574 per year</a>, have the incentive to use machine learning to earn more money through products, memberships, or ads, and are not incentivized to talk about the risks intrinsic to such business models.</p>

<p>Might these power structures amplify existing patterns of inequality with the help of machine learning or target vulnerable populations susceptible to misinformation or addiction? There’s a chance the patterns of inequity supported by ad-based revenue models—which help build machine learning systems—reinforce and mirror the patterns of inequity in broader society. As an expert in this area, I’m concerned when I see friends and colleagues unwilling to go public about these problems, perhaps out of fear of repercussion from their employers. We’re left with few alternatives other than to speak out when faced with powerful silencing mechanisms.</p>

<p>Anecdata like my ex-friend John’s online radicalization can inform our discussion about the potential risks of machine learning deployed in social media across our devices.  The question may be one of not <em>whether</em>, but of <em>how much</em> algorithms can amplify existing patterns in humans and society.</p>

<p>One piece of evidence that machine learning can amplify existing patterns of violence is that Facebook has an established team for counterterrorism policy that itself, ironically, <a href="https://tnsr.org/2019/02/crossroads-counter-terrorism-and-the-internet/https://tnsr.org/2019/02/crossroads-counter-terrorism-and-the-internet/">relies on machine learning</a> and is privy to the same business incentives. (The more content you block and the more people you ban, the more your revenue decreases.) The company has already admitted to having an effect on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/technology/myanmar-facebook.html">atrocious killings in Myanmar</a>. Similarly, Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook all played a significant role in propagating <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2021/01/07/the-making-of-qanon-a-crowdsourced-conspiracy/">QAnon</a> and organizing the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/insurrection-at-the-capitol/2021/01/12/956003580/facebook-removes-stop-the-steal-content-twitter-suspends-qanon-accounts">Capitol insurrection</a> in the United States in January 2021.  Geopolitical risk might also be rising through this technology, as a whistleblower at Facebook has admitted to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ignore-political-manipulation-whistleblower-memo">global political manipulation capabilities</a> created, in part, through the use of machine learning.</p>

<p>Besides saving would-be extremists from algorithms and America from filter bubble insurrectionists, can we save the children? No, not from a <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2021/01/07/the-making-of-qanon-a-crowdsourced-conspiracy/">cabal</a>, but from the terrifying content both <a href="https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2">created <em>and</em> recommended</a> by algorithms, content that is hard to detect and <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/youtube-for-kids-videos-problems-algorithm-recommend">harder to keep removing</a> given the financial incentives to continuing the onslaught.  To rub salt in the wound, there is research linking early-childhood events to <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8858/">dopamine and addictive behavior</a> that machine learning may exploit. Newsfeeds are explicitly designed to target <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/how-to-manufacture-desire/">dopamine circuitry</a> and might therefore disparately affect marginalized populations. Furthering this argument from a socioeconomic perspective, consider that poor kids own fewer devices than rich kids but experience <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/10/29/20937870/kids-screentime-rich-poor-common-sense-media"><em>more</em> screen time</a>. Leaving aside the question of how much machine learning may help target certain populations over others, consider that companies like YouTube and Facebook make strictly more money the more poor kids with ample screen time watch content; the earlier they start, the better.</p>

<p>Given these documented risks of machine learning when it is used to power social media algorithms, it is worth coming up with ways to mitigate risk in the deployment of machine learning technology throughout our homes, communities, and countries.</p>

<p>We’ve explored the ways machine learning may target vulnerable people, countries, and patterns for profit, remaining aware that there’d be more money in avoiding this line of inquiry in the first place. Societal patterns like terrorism, conspiracy theories driven by misinformation, and grotesque kids content run the risk of being amplified through the machine learning in social media. People like John might be more likely to be radicalized because of their life experience, therefore subject to the unintended consequences of companies that develop machine learning. We need to ensure such a discussion happens at a societal level with the involvement of those most affected along with experts in ethics, policy, law, and …</p></article></section></div></div>

                    Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) are emerging as an effective representation for 3D shapes. SDFs encode 3D surfaces with a function of position that returns the closest distance to a surface. State-of-the-art methods typically encode the SDF with a large, fixed-size neural network to approximate complex shapes with implicit surfaces. Rendering these large networks is, however, computationally expensive since it requires many forward passes through the network for every pixel, making these representations impractical for real-time graphics applications.

                        Neural SDFs are typically encoded using large, fixed-size MLPs which are expensive to render.

            We introduce an efficient neural representation that, for the first time, enables real-time rendering of high-fidelity neural SDFs, while achieving state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction quality. We represent implicit surfaces using an octree-based feature volume which adaptively fits shapes with multiple discrete levels of detail (LODs), and enables continuous LOD with SDF interpolation. We further develop an efficient algorithm to directly render our novel neural SDF representation in real-time by querying only the necessary LODs with sparse octree traversal. We show that our representation is 2-3 orders of magnitude more efficient in terms of rendering speed compared to previous works. Furthermore, it produces state-of-the-art reconstruction quality for complex shapes under both 3D geometric and 2D image-space metrics.

                    We encode shapes using a sparse voxel octree (SVO) based feature volume, where the levels of the tree corresponds to LOD. This lets us use a very small MLP, which accelerates rendering by 2-3 orders of magnitudes.

                We qualitatively compare the mesh reconstructions. Only ours is able to recover fine details, with speeds 50× faster than FFN and comparable to NI. We render surface normals to highlight geometric details.

                We test against two difficult analytic SDF examples from Shadertoy; the Oldcar, which contains a highly non-metric signed distance field, as well as the Mandelbulb, which is a recursive fractal structure that can only be expressed using implicit surfaces. Only our architecture can reasonably reconstruct these hard cases. We render surface normals to highlight geometric details.

<p>We are taking a practical approach in the following sections. As such, we need the right tools and environments available in order to keep up with the examples and exercises. We will be using <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> along with packages that will form our scientific stack, such as <code>ndarray</code> (for multi-dimensional containers) and <code>plotly</code> (for interactive graphing), etc. We will write all of our code within a <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>, but you are free to use other IDEs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Miniconda">Install Miniconda<a href="#Install-Miniconda">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>There are many different ways to get up and running with an environment that will facilitate our work. One approach I can recommend is to install and use Miniconda.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others.</p>
<p>— <cite>https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can skip Miniconda entirely if you prefer and install Jupyter Lab directly, however, I prefer using it to manage other environments too.</p>
<p>You can find installation instructions for Miniconda on <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">their website</a>, but if you're using Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) you can execute the following commands from in your terminal:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh</pre></div>
<p>This will download the installation files and start the interactive installation process. Follow the process to the end, where you should see the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for installing Miniconda3!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that's left is to close and re-open the terminal window.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Create-Your-Environment">Create Your Environment<a href="#Create-Your-Environment">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>Once Miniconda is installed, we need to create and configure our environment. If you added Miniconda to your PATH environment during the installation process, then you can run these commands directly from Terminal, Powershell, or CMD.</p>
<p>Now we can create and configure our conda environment using the following commands.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda create -n darn <span>python</span><span>=</span><span>3</span></pre></div>
<p>You can replace <code>darn</code> (<strong>D</strong>ata <strong>An</strong>alytics with <strong>R</strong>ust <strong>N</strong>otebooks) with a name of your choosing.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>This will create a conda environment named <code>darn</code> with the latest Python 3 package ready to go. You should be presented with a list of packages that will be installed and asked if you wish to proceed. To do so, just enter the character <code>y</code>. If this operation is successful, you should see the following output at the end:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>Preparing transaction: <span>done</span>
Verifying transaction: <span>done</span>
Executing transaction: <span>done</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># To activate this environment, use</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#     $ conda activate darn</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># To deactivate an active environment, use</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#     $ conda deactivate</span></pre></div>
<p>As the message suggests, you will need to type the following command to activate and start entering commands within our environment named <code>darn</code>.</p>

<p>Once you do that, you should see your terminal prompt now leads with the environment name within parentheses:</p>

<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The example above shows the macOS machine name "melica" and the user "shahin". You will see something different on your machine, and it may appear in a different format on a different operating system such as Windows. As long as the prompt leads with "(darn)", you are on the right track.</p>
</div>
<p>This will allow you to identify which environment you are currently operating in. If you restart your machine, you should be able to use <code>conda activate darn</code> within your conda prompt to get back into the same environment.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Packages">Install Packages<a href="#Install-Packages">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>If your environment was already configured and ready, you would be able to enter the command <code>jupyter lab</code> to launch an instance of the Jupyter Lab IDE in the current directory. However, if we try that in our newly created environment, we will receive an error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span>darn<span>)</span> melica:~ shahin$ jupyter lab
-bash: jupyter: <span>command</span> not found</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>So let's fix that. Let's install Jupyter Lab and use the <code>-y</code> option which automatically says "yes" to any questions asked during the installation process.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c conda-forge <span>jupyterlab</span><span>=</span><span>2</span>.2.9</pre></div>
<p>We'll also need <code>cmake</code> later on.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c anaconda cmake -y</pre></div>
<p>Finally, let's install nodejs. This is needed to run our Jupyter Lab extension in the next section.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c conda-forge <span>nodejs</span><span>=</span><span>15</span> -y</pre></div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Jupyer-Lab-Extensions">Install Jupyer Lab Extensions<a href="#Install-Jupyer-Lab-Extensions">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>There's one last thing we need to do before we move on, and that's installing any Jupyter Lab extensions that we may need. One particular extension that we need is the plotly extension, which will allow our Jupyter Notebooks to render our Plotly visualisations. Within your conda environment, simply run the following command:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-plotly</pre></div>
<p>This may take some time, especially when it builds your jupyterlab assets, so keep an eye on it until you're returned control over the conda prompt, i.e. when you see the following:</p>

<p>Optionally, you may wish to install the purple looking theme from Figure 1 above.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jupyter labextension install @shahinrostami/theme-purple-please</pre></div>
<p>Now we're good to go!</p>

<p>Now we'll install Rust using rustup, but you can check out the <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html">other installation methods</a> if you need them.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl --proto <span>'=https'</span> --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs <span>|</span> sh</pre></div>
<p>The code samples in this book will work in many versions of Rust, but I can confirm them to be working with version <code>1.42.0</code>. You can get the same version with:</p>

<p>You will be given instructions for adding Cargo's bin directory to your PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>This will work until your close your terminal, so make sure to add it to your shell profile. I use Z shell (Zsh) so this meant adding the following to <code>.zshrc</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>export</span> <span>PATH</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/.cargo/bin:</span><span>$PATH</span><span>"</span></pre></div>
<p>You can make sure everything works by closing and re-opening your terminal and typing <code>cargo</code>. If this returns the usage documentation then you're all set.</p>

<p>Let's test if everything is working as it should be. In your conda prompt, within your conda environment, run the following command</p>

January 28, 2021 | https://www.bannerbear.com/blog/don-t-charge-a-month-for-your-product/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.bannerbear.com/blog/don-t-charge-a-month-for-your-product/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Today I increased pricing plans across Votemojo and Previewmojo. All plans now start at $49 a month. Here's why charging $9 a month for your indie SaaS product is a really silly idea. </p>

<p><em>Update: The two products mentioned in this article no longer exist. Votemojo was shut down. Previewmojo was rebranded to Bannerbear, has pivoted quite a bit since then and is now doing $10K MRR. I stand by this article still, as pricing is one of the main levers of my MRR growth over the last year.</em></p>

<p><em>Note: existing customers always get grandfathered in at their current price plan.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-changed">What's changed?</h2>

<p>Votemojo and Previewmojo now have new pricing pages with 3 tiers and a monthly billing / annual billing toggle. (with a neat little animation when you toggle!)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.previewmojo.com/pricing"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/74bf4fb451e0a3f08be2260da742d1ba0cf58f77/9a0d0/images/blog/new_pricing.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>For Previewmojo in particular, this is a big jump from the previous pricing plan. Previewmojo's lowest pricing tier has increased from $9 to $49 a month. Votemojo's lowest pricing tier has increased from $19 to $49 a month.</p>

<h2 id="why-ive-changed-pricing">Why I've changed pricing</h2>

<p>There's no singular reason, although there was a tipping point - more on that later.</p>

<p>It is my general feeling that I should be aiming higher in the value chain if I am going to turn Mojosaas into a sustainable business. Low pricing often means saturated markets with high churn, and this is not where I want to be aiming. Charging a higher price instantly moves the roadmap away from this space.</p>

<p>Whereas previously it was tempting to look at my roadmap and think "what would people like me pay $9 for", now I am thinking more about what actual businesses would pay $50 to $100 a month for.</p>

<p>This is a good thing because <em>other indie hackers</em> are not your target market. Businesses with money to spend on problems they need solved - that's your target market.</p>

<p>The tipping point I mentioned above happened this week. Previewmojo acquired its first paying customer a few days after launch, on the $9 plan. A few days later, that same customer churned.</p>

<p>I reached out to understand what happened, but have not received a response - which is fine, I am not owed one. But it did make me realise that something's wrong. Low pricing introduces risk. Maybe customers don't know what they are signing up for. Maybe customers perceive it as delivering low value so you're first to get cancelled when the credit card statement gets looked at. And lets not forget that in trying to offer customer support at this price, you will probably make 0 profit.</p>

<p>So I'm climbing up the value chain.</p>

<h2 id="ways-to-price-your-saas">3 ways to price your SaaS</h2>

<p>I've been recently updating myself on SaaS pricing literature / articles. There are many, many such articles on the web (and now there's one more - yay!).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.priceintelligently.com/">Price Intelligently</a> has a nice <a href="https://www.priceintelligently.com/hubfs/Price-Intelligently-SaaS-Pricing-Strategy.pdf">free ebook</a> on the topic.</p>

<p>There's a lot to digest in that PDF (and all definitely worth reading) but I think the most useful and simple lesson for me was that there are roughly 3 ways to price something. I'll list them here and try not to paraphrase the book too much.</p>

<p><em>Cost plus pricing</em> - Where the price of a product is calculated by adding a markup to all variable costs involved in delivering it.</p>

<p><em>Competitor based pricing</em> - Where the price of a product is benchmarked against what other sellers are pricing at.</p>

<p><em>Value based pricing</em> - Where the price of a product is based on the value it delivers to the customer.</p>

<p>I think indie hackers have the tendency to price out the gate based on a combination of cost and competitor pricing. That's why you see a lot of new products out there charging &lt; $10 a month. They are charging that because everyone else is. Short term, you aren't going to earn a sustainable living from $9 subscriptions. Long term, it's going to damage the community. So this mentality has to change.</p>

<p>Value based pricing solves that. Ask what a <em>non indie hacker</em> target group of customers would pay to have a particular problem solved. If they genuinly respond that they would only pay 2x starbucks coffees worth per month for your solution to their problem, it might be time to pivot the product or feature set into something more valuable.</p>

<p>If they don't bat an eye at a $50 / month price, then you're onto something.</p>

<p>(and could most likely charge more)</p>

<![CDATA[Safe dead code removal in a pure functional language]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago, a colleague of mine <a href="https://twitter.com/jfmengels/status/1311940821378387970">wrote this</a> on Slack:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to elm-review I was able to remove ~7300 lines of code in the front end in 225 different files.
Something I could have never done without its aid. Thank you Jeroen!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also some time ago, I <a href="https://twitter.com/jfmengels/status/1330854406615674883">tweeted this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just cleaned up a lot of Elm code. I wanted to remove our usage of a module that brought no value. Manually removed the main places where it was used and followed the compiler errors. That was about 200 lines.
elm-review took care of the other 2700 lines of the then dead code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For scale, this was on a project of about 170k lines of code. Well, before the code removal. If we take what my colleague did, he was basically able to remove ~5% of the codebase, while touching ~30% of all files.</p>
<p>And <strong>we felt good</strong> about that.</p>
<p>I wanted to break down how <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jfmengels/elm-review/latest/"><code>elm-review</code></a>, a static analysis tool for <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, was able to help us remove all this code almost effortlessly in a way that we felt very confident with. Spoiler: It’s because of the lack of side effects in the language.</p>
<p>We are going to compare what code a static analysis tool for a side effect free language (Elm) is able to remove compared to for a dynamic and effectful language (JavaScript).</p>
<h3>Obscurity by impurity</h3>
<p>I’ll take the example of some JavaScript code because that’s another language for which I worked a lot on static analysis.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>formatUserName</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> userInfo <span>=</span> <span>formatUserInfo</span><span>(</span>user<span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> user<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>first <span>+</span> <span>' '</span> <span>+</span> Formatting<span>.</span><span>formatLastName</span><span>(</span>user<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>last<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Did you notice in this example that <code>userInfo</code> was declared but never used? A static analysis tool (or linter if you will) can easily spot that, and it is a very common feature that they provide.</p>
<p>Now what should we do about this unused variable? If we wanted to clean up the excerpt above, the only thing we’d be able to do safely is remove the assignment of <code>formatUserInfo(user)</code> to <code>userInfo</code>, as shown below.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>formatUserName</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>formatUserInfo</span><span>(</span>user<span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> user<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>first <span>+</span> <span>' '</span> <span>+</span> Formatting<span>.</span><span>formatLastName</span><span>(</span>user<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>last<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can’t remove the call to <code>formatUserInfo(user)</code> because we don’t know what it does. Maybe it mutates the <code>user</code> argument or global variables, makes HTTP requests, etc. In this example, I wouldn’t be all <em>that</em> surprised if <code>formatUserInfo</code> would mutate <code>user.name</code> by adding information from other <code>user</code> fields.</p>
<p>Those are called <strong>side effects</strong>: things that a function does in addition to or instead of returning a value. When a function has side effects, we say it is “impure”, and we say it is “pure” if it doesn’t have any.</p>
<p>The tricky thing with side effects is that the surrounding code may rely on those side effects being applied, but there is nothing in the code—that can’t become stale—that indicates that dependency.</p>
<p>If a function is impure, then removing a call to it may change the behavior of the code. That means without knowing whether it is pure or impure, we can’t <strong>safely</strong> remove it. For this article, I’ll consider the removal of code “safe” if it won’t change the behavior of the code or introduce compiler errors.</p>
<p>A smart static analysis tool could try to inspect <code>formatUserInfo</code> to see if it has side effects, but that can get very hairy. In some cases, it will even be outright impossible because of the inherent limitations of a static analysis tool on a dynamic language.</p>
<p>The more dynamic a language gets and the more it allows for side effects, the harder it will be for a static analysis tool to do an accurate analysis and reduce false positives and false negatives.</p>
<p>Here is an incomplete list of JavaScript features that make it hard to predict what the code will do:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval"><code>eval</code> function</a> allows executing non-sandboxed arbitrary JavaScript contained in a string.</li>
<li>Through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get">getters</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set">setters</a>, even an expression as simple as <code>a.b</code> can have side effects.</li>
<li>Through changing the prototype of specific or core types, even standardized functions that are considered pure can become impure. This is actually a security issue and one of the reasons you get so many <code>dependabot issues</code> to bump <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-LODASH-608086">dependencies with vulnerabilities</a>.</li>
<li>Through macros (using Webpack or Babel for instance), the code may be transformed in unknown ways. In some cases, the tool won’t be able to parse the untransformed code.</li>
<li>Through dynamic imports (<code>require</code> or dynamic HTML script tags), arbitrary code—that the tool may not even have access to—can be imported and executed, potentially applying one of the features listed above.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Clarity by purity</h3>
<p>In Elm, you only have <strong>pure</strong> functions. Meaning that there is no observable difference between calling a function and not using the result, and not calling it at all.</p>
<p>In Elm, the previous uncleaned code snippet would translate to this:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>formatUserName</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span>
    <span>userInfo</span> <span>=</span> <span>formatUserInfo</span> <span>user</span>
  <span>in</span>
  <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>first</span> <span>++</span> <span>" "</span> <span>++</span> <span>Formatting.formatLastName</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>last</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we could <strong>safely</strong>—without changing the behavior of the program—report that the whole declaration of <code>userInfo</code> can be removed, the call to <code>formatUserInfo</code> included, and propose to automatically fix it.</p>
<p>

<p>Why was the value unused? Either it lost its purpose at some point yet wasn’t cleaned up, or this might be a bug lying around because it needed to be used somewhere but the developer who wrote/changed the code forgot to. Without talking to the developers directly we can’t know in which situation we are in, and whether the value should be used or removed.</p>
<p>For that reason, when <code>elm-review</code> analyzes the code and it has been run with <code>--fix</code>, it will ask the user for confirmation before applying the suggested fix of removing the variable. Every <code>elm-review</code> fix proposal requires an approval from the user before it gets committed to the file system.</p>
<p>There is a way to batch them to avoid having the process be too tedious though, which I find people start to use after the tool has gained their trust.</p>
<h3>What more can we find?</h3>
<p>In the rest of the article, I will refer to the change we did previously as step 1.</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>In JavaScript-land, we would have had to keep the call to <code>formatUserInfo</code>, but in Elm-land, we were able to remove it. That allows us to do one more thing: check whether <code>formatUserInfo</code> is ever used anywhere else.</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>SomeModule</span> <span>exposing</span> <span>(</span><span>formatUserName</span><span>)</span>
<span>
<span>import</span> Formatting</span>

<span>formatUserName</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>first</span> <span>++</span> <span>" "</span> <span>++</span> <span>Formatting.formatLastName</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>last</span>

<span>formatUserInfo</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>{</span> <span>role</span> <span>=</span> <span>Formatting.formatRole</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>role</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>description</span> <span>=</span> <span>String.trim</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>description</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When we look at this module, it seems that <code>formatUserInfo</code> is never used in any way: It is not exposed to the other modules nor is it used in any of the other functions. So we can safely remove it too!</p>
<p>

  </a>
    </p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Let’s look at the <code>Formatting</code> module, whose import we just removed.</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Formatting</span> <span>exposing</span> <span>(</span><span>formatLastName</span><span>,</span> <span>formatRole</span><span>)</span>
<span>
<span>import</span> Diacritics</span><span>
<span>import</span> ReCase</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Capitalization</span>
  <span>=</span> <span>AllCaps</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>SnakeCase</span>

<span>formatLastName</span> <span>lastName</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>applyFormatting</span> <span>AllCaps</span> <span>lastName</span>

<span>formatRole</span> <span>role</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>applyFormatting</span> <span>SnakeCase</span> <span>role</span>

<span>applyFormatting</span> <span>formatting</span> <span>string</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>formatting</span> <span>of</span>
    <span>AllCaps</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String.toUpper</span> <span>string</span>
    <span>SnakeCase</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ReCase.fromSnake</span> <span>(</span><span>ReCase.toSnake</span> <span>(</span><span>Diacritics.removeAccents</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>elm-review</code> rules have the ability to look at all modules of a project before reporting errors. This makes it immensively more powerful than static analysis tools that only look at a single module at a time (like <code>elm-review</code> did originally, which I can tell you was very frustrating as a rule author). This approach allows us to report things about a module based on how it is used in other modules.</p>
<p>In this case, a different rule named <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jfmengels/elm-review-unused/latest/NoUnused-Exports"><code>NoUnused.Exports</code></a> (previously we were using the <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jfmengels/elm-review-unused/latest/NoUnused-Variables"><code>NoUnused.Variables</code></a> rule) will report that <code>formatRole</code> is exposed as part of the module’s API but never used in other modules, <code>SomeModule</code> being the only module in the entire codebase where it was referenced. Since it’s not used anywhere in the project outside of this module, we can safely stop exposing it from the module.</p>
<p>Note that if this was some kind of utility module that you <em>really</em> wanted to keep as is, you could disable this particular rule for that file. Also this rule does not report functions exposed as part of the public API of an Elm package, no worries there.</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Formatting</span> <span>exposing</span> <span>(</span><span>formatLastName</span><span>,</span> <span>formatRole</span><span>)</span>

    </p>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Now it looks like <code>formatRole</code> was not used internally inside the <code>Formatting</code> module either, so we can remove it entirely just like we did for <code>formatUserInfo</code> back in step 2.</p>

    </span>
  </span>
  
  </a>
    </p>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p><code>formatRole</code> was using the <code>SnakeCase</code> variant of <code>Capitalization</code> and that was the only location where that variant was ever created. If that variant is never created, we have no need to handle it.</p>
<p>For those not familiar with custom types (aka “union types” aka “algebraic data types”) but familiar with JavaScript, they allow you to list all the discrete values that something can have. When used in a <code>case</code> expression (roughly equivalent to a <code>switch</code> in JavaScript), the compiler can determine whether you have handled all possible values and remind you when you haven’t, removing the need to add a default case.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>applyFormatting</span><span>(</span><span>formatting<span>,</span> string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>switch</span> <span>(</span>formatting<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>"AllCaps"</span><span>:</span> 
    <span>case</span> <span>"SnakeCase"</span><span>:</span> 
    <span>default</span><span>:</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>

    <span>
      <img alt="elm-review reporting unused custom type variant" title="" src="https://jfmengels.net/static/d16ae2faaa9f5e2b89407fcf44dadf75/c54b3/step5.png" srcset="https://jfmengels.net/static/d16ae2faaa9f5e2b89407fcf44dadf75/4dcb9/step5.png 188w,

  </span>
  
  </a>
    </p>
<p>This is the first case where an automatic fix is not offered, because we will need to remove the variant both in the custom type definition and in the different patterns, potentially in multiple files. In this case, it’s safer to let the user remove the definition themselves and let the Elm compiler help them fix all the compiler errors that causes.</p>
<p>A tool could potentially do it, but at least for now, <code>elm-review</code> doesn’t. This is how the user would likely remove the …</p></div></div>

<p>I’ve seen screenshots of YouTube modifying dislikes of White House videos. I decided I would do a thorough analysis myself. I wrote a script to check video stats every 80 seconds for 24 hours – for <strong>all</strong> videos on White House’s YouTube channel.</p>



<p>The collected data is archived <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://justpaste.it/94ic5" target="_blank">here</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ufile.io/eqfg1fwl" target="_blank">here</a>. The format is <strong>space</strong>-separated “CSV”, as follows:</p>



<pre><code>VideoURL UnixTimestamp Date,Time Views Likes Dislikes</code></pre>



<p>Here is a sample of the most egregious manipulation:</p>























<p>Some videos were <strong>delisted in minutes!</strong>:</p>

<p>Likes+Dislikes was greater than views in some cases. Although that seems impossible, <strong>Youtube updates views slower, so they do not reflect real views at the time</strong>. For example:</p>

<p>So it’s possible for likes and dislikes to accumulate while views stays the same. Eventually, views jumps up to better reflect reality.</p>



<p>The record of every time dislikes were removed is archived at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pastebin.com/raw/F4ELDc4R" target="_blank">https://pastebin.com/raw/F4ELDc4R</a></p>



<pre><code>Grand Total         -130321</code></pre>



<p><strong>130 Thousand dislikes were removed in a 24hr period!</strong></p>



<p>And this is for the most popular US President of all time!</p>



<p>Enjoy 🙂 -Zoe</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Update</strong></p>



<p>The timezone for the charts is UTC (London). Did you notice the huge drop at 06 hour (1 AM US Eastern)?  Most working people go to sleep by that time.  Coincidence? I think not.</p>

<article>
<p><span>You’re here so that means you’re considering a lean approach to develop your MVP. That’s a great first step.</span></p>
<p><span>But lean product development methodologies alone won’t cut it into today’s entrepreneurial landscape.</span></p>
<p><span>I know this because over the last ten years I’ve built my own startup (which crashed and burned), worked on dozens of MVPs with </span><a href="https://altar.io/work" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Altar.io</span></a><span> and witnessed hundreds of other founder stories.</span></p>
<p><span>The hard truth is, </span><a href="https://altar.io/features-inside-mvp-3-steps-know-answer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>building a successful MVP</span></a><span> is not as simple as coming up with an idea and taking it to a team of developers or a software development company.</span></p>
<p><span>Before writing a line of code, you need to make everything you can to </span><a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>reduce the risk of that product becoming a part of the</span></a><span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>&nbsp;42% of startups that fail because of no market need;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>&nbsp;19% that get outcompeted;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>&nbsp;17% that fail because they build a user-unfriendly product;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>13% who mistimed their product;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>…you see what I mean.</span></p>
<p><span>A great idea is a good start, but if you want to have any chance of succeeding, it’s vital that you focus on the product from a business standpoint.</span></p>
<p><span>That usually starts with thorough research, from numbers on the market to competitor benchmarks or any other information that can help you turn your vision into a rock-solid value proposition.</span></p>
<p><span>From there, you set the main assumptions to prove and outline the journey your users will take through your product.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At this point, you’ll have all the information you need to create the ultimate list of User Stories and features necessary to prove the main assumptions in a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) or Proof of Concept (POC).</span></p>
<p><span>At Altar.io we call this </span><a href="https://altar.io/service-product-scope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>The Product Scope</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, I’m going to give you the full process, step-by-step, starting with defining your stakeholders, and finding your value proposition.</span></p>
<div>
<h4><span>Expert Tip</span></h4>
<p><i><span>“Your MVP won’t work if your customers can’t see any value. Build what customers want and then scale.”</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeprocopio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Joe Procopio</b></a><b>, Product Expert &amp; Startup Founder</b></p>
</div>
<h2><span>Step One: Define Your Stakeholders &amp; Discover Your Value Proposition</span></h2>
<p><span>Before building your MVP, you need to first do some good, old fashioned research.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Start by, asking yourself:</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“What is the problem/pain we’re trying to solve with our product?”</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>The answer to this question should always be at the front of your mind as you move through the process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, keeping that in mind, the next question is:</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“Who is your main target? Define all stakeholders involved in your product”</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>Get to know them in terms of demographics, psychology and behaviour in the observed context.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Later on in the process, it’ll be time to build UX personas for your stakeholders, but we’ll get to that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With your detailed list of target stakeholders in hand, and knowing exactly what the problem is that affects them, the next question you need to look at is:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“How do my stakeholders deal with this problem today? Carry out a competitor benchmark.”</span></i><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>Let’s take Spotify as an example here. Before Spotify existed their stakeholders had three options when it came to listening to their favourite music. They could&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Buy it from iTunes&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Buy CDs&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Download it illegally using piracy (At a time where piracy was at its peak)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>It’s imperative that, before you enter the market, you look and who is already in your space. List your competitors, including their strengths, weaknesses and positioning.&nbsp; Also, you might learn something you can adopt from them. As Pablo Picasso said, “Lesser artists borrow; great artists steal.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then, the final question in step one becomes:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“Why is our solution 10x better than the current market solutions?”</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>Here, you should define what differentiates you from the competition/existing alternatives for your stakeholders. A.k.a your </span><b>Unique Value Proposition</b><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>Let’s again take Spotify as an example. Their value proposition is to give the user the feeling that they had “all the worlds music on their hard drive” </span><a href="https://mastersofscale.com/daniel-ek-how-to-build-trust-fast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>founder Daniel Ek believed</span></a><span> if he could do this he could “build something better than piracy.”</span></p>
<p><span>And on paper, it was a better option (for </span><i><span>all </span></i><span>stakeholders) when compared with illegally downloading music as:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Artists still make money from customers streaming songs;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The playback quality is better and faster than illegal downloads; and well, it’s legal.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>They were a better option than buying CDs or buying from iTunes (the only other options at the time) as:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Instead of buying an album at around $10 each you had access to millions of songs at $10 a month.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>You could listen instantly on the device of your choice, as opposed to:</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Waiting for it to download via iTunes</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Going to the record store, buying the CD, uploading it to your computer and syncing it with a portable device.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>With that in mind, once you have your Unique Value Proposition, it’s time to wrap up everything from Step One in a comprehensive, crystal clear, product-centric elevator pitch.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It should look something like this (feel free to use this as a template):&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i>We’ve created </i></b><i><span>[name of our Product] </span></i><b><i>for</i></b><i><span> [our stakeholders] </span></i><b><i>who </i></b><i><span>[state the problem/pain they’re facing]. </span></i><b><i>This product will solve the problem by</i></b><i><span> [state your product’s key benefit]. </span></i><b><i>Unlike</i></b><i><span> [the current market alternatives/competitors] </span></i><b><i>our product will</i></b><i><span> [explain how your product differentiates you from your existing competition].&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p><span>If any aspect of your elevator pitch is unclear, head back to the beginning of Step One. Otherwise, let’s move onto Step Two: deconstructing your Elevator Pitch and setting your Main Assumptions.</span></p>

<h4><span>Expert Tip</span></h4>
<p><i><span>“Focus on getting your MVP’s value proposition incredibly clear. If your grandma doesn’t understand it’s probably not clear.”</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janphilippkruip/"><b>Jan-Philipp Kruip</b></a><b>, Founder &amp; CEO</b></p>
</div>
<h2><span>Step Two: Deconstructing Your Elevator Pitch to Discover the Main Assumptions to Validate</span></h2>
<p><span>Once you have a rock-solid value proposition and a crystal clear product elevator pitch, it’s time to set the main assumptions you need to validate.</span></p>
<p><span>Looking closely at your elevator pitch, you need to work out:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Which of your assumptions can be validated with research</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Which features need to be built into your MVP to validate any assumptions that can’t be validated with research.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>So, let’s say that your first assumption is that users are </span><i><span>really </span></i><span>facing a problem/pain (for this example let’s call it “Pain X”.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The first assumption you need to validate is whether or not this is a real, tangible pain point. More often than not this assumption can be validated with research, e.g.:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span>“We know that Pain X is an issue for [name of your target stakeholders] because firstly we’ve seen competitors in the market attempting to solve this problem.”</span></i></p>
<p><span>Taking this example one step further, let’s say that the next assumption you need to validate is that your solution to Pain X is better than your target stakeholders current solution.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This assumption can’t be proven by research alone, you need to test within your MVP and measure this with KPIs e.g.:</span></p>
<p><i><span>“Although users are already solving the problem with [competitor’s solution], we believe this is outdated and inefficient. We propose that [our solution] is a better way to solve Pain X. We intend to prove this by building an MVP and measuring the adoption and retention ratio”.&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p><span>However, assumptions aren’t just relevant to the end-users, but other stakeholders in the process. For example, Spotify needed to convince record labels to give them the rights to the music. Which, at a time when piracy and digital music platforms were the enemies of the industry, this was a battle for Spotify.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Spotify’s founder, Daniel Ek, was convinced that he had a solution to convince them to come on board:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“Up until that point, Napster and alike simply hadn’t shared their revenues. I was sure we could work out a straightforward revenue share with the record labels.”</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>It turned out it wasn’t that simple. The record labels still saw digital music platforms, like Napster, as the enemy. They simply didn’t trust Spotify.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Simply put, without industry involvement, Spotify could never exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Daniel had to de-risk the opportunity for the record labels, by guaranteeing them a year’s worth of revenue. He took a painful short term loss to earn their trust and set himself up for the long term win.</span></p>
<p><span>So, keep in mind as you build your list of assumptions, that some have to be tackled </span><i><span>before </span></i><span>you build your MVP and that direct users aren’t the only stakeholders you should be focusing on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once you have the list of assumptions you need to prove with an MVP, it’s time to move on to creating your user stories &amp; building your feature list.</span></p>
<p><b>Related: </b><a href="https://altar.io/expert-interview-building-an-mvp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Expert Interview: The One Thing You Can’t Miss When Building an MVP</span></a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Step Three: User Stories &amp; Feature List&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>At this stage, you’re nearly ready to begin your MVP development process.</span></p>
<p><span>There are two critical aspects, however, that are yet to be completed. Creating your MVP user stories and building your final list of MVP features.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s start with the all-important user stories.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>How to Write User Stories&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>A user story is an explanation of the journey through your product from the perspective of your stakeholder. It’s the most granular description of how a product works. User stories are a great way of showing how a software feature will provide value to your stakeholders. Also, they will keep your team focused on developing a user-centric product that actually solves their problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s create a few simple user stories based on our previous example, Spotify.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<h4><span>Login&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span>As an unregistered user:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>I want to sign up with Facebook, Google or email &amp; password</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>If I sign up with email I want to insert my password into two separate fields to ensure they match</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>I want my password to be secure, therefore must contain at least 8 characters and at least one number and special character.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>As a registered user:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>I can log in using Facebook, Google or email &amp; password.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>If I forget my password I want to be able to click on a “Forgot my Password” link.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Once I’ve clicked on this link I want to insert my email and receive a link that redirects me to an app window that allows me to enter a …</span></li></ul></div></article></div></div>

</p><h2>FAQ: How do I choose a good password or phrase?</h2>
 
ANS: Shocking nonsense makes the most sense
 <p>
	With the intrinsic strength of some of the modern 
encryption, authentication, and message digest algorithms such as 
RSA, MD5, SHS and IDEA the user password or phrase is becoming 
more and more the focus of vulnerability.
 </p><p>
	For example, Deputy Ponder with the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department admitted in early 1993 that both they and the 
FBI despaired of breaking the PGP 1.0 system except through a 
successful dictionary attack (trying many possible passwords or 
phrases from lists of probable choices and their variations) 
rather than "breaking" the underlying cryptographic algorithm 
mathematically.
</p><p> 
	The fundamental reason why attacking or trying to guess the 
user's password or phrase will increasingly be the focus of 
cryptanalysis is that the user's choice of password may represent 
a much simpler cryptographic key than optimal for the encryption 
algorithm being used. This weakness of the user's password choice 
provides the potential cryptanalytic wedge.
</p><p> 
	For example, suppose a user chooses the password 'david.' On 
the surface the entropy of this key (or the number of different 
equiprobable key states) appears to be five characters chosen from 
a set of twenty-six with replacements: 26^5 or 1.188 x 10^7. But 
since the user is apparently biased toward common given names, 
which a majority appear in lists numbering only 6,000-7,000 
entries, the true entropy is undoubtedly much closer to 6.5 x 
10^3, or about four orders of magnitude smaller than the raw 
length might suggest. (In fact this password probably possesses a 
much smaller entropy than even this for the very common name 
"david" would be one of the first names to be checked by an 
optimized dictionary attack program.)
</p><p> 
	In other words the "entropy" of a keyspace is not a fixed 
physical quantity: the cryptanalyst can exploit whole cultural 
biases and contexts, not just byte frequencies, digraphs, or even 
whole-word correlations to reduce the key space he or she is 
trying to explore.
</p><p> 
	To thwart this avenue of attack we would like to discover a 
method of selecting passwords or phrases that have at least as 
many bits of entropy (or "hard-to-guessness") as the entropy of 
the cryptographic key of the underlying algorithm being used.
</p><p> 
	To compare, DES (Data Encryption Standard) is believed to 
have about 54-55 bits (~4 x 10 ^16) of entropy while the IDEA 
algorithm is believed to have about 128 bits (~3.5 x 10^38) of 
entropy. The closer the entropy of the user's password or phrase 
is to the intrinsic entropy of the cryptographic key of the 
underlying algorithm being used, the more likely an attacker would 
need to search a substantially larger portion of the algorithm's 
key space in order to rediscover the key.
</p><p> 
	Unfortunately many documents suggest choosing passwords or 
phrases that are distinctly inferior to the latest method. For 
example, one white paper widely archived on the internet suggests 
selecting an original password by constructing an acronym from a 
popular song lyric or from a line of script from, for example, the 
SF movie "Star Wars". Both of these ideas turn out to be weak 
because both the entire script to Stars Wars and entire sets of 
song lyrics to thousands of popular songs are available on-line to 
everyone and, in some cases, are already embedded into "crack" 
dictionary attack programs (See <a href="ftp://ftp.uwp.edu/">ftp.uwp.edu</a>).
</p><p> 
	However, the conflict between choosing an easy-to-remember 
key and choosing a key with a high level of entropy is not a 
hopeless task if we exploit mnemonic devices that have been used 
for a long time outside the field of cryptography. With the goal 
of making up a passphrase not included in any existing corpus yet 
very easy to remember, an effective technique is one known as 
"shocking nonsense."
</p><p> 
	"Shocking nonsense" means to make up a short phrase or 
sentence that is both nonsensical and shocking in the culture of 
the user, that is, it contains grossly obscene, racist, impossible 
or other extreme juxtaposition of ideas. This technique is 
permissable because the passphrase, by its nature, is never revealed to 
anyone with sensibilities to be offended.
</p><p> 
	Shocking nonsense is unlikely to be duplicated anywhere 
because it does not describe a matter-of-fact that could be 
accidentally rediscovered by anyone else and the emotional 
evocation makes it difficult for the creator to forget. A mild 
example of such shocking nonsense might be: "mollusks peck my 
galloping genitals ." The reader can undoubtedly make up many far 
more shocking or entertaining examples for himself or herself.
</p><p> 
	Even relatively short phrases offer acceptable entropy 
because the far larger "alphabet" pool of word symbols that may be 
chosen than the 26 characters that form the Roman alphabet. Even 
choosing from a vocabulary of a few thousand words a five word 
phrase might have on the order of 58 to 60 bits of entropy -- more 
than what is needed for the DES algorithm, for example.
</p><p> 
	When you are permitted to use passphrases of arbitrary 
length (in PGP for example) it is not necessary to further perturb 
your 'shocking nonsense' passphrase to include numbers or special 
symbols because the pool of word choices is already very high. Not 
needing those special symbols or numbers (that are not 
intrinsically meaningful) makes the shocking nonsense passphrase 
that much easier to remember.
</p><p> 
	If you are forced to use, say, a Unix password utility that 
permits only passwords of restricted length, one good strategy is 
to process a your secret passphrase using MD5 or SHA, then 
<code>UUENCODE</code> the result and select your shorter key from the output.
See Appendix <a href="#appendixC">C</a> and <a href="#appendixD">D</a> for actual MD5 and SHA source implmentations.

 
</p><h2><a name="appendixA">Appendix A.</a>  For software developers</h2>
 
	For software developers designing "front-ends" or user 
interfaces to conventional short-password applications, very good 
results will come from permitting the user arbitrary length 
passphrases that are then "crunched" or processed using a strong 
digest algorithm such as the 160-bit SHS (Secure Hash Standard) or 
the 128-bit MD5 (Message Digest rev.5).[See following Appendices] 
The interface program then chooses the appropriate number of bits 
from the digest and supplies them to the engine enforcing a short 
password. This 'key crunching' technique will assure the developer 
that even the short password key space will have a far greater 
opportunity of being fully exploited by the user.
<p> 
   John Kelsey writes:<br>
	"I think it's a really good idea to use a randomly-generated 
salt to generate a key from a password, and that this salt should 
be as large as possible. Basically, this is to keep an attacker 
from spending lots of computer power <strong>once</strong> to generate a 
dictionary of likely keys.  If users use good techniques to choose 
passwords, this won't matter much, but if they don't, this may 
save them from having their encrypted files or transmissions 
routinely read.  The simplest scheme I can see for this is simply 
to prepend a 128-bit salt (generated as strongly as possible) to 
each encrypted file.  Generate the key from the password by pre-filling 
a buffer with the 128-bit salt, then XORing in the keyed-in 
password, or by appending the key to the keyed-in password.  
Then, run SHA or MD5 or whatever to get the key.<br>
   A secondary point:  Adding a random salt ensures that people 
who use the same password/passphrase for lots of 
files/transmissions don't get the same key every time.  Since most 
successful attacks against modern encryption schemes use <strong>lots</strong> of 
ciphertext from the same key, this might add some practical 
security, at relatively low cost."<br>
   --John Kelsey, <em>c445585@mizzou1.missouri.edu</em>
 
 
</p><h2>Appendix B. A tool to experimentally investigate entropy</h2>
 
	A practical Unix tool for investigating the entropy of 
typical user keys can be found in Wu and Manber's 'agrep' 
(approximate grep) similarity pattern matching tool available in C 
source from <a href="ftp://cs.arizona.edu/agrep">cs.arizona.edu</a> [192.12.69.5]. This tool can determine 
the "edit distance," that is, the number of insertions, 
substitutions, or deletions that would be required of an arbitrary 
pattern in order for it to match any of a large corpus of words or 
phrases, say the usr/dict word list, or over the set of Star Trek 
trivia archives. The user can then adjust the pattern to give an 
arbitrary high threshold difference between it and common words 
and phrases in the corpus to make crack programs that 
systematically vary known strings less likely to succeed. It is 
often surprising to discover that a substring pattern like 
"hxirtes" is only of edit distance two from as many as forty 
separate words ranging from "bushfires" to "whitest." Certainly no 
password or phrase ought to be chosen as a working password or 
phrase that is within two or fewer edit distance from a known 
string or substring in any on-line collection.

<p>It displays all my locals as "&lt;complex data type&gt;" which is not super helpful. There is a <a href="https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=34589">patch</a> to improve this but it looks like it got delayed by legal issues.</p>

<p>For gdb this <a href="https://emacs-lsp.github.io/dap-mode/page/configuration/#native-debug-gdblldb">requires</a> the vscode extension which I couldn't get working in the last post, so I haven't investigated further.</p>
<h2 id="clion-again">clion (again)</h2>
<p>Kaylee Blake emailed me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several of the issues you encountered with CLion are ones I have previously encountered, and thankfully two of them are solvable and one can be worked around. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your variables are (probably) not being displayed because CLion leans on its language support for computing precise start-of-scope for variables (GDB doesn't support this DWARF feature, sadly), but unfortunately defaults to assuming that variables are always out of scope if its language support isn't capable of mapping debug symbols to declarations. (It appears that the Zig plugin doesn't have any debugger integration). As such, you need to click on the gear icon on the left of the debug pane (in your screenshot, hidden behind a <code>&gt;&gt;</code> symbol at the bottom), and uncheck "Hide out-of-scope variables".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To use the Memory View, you need to right-click on any variable and choose "Show in Memory View", which will actually cause the pane to load. I have no idea why this is required given that the Memory View is perfectly capable of navigating to raw addresses or addresses computed by arbitrary expressions once the pane has loaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You (probably) can't set breakpoints through the UI because the Zig plugin doesn't register the Zig filetype as capable of having breakpoints set on it. There's no way to fix this without writing a plugin, unfortunately, but you can still use the GDB console to set breakpoints. They won't persist between sessions, though, or show up in the UI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of the fixes worked. I can now see variables and open them in the memory view.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/clion.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The memory view doesn't support editing memory, but I can still do that in the gdb console.</p>
<p>I added <code>*actual.items.ptr@100</code> to the watches list and it rendered the whole array perfectly happily.</p>
<p>Setting breakpoints in the gdb console seemed to work at first, but restarting the program to get to the breakpoint doesn't. If I rerun using the button in the debugger, the breakpoints disappear. If I try to restart the program from within gdb, it crashes:</p>
<pre><code><span>(gdb) info breakpoints
No breakpoints or watchpoints.
(gdb) b Tree.searchForwards
Breakpoint 1 at 0x207222: file /home/jamie/focus/lib/focus/tree.zig, line 591.
(gdb) run
Command 'run' is not supported.
(gdb) start
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) [answered Y; input not from terminal]
Temporary breakpoint 2 at 0x2097dc: file /nix/store/5g4w66g606d46w8pmzwzq7flrlk3k7cs-zig/lib/zig/std/start.zig, line 243.
Starting program: /home/jamie/focus/test 1&gt; '/dev/pts/4' 2&gt; '/dev/pts/5' 
During startup program exited with code 1.
</span></code></pre>
<p>I can get this to work by starting the program, immediately pausing, setting a breakpoint and then resuming. </p>
<p>Holding F8 to continue runs smoothly, like most of the other debuggers. But unlike most of the other debuggers the local variables stop being displayed until I release the key, so I can't just watch the changes in real time.</p>
<h2 id="netbeans">netbeans</h2>
<p>I made a new C++ project with the wizard and hit "Debug Main Project". At first I though nothing happened, but after a while I noticed a small red message box at the bottom-right of the screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/netbeans_0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It's actually bigger when it first appears, but it shrinks after a few seconds of not being noticed.</p>
<p>Anyway:</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/netbeans_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It says it can't write to /tmp.</p>
<pre><code><span>jamie@machine:~/nixpkgs$ cat &gt; /tmp/test
foo
jamie@machine:~/nixpkgs$ cat /tmp/test
foo
</span></code></pre>
<p>I can write to /tmp.</p>
<p>It also says I should do something like <code>netbeans -J-Dcnd.tmpbase="/home/jamie/netbeans-project"</code>. But that produces the same error message, still referring to "/tmp" rather than the directory I gave it. Did I spell something wrong?</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<pre><code><span>[nix-shell:~]$ strace netbeans 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep 'tmp'

[nix-shell:~]$
</span></code></pre>
<p>It doesn't actually seem to be trying to write "/tmp". It actually doesn't issue any syscalls at all when I press "Debug Main Project" and trigger the message. So I think it's just misreporting some other error. The underlying issue is probably nix-related again.</p>
<p>Also... I try to avoid ranting about software, because software is hard. But if you give me an error message and then make the error text non-selectable and then in the context menu only offer "Mark As Read" instead of "Copy To Clipboard So I Can Google This" then it makes debugging a lot slower.</p>
<h2 id="cgdb">cgdb</h2>
<p>Broadly similar to gdb -tui. It shows the source window and has a lot of useful keyboard shortcuts, but it doesn't display much ambient information like current backtrace or local variables. Everything seems to work, but it's not what I'm looking for.</p>
<h2 id="kdevelop">kdevelop</h2>
<pre><code><span>[nix-shell:~]$ kdevelop --version
kdevelop 5.5.2
</span></code></pre>
<p>Running, breaking, setting watchpoints and navigating the backtrace all worked smoothly.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be a memory view or a way to display arbitrary expressions. I tried adding <code>display (*actual.items.ptr)@100</code> in the gdb console and it didn't appear anywhere on screen, nor did it print the result in the console after the first time.</p>
<p>The rendering of large arrays is a bit annoying - you have to click at the beginning to reveal a few more elements, but they appear at the end. So getting the whole thing on screen requires lots of scrolling.</p>
<p>The key binding for 'next' is also in use by kate, so you have to go into the bindings menu and disambiguate. Which wouldn't be a big deal except that it reset several times over the course of a single session so I had to keep visiting the bindings menu.</p>
<h2 id="gdb-dashboard">gdb-dashboard</h2>
<p>An init file for gdb that adds a dashboard, which is printed whenever the program stops and can be hooked to print at other times too.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/gdb-dashboard.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is pretty great. It doesn't offer the easy point-and-click of a gui but it does reliably put a bunch of useful context on the screen. And it manages to do that without breaking or hiding basic features of gdb like most of the gui frontends I tried. </p>
<p>I'm still on the lookout for a good gui debugger, but this is what I'll use in the meantime.</p>
<h2 id="voltron">voltron</h2>
<p>Loris Cro suggested voltron which is similar to gdb-dashboard but opens the various view in separate terminals and updates them in real time. This seems like a strict improvement and I really like the idea.</p>
<p>After wading through the usual python dependency management morass, I managed to occasionally run some voltron views but mostly managed to crash it repeatedly, and occasionally gdb too. </p>
<p>(The gdb crashes are in <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/ad867039557cc4c6f5ffe22e4f14a0f13fa78c86">somewhere inside printf</a> so this might be the same issue as the tui crash above.) </p>
<h2 id="gdb-frontend">gdb-frontend</h2>
<p>Ilmari Lauhakangas suggested the somewhat generically named gdb-frontend. </p>
<p>If I type the full path in the file picker it pops up "An error has occurred". You have to type the dirname and then pick the file from the list.</p>
<p>When I ran the program it reached the breakpoint and then the UI stopped responding to button clicks and occasionally spat out messages saying the gdb main thread was blocking.</p>
<p>After C-c in terminal it left behind a bunch of ophan gdb processes that prevented gdbfrontend from being restarted.</p>
<h2 id="ddd-again">ddd (again)</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25410215">drosan explained</a> that in ddd the focus follows the mouse which explains why I had trouble typing in the text boxes.</p>
<p>The other bugs I experienced are still blockers though.</p>

<p>Other tools that came up in the conversation:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hugsy/gef">gef</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg">pwndbg</a> add a bunch of commands to gdb that are useful for low-level debugging and reverse engineering. 
<a href="https://github.com/radareorg/radare2">radare2</a> is an independent set of tools for the same purpose that can optionally connect to gdb. I don't have much use for these at the moment, but it's good to know about them.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeclap.itch.io/codeclap">codeclap</a> looks interesting but is still in alpha and doesn't have a demo.</p>
<p><a href="https://pernos.co/">pernosco</a> is a project I've been keeping an eye on. It's not currently affordable for hobby stuff, but I can certainly imagine paying for it when I start doing commercial work again.</p>
<p><a href="https://frida.re/">frida</a> injects javascript code into binaries. At the very least, this enables post-hoc println debugging. I've put aside a weekend in my calendar to try it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://justine.storage.googleapis.com/blinkenlights/index.html">blinkenlights</a> I think is a way to watch your code execute as directly as possible, so you can build intuition for what is actually happening on the hardware. I tried it out quickly and it rendered a single frame before exiting with code 0. But it's interesting enough that I made a note to come back and try it again next year.</p>
<p>I haven't tried many proprietary options so far. While I have a strong preference for foss tools, I'm open to suggestions for good proprietary tools so long as I can try them out without emailing a sales team for a quote.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Wireguard is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology that aims to enable the easy deployment and configuration of servers and clients. Wireguard is intended to replace the use of IPSec or OpenVPN for many VPN applications.</strong> </p>



<p>Wireguard offers both kernel and userspace implementations. The in-kernel version is faster, but must be customized for each OS, and not every OS supports this yet. The first kernel implementation was offered for Linux, but there is now an in-kernel implementations for FreeBSD, and also one for OpenBSD, with a NetBSD implementation in progress. Wireguard needed crypto primitives that were not present in FreeBSD, having high quality native support required a large amount of work and communication with the upstream Wireguard project. The FreeBSD kernel implementation was written by Matt Macy with sponsorship from NetGate, without this vendor support it is unlikely that a project of this size would have been successful.</p>



<p>The main userspace implementation of wireguard is a golang application and it is available via the wireguard-go tool available in FreeBSD ports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A wireguard network configuration is formed of interfaces and peers. Each interface is defined by its private key, peers are defined by their public key and the set of addresses they are allowed to use. This forms a network that uses cryptokey routing.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="3686" data-permalink="https://klarasystems.com/articles/simple-and-secure-vpn-in-freebsd/image-1-2/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/klarasystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.jpeg?fit=468%2C353&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="468,353" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/klarasystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.jpeg?fit=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/klarasystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.jpeg?fit=468%2C353&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="468" height="353" src="https://i2.wp.com/klarasystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.jpeg?resize=468%2C353&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/klarasystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.jpeg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https://i2.wp.com/klarasystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/klarasystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.jpeg?resize=200%2C150&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>With cryptokey routing, hosts are defined by their cryptographic keys, where public keys are used as identifiers. This means that most of the configuration for wireguard requires dealing with these public keys. Wireguard does not specify mechanisms for key distribution and management, and it is fair to compare this with the distribution of ssh keys. Unlike ssh, the public keys need to be available for both sides of the connection.</p>



<p>Wireguard uses INI files for static configuration, a config file might look like:</p>



<pre><code>[Interface]
PrivateKey = EO9b4bV1qg0veyFelERv69v4eamKu/evGZ/Hbiq82Eg=
ListenPort = 51820

[Peer]
PublicKey = ZBF6vo22sBkT0ro/xnlZ0EZsFGTYPTOvY8luFFtJwwk=    
AllowedIPs = 10.10.0.2/32

[Peer]
PublicKey = fnpAo3hMf9UOtPpM+CUtpB+ETvB5XjNLIuTGsX+qnCc
AllowedIPs = 10.10.0.138/32

[Peer]
PublicKey = Tpdhd68aaDAQfNsnqzoViMl1h+yHeYuVZ22xrY1BM0I=
AllowedIPs = 10.10.0.3/32, 192.168.2.1/24
</code></pre>



<p>The allowed IP addresses act as a routing table. When traffic is sent, the packet is compared to the peer’s AllowedIPs, and if it matches the address or the subnet, the packet is encrypted using the peer’s public key and forwarded over the tunnel in its direction.</p>



<p>On receipt of a packet, AllowedIPs acts as a receive filter. The packet is first decrypted and authenticated, and then it is evaluated against the AllowedIPs to verify that it is allowed to enter the network.</p>



<h4><strong>Installation</strong></h4>



<p>Wireguard makes a serious effort to make the tools it offers consistent on all platforms. To do this, there are two components that determine whether the kernel or userspace implementation is used. The first is a method to create a wireguard interface; this is the component that changes between kernel and userspace versions, then there is a single configuration wg(8) tool to manage the VPN.</p>



<p>This approach intends to smooth over platform configuration differences. The platform specific part is creating and configuring the network interface, but the VPN configuration should all be manageable with a single consistent tool.</p>



<p>FreeBSD has an in-kernel implementation of wireguard that landed in the tree in&nbsp;<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=368163">November 2020</a>. The in-kernel implementation is still very fresh, so in this article we will use the userspace tool, as it is available in the most supported versions of FreeBSD today. The in-kernel implementation key generation is still performed using the wg(8) tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can install wg(8) and wireguard-go (the wireguard userspace implementation) from ports with:</p>



<pre><code># pkg install wireguard wireguard-tools</code></pre>



<h4><strong>Creating Keys</strong></h4>



<p>Our host’s identity is defined by its key pair. We need to generate a wireguard private key using the&nbsp;wg genkey&nbsp;command; wireguard helpfully (if frustratingly) insists that we don’t place the private key in a world readable file. To generate the key and append it to a file, we need to temporally change our umask:</p>



<pre><code># (umask 0077; wg genkey &gt; private.key)
# cat private.key
MOtM8w02ONtGK9vmLCXlx6em+5pRTm6C0z7HCeIrPlY=
</code></pre>



<p>This command creates a private key and places it into a file called private.key. We can view the private key by catting the file; anyone with the private key can act as the server, so you should be very careful with your wireguard private keys. Wireguard tools will typically censor the private key in output unless additional flags are given.&nbsp;</p>

<div><div>
<p>Did you know?</p>



<h2>You can maximize the <strong>power of your FreeBSD</strong> infrastructure with our <strong>Support Subscription!</strong></h2>




</div></div>




</div></div>



<p>Wireguard uses our public key as our identity, wg(8) will show us the public key for a private key with the&nbsp;<em>wg pubkeycommand</em>:</p>



<pre><code># wg pubkey &lt; private.key
APWANIrAD3drcSNUdDuUuXLsCRksKxuQxwBHf56UxiM=
</code></pre>



<h4><strong>Server Side</strong></h4>



<p>First, let’s configure our server side. The server is going to act as the central host in our network with several clients connecting to it for access. This host needs to have a stable public IP and a known shared port to accept wireguard traffic on.</p>



<p>We need to generate keys for the server:</p>



<pre><code>wg-server (umask 0077; wg genkey &gt; server.key)
wg-server # cat server.key
AJKFyhDoLfLnlclEcKV97bRonVKGgEbRGi7vGfeYNnw=
wg-server # wg pubkey &lt; server.key      # show the public key for this private key
j2klzAC0RnWOOUAcZw+/GEtp5URCSwf9r3yW+JYJRRE=
</code></pre>



<p>Next, there are a few steps to set up the network. We need to create a wireguard interface using wireguard-go:</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # wireguard-go wg0
INFO: (wg0) 2021/01/08 14:35:42 Starting wireguard-go version 0.0.20200320
</code></pre>



<p>This interface needs to be configured to have an address in our private network on the host and a route to direct traffic into the wireguard tunnel. We use the wg(8) tool to configure the interface’s private key.</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # ifconfig wg0 inet 10.10.0.1/24 10.10.0.1
wg-client # route add 10.10.0.0/24 -interface wg0
wg-server # wg set wg0 private-key ./server.key listen-port 51820
</code></pre>



<p>If we don’t specify the listen port here, then wireguard will select a random port when the wg0 interface is brought up. For a destination server like this, we need to have a consistent port between addresses, and so we use one common to wireguard here.</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # ifconfig wg0 down
wg-server # ifconfig wg0 up
</code></pre>



<p>Finally, we need to configure each peer with its public key and the IP addresses it is allowed to use:</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # wg set wg0 peer &lt;peer pubkey&gt; allowed-ips 10.10.0.2/32 </code></pre>



<h4><strong>FreeBSD Client</strong></h4>



<p>Each client needs to go through similar steps: first create a private key to identify the client:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client (umask 0077; wg genkey &gt; client.key)
wg-client # cat client.key
gM3ydSBBTZOw1nzIyV/nxJuONB8/MNe/RhcOikQbE3Y=
wg-client # wg pubkey &lt; client.key      # show the public key for this private key
jILr21Xt+3sXDZepu5Z3syuJMXyc29f5GBXHZFPulEE=
</code></pre>



<p>We need to create the wireguard interface by running wireguard-go:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # wireguard-go wg0            # create the wg0 interface</code></pre>



<p>This interface is then configured for the internal VPN network. wireguard-go creates a tun interface, and tun interfaces need to be configured with a source and destination address. As that is not important here, we can use the same address for both parts. To make sure we can reach the internal network properly, we also need to add a route:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # ifconfig wg0 inet 10.10.0.2/24 10.10.0.2
wg-client # route add 10.10.0.0/24 -interface wg0
</code></pre>



<p>With the interface configured, we can now configure wireguard:</p>



<pre>wg-client # wg set wg0 private-key ./client.key&nbsp;</pre>



<p>Finally, we need to configure the wg0 interface with an endpoint for the server:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # ifconfig wg0 down
wg-client # ifconfig wg0 up
wg-client # wg set wg0 peer &lt;peer pubkey&gt; allowed-ips 10.10.0.0/24 endpoint 192.0.2.42:51820
</code></pre>



<p>When we configured the client peer, we told wireguard where to find the server with the endpoint parameter. In this case the client doesn’t listen on a predictable port, but instead it first has to create the wireguard tunnel with the server when traffic needs to be sent.</p>



<p>Now that we have created and configured our client, we need to add its public key and allowed-ip addresses to the server.</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # wg set wg0 peer jILr21Xt+3sXDZepu5Z3syuJMXyc29f5GBXHZFPulEE= allowed-ips 10.10.0.2/32 </code></pre>



<p>Finally we can test the set up using ping:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # ping 10.10.0.1
PING 10.10.0.1 (10.10.0.1): 56 data bytes                 
64 bytes from 10.10.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=3.253 ms  
64 bytes from 10.10.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.358 ms  
64 bytes from 10.10.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.089 ms                                                            
64 bytes from 10.10.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=1.649 ms                                                            
^C                           
</code></pre>



<p>Wireguard is not a ‘chatty’ protocol. If there is no traffic to send from the client for a long time, and it doesn’t have a fixed address, the server can ‘forget’ how to reach the client.</p>



<p>It might be the case that the client is behind a NAT network. To support this case, wireguard supports the<em>&nbsp;persistent-keepalive&nbsp;</em>configuration option. This option is disabled by default, but it allows our client to receive packets from the server when it is not sending traffic itself.</p>



<p>RFC4787 recommends a 2 minute timeout interval for NATs and middleboxes, but recent UDP protocols (such as QUIC), recommend sending packets every 30 seconds to prevent middleboxes from&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1879141.1879174">losing state for UDP flows</a>.</p>



<p>If you need the tunnel connection kept alive, add the&nbsp;persistent-keepalive&nbsp;parameter:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # wg set wg0 peer &lt;peer pubkey&gt; allowed-ips 10.10.0.0/24 persistent-keepalive 30 endpoint 192.0.2.42:51820</code></pre>

<p>This is an updated version of the 2019 post, architecture of my life, which you can find <a href="https://blog.nntn.nl/architecture-of-my-life" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Automation is something dear to my heart. Like the figure at the top of this post, I am not sure that in the end it will have actually saved me time, but it has given me many opportunities to learn, as trying to build a resilient piece of software with a beautiful architecture, which helps me be more productive is an ever-evolving project, which will keep pushing me to learn more. I hope with this I can inspire you to automate some part of your life.</p>
<p>In this blogpost I will describe the following things:</p>
<ul><li><a href="#the-foundation"><b>The foundation</b></a>:<br>The code my automation is built upon. It will also explain the fundamental ideas behind how I think about automation.</li>
<li><a href="#actions"><b>Actions</b></a><b>:</b><br>An overview of some of the automation I have built. If you're looking for some inspiration to build something yourself, this is the place to go.</li>
<li><a href="#other-software-i-made"><b>Other software</b></a><b>:</b><br>Not everything I built can be run inside the framework I built. I also built some other cool utilities to help me in my every day life.</li></ul>

<p>The core and foundation of my automation is named Atlas. Atlas handles everything to run my automation, from connecting to services to handling errors.</p>
<h2 id="an-action">An Action</h2>
<p>At the core of Atlas is a simple idea: Actions. Anything I might ever want to automate is an action. It will act on my behalf on the online services that I use. Some actions will check for themselves if they need to run (adding a reminder for a sent email). The action can also decide how often it wants to run, from every 15 minutes to once a week. Others I only want to run when I need them to (checking the uptime of my systems). </p>
<p>Some require input to do their job correctly (adding a todo to my todo list). The most complicated actions have some state, as the input they require is more complicated. </p>
<p>To build this state I use a chatbot interface, where I give a command, the system parses my input, updates the state and performs the next step, incrementally building the state until all the necessary properties for the action to complete are in place. This flow is explained in the figure below</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F4c8fca8e-34ca-4d28-aae0-8739d858799a%2FUntitled.png?table=block&amp;id=3589228c-eff7-48d2-96d1-453c772c5623&amp;userId=&amp;cache=v2" alt="Overview of the state"><figcaption>Overview of the state</figcaption></figure>
<p>For example, when I want to add a task to a specific task list, I first write the content of that task, which is added to the state. It replies asking which project I want it to add to with some example task lists. I reply with "Write a blog". In the "Update State" part of the flow, this title of a task list is then internally converted to the internal id of the list. This way, me and anyone else using the system do not need to know the exact internals.</p>
<h2 id="interface">Interface</h2>
<p>Atlas is always part of another project. It is wrapped in Ares, a project that connects Atlas and the Microsoft Bot Framework to make it available as a chatbot, in my case as a Telegram chatbot, where you can ask it to perform the actions. It is also run as an Azure Function, available as a <a href="https://zeus-laurentia.azurewebsites.net/api/run/help" target="blank">web-api</a>. I have used this API to build an iOS shortcut to run Actions from my phone and watch and have created a windows application such that I can run any action from my laptop. The Azure Function also runs on a timer trigger and executes every 15 minutes to execute the relevant actions. </p>

<figure><img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Ff3b1e86d-a29f-42cd-a80c-2919f668ba32%2FUntitled.png?table=block&amp;id=cd513ca1-b189-4792-9c94-ea4428a84242&amp;userId=&amp;cache=v2" alt="Telegram chat interface"><figcaption>Telegram chat interface</figcaption></figure>





<h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h2>
<p>One of the problems of building your own automation is that things are breaking. Constantly. I am connecting to 17 online services and having 35.000+ lines of code means that it is likely something will break. Most of the errors occur within Actions, as they make the calls to external services and change (and therefore break) most often. To make sure one action does not break the entire system, the actions are run in a try-catch block. </p>
<p>Once an action crashes, automation will start running to handle the crash. Independently running actions will start to send me messages to tell me that it is broken after four failed runs, so that timeouts and other temporary problems donâ€™t bother me. It will also automatically throttle itself, postponing its next run in an exponential way, to make sure it does not break anything and I do not get spammed with messages. </p>
<p>After 10 crashes, my automation will automatically create a GitHub issue with the name of the action that crashes and the stack trace. It will even try to generate a url to line in the code in GitHub link where it believes the issue is originating.</p>
<p>The Telegram chatbot will ask the user after a single crash if it wants to make a GitHub issue, as this is deemed more important.</p>
<p>Now, you have a good overview of the basics, we can discuss the cool parts.</p>

<h2 id="spotify">Spotify</h2>
<p>I like to listen to a lot of music. Last year, I spent 98.960 minutes listening to <a href="https://spotify.com/" target="blank">Spotify</a>, one of the most  popular streaming services out there. To help me get the most out of their service, I have a lot of automation running to help me. </p>
<h3 id="sort-by-loudness">Sort by Loudness</h3>
<p>To aid you in finding new music, Spotify presents you with two auto-generated personalized playlists. AÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/using_spotify/playlists/discover-weekly/" target="blank">Discover Weekly</a>Â&nbsp;playlist with new music from new artists and aÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/using_spotify/playlists/release-radar/" target="blank">Release Radar</a>Â&nbsp;playlist which contains music released this week. Both are very nice, but have one problem, they jump from very loud energetic to peaceful piano music. This is very jarring if you are listening. To solve this, I download all songs from the playlist and get the features of the songs. <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/#audio-features-object" target="blank">These features are provided by Spotify</a> and contain things like energy, danceability, liveness and loudness. I order all songs by loudness and put them in a new playlist for me. This way I can listen to my music from very loud to very peaceful.</p>
<h3 id="personally-generated-playlists">Personally generated playlists</h3>
<p>Once you have features of songs, you can think bigger. Spotify can extract features from all of my saved music. From that you can generate playlists. However to do that, you would need to find the perfect settings to create a nice playlist. For this I created a windows application called Playlister, explained further below. Using Playlister, I have created playlists named Summer, Winter, Piano and Energy. Every week, Atlas downloads all my saved songs from Spotify and runs it through each of the finely tuned filters for my playlists and updates each with new songs Iâ€™ve added and removes songs I no longer like. So if I want to listen to music that gets me hyped, I listen to the Energy playlist, which consists of songs I like that, following my tweaks, can be considered full of energy.</p>
<h3 id="last-4-weeks">Last 4 weeks</h3>
<p>I (used to) spend a lot of time biking and travelling by train. I have a data plan, but don't want to overshoot it. This leads to the fact that I need Spotify to download a lot of music. However, I also have a lot of new music that I want to bring with me. I could download all my music, but my phone does not have enough storage for that. To solve this problem, Atlas will update a playlist every night with all of the songs I added in the last 4 weeks. I then tell Spotify to keep this playlist downloaded at all times. This leads to an almost always updated playlist with my newest songs.</p>
<h3 id="random-songs">Random Songs</h3>
<p>In the previous paragraph I explained that I canâ€™t download every songs to my phone. However, I might want to listen to a random selection of music every once in a while. Music not in one of my automatically generated playlist or in any other list. Furthermore, even if I have internet, I sometimes feel like the shuffle is not completely random. And lastly, it is also sorted by loudness and if I need to concentrate, I can start at loud and end at calm music. To solve these problems, every night Atlas takes all my saved music, picks 50 random songs and adds it to a playlist sorted by loudness, so I can always listen to some random music I like.</p>
<h3 id="full-release-radar">Full Release Radar</h3>
<p>Spotify has a feature called Release Radar, where each week, you can listen to music that came out that week from artists you follow or might find interesting. This is great and Iâ€™ve gotten a lot of new music from it, however it might miss artists that I like and if an artist released an entire album, it will only display one song in the playlist, which I can definitely understand, but I donâ€™t want. So I created an Action on Atlas, which every Friday checks all the artists I follow. If they released any new music in the last week and it puts the songs into a playlist called â€œFull release radarâ€�, so that I do have this overview.<br>As an addition, another action checks if I added music from a new artist and automatically follows them, so this list is constantly expanding.</p>
<h2 id="todoist">Todoist</h2>
<p>Task lists are must for me. I forget a lot of things and task lists enable me to keep track of all the things I need to do. To help me I use <a href="https://todoist.com/" target="blank">Todoist</a>.</p>
<h3 id="temporary-projects">Temporary Projects</h3>
<p>As some might know, every Friday, I try to clean my room. This is very nice, as during the week I donâ€™t have to think about keeping everything clean, as on Friday I will clean it anyways, nor do I have to force it in sometime during the week. Cleaning is something that I have to go through often and has a predetermined list of tasks. Although I try to do it on Friday, it might occur that it happens on another day. To be able to start with all of these tasks on the fly I have an Action which can import a template at any time. The template is written inÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://www.taskpaper.com/" target="blank">TaskPaper</a>, a simplistic way of writing down tasks, to create all projects and tasks. These configuration files are stored in my OneDrive, so I can edit, delete or add any new list at any time or any place.</p>
<h3 id="github-synchronisation">GitHub Synchronisation</h3>
<p>On <a href="https://github.com/" target="blank">GitHub</a>, I currently have 7 repositories where I have issues open that I plan on fixing one day. To keep track of this in one place, I synchronize them to Todoist, where I can see them in a separate project. This is only one way, as I neither want to create issues in Todoist, not be able to complete them. </p>
<h3 id="today-action">Today action</h3>
<p>When doing work from my task list, there are two main categories this work can be divided into: work that needs to be done today and work that you plan on doing today. The first is easily managed in Todoist by due dates. The second is managed by myself with a …</p></article></div>

<p>The pandemic has subsided; the number of people who have recovered from COVID19 (SARS-CoV-2) have been steadily rising. With this new development, the question of how long the immunity against the virus will last remains a cause for concern for experts, including the general public.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.rockefeller.edu/news/30005-sars-cov-2-immune-response-improves-long-term-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new study</a> has found that the immunity against COVID-19 post recovery remains for at least six months and likely even longer.</p>
<p><span>In the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03207-w#citeas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper published</a> in the journal <em>Nature</em>, the researchers note that the immune system studies the nature of the virus remarkably well and strategize itself to develop better and more effective antibodies even after the infection has abated.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p>Now before we get further into detail, let’s first understand how our immune system protects us from many different types of unwanted invaders, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi, and how it helps us attain immunity against them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The immune system is an army of cells, tissues, and organs that coordinate the bodily defenses against any threats. The white blood cells, also known as leukocytes, are one of the most important cells involved in the process, and they circulate throughout the body and make sure there are not any unwanted foreign invaders that may harm us.</p>



<p>There are two divisions of leukocytes, and they are: phagocytes and lymphocytes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phagocytes are the first cells to trigger <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000821.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immune response</a>; they destroy any foreign cells they encounter through ingestion. This helps them identify the antigen present in the foreign cells, and transmit this information to lymphocytes, which then hunt for infected body cells and annihilate them completely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lymphocytes unit of the immune system comprises of two major cellular components called B-cells and T-cells. These cells utilize the information collected from the antigens to recognize any unwanted visitors in the future. So once a threat makes another visit, the cells will unleash the right antibodies to destroy the invaders. This is how our body develops immunity against certain diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the effectiveness of immune response decreases with time as the level of antibodies drops after a certain period. So in order to deal with pathogens more efficiently, the immune system doesn’t always produce antibodies, instead it resorts to creating memory B-cells that easily recognize the pathogen and release a new batch of antibodies upon re-exposure to the any unwanted visitors.</p>



<p>In the study, the researchers found that these antibodies emerged post SARS-CoV-2 infection are the results of immune cells working in choir to evolve while simultaneously being constantly exposed to hidden remnants of the virus in the intestinal wall. And as a result, the next time a recovered patient contracts the virus, their body will initiate a rapid immune response to the virus, hence preventing reinfection. However, the efficacy of this memory on warding off the infection is solely determined by the nature of the pathogen the person has contracted with.</p>



<p>For the study, the researchers assessed the antibody responses of 87 participants at two separate time-points: one month following infection, and then again after six months. They found that although the antibodies lingered on the participants’ blood plasma for six months, there were significant drops in their levels and as a result of that, the ability to neutralize the virus plummeted five-fold.</p>



<p>Surprisingly however, the subsequent batch of antibodies produced by the memory B cells in patients, increased in some cases. The researches have specified that the overall numbers of memory B-cells that unleashed antibodies that attack the receptor-binding domain of the virus, remained the same. These antibodies are the ones that will fend off the virus upon re-encounter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, upon closer inspection at the memory B cells, the team also found that these cells had mutated many times over even after the infection waned, and this made the antibodies the cells created outperformed the originals in staving off the virus. Moreover, this new set of antibodies could latch on to the virus and even identify the mutated versions of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They have been found to be able to identify even the mutated version of SARS-CoV-2 including <a href="https://theconversation.com/south-african-scientists-who-discovered-new-covid-19-variant-share-what-they-know-153313" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South African Variants</a> (called 501Y.V2) that have undergone mutations for more than 20 times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The memory B cells of course mutate and deploy antibodies at times of infections like HIV or herpes, but seeing them evolve with SARS-CoV-2, which is believed to wither soon after infection has resolved, was never expected until now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SARS-Cov-2 thrives and replicates in the upper respiratory tract. However, upon examining biopsies of intestinal tissue from recovered patients, its genetic materials and proteins were detected within it. The researchers conjecture this could be what’s fueling the evolution of memory B-cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The infectiousness of these viral remnants are yet to be determined. In the future, the team plans to understand the role these viral remnants play in immunity as well as in the progression of the disease by making more participants involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study has been published in the journal <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03207-w#citeas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature</a></em>:</p>

<p>Some critics think the curl project shouldn’t use GitHub. The reasons for being against GitHub hosting tend to be one or more of:</p>



<ol><li>it is an evil proprietary platform</li><li>it is run by Microsoft and they are evil</li><li> GitHub is American thus evil</li></ol>



<p>Some have insisted on craziness like “we let GitHub hold our source code hostage”.</p>



<h2>Why GitHub?</h2>



<p>The curl project <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2010/03/23/curl-goes-git/">switched to GitHub</a> (from Sourceforge) almost eleven years ago and it’s been a smooth ride ever since.</p>



<p>We’re on GitHub not only because it provides a myriad of practical features and is a stable and snappy service for hosting and managing source code. GitHub is also a developer hub for millions of developers who already have accounts and are familiar with the GitHub style of developing, the terms and the tools. By being on GitHub, we reduce friction from the contribution process and we maximize the ability for others to join in and help. We lower the bar. This is good for us.</p>



<p>I like GitHub.</p>



<h2>Self-hosting is not better</h2>



<p>Providing even close to the same uptime and snappy response times with a self-hosted service is a challenge, and it would take someone time and energy to volunteer that work – time and energy we now instead can spend of developing the project instead. As a small independent open source project, we don’t have any “infrastructure department” that would do it for us. And trust me: we already have enough infrastructure management to deal with without having to add to that pile.</p>



<p>… and by running our own hosted version, we would lose the “network effect” and convenience for people that already are on and know the platform. We would also lose the easy integration with cool services like the many different CI and code analyzer jobs we run.</p>



<h2>Proprietary is not the issue</h2>



<p>While git is open source, GitHub is a proprietary system. But the thing is that even if we would go with a competitor and get our code hosting done elsewhere, our code would still be stored on a machine somewhere in a remote server park we cannot physically access – ever. It doesn’t matter if that hosting company uses open source or proprietary code. If they decide to switch off the servers one day, or even just selectively block our project, there’s nothing we can do to get our stuff back out from there.</p>



<p>We have to work so that we minimize the risk for it and the effects from it if it still happens.</p>



<p>A proprietary software platform holds our code just as much hostage as any free or open source software platform would, simply by the fact that we let someone else host it. They run the servers our code is stored on.</p>



<h2>If GitHub takes the ball and goes home</h2>



<p>No matter which service we use, there’s always a risk that they will turn off the light one day and not come back – or just change the rules or licensing terms that would prevent us from staying there. We cannot avoid that risk. But we can make sure that we’re smart about it, have a contingency plan or at least an idea of what to do when that day comes.</p>



<p>If GitHub shuts down immediately and we get zero warning to rescue anything at all from them, what would be the result for the curl project?</p>



<p><strong>Code.</strong> We would still have the entire git repository with all code, all source history and all existing branches up until that point. We’re hundreds of developers who pull that repository frequently, and many automatically, so there’s a very distributed backup all over the world.</p>



<p><strong>CI</strong>. Most of our CI setup is done with yaml config files in the source repo. If we transition to another hosting platform, we could reuse them.</p>



<p><strong>Issues</strong>. Bug reports and pull requests are stored on GitHub and a sudden exit would definitely make us lose some of them. We do daily “extractions” of all issues and pull-requests so a lot of meta-data could still be saved and preserved. I don’t think this would be a terribly hard blow either: we move long-standing bugs and ideas over to documents in the repository, so the currently open ones are likely possible to get resubmitted again within the nearest future.</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that it would be a significant speed bump for the project, but it would not be worse than that. We could bounce back on a new platform and development would go on <em>within days</em>.</p>



<h2>Low risk</h2>



<p>It’s a rare thing, that a service just suddenly with no warning and no heads up would just go black and leave projects completely stranded. In most cases, we get alerts, notifications and get a chance to transition cleanly and orderly.</p>



<h2>There are alternatives</h2>



<p>Sure there are alternatives. Both pure GitHub alternatives that look similar and provide similar services, and projects that would allow us to run similar things ourselves and host locally. There are many options.</p>



<p><strong>I’m not looking for alternatives. I’m not planning to switch hosting anytime soon!</strong> As mentioned above, I think GitHub is a net positive for the curl project.</p>



<h2>Nothing lasts forever</h2>



<p>We’ve switched services several times before and I’m expecting that we will change again in the future, for all sorts of hosting and related project offerings that we provide to the work and to the developers and participators within the project. Nothing lasts forever.</p>



<p>When  a service we use goes down or just turns sour, we will figure out the best possible replacement and take the jump. Then we patch up all the cracks the jump may have caused and continue the race into the future. Onward and upward. The way we know and the way we’ve done for over twenty years already. </p>

<h2>Updates</h2>



<p>After this blog post went live, some users remarked than I’m “<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/bfxd28">disingenuous</a>” in the list of reasons at the top, that people have presented to me.  This, because I don’t mention the moral issues staying on GitHub present – like for example previously reported workplace conflicts and their association with hideous American immigration authorities.</p>



<p>This is rather the opposite of  disingenuous. This is the truth. Not a single person have <em>ever</em> asked me to leave GitHub for those reasons. Not me personally, and nobody has asked it out to the wider project either.</p>



<p>These are good reasons to discuss and consider if a service should be used. Have there been violations of “decency” significant enough that should make us leave? Have we crossed that line in the sand? I’m leaning to “no” now, but I’m always listening to what curl users and developers say. Where do you think the line is drawn?</p>

January 27, 2021 | https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>
I am often asked what I mean when I say that developers spend most of their time figuring the system out. Let’s unpack the statement.
</p>
<p>
The oldest reference on the topic I know of dates back to 1979 in a book by Zelkowitz, Shaw, and Gannon entitled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-software-engineering-design-Prentice-Hall/dp/013710202X">Principles of software engineering and design</a>. It said that most of the development time was spent on maintenance (67%).
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/1979-graph-picture.png" alt="Software development costs (1979)">
	<figcaption>Software development costs (1979)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Granted, the book does not specify how the figure was obtained. Still, it was deemed an important enough problem to attract significant research attention since then.
</p>
<p>
So, how far are we now, more than 4 decades later?
</p>
<p>
Let’s look at a recent paper by Xia, Bao, Lo, Xing, Hassan, &amp; Li entitled <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318811113_Measuring_Program_Comprehension_A_Large-Scale_Field_Study_with_Professionals">Measuring Program Comprehension: A Large-Scale Field Study with Professionals</a> and published in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 44, 951-976, 2018. This paper is quite interesting in that it describes in great details how the figures are obtained. And it says that Comprehension took on average ~58%.
</p>
<p>
Now, take a closer look at the results table.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/2018-costs.png" alt="Software development costs (2018)">
	<figcaption>Software development costs (2018)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
In particular, take a look at the third column in the table: it says Navigation accounts for 24% of the effort, and that is considered separately from the Comprehension effort!
</p>
<p>
So, after 4 decades, we can observe that not much has changed beside learning how to measure the “figuring out” time.
</p>
<p>
So what?
</p>
<p>
Well, that is the single largest expense we have. If we want to optimize anything in our discipline we should look at this part first. We talk often about how we build systems, but how often do you talk about how you spend the “figuring out" time? If we do not talk about it, it’s not explicit. If it’s not explicit, it does not get optimized.
</p>
<p>
If we do talk about how the “figuring out the system” time is spent, we notice that people spend it reading. In fact, as the above paper also shows, comprehension is essentially measured as reading! The two are considered as mostly synonymous.
</p>
<p>
So, how should we talk about how we figure the system out?
</p>
<p>
Given that not much happened for 4 decades, we should entertain the idea that maybe we should frame the problem differently. 
</p>
<p>
Please, bear with me. This is where it gets interesting. So, why do developers read code? Because they want to figure the situation enough to know what to do next. The intent is important. This is decision making.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/decision-making.png" alt="The figuring out time is a decision making time">
	<figcaption>The figuring out time is a decision making time</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
From this perspective, reading is just the means through which information is gathered from data. It also happens to be the most manual possible way to do that, so this lends itself to an important opportunity for optimization.
</p>
<p>
Before you can do something significant about anything, you have to name it. Otherwise it's like with Voldemort. <a href="http://humane-assessment.com/">Many winters ago</a>, I called the effort of “figuring the system out to know what to do next" assessment. And I claimed we should optimize development around it.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/assessment.png" alt="Assessment is the process of understanding a situation around a system enough to make a decision">
	<figcaption>Assessment is the process of understanding a situation around a system enough to make a decision</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
For a whole decade my colleagues and I explored this idea. And it led us to what we now call moldable development.
</p>
<p>
What’s that?
</p>
<p>
Reading is the most manual way to extract information out of data. It does not scale and leads to incomplete information &amp; uncertainty.
</p>
<p>
Software is hard enough. Not knowing what the current system is like should not be an acceptable variable in the equation. A hand drawn picture about the current system is a belief. Decisions should never be based on beliefs. Not in engineering.
</p>
<p>
Once we accept that systems are data, it becomes obvious we should approach it like data, too. Data science tells us that you first start from the problem and then reason through a tool that matches the context.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/molding.png" alt="Tools should match the context">
	<figcaption>Tools should match the context</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
 As software is highly contextual we cannot predict specific problems. We can only predict classes of problems. To handle this, the key idea of moldable development is that the tool should be moldable after knowing the problem. In this way it can deal with what's important in context, and because of it, it can take care of the boring part of reading. Of course, for this to be practical, the cost of creating custom tools must be small.
</p>
<p>
I see the flow of constructing custom tools during development, and, ideally, for every single development problem, as the next major leap in software development.
</p>
<p>
In a decade from now, we should not be measuring the "figuring the system out” in terms of reading. We should occupy our energy with solving actual problems. To get there we should start by talking about how not to read code. We cannot afford not to.
</p>
<p>
We created <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a> to provide a concrete start for the "how not to read code" conversation. Glamorous Toolkit is a moldable development environment that makes it possible to create custom tools about software systems inexpensively.
</p>
<p>
So, go to <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">gtoolkit.com</a>. Play with it. Feel #MoldableDevelopment.
</p>
<p>
And do engage with us: <a href="https://discord.gg/FTJr9gP">discord.gg/FTJr9gP</a>.
</p>
<p>
Let’s make that conversation happen.

<p>As an operating system GNU/Linux has become a mess because of the fragmented nature of the project, the bloatware in the kernel, and because of the manipulation by corporate interests. There exist <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/technical-reasons-to-choose-freebsd-over-linux.html">several technical reasons</a> for when a migration from GNU/Linux to BSD make sense, but this article isn't about that, it's an opinionated rant, more than anything else.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the past I have always been a favorite of choosing operating system and tools based upon technical merit. However, in today's world of companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and many others, compromising user privacy, and conducting controversial activities, I don't believe that to be the right cause of action.</p>
<p>Proprietary operating systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10#Privacy_and_data_collection">Microsoft Windows 10</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/iosecure/357e724811fe04167332ef54e736670d">Apple MacOS</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29#Security_and_privacy">Google Android</a> have become famous for their ill conduct, and even companies like Lenovo is using UEFI boot to inject custom Windows components, so that the system can phone home to Lenovo.</p>
<p>As a result of all this I have been a proponent for the open source alternatives, like GNU/Linux and BSD, for a very long time. Not only that, I also believe that the open source alternatives are much better in many technical areas.</p>
<p>I have also always been very much against <a href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/the-typical-discussions-about-bsd-vs-linux.html">The typical discussions about BSD vs Linux</a>, and as I wrote in my article back then, I have always believed that the different open source projects can help each other and cooperate, and that end-users should only debate such issues from a technical stand point rather than personal preference.</p>
<p>Whenever it has been possible, I have proposed people, both private and in the industry, to change the operating systems they use to open source alternatives, and when people have been receptive to my advocacy I have helped them migrate from Microsoft Windows on their workstations to BSD or Linux. And likewise on the server side. This has been a truly successful endeavor and I have honestly never experienced a dissatisfied person or company.</p>
<p>However, things are beginning to change in the GNU/Linux world as more and more corporations want to control the direction of the Linux communities. Due to the structure and organization of GNU/Linux as an operating system, it is unfortunately susceptible to these influences, and while it is still open source, and still not anywhere near the bad things that is going on with the proprietary alternatives, some opt-out features have slowly been introduced into both the kernel and systemd.</p>
<p>You can still choose to opt-out of these features and go your merry way, but as an open source enthusiast and proponent, and as a privacy concerned individual, perhaps the better approach is to migrate systems to something where you don't have to concern yourself with "creepware".</p>
<p>As a system administrator I don't want to worry about whether I am going to be surprised the next time I upgrade a system, and I don't want to keep a list of spyware I have to remember to opt-out of whenever I run one of these systems.</p>
<p>Several Linux distributions have decided (not only because of privacy opt-out issues, but other issues as well) to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Linux_distributions_without_systemd">other init solutions than systemd</a>, but with the situation going on in the kernel development, and with many third party applications becoming more and dependent upon systemd, the problems are spreading to other parts of the operating system and I believe this is becoming an uphill battle.</p>
<p>I don't believe the future of GNU/Linux looks as bright as it used to, and as a possible alternative solution I suggest migrating everything (when possible) to something a bit more sane, like the BSD projects.</p>

<h2 id="fragmented">Linux is fragmented</h2>
<p>In 1983 Richard Stallman announced his intent to start coding the GNU Project in a Usenet message. By June 1987, the project had accumulated and developed free and open source software for an assembler, an almost finished portable optimizing C compiler (GCC), an editor (GNU Emacs), and various Unix utilities, such as ls, grep, awk, make and ld.</p>
<p>In 1991, the Linux kernel appeared, developed outside the GNU project by Linus Torvalds, and in December 1992 it was made available under version 2 of the GNU General Public License. Combined with the operating system utilities already developed by the GNU project, it became the GNU/Linux operating system, better known as just "Linux".</p>
<p>Then came the Linux distributions. Different projects took the Linux kernel, the GNU tools and libraries, additional third party software, documentation, the X Window System, a window manager, and a desktop environment, and combined those components into the distributions. Different distributions focused on different goals, some put focus on the desktop while others put their main focus on servers, and again others tried to provide a multi-purpose operating system.</p>
<p>In the past all these different components and projects where developed by open source enthusiasts and communities and the passion for programming and open source was the driving force.</p>
<p>This is no longer the case! Please see <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/the-real-motivation-behind-systemd.html">The real motivation behind systemd</a>.</p>

<p>Linus Torvalds has many times made it very clear that he doesn't care about what goes on in the "Linux world", all he cares about is the kernel development, and on January 6, 2020 in the "Moderated Discussions" forum at <a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=189711&amp;curpostid=189841">realworldtech.com</a>, Linus Torvalds answered a user's question, with an absolute jaw-dropping comment, about a year-old kernel maintenance controversy that heavily impacted the ZFS on Linux project.</p>
<p>After answering the user's actual question, Torvalds went on to make very wrong and damaging claims about the ZFS filesystem. Torvalds said:</p>
<blockquote>
It (ZFS) was always more of a buzzword than anything else.
</blockquote>
<p>By that statements Linus Torvalds has just reduced more that 15 years of development of one of the most robust and popular filesystems in the world into a "buzzword"!</p>
<p>ZFS is described as "The last word in filesystems". It is a combined filesystem and logical volume manager originally designed by Sun Microsystems. ZFS is a stable, fast, secure, and future-proof filesystem. It is scalable, and includes extensive protection against data corruption, support for high storage capacities, a maximum 16 Exabyte file size, and a maximum 256 Quadrillion Zettabytes storage with no limit on number of filesystems (datasets) or files, efficient data compression, snapshots and copy-on-write clones, continuous integrity checking and automatic repair, RAID-Z, native NFSv4 ACLs, and can be very precisely configured.</p>
<p>The two main implementations, by Oracle and by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenZFS">OpenZFS</a> project, are extremely similar, making ZFS widely available within Unix-like systems.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the Wikipedia article, OpenZFS is an umbrella project aimed at bringing together individuals and companies that use the ZFS file system and work on its improvements, aiming as well at making ZFS more widely used and developed in an open-source manner. OpenZFS brings together developers from the illumos, Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS platforms, and a wide range of companies. High-level goals of the project include raising awareness of the quality, utility and availability of open-source implementations of ZFS, encouraging open communication about ongoing efforts toward improving open-source variants of ZFS, and ensuring consistent reliability, functionality and performance of all distributions of ZFS.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/commits/master">OpenZFS on Linux</a>, which is the Linux part of the project, has currently 345 active contributors with more that 5.600 commits, and commits are being made on an almost daily basis!</p>
<p>Some of the worlds biggest CDN and data storage services runs ZFS on either FreeBSD or Linux!</p>
<p>In another situation Linus Torvalds gave an interview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mysM-V5h9z8">TFiR: open source and Emerging Tech YouTube channel</a> about Linux on the desktop in which he makes another amazing statement saying that Linux still isn't ready for the desktop and that perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS">Chrome OS</a> is the solution to that problem.</p>
<p>These and many other statements by Linus Torvalds shows that Torvalds should avoid authoritative statements about projects he's unfamiliar with, but more importantly they also show that Linux as an operating system has no real direction and no clear management because the kernel development is performed in isolation from the rest of the Linux world.</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds is generally also very open to the rapid influence by corporate interests and his perspective on security is also worrying.</p>
<p>In 2009 Linus Torvalds admitted that the kernel development is getting out of control.</p>
<blockquote>
We're getting bloated and huge. Yes, it's a problem ... Uh, I'd love to say we have a plan ... I mean, sometimes it's a bit sad that we are definitely not the streamlined, small, hyper-efficient kernel that I envisioned 15 years ago ... The kernel is huge and bloated, and our icache footprint is scary. I mean, there is no question about that. And whenever we add a new feature, it only gets worse.
</blockquote>
<p>At LinuxCon 2014, he said that he thinks the bloat situation is better because modern PCs are a lot faster!</p>
<blockquote>
We've been bloating the kernel over the last 20 years, but hardware has grown faster.
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very problematic attitude.</p>
<p>When software gets bloated it not only becomes more insecure and more error prone, but it also becomes much slower. Thinking that the problem goes away because hardware becomes faster is an immature attitude. In this day and age we need to optimize software so that less power is required, we need to save power and limit pollution.</p>
<p>In a 2007 interview "Why I quit": kernel developer Con Kolivas he stated:</p>
<blockquote>
If there is any one big problem with kernel development and Linux it is the complete disconnection of the development process from normal users. You know, the ones who constitute 99.9% of the Linux user base. The Linux kernel …</blockquote></article></div>

			<p>I have never used WhatsApp, and never will. Despite this, I still feel the need to write an article about WhatsApp since it’s the perfect case study to help understand a class of businesses models I call “user domestication”. The domestication of users is high on my list of problems plaguing the human race, and is worth a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>With the meta-explanation out of the way, let us begin.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-rise">WhatsApp’s rise</h2>
<p>For those unfamiliar, WhatsApp is a tool that makes it convenient and easy to help Facebook further its core mission: the optimization and auctioning of human behavior (colloquially known as “targeted advertising”). It originally persuaded people to consent to this by allowing them to send text to each other over the Internet, something that was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_protocols">already possible</a>, and combining an easy-to-learn UI with successful marketing. It then expanded to include features such as free voice and video calls. Free calls helped it grow to become the de-facto communication platform in many other countries.</p>
<p>Having its own proprietary chat system incompatible with other clients allowed WhatsApp to build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a>: WhatsApp’s existing users were held captive by the fact that leaving WhatsApp meant losing the ability to communicate with WhatsApp users. People switching from WhatsApp must convince all their friends to switch, too; this includes less technically inclined friends who had a hard time learning WhatsApp in the first place.</p>
<p>In a WhatsApp world, people who want to keep in touch must abide by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone can only use the proprietary WhatsApp client to send messages; developing alternative clients isn’t supported.</li>
<li>Everyone’s mobile device must run an operating system supported by said client. Since WhatsApp developers will only write a client for popular operating systems, the Android and iOS duopoly strengthens.</li>
<li>Users fully depend on WhatsApp developers. If WhatsApp developers decide to include user-hostile features in the app, users must go with it. They can’t switch to a different server or client without switching away from WhatsApp and losing the ability to communicate with all their WhatsApp contacts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-domestication">User domestication</h2>
<p>WhatsApp rose by trapping previously-free beings in their corral and changing their habits to create dependence on masters. Over time, this made it difficult or impossible to return to their previous lifestyle. That process should sound familiar: it’s eerily similar to the domestication of animals. I call this type of vendor lock-in <strong>user domestication:</strong> the removal of user autonomy to trap users into serving vendors.</p>
<p>I chose this metaphor because animal domestication is a gradual process that isn’t always deliberate, and typically revolves around one group becoming dependent upon another. For example: there’s evidence that domestication of dogs began with socialization, resulting in not-entirely-artificial selection promoting genes that resulted in more friendliness with and dependence upon humans.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Whether it happens on purpose or by accident, user domestication almost always follows the same three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>A high level of dependence given from users to a software vendor</li>
<li>An inability for users to control their software, through at least one of the following methods:
<ol>
<li>Preventing modification of the software</li>
<li>Preventing migration onto a different platform</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The exploitation of now-captive users who are unable to resist</li>
</ol>
<p>The completion of the first two steps left WhatsApp users vulnerable to user domestication. With investors to answer to, they had every incentive to implement user-hostile features without consequence.</p>
<p>So, of course, they did.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-descent">WhatsApp’s descent</h2>
<p>Domestication has a purpose: it enables a master species to exploit the domesticated species for its own gain.</p>
<p>Recently, WhatsApp updated its privacy policy to allow sharing data with its parent, Facebook. Users who agreed to use WhatsApp under its previous privacy policy had two options: agree to the new policy or be unable to use WhatsApp again. The WhatsApp privacy policy update is a classic bait-and-switch: WhatsApp lured users in with a sleek interface and the impression of privacy, domesticated them to remove their autonomy to migrate, and then backtracked on its previous commitment to privacy with minimal consequence. Each step in this process enabled the next; had user domestication not taken place, it would be easy for most users to switch away with minimal friction.</p>
<p>Those of us who were sounding the alarm a few years ago experienced a brief moment of sadistic bliss when our titles were upgraded from “annoying and paranoid conspiracy theorists” to just “annoying”.</p>
<h3 id="an-attempt-at-damage-control">An attempt at damage control</h3>
<p>The bait-and-switch operation incurred backlash significant enough for a noticeable minority of users to actually migrate; this number turned out to be slightly more than the rounding error WhatsApp was likely expecting. In response, WhatsApp delayed the change and published the following ad:</p>

	<img width="600" src="https://seirdy.one/p/whatsapp_ad.png" alt="WhatsApp ad describing data not collected">
</picture>

<p>The ad lists various data that WhatsApp doesn’t collect or share. Allaying data collection concerns by listing data <em>not</em> collected is misleading. WhatsApp doesn’t collect hair samples or retinal scans either; not collecting that information doesn’t mean it respects privacy because it doesn’t change the information WhatsApp <em>does</em> collect.</p>
<p>The ad denies “keep[ing] logs of who everyone is messaging or calling”. Collecting data is not the same as “keeping logs”; it’s possible for metadata to be fed into an algorithm before being discarded. A model can thus learn that two users call each other frequently without keeping logs of the metadata for each call. The fact that they specifically chose to phrase this line around logging implies that WhatsApp either already collects this class of data or has deliberately left the door open to collecting it in the future.</p>
<p>A stroll through WhatsApp’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210124061525/https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en">actual privacy policy</a> at the time reveals that they do collect considerable metadata used for marketing through Facebook.</p>
<h2 id="software-freedom">Software freedom</h2>
<p>With user domestication, providing useful software to users is a means to the end of exploiting them. The alternative is simple: make serving users the end in and of itself.</p>
<p>To prevent being controlled by software, users must be in control. Software that allows users to be in control is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a>. The word “free” in this context refers to freedom rather than price. Software freedom is similar to the concept of open-source, but the latter is focused on practical benefits rather than ethics. A less ambiguous term that neutrally refers to both free and open-source software is <strong><abbr title="free and open-source software">FOSS</abbr></strong>.</p>
<p>Others have <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">explained</a> the concepts underpinning free software better than I can, so I won’t go into detail. It comes down to four essential freedoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-money-with-foss">Making money with FOSS</h3>
<p>The most common objection I hear is that FOSS makes it harder to make money.</p>
<p>The key to making money with FOSS is to make software a <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Complement">commoditized complement</a> of other, more profitable services. Examples of such services include selling support, customization, consulting, training, managed hosting, hardware, and certifications. Plenty of companies use this approach instead of building proprietary software: Red Hat, Collabora, System76, Purism, Canonical, SUSE, Hashicorp, Databricks, and Gradle are some names that come to mind.</p>
<p>Managed hosting isn’t a basket worth all your eggs if giants like AWS can do the same at a lower price. Being the developer can give an edge in areas like customization, support, and training; it doesn’t offer as obvious an advantage when it comes to hosting.</p>
<h2 id="foss-isnt-always-enough">FOSS isn’t always enough</h2>
<p>Free software is a necessary but sometimes insufficient requirement to build domestication immunity. Two more measures include <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong>open platforms.</strong></p>
<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
<p>When software grows too complex, it needs to be maintained by a large team. Users who disagree with a vendor can’t easily fork and maintain a multi-million-line codebase, especially if the software in question potentially contains security vulnerabilities. Dependence on the vendor can grow quite problematic when complexity causes development costs to skyrocket; the vendor might resort to implementing user-hostile features to stay afloat.</p>
<p>Complex software that can’t be developed by a different group of people creates dependence, step one of user domestication. That alone is enough to open the door to problematic developments.</p>
<h4 id="case-study-mozilla-and-the-web">Case study: Mozilla and the Web</h4>
<p>Mozilla was a ray of hope in the browser wars, a space dominated by adtech, surveillance, and vendor lock-in. Unfortunately, developing a browser engine is a monumental task difficult enough for Opera and Microsoft to give up and re-skin Chromium. Browsers are more than the document readers they were meant to be: they’ve evolved into application runtimes with their own stacks for GPU acceleration, Bluetooth, permissions, device enumeration, bundled media codecs, <abbr title="digital rights management">DRM</abbr><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, extension APIs, developer tools…the list goes on. It takes billions of dollars a year to respond to vulnerabilities in such a massive attack surface and keep up with a standard that grows at such a worrying rate. Those billions have to come from somewhere.</p>
<p>Mozilla ended up having to make major compromises to stay afloat. It cut search deals with blatantly user-hostile companies, and bundled the browser with <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2014/02/11/publisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center/">ads</a> and bloatware such as a partially ad-funded proprietary bookmarking SaaS called <a href="https://dustri.org/b/firefox-youre-supposed-to-be-in-my-pocket-not-the-other-way-around.html">Pocket</a>. Since acquiring Pocket (to diversify its sources of income), Mozilla hasn’t yet delivered on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/27/mozilla-pockets-pocket-in-first-acquisition/">earlier statements</a> saying it would open-source its code: while the clients have been open-sourced, the server code remains proprietary. Open-sourcing this and re-writing portions if necessary …</p></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<!-- Article Start -->
			
<p>In May 2020, former president Donald Trump wrote on Twitter and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/01/facebook-staff-angry--zuckerberg.html">Facebook</a>, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” encouraging the use of lethal force against Black Lives Matter protesters. Mark Zuckerberg, in communicating with his staff about why he decided not to take down the post, compared it with a statement the company removed from its platform earlier that year in India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kapil Mishra, a Delhi politician from the governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, had given the Delhi police <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/kapil-mishra-delhi-police-caa-protests-jaffrabad-6282870/">an ultimatum</a> a few months earlier on Twitter and Facebook. If the police didn’t clear the streets of protesters demanding a withdrawal of a discriminatory citizenship law, read the now deleted post, Mishra and his supporters would get out there and do it themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he wasn’t alone. Other members of India’s Parliament, such as junior finance minister Anurag Thakur, were <a href="https://fb.watch/3975ctWeM7/">caught</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDQYanaVApE">tape</a> at an election rally in Delhi, urging their supporters to “pump bullets” into “traitors.” When questioned by the media, Thakur suggested that they merely reflected the mood of the public in Delhi.</p>



<p>In the days after Mishra’s statements, mobs of BJP supporters carrying firearms, iron rods, and petrol bombs began attacking Muslim neighbourhoods, killing <a href="https://thewire.in/communalism/delhi-riots-kapil-mishra-minority-commission-report">53 people</a> and injuring another 250 in the heart of India’s capital. The Delhi government’s <a href="https://ia801906.us.archive.org/11/items/dmc-delhi-riot-fact-report-2020/-Delhi-riots-Fact-Finding-2020.pdf">fact-finding commission</a>, headed by an advocate of the Supreme Court, couldn’t have been clearer about what happened: “An incendiary public speech by BJP leader and former MLA Kapil Mishra on 23 February 2020 clearly incited violence in words and intent,” the report read.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet politicians like Kapil Mishra, <a href="https://twitter.com/ianuragthakur?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Anurag Thakur</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/p_sahibsingh?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Parvesh Verma </a>— all implicated in the government’s report — still have their Facebook and Twitter accounts, where they can spread their anti-Muslim message to their combined hundreds of thousands of followers. One post was removed, but their accounts remain. The social media platforms did nothing to block or limit their ability to make similar violent threats in the future or publicize policies that subscribe to Hindutva, an explicitly Hindu-supremacist ideology, despite India’s secular constitution. If these companies can silence a sitting United States President — the world’s most powerful official — why can’t they curb politicians with far less power, like Kapil Mishra?</p>



<p>There’s an obviously cynical conclusion to make: Donald Trump has lost his political power, while Kapil Mishra is only gaining his. The way that Facebook and Twitter have treated these two politicians highlights the fact that the platforms exist to protect the powerful and their own profits over everything else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Populists don’t gain power in a vacuum. They build it using all the advantages that social media gives those who are not constrained by facts and are willing to make open calls for violence. The problem is not freedom of speech— that is sacrosanct. The problem is that, in the pursuit of profit, social media giants will amplify incendiary voices, giving them the freedom to reach more followers. It’s a systemic risk that governments need to tackle with emerging legislation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social media algorithms are the automated editors that decide what you see in your feeds. They are built on massive volumes of data that platforms extract by surveilling everything their users do online. These algorithms are built to maximize our attention and keep us clicking and scrolling so that people can be shown more ads. This addictive design has not been programmed to discern what is true or what is false, what is harmful or what is not.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>While the most stringent regulations are currently in places like California and the European Union, the worst harm is happening far away from the West.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>My organization, <a href="https://www.reset.tech/">Reset</a>, was built to tackle these flaws at the heart of how social media is built. We advocate for stronger enforcement of rules and standards that can severely curtail the amplification of disinformation and hate. And we want to ensure that voices from the “rest of the world” are not lost in regulatory discussions of systemic risk. While the most stringent regulations are currently in places like California and the European Union, the worst harm is happening far away from the West.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In India, staff at Facebook can’t and don’t want to challenge political power that produces industrial quantities of hate and disinformation on their platform. In 2019, I was very surprised to find Facebook’s team in India asleep at the wheel ahead of a major “citizenship” counting exercise that <a href="https://www.fidh.org/en/region/asia/india/assam-the-biggest-mass-disenfranchisement-of-the-21stcentury">could disenfranchise</a> hundreds of thousands of genuine Indian citizens in the eastern state of Assam.</p>



<p>The government, with the help of the media, painted Muslim Bengalis in Assam as immigrants from Bangladesh. India’s home minister called them “<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha-2019/infiltrators-are-termites-will-throw-them-out-amit-shah/article26805646.ece">termites</a>” and threatened to throw them out of the country. Despite <a href="https://avaazpress.s3.amazonaws.com/FINAL-Facebook%20in%20Assam_Megaphone%20for%20hate%20-%20Compressed%20(1).pdf">strong parallels</a> to how Rohingya Muslims were disenfranchised in Myanmar and Facebook’s disastrous role in fanning the flames of genocidal violence there, the company hadn’t seemed to have learned any lessons. It had no plan in place to tackle the huge spike in hate speech and lies that accompanied the citizenship exercise, because they had barely any content moderators who could read and write in the Assamese language.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/07/facebook-does-not-benefit-from-hate/">Public statements</a> by Facebook claimed that what people say and do on its site is merely a mirror of society. If Donald Trump incites a whole movement of white supremacists, it is because white supremacy exists in American society, or Hindu supremacy exists in Indian society, as demonstrated by members of India’s own democratically elected parliament. There is, of course, some truth to that, and traditional media has also helped fan the flames of hatred.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the “passive mirror” defense lodged by major social media companies is one of their greatest lies. Facebook’s own research in Germany showed that 64% of people who joined an extremist group did so because of Facebook’s recommendation tools (the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/facebook-group-recommendations-election/">later paused the feature</a>).&nbsp;In 2014, a former Facebook product manager <a href="http://andrewledvina.com/blog/2014-07-04-10-ways-facebook-is-the-devil/">wrote</a> that Facebook carries out experiments on users all the time — to make them click the like button, click on more ads, and spend more time on the site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The violent events in Washington on January 6 played out under the full glare of the global press, forcing platforms to enforce their own policies on inciting violence. But in the U.S. as well as around the world, social media is still enabling the rise of more Donald Trumps, like Kapil Mishra or Anurag Thakur in India. It won’t stop unless we hit “reset” on Big Tech.</p>

        <p>Rust functions are surprisingly diverse, sitting at the intersection of multiple
language features which may take time to understand. In this post, we’ll walk through
those features and explain how they appear in function signatures, so you can be
well-equipped to understand functions you see in the wild, or identify the best way
to write the functions you need in your own code.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2>



<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<div id="info-1">
    
    <div>
        <div>
            
<h3 id="describing-not-recommending">Describing, not Recommending</h3>

<p>This is a survey of what function signatures <em>can</em> look like in Rust, not a commentary
on what they <em>should</em> look like. Any one of the patterns shown here may be seen in the wild,
and learning to read other people’s code in any language is a valuable skill.</p>

<h3 id="part-of-a-series">Part of a Series</h3>

<p>This is the first of a pair of posts describing how to read Rust function signatures. Part 2,
tackling generic functions, is currently in the works.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
</div>


<h2 id="signatures">Signatures</h2>

<p>First things first, we need a function signature. Let’s start with something basic.</p>

<figure id="code-1">
    <a href="#skip-code-1">Skip this content.</a>
    
<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>example_1</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span><span>;</span>
<span>//           ↑  ↑    ↑  ↑       ↑</span>
<span>//           |  |    |  |       |</span>
<span>//           | type  | type    type</span>
<span>//         pattern  pattern</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

    <figcaption><span>Code 1</span> <p>A simple function signature example.</p> <a href="#code-1"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>This is a function that takes in two 32-bit integers (the <code>i32</code> type), and
returns a 32-bit integer as well. The arrow (<code>-&gt;</code>) indicates the return type.</p>

<p>Note that the types are all explicit. Rust <em>does</em> support type inference, but not for
function signatures. All parameter and return types must be specified.</p>



<p>We can also see that the pattern comes before the type, separated by a colon. This
<code>&lt;pattern&gt;: &lt;type&gt;</code> syntax matches Rust’s general syntax for
<dfn id="def-type-ascription">type ascription</dfn>, which is the Rust term for
specifying types explicitly.</p>

<h2 id="destructuring">Destructuring</h2>

<p>Notice too that I keep saying “pattern” instead of “variable name.” That’s because Rust
parameters are <dfn id="def-pattern" title="pattern">patterns</dfn>, meaning you can
destructure and bind against the internal structure of the types.</p>

<figure id="code-2">
    <a href="#skip-code-2">Skip this content.</a>
    
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>IpV4Address</span><span>(</span><span>u8</span><span>,</span> <span>u8</span><span>,</span> <span>u8</span><span>,</span> <span>u8</span><span>);</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>print_ipv4addr</span><span>(</span><span>IpV4Address</span><span>(</span><span>o1</span><span>,</span> <span>o2</span><span>,</span> <span>o3</span><span>,</span> <span>o4</span><span>):</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>IpV4Address</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}.{}.{}.{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>o1</span><span>,</span> <span>o2</span><span>,</span> <span>o3</span><span>,</span> <span>o4</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>addr</span> <span>=</span> <span>IpV4Address</span><span>(</span><span>127</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>print_ipv4addr</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>addr</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

    <figcaption><span>Code 2</span> <p>An example of a function with destructuring in its parameter list.</p> <a href="#code-2"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>In this example, the <code>IpV4Address</code> type is destructured in the function signature, binding four
variables (<code>o1</code>, <code>o2</code>, <code>o3</code>, and <code>o4</code>) to the respective items in the tuple struct. These
variables are then used in the function body to print the address.</p>

<h3 id="refutability">Refutability</h3>

<p>One restriction of pattern matching in function signatures is that you can only use
<dfn id="dfn-irrefutable">irrefutable</dfn> patterns, meaning <em>patterns that always match</em>.
By contrast, <dfn id="dfn-refutable">refutable</dfn> patterns may sometimes fail to match,
perhaps because they specify only a single variant of an <code>enum</code> with multiple variants.
Refutable patterns can be used in a <code>match</code> expression or equivalent construct, where the
collection of patterns is checked for exhaustiveness (meaning all values are guaranteed to
match at least one pattern), but patterns in function signatures are all alone, so they must
be irrefutable.</p>



<p>Here’s a table to help explain:</p>

<figure id="table-1">
    <a href="#skip-table-1">Skip this content.</a>
    <figcaption><span>Table 1</span> <p>A survey of pattern refutability.</p> <a href="#table-1"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Pattern</th>
      <th>Refutability</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>a</code></td>
      <td>Irrefutable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>_</code></td>
      <td>Irrefutable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>MyStruct { f1: x, f2: y }</code></td>
      <td>Irrefutable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Some(b)</code></td>
      <td>Refutable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Err(MyError::Foo)</code></td>
      <td>Refutable</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


    
</figure>

<p>The first three patterns could be found in a function signature. The last two could not.</p>

<h3 id="renaming">Renaming</h3>

<p>Another feature of declaring and assigning to new variables in a function
signature pattern is that you can create a variable with a name different from the
name of the field in the relevant type.</p>

<figure id="code-3">
    <a href="#skip-code-3">Skip this content.</a>
    
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Something</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>field_1</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>field_2</span><span>:</span> <span>f64</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// The `field_1: x` and `field_2: y` parts are assigning</span>
<span>// the values of `field_1` to `x` and `field_2` to `y`.</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>Something</span> <span>{</span> <span>field_1</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>field_2</span><span>:</span> <span>y</span> <span>}:</span> <span>Something</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"x: {}, y: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Something</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>field_1</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span>
        <span>field_2</span><span>:</span> <span>1.0</span><span>,</span>
    <span>};</span>
    
    <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

    <figcaption><span>Code 3</span> <p>An example of renaming.</p> <a href="#code-3"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>This can be useful when you want to locally use a different name than the name of
the field, and do so in a single line rather than binding to a local variable
with a new name in the body of the function.</p>

<h2 id="bindings">Bindings</h2>

<p>As we use patterns to bind, we can also set the kind of binding, which may be the
default (with no specifier) <code>mut</code>, <code>ref</code>, or <code>ref mut</code>. Collectively, the binding
options are as follows:</p>

<figure id="table-2">
    <a href="#skip-table-2">Skip this content.</a>
    <figcaption><span>Table 2</span> <p>Binding syntax and the resulting types</p> <a href="#table-2"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Binding Specifier</th>
      <th>Mutability</th>
      <th>Ownership</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>No specifier</td>
      <td>Immutable</td>
      <td>Owned</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>mut</code></td>
      <td>Mutable</td>
      <td>Owned</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ref</code></td>
      <td>Immutable</td>
      <td>Borrowed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ref mut</code></td>
      <td>Mutable</td>
      <td>Borrowed</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


    
</figure>

<p>The <dfn id="dfn-binding">binding</dfn> pattern specifies how a binding should occur; should it be
by-value (meaning in Rust that it either takes ownership of the bound value, or makes a copy of it,
depending on whether the type of that value implements the <code>Copy</code> trait), by-reference, or
by-mutable-reference?</p>

<h3 id="owning-binding">Owning Binding</h3>

<p>An owning binding may display one of two behaviors, depending on the type involved in the binding.
If the type implements the <code>Copy</code> trait, then it will be copied to the new owner at the binding site.
If the type <em>does not</em> implement <code>Copy</code>, then it will be moved from the prior owner to the new owner
at the binding site.</p>



<p>To understand this, let’s talk about <code>Copy</code>. <code>Copy</code> is a trait indicating a type is “trivially copyable,”
meaning it can be copied with only a call to <code>memcpy</code>, so all the data contained in the structure
is contiguous; there are no pointers to chase. <code>Copy</code> tells us that copying a piece of data is fast.</p>

<p>At the same time, it improves ergonomics for certain types which may otherwise be tedious to use under
Rust’s ownership semantics. Imagine if number types (which all implement <code>Copy</code>) were moved any time
they were assigned. Something as simple as <code>x = y</code> would invalidate <code>y</code>, and thus make mathematical code
much more frustrating to write.</p>

<p>So, <code>Copy</code> pulls double-duty. It tells us something is cheap to copy, and it permits that copying to be
done implicitly.</p>

<p>In contexts where a type doesn’t implement <code>Copy</code> but <em>does</em> implement the <code>Clone</code> trait, you can instead
call <code>.clone()</code> on it explicitly to create a duplicate which will be moved into the new owner, without
invalidating the prior owner.</p>

<p>Now, what does this look like in the context of a binding?</p>

<figure id="code-3">
    <a href="#skip-code-3">Skip this content.</a>
    
<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Clone,</span> <span>Debug)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Thing</span><span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>Thing</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// This moves `t` into the `takes_ownership` function.</span>
    <span>// `t` no longer owns any data, and thus is invalid</span>
    <span>// to use again.</span>
    <span>takes_ownership</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// If uncommented, this line would not compile.</span>
    <span>//</span>
    <span>// println!("{:#?}", t);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>takes_ownership</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>Thing</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// `x` is the owner of whatever `Thing` is passed</span>
    <span>// into the `takes_ownership` function, and when</span>
    <span>// `x` goes out of scope at the end of the function,</span>
    <span>// any necessary cleanup of the data will be</span>
    <span>// performed (only relevant if the type in question</span>
    <span>// implements `Drop`).</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

    <figcaption><span>Code 3</span> <p>An example of a broken use of owning binding in a function signature.</p> <a href="#code-3"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
</figure>



<p>Sometimes this kind of binding is exactly what you want. For example, you may have a need for a
“consuming builder,” one of two forms the Builder Pattern can take in Rust. In a consuming builder,
the builder type passes ownership of some data to the type that it’s building, because that type
will need ownership of the data to operate.</p>

<p>If you take ownership of a piece of data with an owning binding and want to return ownership to the
calling context, you can return it from the function. For example, the popular <code>once_cell</code> crate features
a type which can only be written to once. If you try to write to it again, it returns ownership of the
value you attempted to set.</p>



<figure id="code-4">

<h3 id="mutable-owning-binding">Mutable Owning Binding</h3>

<p>Sometimes, in addition to taking ownership of a piece of data, you’d like for that data to be mutable
from the start as well. In that case, you can use a mutable owning binding.</p>

<p>The use of a mutable owning binding can always be replaced with an immutable owning binding followed by
a mutable rebinding to a variable of the same name in the body of the function (shadowing the parameter
from that line onward). The choice is one of taste.</p>

<h3 id="reference-binding">Reference Binding</h3>

<p>Reference bindings inside function signatures in Rust can seem a little unusual, but they are permitted.
The idea is that the binding performed is a reference to the type of the value. If the value was passed
in by value, then it’s either moved or copied as discussed in the owning binding section, and in the body
of the function the value is of a reference to the post-move data (if the type is <code>Copy</code>, the difference
doesn’t amount to much). This is different from an owning binding of a reference type both for the caller
of the function, and inside the function itself (<code>x: &amp;Number</code> is <em>not</em> the same as <code>ref x: Number</code>).</p>

Well, from <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore">their website</a>:</p><blockquote>Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development...</blockquote><p>Let's break that down! First, Firestore is a <em>database</em> - that means it's a good place to store data, and retrieve it later. If you're into ML/data science, and have been building dashboards with Streamlit, the data you work with probably looks like Pandas tables, Numpy arrays, CSV files. These tend to be fairly <em>static</em>. You'll rarely need to create new entries or update them, let alone make your data accessible from apps all over the world. But many web apps need to be <em>dynamic,</em> allowing lots of edits to the data and creation of new data — and databases excel at this! Every consumer web app you can think of (Gmail, Youtube, Slack, Airbnb) have databases that manage the things that their users create (emails, videos, chat messages, and listings).</p><p>Unlike other databases, Firestore is <em>flexible</em>. In technical terms, we call it a "NoSQL" database, which means that you don't have to design a fixed schema for how your data will be structured before you begin. This is great for quick prototyping! Oftentimes, when I'm making a web app, I don't exactly know what it will look like or do, much less how I should store my data.</p><figure><img src="https://geekandpoke.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341d3df553ef0148c80ac6ef970c-pi" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://geekandpoke.typepad.com/geekandpoke/2011/01/nosql.html</figcaption></figure><p>As an analogy, let's say I wanted to bake a bunch of desserts. A SQL database is a bit like having to write out a pie recipe beforehand, and then always following it line-by-line. I can efficiently bake lots of pies, which will be tasty if my original recipe was good. But the NoSQL approach is more like: let me start with something vaguely pie-like, but maybe it'll become a tart, or drift towards more of a cupcake... I can experiment until I land on something that really hits the spot.</p><p>Finally, Firestore is hosted on the <em>cloud</em>. This means that it's a service, very much like <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> or our very own <a href="http://streamlit.io/sharing">Streamlit Sharing</a>, where you don't have to worry about maintaining your own servers. You don't need to worry about scaling, uptime, or a bunch of other issues that can get in the way of building out your idea.</p><h3 id="what-are-some-downsides-of-firestore">What are some downsides of Firestore?</h3><p>First, as a hosted service, Firestore can cost you money. They do have a generous free tier to start out with — no credit card needed! And if your app exceeds the free limits, they'll inform you and stop new writes. Even if you hit the paid tier, Firestore is pretty cheap; I run a <a href="https://oneword.games/">side project</a> with hundreds of daily users and thousands of daily writes, and Firestore only costs me ~$1/month.</p><p>Second, other databases may perform better on complicated queries, or when you get to e.g. millions of daily users. For pure speed of setup, Firestore is great, but if you already know that scaling will be an issue, you may want to consider other options like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html">SQLite</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>, or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/spanner">Cloud Spanner</a>.</p><p>And finally, most Firestore users use JavaScript, so there are fewer Python code snippets and Stack Overflow answers to find. For this tutorial, we'll use <a href="https://googleapis.dev/python/firestore/latest/index.html">Firestore's Python library</a>, which is very pleasant to work with. Here's a snippet from their Python API for inspiration:</p><pre><code>from google.cloud import firestore

# Add a new user to the database
db = firestore.Client()
doc_ref = db.collection('users').document('alovelace')
doc_ref.set({
    'first': 'Ada',
    'last': 'Lovelace',
    'born': 1815
})

# Then query to list all users
users_ref = db.collection('users')

for doc in users_ref.stream():
    print('{} =&gt; {}'.format(doc.id, doc.to_dict()))
</code></pre><p>Pretty easy to read, right?</p><h2 id="part-1-a-simple-streamlit-sharing-app">Part 1: A simple Streamlit Sharing app</h2><p>Okay! If you're sold on the awesomeness of Firestore, I'm now going to show you how to bake in that awesomeness into a Streamlit app. Let's cook up a simple version of the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/">Reddit home page</a>, from scratch! (Okay, that was the last cooking analogy, I promise.)</p><p>Once again, <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> is the fastest way to build web apps in Python. <a href="https://blog.streamlit.io/introducing-streamlit-sharing/">Streamlit Sharing</a> is the fastest way to put your app online, so you can share it with the world. Here's what Sharing can do for you, in 1 minute:</p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/czWaLgF9sA0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Here in Part 1, I'm going to walk you step-by-step through the process of building a Streamlit Sharing app, even if you've never done it before. Ready? Let's do this!</p><p><em>If you're already a Streamlit master, feel free to skip down to Part 2; just remember to <code>pip install google-cloud-firestore</code> , or the equivalent in your Python library manager of choice.</em></p><h3 id="setting-up-your-git-repo">Setting up your Git repo</h3><p>We'll start by <a href="https://github.com/new">creating a new repo on GitHub</a> — the folder where all your code will go. Name it whatever you like! (I'm calling mine <code>streamlit-reddit</code>). Make sure it's public, though, so we can host it on Streamlit Sharing later.</p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vpwzgFv.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/vpwzgFv.png"><figcaption>New GitHub repo</figcaption></figure><p>Next, you'll want to download (aka "clone") this repo on your own computer. (<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">You'll need to have Git installed</a>.) Open up a local shell, and run the following commands, replacing <code>{username}</code> with your own GitHub username:</p><pre><code># Creates a copy of this repo on your computer
$ git clone https://github.com/{username}/streamlit-reddit.git

# Enters the repo, which is currently empty
$ cd streamlit-reddit
</code></pre><h3 id="running-streamlit-on-your-own-computer">Running Streamlit on your own computer</h3><p>With our Git repo set up, let's add in the two main files every Streamlit Sharing app needs:</p><p><code>requirements.txt</code> — A list of the Python libraries we use, so Streamlit Sharing will know to install them.</p><p>For this tutorial, we'll only be using two libraries: Streamlit itself, and the <a href="https://googleapis.dev/python/firestore/latest/index.html">Python client for Firestore</a>. So this is all you need inside your <code>requirements.txt</code> file:</p><pre><code>streamlit
google-cloud-firestore
</code></pre><p><code>streamlit_app.py</code> — Where our app code will go! Let's start with just a few lines:</p><pre><code>import streamlit as st

st.header('Hello 🌎!')
if st.button('Balloons?'):
    st.balloons()
</code></pre><p>This app imports the Streamlit library, and then shows some text and a button. When you click on the button, a bunch of balloons will float up from the bottom of the screen!</p><p>Now, we're going to use <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/">Pip</a> to install the Streamlit and the Firestore libraries onto your own computer. (If you prefer <a href="https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html">pipenv</a> or <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a> or <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/">conda</a>, any of those are fine too!)</p><pre><code># Install all the libraries mentioned in requirements.txt
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
...
</code></pre><p>We're ready to run our starter Streamlit app!</p><pre><code># Run this Streamlit app on your own computer
$ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  Network URL: http://192.168.1.3:8501
</code></pre><p>If you see the Streamlit app launched on your own browser, that means everything worked. (You may have to enter in the URL, like <a href="http://localhost:8501/">http://localhost:8501</a>). Try clicking on that button!</p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/c6YSDvk.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/c6YSDvk.png"><figcaption>Streamlit app running locally</figcaption></figure><h3 id="deploying-your-app-on-streamlit-sharing">Deploying your app on Streamlit Sharing</h3><p>Okay, we're ready to put our app on Streamlit Sharing! First, we need to save our changes to Git (aka "commit"), and then upload (aka "push") our changes onto GitHub. Again, from a shell that's inside your repo:</p><pre><code># Add and all changes in your files
$ git commit -am "Create requirements.txt and a simple Streamlit app"

# Push all commits back to GitHub
$ git push
</code></pre><p>Now if you go to the GitHub page for your repo, you should see the code that you just wrote:</p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HhxVgnQ.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/HhxVgnQ.png"><figcaption>Successfully pushed code</figcaption></figure><p>Once your code is on GitHub, you're ready to deploy your app for the world to see! Head over to <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/">https://share.streamlit.io/</a> and create a new app. (If you don't have access to Sharing yet, post below in the comments and we'll sort you out.) <a href="https://blog.streamlit.io/deploying-streamlit-apps-using-streamlit-sharing/">Here's a great tutorial</a> on deploying through sharing if you'd like to read more.</p><p>Fill in the name of your repo — the others should populate automagically — then click "Deploy!" 🎈</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/01/GIF_1.2.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Steps to deploying an app on sharing</figcaption></figure><p>That URL you are on (e.g. <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/akrolsmir/streamlit-reddit">https://share.streamlit.io/akrolsmir/streamlit-reddit</a>), is one that anyone on Earth can go to and play with. Isn't that cool? You've gone from "literally nothing" to "functioning, globally-hosted Streamlit app" in the space of 15 minutes! But hold on to your horses, we're about to get to the <em>really</em> cool stuff: saving data online, with Firestore.</p><h2 id="part-2-setting-up-firestore">Part 2: Setting up Firestore</h2><p>Once again, Firestore is the database we're using to create, edit, and read our data. For our Reddit home page, we're going to use it to store things like the links, titles, and later upvotes. Here in Part 2, I'll walk you through how to set that up.</p><h3 id="set-up-a-firebase-account">Set up a Firebase account</h3><p>To clear up some potential confusion: <em>Firestore</em> is the database we're using, one of many services provided by <em>Firebase</em> (which is a part of Google). You'll want to sign in to your Google account at <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">https://console.firebase.google.com/</a>. Then, create a Firebase project:</p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/h3PS1m6.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/h3PS1m6.png"><figcaption>The Firebase sign-up screen</figcaption></figure><p>These are the steps to create an account:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/01/GIF_2.2.gif" alt=""></figure><ul><li>Name your project</li><li>Enable analytics [You <em>can</em> skip this since we're not using it today, but I think Analytics are really cool 🙂]</li><li>Accept terms and click create!</li></ul><p>Once created, you'll see Firebase loading and will be notified when the project is ready [this is pretty quick].</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/01/GIF_3.2.gif" alt=""></figure><p>Awesome, our Firebase project is set up! Firebase has a lot of different tools for building web apps, but the only one we're using today is Firestore.

This is based on the incorrect assumption that an L3 system would drive with the 65mph on the freeway, then beep to request driver takeover, then<!-- -->—in the event the driver does not take over— give up and let the vehicle steer off the road. Obviously, in practice, any reasonable manufacturer would not build such a system—which would likely be subject to product <span>liability</span>—but rather build in a risk mitigation strategy if the driver does not take over, e.g. not allow activation at higher velocities or turn on the emergency signal and stop the vehicle in the lane in case the driver does not respond to a takeover request.

      <article role="main">
        <p>It all started with a meme tweet:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.acepace.net/images/xlatb/meme.jpg" alt="twitter meme describing waves to extract values from an array in x64"></p>

<p>Laugh, scroll past, then I started wondering, “what are the chances this obscure opcode is faster than optimized loads?” and I realized I had just been <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd sniped</a>. So I decided to dig up my half-remembered memories of how to benchmark opcodes and get to the bottom of this meme.</p>

<p>For those of us who do not recall every opcode that Intel dreamed up, the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-instruction-set-reference-manual-325383.pdf">Intel reference manual</a> is a useful reference and says the following:</p>

<p>XLAT/XLATB - <em>Locates a byte entry in a table in memory, using the contents of the AL register as a table index, then copies the contents of the table entry back into the AL register. The index in the AL register is treated as an unsigned integer. The XLAT and XLATB instructions get the base address of the table in memory from either the DS:EBX or the DS:BX registers</em></p>

<p>In other words, the instruction performs</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>MOV</span> <span>AL</span><span>,[</span><span>EBX</span><span>+</span><span>AL</span><span>]</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>EBX is the array base and AL is the offset.</p>

<p>Which is exactly the core line of the last snippet in the meme.</p>

<p>My guess was <strong>the equivalent load opcode version would outperform xlatb</strong>. How I tested this simple question is worth writing up, if only to have a reference for micro benchmarking from end to end.</p>

<h3 id="technical-background">Technical background</h3>

<p><em>Feel free to skip this if you’re familiar with benchmarking, CISC vs RISC and why I guessed what I guessed</em></p>

<h4 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking</h4>

<p>What I did to test my guess is called micro benchmarking. The difference from regular benchmarking is in the focus and minimization of context. It helps in answering very small questions such as “What is the fastest way to sort an array of numbers in C”, and ignoring memory pressure, design and other considerations that are important in the real world of benchmarking.</p>

<p>The challenge in micro benchmarking is that there is a lot of noise in the process. Compilers, operating systems, CPU temperature and frequency changes can all serve to create large shifts in the performance of the benched code snippet.</p>

<p>Therefore, the goal is to define the problem as accurately as possible. For example</p>

<ul>
  <li>Minimize hardware considerations. This means removing frequency scaling, branching, any chance of the data being evicted from the cache.</li>
  <li>No interaction with the system. This means no system calls, but also no memory allocations and hopefully remove the role the runtime plays (for example if we’re benchmarking .NET code)</li>
</ul>

<p>These typically lead micro benchmarks to being written in assembly code and measuring runtime using the <a href="https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/X86-assembly/Instructions/rdtsc">rdtsc</a> opcode.</p>

<p>To understand this at a basic level, I really recommend the book <a href="https://nostarch.com/insidemachine.htm">Inside the Machine</a> (Jon Stokes), another option is <a href="http://www.lighterra.com/papers/modernmicroprocessors/">Modern Microprocessors in 90 minutes</a> but for more than that, the relatively up to date reference is <a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/cpu/">Real World Technologies</a> articles on CPU architecture.</p>

<p>The reference for nearly everything relating to opcode latency for Intel and AMD CPUs is <a href="https://www.agner.org/optimize/">Agners guides</a> and <a href="https://uops.info/table.html">uops.info</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to measure these latencies and what exactly a CPU is doing when executing an opcode, you need to read the Performance Measurement Counters embedded in the hardware. This gives us precisely numbers for (example) how many L1 cache hits and misses happened in a code block, how many branch mispredictions happened and so forth.</p>

<h4 id="xlat-and-cisc">XLAT and CISC</h4>

<p>Now, what the heck is XLAT and why does it exist?</p>

<p>The basic idea behind the XLAT instruction is the idea behind Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISC), that states hardware should implement common instruction sequences with dedicated instructions that perform the same task but faster. This is the idea behind many of the weird x86 instructions (or other CPUs).</p>

<p>However, since that time, all modern CPUs have turned RISC-like, by internally using a reduced instruction set and translating the ISA opcodes into internal commands, some implemented using CPU microcode. This also allows for different optimizations such as micro opcode fusion. Another note, CPU designers spend a lot of time optimizing the commonly use instructions, which makes them very fast (for example xor rax,rax is free) This leaves very little room for opcodes like xlatb to shine.</p>

<p>While we’re dunking on CISC, I came across the following great snippet on the difference between the good parts of CISC and the bad parts.</p>

<p><em>We should distinguish the “Complex” instructions of CISC CPUs - complicated, rarely used, and universally low performance, from the “Featureful” instructions common to both CISC and RISC CPUs, which combine a small sequence of operations, are commonly used, and high performance. - <a href="https://gist.github.com/erincandescent/8a10eeeea1918ee4f9d9982f7618ef68">erincandescent</a></em></p>

<h3 id="the-experiments">The experiments</h3>

<p>What I ended up doing was running the different code snippets in the Andreas Abel’s micro benchmarking harness, available on <a href="https://github.com/andreas-abel/nanoBench">GitHub</a>. The machine used for execution was a VM running on a Broadwell i7-5500U, Debian 9.9, kernel version 4.9 with the host CPU frequency governor set to disabled (max clock speed all the time).</p>

<p>The executed code snippets were as described in the table below.</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>Snippet 0
   </td>
   <td>Snippet 1
   </td>
   <td>Snippet 2

</tbody></table>

<p>In order to remove as much variance as possible, it’s best to make sure all accesses are kept inside the L1 cache (code and data). For this reason, the following initializations are required</p>

<ul>
  <li>Aim RBX at RSP, making sure the array accessed is inside the L1 data cache</li>
  <li>Set RAX to 0</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, this opcode sequence is small enough to be in the same L1 code cache line so no effort was required there (manually verified).</p>

<p>For this experiment, what matters is the number of cycles required to execute (which is a close approximation of time) and the cycles elapsed (wall time). In addition, I’ll also measure how many loads happened while executing this snippet, by tracking the <a href="https://download.01.org/perfmon/index/haswell.html">MEM_LOAD_UOPS_RETIRED.L1_HIT PMC</a>.</p>

<p>The command line I used when executing the benchmarks was</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">./nanoBench.sh <span>-avg</span> <span>-n_measurements</span> 500 <span>-asm_init</span> <span>"mov rbx, rsp;xor rax,rax;"</span> <span>-asm</span> SNIPPET_HERE <span>-config</span> configs/cfg_Broadwell_common.txt</code></pre></figure>

<p>The results, summarized in a table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Snippet 0</th>
      <th>Snippet 1</th>
      <th>Snippet 2</th>
      <th>Snippet 3</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>RDTSC: 6.35</td>
      <td>RDTSC: 6.00</td>
      <td>RDTSC:  4.81</td>
      <td>RDTSC: 5.6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Core cycles: 8.01</td>
      <td>Core cycles: 7.02</td>
      <td>Core cycles: 6.36</td>
      <td>Core cycles: 7.01</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Loads: 2</td>
      <td>Loads: 2</td>
      <td>Loads: 2</td>
      <td>Loads: 2</td>
    </tr>

</table>

<p>There are a few things that stand out.</p>

<p>Foremost, xlatb is slower than the equivalent optimized x64 code.</p>

<p>Second, as is generally known, memory loads are the most expensive part of any algorithm, but once the data is in L1, the difference in number of loads doesn’t seem to matter. The xlatb sequence has only one data load yet is slower than the optimized x64 version.</p>

<p>Second, the core cycle count for the xlatb instruction precisely matches the <a href="https://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf">Agner table</a> (page 229). Good to know our measurements line up with others :)</p>

<p>Last, note that reducing the amount of instructions used does not decrease time required linearly. Why? The number of instructions is not linearly correlated to the actions performed by the processor. A classic example is xor rcx,rcx. This opcode never actually executes. Instead, the CPU just updates a pointer in the register renaming file.</p>

<p>To examine these type of questions, another tool is required - the Intel Architecture Code Analyzer (<a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-architecture-code-analyzer">IACA</a> - unfortunately now deprecated). This tool will look at the machine code and tell you how different Intel CPUs will execute them. Let’s look at one case in particular to see why removing instructions doesn’t always linearly save time. Attached are only the relevant parts of the output, which are the micro-op count.</p>

<p>* - instruction micro-ops not bound to a port</p>

<p>^ - Micro Fusion occurred</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Number of Uops</th>
      <th>opcodes</th>
      <th>Number of Uops</th>
      <th>opcodes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>3^#</td>
      <td>push rcx</td>
      <td>3^#</td>
      <td>push rcx</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1*</td>
      <td>xor rcx,rcx</td>
      <td>1*</td>
      <td>movzx rcx,al</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>mov cl,al</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>add rcx, rbx</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>add rcx,rbx</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>mov al, byte ptr [rcx]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>mov al, byte ptr [rcx]</td>
      <td>2^#</td>
      <td>pop [rcx]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2^#</td>
      <td>pop rcx</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The important bit is noting that in snippet 0, the opcodes xor rcx,rcx; mov cl,al takes up one execution unit (xor rcx rcx is not bound to an execution port).</p>

<p>In snippet 1, the opcode movzx rcx,al doesn’t take up an execution port at all.</p>

<p>You can also play around with llvm-mca which does something similar, and see the same results, by using Compiler Explorer (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/6SjY_d">snippet link</a>).</p>

<h4 id="side-note-on-actually-running-the-experiments">Side note on actually running the experiments</h4>

<p>All my machines are Windows machines, where accessing the PMCs is not as fun or easy as it is on Linux. The proper reaction should be “so run it inside a VM”, but apparently Hyper-V doesn’t expose PMCs to guests by default and I couldn’t find a way to do it easily.</p>

<p>I ran into every possible frustration while searching for a cheap bare metal cloud machine, including Oracle gating the bare metal instances behind a request form that requires a human being to look at.</p>

<p>In the end, VMWare Workstation exposes PMCs to guests so a friend with power to spare gave me a VM to test.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>The meme is wrong, no surprise. An optimized sequence of x64 instructions beats out a single complex instruction. This isn’t always true (POPCNT as a counter example) but some instructions are legacy for a reason. If LLVM doesn’t output the opcode, it’s probably for the best.</p>

<p>Also this was an opportunity to rediscover micro benchmarking. It’s quite likely I made some measurement mistakes, so if you found any, feel free to contact me.</p>

<h2 id="also-thanks-are-in-order-for-help-in-this-bit-of-fun">Also, thanks are in order for help in this bit of fun</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wobel_">@wobel_</a> for providing the VM and therapy while I swore at cloud providers.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/damageboy">@damageboy</a> for generally knowing everything and in this case, for writing a series of blog posts on micro benchmarking .NET instructions available <a href="https://bits.houmus.org/2018-08-18/netcoreapp3.0-instrinsics-in-real-life-pt1">here</a> that pushed me to do this sort of stuff</p>

<p>And again to Andreas Abel for saving me a lot of time with his micro benchmarking harness available on <a href="https://github.com/andreas-abel/nanoBench">GitHub</a></p>
