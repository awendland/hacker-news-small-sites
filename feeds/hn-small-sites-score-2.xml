<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>P</span>eople afflicted by Covid-19, particularly those with bad cases, experience difficulty breathing.&nbsp; We need oxygen in our tissues to keep our bodies working and our brains clear; viral damage to our lungs deprives bodies of this vital dissolved gas.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>	This oxygen-starved condition is called hypoxia, and itâ€™s also a serious condition in many parts of the worldâ€™s ocean, as well as in estuaries, lagoons, rivers, and lakes. Marine hypoxia receives much less public attention than ocean acidification or warming—but in many parts of the world its effects may be just as profound, and the problem is worsening.</p>
<p>	The causes of marine hypoxia are twofold. The first, which has been studied the most, is the too-much-of-a-good-thing problem of nutrient over-enrichment. Vast loads of nutrients are applied to farm fields as fertilizers, spill from our sewage and septic systems, and waft from the tailpipes of automobiles. Inevitably some of these make their way into water, stimulating blooms of tiny plankton that eventually die and decay.&nbsp;The process of decaying consumes the oxygen, and hypoxia ensues. Wastewater treatment plants have helped but are not enough. Some nutrient-loaded hypoxic waters are now-infamous â€œdead zones,â€� such as the northern Gulf of Mexico, the Chesapeake Bay, and Lake Erie most summers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>	The other major cause is global warming.&nbsp;Warmer water canâ€™t hold as much dissolved oxygen as colder water. Itâ€™s lighter, too, and therefore tends to float above cooler layers, cutting them off from atmospheric exchange so that they eventually become deoxygenated as well. This phenomenon isnâ€™t directly associated with nutrient over-enrichment, but can exacerbate and intensify dead zones and impact deep ocean waters that have few nutrients. Warming is a global problem affecting the oxygen status of all waters—and it also fuels blooms of algae that die and decay, again setting off the cycle of oxygen loss.</p>
<p>	The general public—and even many scientists—are unaware of the rapidly expanding scale of deoxygenation. Among the first researchers to describe it were marine ecologists Bob Diaz and Rutger Rosenberg, who in the 1980s began to study the impacts on bottom-dwelling organisms in estuaries and coastal seas. In 1995 they wrote, "There is no other environmental variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically in such a short period as dissolved oxygen." &nbsp;</p>
<p>	In 2008, Diaz and Rosenberg published a landmark study in the journal <em>Science</em>, documenting over 400 such zones and showing that their growth was exponential.&nbsp;By 2019 their tally exceeded 700, and possibly as many as 1000, coastal dead zones.&nbsp;If we make a chart of the known history of increase and color-code it by Gross World Product, an index of global economic output, we can appreciate the linkage of these dead zones to human activity:</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_423219c2026b77bfba722aa122b966a6.jpg" alt="dead zones and GWP chart"><figcaption><span>Growth in the number of coastal marine ecosystems classified as â€œdead zonesâ€� by Diaz and Rosenberg (2008) and Diaz et al. (2019).  The colors indicate levels of Gross World Product (GWP), and show that as economic output has increased exponentially, so has the number of polluted, deoxygenated dead zones. </span><br><span>GWP data: World Bank and CIA Factbook (compiled in Wikipedia).</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Deoxygenation in open oceans, away from coasts, extends farther and deeper, and is largely caused by the aforementioned tendency of warm water to seal off the cool waters below. The extent and spread of these so-called oxygen minimum zones wasnâ€™t fully appreciated until around 15 years ago, when improved instrumentation allowed scientists to measure them.&nbsp;Ten years ago their total area was estimated at 8 percent of Earth's ocean surface area—11.7 million square miles altogether, an area larger than North America and comparable in size to the entire African continent. That area is expanding today.<br></p>
<p>Brief periods of hypoxia—or even no oxygen, a phenomenon called anoxia—are common in nature and many organisms adapt by moving away or going temporarily dormant.&nbsp;A very few species are exceptionally tolerant and even have specialized metabolic pathways to cope in these circumstances.&nbsp;As the scale of deoxygenation increases, however, we see low-oxygen events so large and long that even highly mobile organisms, like fish, canâ€™t always escape.&nbsp;Some may be able to survive but become so weak that they have difficulty moving and finding food, let alone digesting it.&nbsp;Think of the Covid-19 sufferers who are so exhausted from lack of oxygen that they can barely move.&nbsp;Itâ€™s the same basic issue.&nbsp;As scientists study the problem of marine deoxygenation, we are increasingly seeing the effects on everything from fish growth to reproductive impairment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Although most of the studies on biotic effects of deoxygenation have taken place in laboratories, my colleague Ben Walther and I, together with our students and colleagues, have learned to decipher signs of hypoxia exposure that are â€œrecordedâ€� in tiny bones within fish heads, called otoliths or ear-stones.&nbsp;These calcium carbonate deposits grow incrementally and take up various trace elements including the element manganese, which becomes available only at very low oxygen concentrations.&nbsp;By studying the lifetime uptake of manganese, biologist Michele Casini and I showed that periods of intense hypoxia have profound impacts on the growth and health of Atlantic cod in the Baltic Sea. With less oxygen available, cod have less energy for foraging and fighting off parasites and infections. As a result, they are unhealthy and shrunken compared to cod living in better environments. By age three, cod with high levels of hypoxia exposure are one-third smaller than healthy cod from oxygen-rich waters. Multiply that by population size and you have an epic loss of biomass. This has direct economic consequences and likely causes enormous suffering for the fish themselves.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_15b7f377d5e469878f05995df3610167.jpg" alt="Cod before-and-after"><figcaption><span>Left: Cod caught in 1981 off the island of Gotland, Sweden. Right: Cod caught in 2020 in the same vicinity. Baltic cod today are affected by several stressors, foremost among them hypoxia. </span><br><span>K. Limburg and Y. Heimbrand</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Deoxygenation impacts ripple through entire ecosystems, too.&nbsp;Recent work has shown that in large stretches of the ocean even zooplankton, the microscopic animals who feed fish, often live on the edge of metabolic collapse. A study in the eastern tropical North Pacific oxygen minimum zone found that zooplankton there migrate in and out of microhabitats with extremely low oxygen; they are among the most hypoxia-tolerant organisms, yet are already at their metabolic limits. Projected further declines in oxygen may put them over the edge, with important consequences for carbon cycling and other biogeochemical processes in the open ocean.&nbsp;Food webs become compromised, particularly those on sea bottoms; there are many documented cases of sensitive invertebrate communities falling victim to hypoxic events since they cannot flee. Hypoxia has even been found to cause mass mortality in coral reef ecosystems, and in some instances may play as important a role as the better-known culprit of elevated water temperatures. Even open-water ecosystems change as the volume of healthy habitat shrinks and species crowd together, leading to novel food-web interactions. Covid-19â€™s web of long-term complications presents an uncanny parallel.<br></p>
<p>	Fortunately for humanity, a vaccine for Covid-19 should be available in 2021.&nbsp;The outlook for the oceans is not so optimistic, but neither is it hopeless.&nbsp;Think about the initial response to the virus, which was hamstrung by shortages of necessary medical supplies and technology, including masks and respirators; once the issues were recognized, it became possible to prioritize production to deal with the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of coastal hypoxia, nutrient pollution reductions coupled with wetland and seagrass restoration are akin to masks and respirators. They help protect the ecosystems and build up their resiliency. Those approaches resulted in greatly improved water quality and subsequent return of biodiversity in the waters off Tampa Bay, Florida, for example. And after decades of nutrient management, some parts of the Baltic Sea and Chesapeake Bay are beginning to show signs of recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>	The looming, elephant-in-the-room challenge is to deal with global warming, which will require new economic policies at national and global scales and the commitment of governments and citizens everywhere. Although overshadowed in the news cycle by Covid-19, global warming is still on the rise, fueled by human outputs of greenhouse gases.&nbsp;We <em>must</em> bend the curve on greenhouse gas emissions, just as we must flatten the Covid-19 curve. Without such change, we are headed in a dark, scary direction where nobody really wants to go.</p>

  <p>I had been a happy-go Java developer on Windows platform. And then I had to ride the Ruby-on-Rails wave over Linux platform, only to realize how much I didn't know about productivity with automation. Later I moved onto MacOS to experience bliss before starting to hate it for one thing after the other; right from their buggy operating system upgrades to Apple not providing power cable compatible to Indian market resulting in earthing issues. Out of frustration I jumped back to Ubuntu and now back on Windows after long years.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting onto Windows was more out of necessity than interest and I started to explore how much things have changed in the Windows world. It wasn't a smooth return for me but the teething period is over and I'm loving Windows again. If you are onto Windows 10 Pro edition, and wanting to get the best of both worlds (Windows and Linux), this post is for you. I am jotting down ProTips to experience delight and productivity at development work.</p>
<ol><li>Use WSL 2 instead of WSL 1, for the former is far less resource intensive by integrating natively with Windows 10 Hyper-V virtualization stack, and thus phenomenally faster too. If you are on Windows 10 Home edition, you need to upgrade it to Windows 10 Pro edition and it is worth it, for you can get it at half the price upon upgrade.</li><li>Do not mount windows native formatted drive (NTFS) onto WSL for code that can be developed both in WSL environment and Windows. While this works, it is snail paced and you will frustrated too soon. I tried this out of curiosity and frustrated beyond my anticipation. If you are still wanting this, you will have to first format the storage drive in DOS format (as FAT32), so that it works well with your WSL and host Windows operating systems. This is possible the best middle-ground that you can hit upon.</li><li>Use <a href="https://aka.ms/terminal" target="_blank">Windows Terminal</a>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp; <a href="https://blog.codonomics.com/2020/09/Cmder" target="_blank">Cmder</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu" target="_blank">ConEmu</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mintty/mintty" target="_blank">Mintty</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a> or any other console emulators. Why? You can customize it with default settings for each of WSLs, Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or other terminals integrated with it. Also Windows Terminal is lightweight and faster.</li><li>When you start your development server in WSL 2, try testing it in your browser with <b><i>localhost</i></b>, it won't work. WSL is one proper sandboxed environment or VM. You need to port forward localhost settings for this to work. This can be done by adding the line like below in your <b><i>.wslconfig</i></b> file in your windows <b><i>$HOME</i></b> directory.<br>--
 --<br>
 </li><li>WSL 2 can consume all of your host memory. You can set limits to it by appending the line&nbsp;<b><i>memory=16GB</i></b> in your <b><i>.wslconfig</i></b> file.</li><li>Do install <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh" target="_blank">Oh-My-ZSH</a> to use zsh shell instead of the default bash. You get bunch of goodies like pre-configured aliases for Git and more by way of its plugins that you can configure to your preference.</li><li>If you are into using <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki" target="_blank">tmux</a>, you can use that too in your WSL 2, and power it up with <a href="https://github.com/erikw/tmux-powerline" target="_blank">tmux-powerline</a>.</li><li>You can change the location of your WSL 2 distribution's virtual hard drive.&nbsp;I keep all of my VMs (and now WSL 2 virtual hard drives) in <b><i>D:\VMs\&lt;platform&gt;\&lt;distribution name&gt;</i></b>. Run the following commands in PowerShell - replacing distribution name and preferred location: <br>----<br> Also at the time of writing, when you import a distribution, you may need to tell WSL 2 to start the distribution using the Linux user account you created when you first created the distribution. Thanks to <a href="https://www.58bits.com/blog/2020/05/30/wsl-2-setup-development">58bits.com </a> that you can run the below PowerShell script that imports the distribution, and resets the default user as you would like it to be. <br>-- --<br> Note that if your import fails with 'Unspecified error' (or other) - you may need to limit the amount of memory allocated to <b><i>vmmem</i></b>. You can do this with WSL2 config to limit memory as mentioned in ProTip 5 above.</li><li>If you are into using VS-Code as your IDE for development, you can launch the one you installed on your host Windows 10 OS from WSL 2 bash in your project's root folder and executing <b><i>`code .`</i></b>. With this you can work on your windows operating system launching your development servers in WSL environment, thus getting the best of both the worlds. Additionally, you can install your vs-code extensions on remote wsl as well as on host OS, all from within your IDE.</li><li>And <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/" target="_blank">Docker Desktop for Windows</a> works well with your WSL2 too. You just can extract the best from everything.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Windows 10 is super cool again with WSL 2. Whether you are a Windows buff wanting to leverage Linux goodies, or a Linux buff wanting to draw upon Windows 10 strengths, you can have it all. Happy coding!!..

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Daniel J. Bernstein's IM2000 email proposal is not a good idea</h2>

	<p><small>September  6, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>A long time ago, Daniel J. Bernstein wrote a proposal for a new
generation of Internet email he called <a href="https://cr.yp.to/im2000.html">IM2000</a>, although it never went anywhere.
Ever since then, a significant number of people have idealized it
as the great white 'if only' hope of email (especially as the
solution to spam), in much the same way that people idealized Sun's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS">NeWS</a> as the great 'if only'
alternative to X11. Unfortunately, IM2000 is not actually a good
idea.</p>

<p>The core of <a href="https://cr.yp.to/im2000.html">IM2000</a> is summarized by Bernstein as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>IM2000 is a project to design a new Internet mail infrastructure
around the following concept: Mail storage is the sender's
responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first problem with this is that it doesn't remove the fundamental
problem of email, which is (depending on how you phrase it) that
email is an <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/EmailVsModernProtocols"><em>anonymous push</em> protocol</a>
or that it lacks <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/SignedEmailWrongProblem"><em>revocable authorization</em> to send you things</a>. In IM2000, random strangers on the
Internet are still allowed to push to you, they just push less data
than they currently do with (E)SMTP mail.</p>

<p>The idea that IM2000 will deal with spam rests on the idea that
forcing senders to store mail is difficult for spammers. Even a
decade ago this was a questionable assumption, but today it is
clearly false. A great deal of serving capacity is yours for the
asking (and someone's credit card) in AWS, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform">GCP</a>, Azure, OVH,
and any number of other VPS and serverless computing places.  In
addition many spammers will have a relatively easy time with
'storing' their email, because their spam is already generated from
templates and so in IM2000 could be generated on the fly whenever
you asked for it from them. We now have a great deal of experience
with web servers that generate dynamic content on demand and it's
clear that they can run very efficiently and scale very well,
provided that they're designed competently.</p>

<p>(I wrote about this a long time ago <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/SenderStorageHelpsSpammers">here</a>, and things have gotten much
easier for spammers since then.)</p>

<p>At the same time, IM2000 is catastrophic for your email privacy.
People complain vociferously about 'tracking pixels' in HTML email
that betray when you open and read the email from someone; well,
IM2000 is one giant tracking pixel that reliably reports when and
where you read that email message. IM2000 would also be a terrible
email reading experience, because it's like a version of IMAP where
message retrieval has random delays and sometimes fails entirely.</p>

<p>(As far as spam filtering your incoming IM2000 messages goes, IM2000
gives you far less up front information than you currently get with
SMTP email. I wrote up this and other issues a long time ago in an
entry about <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/SenderStorageProblems">the technical problems of such schemes</a>. Some of those problems are no longer
really an issue more than a decade later, but some continue to be.)</p>

<p>At a broader 'technical choices have social impacts' level, IM2000
would create a very different experience than today's email systems
if implemented faithfully, one where 'your' email was actually not
yours but was mostly other people's because other people are storing
it. Those other people can mostly retract individual messages by
deleting them from their servers (you would still have the basic
headers that are pushed to you), and they can wipe out large sections
of your email by deleting entire accounts (and the sent messages
associated with them), or even by going out of business or having
a data loss incident. Imagine a world where an ISP getting out of
the mail business means that all email that its customers have sent
from their ISP email accounts over the years just goes away, from
everyone's mailbox.</p>

<p>(If 'ISP' sounds abstract here, substitute 'Yahoo'. Or 'GMail'.)</p>

<p>In addition, in some potential realizations of IM2000, email would
become mutable in practice (even if you weren't supposed to in
theory), because once again the sender is storing the message and
is in a position to alter that stored copy. Expect that capability
to be used sooner or later, just as people silently revise things
posted on the web (including official statements, perhaps especially
including them).</p>

<p>Some of these social effects can be partially avoided by storing
your own local copies of IM2000 messages when you read them, but
there are two issues. The first is pragmatic; the more you store
your own copies and the earlier you make them, the more IM2000 is
SMTP in a bad disguise. The second is social; in the IM2000 world
the server holds the authoritative copy of the message, not you,
so if you say the message says one thing (based on your local copy)
and the server operator says it says something else (or doesn't
exist), the server operator likely wins unless you have very strong
evidence.</p>

<p>In general, I think that IM2000 or anything like it would create
an 'email' experience that was far more like the web, complete with
the experience of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a>
and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/CoolUrlsChange">cool messages changing</a>, than today's
email (where for better or worse you keep your own full record of
what you received, read and reread it at your leisure, and know
that it's as immutable as you want it to be). And it would still
have the problem that people can push stuff in front of you, unlike
the web where you usually at least have to go looking for things.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When the pandemic hit global news, everyone (I presume) and especially on Twitter were sharing their predictions about the future.<br></p><p>Apart from the range of predictions from dark and gloomy to “it’s going to be alright soon” optimism, there was intense collective thought being shared on how to adjust to the new life.&nbsp;</p><p>A dangerous outside world with a potentially lethal virus, getting stuck indoors and hence being wrenched out of every routine and social habits, general anxiety and fear for yourself and your loved ones - didn’t stop people from sharing “if you don’t build your business ideas while you’re stuck indoors, you’ll never do it”. Or “this is the best time to become fit and the best version of yourself.”&nbsp;</p><p>You know, non-empathetic BS that treats human beings like a robot following a set of instructions.</p><p>I spent month 1 in anxiety and fear desperately trying to adjust to the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>By month 2, I’d figured out that to not go insane, I will have to block news, browsing Twitter, and any websites tracking the pandemic 12 times a day. And so I did. My mind felt wrinkled until I let go, and it felt like I could relax and breathe &nbsp;again.</p><p>In the same month, I thought I would adjust and “become the best version of myself” or whatever hustle porn phrase was trending that week. I failed at adjusting and living a “normal” life for several months. I stopped trying so hard.</p><p>It also dawned on me that while my problems are real, the people really facing a hard time are those from the lower economic strata. They don't just have an option to live indoors and "WFH". They can't quit their jobs and go home. I became grateful about my position and privilege in life and internally I stopped complaining to myself about how difficult life is during a pandemic. I became calm.</p><p>It’s month 7 and I think I finally got a grip on my life.</p><p>You see, building new routines and adjusting to new social normals is a long process. Sure, you can write it down on a piece of paper and try to follow it, but your body and mind aren’t fully aligned and adjusted.</p><p>In particular, I found being stuck within 4 walls and not talking to anyone other than my family members for months wasn't going to help me adjust to the new normal.</p><p>In June, I started writing. This was the first step towards normalcy as I finally got in touch with my thoughts again and found an outlet to express them.</p><p>And only in the last month, I created a routine around going downstairs for a long 45-min brisk walk (while wearing a mask and avoiding people like the plague). I also started scheduling a lot of calls whenever someone from my life reached out, just to catch up with them and behave like we would had we bumped into each other at a coffee shop.</p><p>Human beings are incredible at adapting to a situation and normalising it. Life is finally starting to feel normal again. It just takes time, in this case 7 &nbsp;months.</p><p>I can see this in other people too - their behaviours, their mood, what they are saying when you talk to them and what you see people talk about on Twitter and other social platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday, I played <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=puertorico" target="_blank">Puerto Rico</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/sankalpjonna" target="_blank">Sankalp</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/akashjdotcom" target="_blank">Akash</a> in the afternoon. In the evening. I walked while listening and occasionally babbling with a group of people on <a href="https://leher.app/" target="_blank">Leher</a> (Clubhouse for India). It felt like a fun conversation we would have otherwise had over a beer had we met physically. At night, I joked and laughed around with college friends over a Zoom call. </p><p>Life felt normal.</p><p>While the pandemic is bigger than ever and it’s imperative that we continue following all safety guidelines, having a routine you follow everyday, going outdoors regularly, socialising with people on video or phone calls - helps me adjust to this life in a pandemic.</p></div></div>]]>

							<p>Fog clings to a never-ending row of low-rise buildings down the length of a dusty road, it’s early, around eight o’clock on a cool April morning. The fog clears and voices breakthrough and you see the first glimpses of the large bazaar, sounds of shutters slamming open, doors being unlocked and people greeting each other as their day starts. The occasional chatter of gunfire can be heard as firearms are test fired nearby.</p>
<p><em>Darra Adam Khel</em>. This bustling town is situated in modern-day <em>Pakistan</em>, a stone’s throw from the Pak-Afghan border. <em>What makes it so special?</em> You may ask and the answer lies within the myriad of myths and legends put out over the years.</p>

<p><span><iframe width="1160" height="653" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-f7j-RlN_Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>As of this year, 2019, <em>Darra</em> is the last main tribal arms market and manufacturing town that remains in the Pak-Afghan FATA region (Federally-Administered Tribal Region – FATA pronounced Faa-Thaa locally), the last vestige of old-world freedom in the area. Over the last few years, the other manufacturing hubs and markets in towns like <em>Landi Kotal</em>, just a few minutes’ drive from <em>Torkham</em> border on the <em>Khyber Pass</em>, have finally died out leaving a handful of shops and a couple of gunsmiths who repair the large number of firearms still found across the region. <em>Peshawar’s</em> massive arms bazaars have also disappeared leaving a few licensed manufacturers in a small industrial estate on its outskirts and a few licensed dealers scattered throughout the city.</p>
<p><em>Darra</em> held out against the threat of the <em>Taliban</em> in the early 2010s, fighting them off on a number of occasions seeing as they had the arms, supplies and manpower to fend for themselves. They are no friend to these <em>Taliban</em> as you can see even though they have been linked by a few journalistic sources with selling them an enormous number of arms and ammunition. Contrary to popular belief that the market is now dead or not operating, the bazaar still thrives with many firearms bought and sold daily in its now-legendary bazaar. Yes, there were times were the shutters ere down but this was always just a façade, something that happened on the face and business continued in the back alleys and dusty basements.</p>
<p>However, the town of thousands of arms dealers and manufacturing workshops has been relegated to around a thousand of both due to the global war on terror and its impact on the global arms trade and international smuggling routes. They do not get as much as they used to though they still have a steady but small supply of items that get through to them even to this day. Due to this war on terror, the FATA area – which for many years managed to retain its autonomy, was regulated to prohibit the sale and ownership of explosive type ordnance and large-caliber arms such as HMG’s (e.g: DsHK / KPV) and up to the general population there. Fortunately, <em>Darra</em> still maintains its hold on the trade of tribal arms throughout the now regulated tribal areas and still holds a monopoly on arms manufactured there that are sold within <em>Pakistan</em> and <em>Afghanistan</em> too.</p>
<p>The war on terror has a lot of detriments with the main one being that it has increased the price of arms so much; that now an AK rifle which would have cost approximately Rs10,000 (~£55/~$67), around fifteen years ago, now costs a minimum of around ten times that. Yes, as with all markets, prices do fluctuate depending on many local and regional factors but prices still remain relatively high due to this. Genuine, original factory-made arms command a high premium on the market as a whole throughout the Pak-Afghan region and this has meant that locally made arms are sold more than originals due to the somewhat extortionate prices that can be seen. Due to soaring inflation and prices of raw material, locally made arms now cost the same as originals were only a decade or so ago.</p>

<p>Some older background information would be needed to understand why such a place even exists on such a scale as it is or even was. During the British Raj period of the 1800s where the British Empire ruled over these tribal areas, small workshops opened up in many areas across the region to produce exact copies of arms used by the British to fight back against them. Gunsmiths started with muskets and then progressed onto Lee-Enfield action rifles and that was their mainstay for a lengthy period continuing to upgrade and produce newer variations, turning those small shops into larger ones. That is how <em>Darra</em> and many other manufacturing towns and bazaars got their start and from then, the markets grew and grew becoming what they then were known as. <em>Darra’s</em> second major call to fame was that it supplied arms and ammunition to the <em>Mujahideen</em> in <em>Afghanistan</em> during the 1979-1989 Soviet-Afghan War, some say it was even supported by the federal government too at this point. More recently, <em>Darra’s</em> notoriety came to surface as ill-informed people conducting poor journalism claimed it was a black market and that the gunsmiths manufactured guns in mud huts, with basic tools using their bare hands. Putting this to rest, let me start with calling it a black market; this is incorrect as the areas where these markets were/are based comes under its own tribal laws and governance much different to the rest of <em>Pakistan</em>, they are operating well within their own laws therefore it is not a black market in any sense within these borders. There is an element of truth to the thought of mud huts, bare hands and rudimentary methods but the times long past, when this was the norm, are not an indication of how things are in this day and age. Yes, some processes such as heat-treating and finishing are done in so-called mud huts and outdoors under makeshifts structures (this is much needed for ventilation) however the actual workshops are almost always in brick structures and the gunsmiths utilize milling machines, CNC machines and other tools to make their products. Yes, they do use basic tools but those are used to fit and finish the firearm and not to actually manufacture or produce it.</p>

<p>A negative misconception in regards to the firearms produced is the thought that they aren’t heat-treated or are of poor quality. This isn’t true for the most part as they do go through a heat-treating process, however the detractor is that the method of heat-treating leaves a lot to be desired, especially in the cheaper copies. Many users of lower quality copies complain of metal warping and deformation causing a firearm to become inoperable or dangerous to use, this is what leads to people surmising that all arms made in such areas are no good. This is an issue for lower quality copies, a lower quality firearm will have its flaws as it is not built using quality material and to the same tolerances as a firearm made to exact specs with all care taken in production. At the end of the day, you must repeat the same phrase to people who ask why a cheap item is no good; you get what you pay for – if you want a cheap item, you will get a cheap item that will end up having issues or breaking much like any cheap thing you buy.</p>
<p>Moving away from the negatives, let us talk about positives. Apart from the exquisite food that the food gurus cook up there, <em>Darra</em> is also famous for some of the firearms designs to come out of its shops – most notable is the infamous AKMSU which resides in the Royal Armouries, Leeds, UK. Even though that particular firearm could have been made elsewhere in FATA or <em>Afghanistan</em> by a number of other gunsmiths, it has been linked to <em>Darra</em> due to the town being the main source of arms for sale and the similar types of AK designed copies/modifications known to have come out of there. I could list an almost infinite number of firearms designs displaying their know-how such as the modified SKS made to resemble an AK, or the well-known 8mm bolt-action faux AK and even the more recent AK M4geries. Forget all of those firearms, the gunsmiths themselves are the ones to keep this market and tradition alive, it’s them you have to appreciate as without them there would be more-or-less nothing left of the industry. The ingenuity and skill they have has made <em>Darra</em> a household name throughout the region and extending to much of the world, even to those who are not versed on firearms.</p>

<p><em>Darra</em> has managed to stand against the tide of time and change in an increasingly connected world and holds its own against all odds but has still found a way to use newer technologies and retain its own methods &amp; procedures of manufacturing in its regular business. Even with all that, there is now news that changes things, FATA and Darra with it, will finally be incorporated into the neighboring <em>KPK</em> (<em>Khyber</em> <em>Pakhtunkhwa</em>) province of <em>Pakistan</em>. Regrettably, this means that their own tribal laws will now be abolished and government/regional laws and regulations will be implemented in its place there. The whole town’s industry will be made to register for licenses in either manufacturing or dealing sectors or be shut down. It is said that they will have easier access to raw materials and the costs of business will hopefully decrease, this is something that we can only hope does not destroy this historic industry. <em>Darra</em> will move into the new age with much newer equipment and tooling plus workshops and industrial estates that are planned to be built there and in other places with support of the current federal government of <em>Pakistan</em>. It is planned that arms manufactured there will be available to international markets via some …</p></div></div></div></div></div></article></div>

        <p>Design is a broad topic. This post won’t approach the adjective qualifying a style with simple forms and a pure appearance. No. Design is broader than a sleek car or an harmonious living room.</p>

<p>Design is a creative activity that aims to invent, improve and solve problems. Life is full of them, in various domains, which pushes people to eventually become a designer of something. Whether you’re conceiving a recipe, an apartment layout, a software or a rocket you are designing. By learning the fundamentals, you will arm yourself for various situations. Here is a list of the best pragmatic principles I’ve learned to better design. In spite of their obviousness and renown, my experience has shown me that some of these principles are often forgotten.</p>

<p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: In english, <em>to design</em> means both <em>to draw</em> and <em>to conceive according to a plan</em>. Similarly in French, the word <em>dessin</em> (a drawing) derives its etymology from the word <em>dessein</em> (have the intention).</p>

<h2 id="incremental-improvement">Incremental improvement</h2>

<p>Believing you can do it right the first time is naive at best, pretentious at worst. <strong>You will fail and have to accept it</strong>. Do not postpone but instead <strong>release fast</strong>, get feedback early and iterate to make it better. You will find many references, notably on Lean Startup, DevOps culture or Site Reliability Engineering, which encourage <strong>a quick redesign capability rather than a perfect design at the first place</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To write clean code, you must first write dirty code and then clean it. […]
Learning to write clean code is hard work. It requires more than just the knowledge of principles and patterns. You must sweat over it. You must practice it yourself, and watch yourself fail. Robert C. Martin — Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="reuse-what-exists">Reuse what exists</h2>

<p>It is unlikely that the problem you face is fundamentally new. Before making any effort, look for <strong>existing solutions</strong> or proven practices. <strong>Be humble</strong> and accept you can’t compete with years of expertise on a subject. If so, the motivation to develop the new model must come from reaching the limits of the previous one. In software engineering for instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">design patterns</a> are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.</p>

<p>Don’t limit yourself to the area of the original problem, sometimes a similar problem has been found and solved long before in <strong>a different field</strong>. Learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory">queuing theory</a> will help you to write an operating system scheduler as well as being frustrated in a supermarket queue. Solutions come from fields of experiences and theories that you would not necessarily expect.</p>

<h2 id="five-whys">Five whys</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">Five whys technique</a>, originally developed by Toyota, has been mostly used for exploring the root cause of a defect in a system. It involves asking the relevant question starting with a why in order to find the source which cause the failure. Adapt this technique to find out what really matter in our design. For example, “<em>We need a program which exports our documentation to PDF</em>”:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Why? - So the export can go on the website.</li>
  <li>Why? - Because our customers has to read it.</li>
  <li>Why? - Because they require it to maintain the software.</li>
  <li>Why (don’t they have access to the documentation like everyone else)? - Because they haven’t been integrated into our platform.</li>
  <li>Why? Because they have never been on-board on the platform.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Decision</strong>: instead of developing a complex program which exports PDF, write a simple on-boarding guide for the customers.</p>

<p>This situation often occurs when the given requirement includes the design. Before answering the question <em>“How do we do it?”</em> directly, the first and most important step is to remember “<em>Why do we do it?</em>”. Once you have understood the <strong>root reasons</strong> and constraints for the requirement, it clears the path on how to get there and can <strong>prevent</strong> you from taking <strong>very long detours</strong> in addition to <strong>simplifying</strong> the design.</p>

<h2 id="keep-it-simple-stupid">Keep it simple stupid</h2>

<p><strong>Resolve problems, don’t create them</strong>. You should be suspicious of providing a solution that makes the overall system more complicated than before. Remember: You’ll have to maintain everything you build, so you’d better build as little and simply as possible.</p>

<p>Simple designs are easy to <strong>learn</strong>, easy to <strong>teach</strong>, easy to <strong>use</strong> and therefore easily <strong>appeal</strong> to customers. It forces the design to be intuitive and obvious, reducing the learning curve and facilitates the adoption. Like Denis Diderot says in Pensées sur l’interprétation de la nature:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These books [of Sthal and Newton] were just waiting to be heard, to be valued for what they were worth; and it would not have cost their authors more than a month to make them clear; that month would have spared three years of labor and exhaustion to a thousand good spirits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what is a simple design? In the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/simplicity/">Simplicity chapter of the Site Reliability Engineering</a> book of Google, they mention a great quote from the French poet Antoine de Saint Exupery about perfection which could fit very well with simplicity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer more to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away - A. de Saint Exupéry, Terre des Hommes</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good-enough">Perfect is the enemy of good enough</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.de/pin/397724210839705109/"><img src="https://reflexio.debec.eu/assets/moka-pot.svg" alt="moka"></a></p>

<p>The moka coffee maker may not produce perfect coffee, but it requires so little maintenance compared to a large coffee machine with radiators, pipes, grinder, etc. that it makes the compromise “complexity / coffee taste” great.</p>

<p>Remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>: in general <strong>80% of a things can be done in 20%</strong> of the total allocated time. Conversely, the hardest <strong>20% left takes 80%</strong> of the time. Perfection requires infinite time and energy. This is impossible and therefore should not be part of your design.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beware of the perfection pitfall and design your architecture only as good as necessary and not as good as ultimate possible. - Ralf S. Engelschall</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="postpone-complexity">Postpone complexity</h2>

<p>Simplicity and incremental improvement principles give birth to a another principle: <strong>Postpone complexity</strong>. Complexity lies in early optimization, as Donald E. Knuth points out in his article <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/361604.361612?download=true">Computer Programming as Art</a> with “<em>premature optimization is the root of all evil</em>”. Focus on designing something that works instead of something finely tune that does not.</p>

<p>Complexity lies also in early generalization. Focus on designing something that works in a single use case rather than something that will not work in many. When designing a coffee machine, first design something that makes a simple black coffee. If you plan ahead to include all extra options for latte, cappuccino or irish coffee you will end up not making a simple back coffee. As elegantly summarized by Ralf S. Engelschall: “<em>Use before reuse</em>”.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Do you think there’s a principle missing? Send me your comments! This list will certainly be extended and refined, subscribe to the <a data-formkit-toggle="78a863d4eb" href="https://reflexio-debec.ck.page/78a863d4eb">newsletter</a> if you wish to be notified about it. In the meantime, how are you going to ensure that you do not forget to implement the principles you have just learned?</p>

    <h3>PDP 11/70 Emulator - v3.1 August 2020</h3>
    <p>
      This emulator came about because years ago I was a programmer for RSTS/E on a PDP 11/45 and had admired the console idle loop light pattern - but I couldn't quite remember how it looked. Given the unavailability of real systems it became time to write
      an emulator!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was going to start with a PDP 11/45 emulator but the extra memory of a PDP 11/70 became far too attractive (a whole 4MB!). It took some time before I finally produced a
      <a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/pdp11-45.html">PDP 11/45</a> version.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have met my core objective - I can now see the RSTS/E console light pattern that I was looking for, and found that newer versions (eg v9.6) have a different light pattern. Also I have now seen some of the light patterns for other OSes. RSX and BSD 2.11
      have their own different patterns and Unix V5 and Ultrix operate with absolute minimum light movement (I'm assuming they operates mostly in WAIT mode).
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting all of the operating systems used here presents its own set of challenges - one of which is finding the software in the first place. But one of the most interesting was RSTS/E V06C which has its own
      <a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/RSTSv06c.html">story</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: The boot code in this emulator is a custom PDP 11 program running with it's own set of light patterns. It is initially loaded at address 140000 and has a LIGHTS command which operates by mapping and executing a WAIT instruction from a pattern of virtual addresses located in Supervisor
      mode. You can also use the BOOT command to start one of the guest operating systems listed below, or the ODT command to start a version of the Octal Debugging Tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      However boot code like this was not part of early PDP 11s. These systems had no BIOS or other software to help get the bare metal started. If you were lucky perhaps the previous boot code would still be intact in non-volatile magnetic core memory, but in general booting the system required toggling in a small bootstrap loader from the front panel. There are listings of bootstrap loaders for various devices
      <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/psychology/pdp-11/bootstraps.html">here</a>.
      If you are a purist don't use the boot code! Instead find the bootstrap code for the device you want to boot from and toggle it in through the switches. However be warned - the boot program will not work unless toggled in perfectly which often takes a few goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example of the switch commands for booting from an RK05 where the value at address 1002 selects the unit number (rk0, rk1, rk2, etc). Goodluck!
    </p>
    <pre><b>

      If you wish to toggle in a simple light chaser to the front panel then here are some switch commands which can be used:

                            001000, LOAD ADDRESS, ENABLE, START
</pre>
To restart the initial boot code (if it has not been overwritten) use the switch commands:
    <pre>HALT, 140000, LOAD ADDRESS, ENABLE, START
</pre>
    <p>
      If you plan to run the emulator repeatedly or for a project, consider downloading the emulator to your own machine or server.
      This will <b>significantly</b> speed any of the emulator disk accesses and response times. All files and emulator OS
      disks can be found in the top level folder of
      <b><a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/">http://skn.noip.me/pdp11/</a></b> or in the zip file
      <b><a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/pdp11.zip">pdp11.zip</a></b> Please note that browser security
      policy may prevent local emulator pages from booting disk images so please read the information in <b>StartChrome.cmd</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are interested in how the emulator works then you can browse the source files on
      <b><a href="https://github.com/paulnank/nankervis-pdp11-js">Github</a></b>.
      The main Javascript files are pdp11.js, fpp.js and iopage.js
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many PDP emulators out there and I have never seen what I consider to be a complete list. Some of the really interesting ones can be found by googling terms such as "vhdl pdp 11". However the gold standard is SIMH at
      <a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/">Trailing Edge</a>.
      A different approach to Javascript PDP 11 emulation can be found at
      <a href="http://www.pcjs.org/devices/pdp11/">www.pcjs.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that the first PDP 11 emulator would be SIM-11 written in FORTRAN before the first PDP 11/20 hardware was even built - see
      <a href="http://www.hampage.hu/pdp-11/birth.html"> How the PDP-11 Was Born</a>. There is more PDP 11 history at
      <a href="http://www.hampage.hu/pdp-11/main.html">www.hampage.hu</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course if you want your own PDP 11/70 front panel you might consider a
      <a href="http://obsolescence.wixsite.com/obsolescence/pidp-11">PiDP-11</a>.

      Happy emulating!

<meta name="twitter:title" content="3 Programming Books for Beginner to Read in 2020">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="Programming books can help you level up as a Developer, especially when you are getting started in Software Development or learning a new language.">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://www.datastuff.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/library-869061_640.jpg">
<p>Be it an O’Reilly book, or some of the Computer Science classics, many <strong>programming books</strong> can help you level up in your <strong>career as a Developer</strong>. </p>
<p>This can be especially important when you are <strong>getting started</strong> in Software Development, or in a <strong>programming language</strong> like Python.</p>
<p>These last months have been quite heavy and stressful for many of us, what with the Apocalypse taking place and all that. </p>
<p>So why not take advantage of the situation, and use our newfound free time to double down on our studies and read some programming books?</p>
<p>This may be the time to be twice as productive. As <a href="http://paulgraham.com/gh.html?viewfullsite=1">Paul Graham</a> said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If it is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to do it may be to make the following deal with yourself: you never have to work on boring projects (…), and in return, you’ll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Without further ado, let’s see book number 1.</p>
<h2>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Automate-Boring-Stuff-Python-2nd-ebook/dp/B07VSXS4NK/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Automate+the+Boring+Stuff+with+Python&amp;qid=1587355901&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=li3&amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;linkId=f895004eb4c2d8493cba066d43e4b256" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/AtBSwPi');" data-cf-modified-0749bac8c116f0d61ff6b456-=""><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B07VSXS4NK&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=strikingloo-20"></a><img loading="lazy" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=strikingloo-20&amp;l=li3&amp;o=1&amp;a=B07VSXS4NK" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p><p>If you’re new to programming, there’s this very early stage when you’re still realizing the <strong>huge potential software can have</strong>, especially when applied to <strong>automation</strong>. </p>
<p>There’s a big difference between performing a simple task manually, and doing it a thousand times faster with a script.</p>
<p>There’s also a case to be made that <strong>Python is the best language to get started</strong> with Software Development, since its syntax and environments can be less daunting than C or Java. This way, you can spend less time doing this kind of “set up” things, freeing you up to focus on what’s important: solving actual problems.</p>
<p>I think <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2yoYd2y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Automate the Boring Stuff</a></em> really sets itself apart from other programming books in this area: showing you from the get-go which <a href="https://www.datastuff.tech/programming/pythons-list-comprehensions-uses-and-advantages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">typical day-to-day problems you can solve with Python scripts</a>, or with code, really. </p>
<p>From basic program flow and logic to more advanced tasks like <a href="https://www.datastuff.tech/programming/how-to-scrape-the-web-using-python-with-scrapy-spiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Web Scraping</a>, this book walks with you <strong>all the way from beginner to proficient</strong>, without holding your hand too much.</p>
<p>My favorite project from that book is the one on the chapter <strong><em>Handle the Clipboard Content</em></strong>, which teaches you how to copy and paste text programmatically, eventually making a <em>super-clipboard</em> which stores more than one text.</p>
<p>I have a personal attachment to this book, as I used it to learn Python when I was still in high school, deciding on whether to study Computer Science or not.</p>
<p>If you work in an office and you’re thinking of <strong>pivoting into programming</strong>, this book is for you.</p>
<p>Here’s a link to <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2yoYd2y">Automate the Boring Stuff</a></em> in Amazon.</p>
<h2>Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Press-Thomas-Cormen-ebook/dp/B007CNRCAO/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1&amp;keywords=cormen&amp;qid=1587356486&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=li3&amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;linkId=09fe74bb316b42a1559a9377aabc1f17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/ItACormeni');" data-cf-modified-0749bac8c116f0d61ff6b456-=""><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B007CNRCAO&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=strikingloo-20"></a><img loading="lazy" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=strikingloo-20&amp;l=li3&amp;o=1&amp;a=B007CNRCAO" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p><p>To every Computer Science student, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2VktSLi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/ItACormen');" data-cf-modified-0749bac8c116f0d61ff6b456-="">Cormen et al.’s Introduction to Algorithms</a></em> is our bible.</p>
<p>This book has been <strong>sitting on my shelf for years</strong>. </p>
<p>It has helped me <strong>prepare for many exams</strong>, or whenever I need to <strong>brush up on Data Structures</strong> before an interview.</p>
<p>Especially if you’re planning to get into Software Development without getting a college degree, this book is a definite must-read.</p>
<p>This Computer Science book is the most comprehensive study of basic <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong> you will find. </p>
<p>It covers:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Algorithmic Complexity</strong> (with the best explanation of Big-O notation I’ve seen so far).</li><li><strong>Sorting Algorithms</strong> (<em>many</em> sorting algorithms).</li><li><strong>Graphs</strong> and Graph-related Algorithms (especially Binary trees).</li><li><strong>Hash tables</strong> and hashing algorithms.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Programming</strong>, Greedy Algorithms, <strong>Divide-and-Conquer</strong> Algorithms.</li></ul>
<p>These topics and many others are explained in understandable terms, but with <strong>mathematical rigor and correctness</strong>. Not only that, but they often come up both in <strong>day-to-day work</strong>, and in <strong>interview problems</strong>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this is a university level book, packed full with formal proofs and mathematical notation. </p>
<p>Even so, I think most developers will agree it is <strong>generally entertaining to read </strong>(<em>if you don’t find Data Structures fun, make sure you’re picking the right career!</em>), and explains most concepts really clearly and succinctly.</p>
<p>If you need to learn how a hash table works, or want to be able to build a binary search tree from scratch, or just need a quick brush up on sorting algorithms before an interview, this is the book for you.</p>
<p>As before, here’s a link to <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2VktSLi" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/Cormen');" data-cf-modified-0749bac8c116f0d61ff6b456-="">Cormen et al.’s Introduction to Algorithms</a></em> in Amazon.</p>
<p>And, speaking of interviews…</p>
<h2>Cracking the Code Interview</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1&amp;keywords=ctci&amp;qid=1587356024&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=li3&amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;linkId=904a242e267cc92cfb582e366ee3e63a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/CtCIi');" data-cf-modified-0749bac8c116f0d61ff6b456-=""><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0984782850&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=strikingloo-20"></a><img loading="lazy" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=strikingloo-20&amp;l=li3&amp;o=1&amp;a=0984782850" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p><p>Ok, hear me out here. If you’re starting from scratch, I think <a href="https://amzn.to/2yoYd2y" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/AtBSwP');" data-cf-modified-0749bac8c116f0d61ff6b456-="">Automate the Boring Stuff</a> is the most practical way to start learning Python and programming.</p>
<p>And if you want to <strong>dive deeper</strong> and learn more advanced or theoretical Computer Science concepts, like Algorithms and Data Structures, then <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2VktSLi">Cormen’s Introduction to Algorithms</a></em> is the undisputed book to go.</p>
<p>However, when all is said and done, there is a craftsmanship that you can only learn by doing, and practicing.</p>
<p>As Charles Darwin once said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I have always maintained that, excepting fools, men did not differ much in intellect, only in zeal and hard work.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If that’s the stage where you feel you’re at, then the best thing you can do is <strong>practice a lot</strong>, with <strong>many different problems</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3bluxBO" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/CtCI');" data-cf-modified-0749bac8c116f0d61ff6b456-="">Cracking the Code Interview</a></em> (CTCI, for friends) has to offer.</p>
<p>Sure, the first chapter deals more with the “soft” aspects of a Software Interview (which, again, if you plan to apply for a SWE job eventually, then you should master those too!).</p>
<p>But the rest of the book? Chapter after chapter of <strong>fun, challenging problems</strong> taken straight out of Google’s, Microsoft’s or Facebook’s interview processes. And, they are divided into categories so you can practice one subject at a time.</p>
<p>Feel like you need to polish your <strong>bit manipulation</strong> skills? CTCI has a chapter for you.</p>
<p>Want to practice thinking on your feet and deciding which <strong>Data Structures</strong> fit each kind of problem setup? CTCI has you covered, too.</p>
<p>I did feel my <strong>Software Interview skills</strong> improved after reading CTCI and going through all its exercises. However, that’s definitely not the most important part. The most valuable thing I got from CTCI, is practice: hands-on practice, solving many different problems through code.</p>
<p>To get started, be sure to check out <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3bluxBO" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/CTCIf');" data-cf-modified-0749bac8c116f0d61ff6b456-="">Cracking the Code Interview</a></em> on Amazon.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So far, I’ve made recommendations for:</p>
<ul><li>A very language-focused programming book for your first steps as a Developer.</li><li>A more academic or broader book for the more theoretically-oriented readers.</li><li>A last, very practical book with a lot of exercises for everyone, old and new to coding.</li></ul>
<p>Each of these programming books has helped me learn a lot. Some have saved my skin on more than one occasion -or exam!-. </p>
<p>When I am preparing for an interview, or a tough exam, there are no other books I’d rather have <em>(though, if you read this far and are thinking ‘hey, he didn’t mention &lt;book_name&gt;!’ this is your time to shine! Hit me up in the comments and I’ll make sure to add it to my reading list)</em>.</p>
<p>I hope at least some of these books will be as helpful to you or your programmer friends, too!</p>
<p>Have you already read any of these books? Are you reading any of them? Let me know what you think of them in the comments! </p>
<p>I’d love to know your opinion, both if you liked them or not. Especially if you can offer a recommendation for what you think is a better alternative!</p>
<p>If you want to get into Data Science or Machine Learning, check out my older post <em><a href="https://www.datastuff.tech/data-science/3-machine-learning-books-that-helped-me-level-up-as-a-data-scientist/" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/endMLB');" data-cf-modified-0749bac8c116f0d61ff6b456-="">Machine Learning Books to Level Up as a Data Scientists</a></em>.</p>

<p>Last month <a href="https://danielvassallo.com/only-intrinsic-motivation-lasts/">I left my job at Amazon to work for myself</a>. I’m no longer an employee, but if I were ever to become one again, here’s what I’ll keep in mind.</p>



<h3 id="mce_4">Many things won’t be within my control.</h3>



<p>Getting promoted, getting a raise, getting recognized, getting on an important project — these are all things that an employee can never fully control, regardless of the effort made. Some people I worked with made their well-being dependent on these things. I tried not to. It’s normal to be disappointed by undesirable outcomes, but I try to avoid having externally controlled outcomes play a role in my satisfaction and self-esteem.</p>



<h3>My satisfaction comes from challenges, not from outcomes.</h3>



<p>Most companies function by setting goals and holding people accountable for the outcomes. The problem is, I don’t consider myself to be goal-driven. I don’t set goals for myself; I cannot remember ever setting one. I have targets, but I don’t try to hold myself accountable for the outcomes. Employers, however, care a lot about outcomes, and as an employee I always wanted to do my best to deliver what my employer wanted. So my approach was to mentally transform the company’s goals into small daily challenges. Tackling a challenge, brainstorming solutions, trying my best, finding an easy way out — doing those things can give me satisfaction regardless of the outcome. It’s the journey that matters to me, not the outcome, and the journey is just a stream of daily challenges coupled with my best attempts to tackle them.</p>



<h3 id="mce_2">Trying to get promoted is the fastest way not to get promoted.</h3>



<p>Promotions are usually the biggest carrot that employers dangle in front of employees to “motivate them”. A promotion doesn’t cost the employer anything, which is definitely not the case for other motivational incentives, such as a bonus, or a day off. Luckily for the employer, employees tend to want promotions a lot — probably more than they want bonuses and days off. However, once again, promotions are outcomes controlled by many variables and by random subjective people. They are never really in the employee’s control. My trick was not to desire one. I never asked my manager what I needed to do to get a promotion, I never asked to discuss my career plan, I never looked for a career mentor, I never tried to impress those that would be evaluating me — nothing of that sort. I just focused on the things in my control: doing the best work I could, as if it were my own company, and treating others how I wanted to be treated.</p>



<h3 id="mce_2">The company’s opinions are not necessarily my opinions.</h3>



<p>Being a good employee is like being a lawyer acting for a client. The lawyer’s job is to make the best case for the client, regardless of what the lawyer might think. My job as an employee was to do the best work I could, the way the company wanted, based on the values and opinions of the company. Just like the lawyer, I would occasionally voice my opinion privately when we didn’t see things entirely eye to eye. But it was always on me to disagree and commit. And also just like the lawyer, there were always moral and legal lines I wouldn’t cross. But as long as I held the job, I carried out my duty. For example, whenever I talked to customers, I always gave them the company’s opinion of the products, not my own. That’s how it’s supposed to be. If I were to employ people, that’s what I would want them to do.</p>



<h3 id="mce_2">Meaningless work is the cost of doing business.</h3>



<p>Most policies, processes, and procedures that I’ve been subject to by my employers had things in them that I thought were completely meaningless, and that I wouldn’t do if I were in charge. This work was the hardest type for me to do, especially when it carried on for days, weeks, and months. The bigger the company and the more distant the policy-makers are from the makers, the more of this you can expect. The best mechanism I found to convince my procrastinating self to persevere with this work was to think of it as a cost of doing business, rather than a purposeless task. That simple mental switch suddenly gives it meaning in the complex universe of a company.</p>



<h3 id="mce_2">Rewards kill my enthusiasm.</h3>



<p>I never liked having incentives dangled in front of me, and I don’t trust people that tell me: If you do this, you’ll get that. I’ve hated this for as long as I can remember, because it always feels like somebody is trying to control me or trying to change my behavior. I respond very negatively to the perception of being controlled, so as much as I can, I try to avoid such environments. When I can’t do that, I try to ignore the incentives, and just focus on the things that I can control, such as doing the best work that I can. This has helped me to find peace of mind in environments filled with carrots and sticks.</p>



<h3 id="mce_20">Only intrinsic motivation lasts.</h3>



<p>There are things that I feel intrinsically driven to do, even when there’s no incentive or punishment compelling me to do them. The best kind of work for me is work driven by this intrinsic energy. I might be doing other things, but I would always be looking for opportunities that allow me to spend more time on work driven by my intrinsic motivation. My last job was very good by every measure, but once I discovered an alternative path that would allow me to use my intrinsic motivation more, it became practically impossible for me to stay. If I were to become an employee again, I’d be very careful not to let the extrinsic rewards distort how I measure job opportunities. Once I attain a certain level of financial security, the satisfaction from rewards wears off quickly, and only intrinsic motivation lasts.</p>

    <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/TI99-IMG_7143.jpg" alt="TI-99/4A"></p>
<p>When I was around 13-14 years old, home computers were just appearing
on the market.  The first machines that I remember to have been sold
in the large department stores in Berlin were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family">Atari 400 and
800</a> as well as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A">TI-99/4A</a>.
At the time, these machines were incredibly expensive, but me and my
friends often hung out in the stores to play around with these
machines and dream of owning them.</p>
<p>I found the TI-99/4A to be very good looking with its late 1970ies US
design and its nice keyboard.  In magazines I read that the machine
was slow and crippled, though, and the british home computers were
much cheaper, so I never became friends with the TI back then.</p>
<p>Recently, I found a machine cheaply on sale on an auction site and
bought it, despite the fact that neither the power supply nor the TV
modulator was included with the system.  The power brick was easy to
buy separately and I thought that I would not want the TV modulator
anyway.  I figured that the (european) TI outputs a component (YPbPr)
video signal and decided to try some conversion circuits that I found
on the Internet until I got something that one of my monitors could
display.</p>
<p>The first two attempts that I made failed, though.  One of the
schematics I had was a generic YPbPr conversion circuit based on a
bunch of opamps.  It did not produce a picture at all, but not knowing
enough about video signal encoding I did not manage to debug the
problem.  The same happened with another schematic that supposedly was
specifically designed for the TI-99/4A, but did not work for me
either.  Finally, I run across a new adapter circuit called
<a href="https://tms-rgb.com/">TMS-RGB</a> designed by <a href="https://twitter.com/npiegdon">Nicholas
Piegdon</a> just this year.</p>
<p><img src="https://netzhansa.com/images/tms-rgb-pcb.jpg" alt="TMS-RGB PCB"></p>
<p>The TMS-RGB is a generic RGB converter for systems using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TMS9918">TMS9929A</a>
chip, i.e. the TI-99/4A, some MSX systems and the ColecoVision.  It is
a tightly packed PCB with surface mounted components meant to be
soldered onto the solder side of the PCB of the machine to be
converted.</p>
<p><img src="https://netzhansa.com/images/tms-rgb-on-ti.jpg" alt="TMS-RGB mounted on TI-99/4A board"></p>
<p>To me, getting the PCB fabricated in China, sourcing the components
and soldering them onto the board with a microscope was part of the
fun.  It was not all that easy, though, and the TMS-RGB website has
some shops listed that sell the board ready for installation.
Installing it in the machine is very easy thanks to the excellent
videos published on the site.</p>
<p>The TMS-RGB converts the YPrPb signal to RGB + Sync, but it does not
change the overall timing.  This means that one either needs a monitor
that can deal with TV format RGB signals (i.e. one that has a RGB
SCART Input or a CBM 1084), or an upscaler that converts the signal to
match the expectations of a more modern computer monitor.  I bought a
cheap GBS-8200 upscaler board which produces a VGA output and it
worked fine.</p>
<p><img src="https://netzhansa.com/images/ti-and-upscaler.jpg" alt="TI-99/4A board and GNS-8200 upscaler"></p>
<p>In fact, the picture quality that I get with this on my TFT monitor is
just awesome.  The pixels are crisp and the is no blur, jail bars or
ghosting.  I can recommend the TMS-RGB board to anyone who wants to
equip their TMS9929A based hardware with a better video output.  The
overall cost for the PCB's, components and the upscaler board was
around 70 Euros.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>So the other day I both defined Tcl procedures all by myself and used them interactively, and I liked it, to the point where it felt like some kind of local optimum. This entry is an attempt to cope with the trauma of liking Tcl, by means of rationalizing it. I'll first tell the story of my fascinating adventures, and then I'll do the rationalizing (to skip the oh-so-personal first part, go straight for the bullet points).</p>
<p>Here's what I was doing. I have this board. The board has a chip on it. The chip has several processors in it. There's a processor in there that is a memory-mapped device, and I talk to it using CPU load/store commands. The CPU is itself a JTAG target, and I talk to it via a probe, issuing those load/store commands. To the probe I talk via USB using an ugly console that can't even handle the clipboard properly. The console speaks Tcl.</p>
<p>Net result: in order to talk to the memory-mapped processor, I have to speak Tcl. Or I can use a memory view window in a graphical debugger. Except some addresses will change the processor state when read (pop an item from a LIFO, that sort of thing). So no, memory view windows aren't a good idea – you have to aim for the specific address, not shoot at whole address ranges. Damn, just who thought of defining the hardware in such a stupid way? Why, it was me. Little did I know that I was thereby inflicting Tcl on myself.</p>
<p>Anyway, there's this bug I have to debug now, and as far as I know it could be in at least three different pieces of software or in two different pieces of hardware, and I don't like any of the 5 options very much, and I want to find out what it is already. So at the ugly probe console I type things like <code>word 0x1f8cc000</code> (reads the processor status), <code>word 0x1f8cc008 2</code> (halts the execution), <code>word 0x1f8cc020 0x875</code> (places a breakpoint). I get sick and tired of this in about 2 minutes, when the command history is large enough to make the probability of hitting Enter at the wrong auto-completed command annoying. It's annoying to run the wrong command because if I ruin the processor state, it will take me minutes to reproduce that state, because the program reads input via JTAG, which is as slow as it gets.</p>
<p>So I figure this isn't the last bug I'm gonna deal with this way, and it's therefore time for Extending my Environment, equipping myself with the Right Tools for the Job, Tailored to my needs, utilizing the Scripting capabilities of the system. I hate that, I really do. Is there something more distressing than the development of development tools for the mass market of a single developer? Can a programmer have a weakness more pathetic than the tendency to solve easy generic meta-problems when the real, specific problems are too hard? Is there software more disgusting in nature than plug-ins and extensions for a butt-ugly base system? But you know what, I really fail to remember 0x1f8cwhat the breakpoint address is. This story has one hexadecimal value too much for my brain. OK, then. Tcl.</p>
<p>I decided to have one entry point procedure, <code>pmem</code>, that would get a memory-mapped processor id, 'cause there are many of them, and then call one of several functions with the right base address, so that <code>pmem 0 pc</code> would do the same as <code>pmem_pc 0x1f8c0000</code>. Well, in Tcl that's as simple as it gets. Tcl likes to generate and evaluate command strings. More generally, Tcl likes strings. In fact, it likes them more than anything else. In normal programming languages, things are variables and expressions by default. In Tcl, they are strings. <code>abc</code> isn't a variable reference – it's a string. <code>$abc</code> is the variable reference. <code>a+b/c</code> isn't an expression – it's a string. <code>[expr $a+$b/$c]</code> is the expression. Could you believe that? <code>[expr $a+$b/$c]</code>. Isn't that ridiculous?</p>
<p>In fact, that was one of my main applications for Tcl: ridiculing it. I remember reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130385603">the huge Tcl/Tk book by Brent Welch</a> with my friend once. There was a power outage and it was past the time when the last UPS squeaked its last squeak. And the book was there 'cause the hardware guys use it for scripting their lovecraftian toolchain. We really did have fun. Tears went down my cheeks from laughter. Even people with the usual frightened/mean comments about those geeks who laugh their brains out over a Tcl book  didn't spoil it. So, ridiculing Tcl, my #1 use for it. The other use is the occasional scripting of the hardware hackers' lovecraftian toolchain. Overall, I don't use Tcl very much.</p>
<p>The nice thing about Tcl is that it's still a dynamic language, and reasonably laconic at that, modulo quoting and escaping. So I enter the usual addictive edit/test cycle using <code>tclsh &lt; script</code>. N minutes down the road (I really don't know what N was), I've finished my 2 screenfuls of Tcl and the fun starts. I actually start debugging the goddamn thing.<br>
<code><br>
$ pmem 0 stat<br>
IDLE<br>
$ pmem 0 bkpt 0 0xbff<br>
$ pmem 0 bkpt 1 0xa57<br>
$ pmem 0 cmd run<br>
$ pmem 0 stat<br>
DEBUG<br>
$ pmem 0 pc<br>
0xbff<br>
$ pmem 0 rstack<br>
3 return addresses<br>
addr 0: 0x0005<br>
addr 1: 0x05a8<br>
addr 2: 0x0766<br>
$ pmem 0 cmd stp<br>
$ pmem 0 pc<br>
0xc00<br>
</code></p>
<p><em>Weeee!</em> <em>HAPPY, HAPPY, JOY, JOY!</em></p>
<p>You have no idea just how happy this made me. Yeah, I know, I'm overreacting. I'll tell you what: debug various kinds of hardware malfunction for several months, and you'll be able to identify with the warped notion of value one gains through such process. On second thought, I don't know if I'd really recommend it. Remember how I told <a href="http://www.yosefk.com/blog/low-level-is-easy.html">low-level programming was easy</a>? It is, fundamentally, but there's this other angle from which it's quite a filthy endeavor. I promise to blog about it. I owe it to the people who keep telling me "so low-level is easy?" each time they listen to me swear heartily at a degenerate hardware setup where nothing works no matter what you try. I owe it to myself – me wants to reach a closure here. Why should I tolerate being regularly misquoted at the moments of my deepest professional catharsis?</p>
<p>Aaaanyway, in just N minutes, I bootstrapped myself something not unlike a retarded version of gdb, the way it would work if the symbol table of my program was stripped. But no matter – I have <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/addr2line1.html">addr2line</a> for that. And the nice thing about my retarded debugger front-end is that it looks like shell commands: <code>blah blah blah</code>. As opposed to <code>blah("blah","blah")</code>. And this, folks, is what I think Tcl, being a tool command language, gets right.</p>
<p>I come from the world of pop infix languages (C/Java/Python/Ruby/you name it). Tcl basically freaks me out with its two fundamental choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tcl likes literals, not variables.</strong> Tcl: <code>string, $var.</code> Pop infix: <code>"string", var</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Tcl likes commands, not expressions.</strong> Tcl: <code>doit this that, [expr $this+$that]</code>. Pop infix: <code>doit("this","that"), this+that</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So basically, pop infix languages (and I use the term in the most non-judgmental, factual way), pop infix languages are optimized for programming (duh, they are programming languages). Programming is definitions. Define a variable and it will be easy to use it, and computing hairy expressions from variables is also easy. Tcl is optimized for usage. Most of the time, users give simple commands. Command names and literal parameters are easy. If you are a sophisticated user, and you want to do <code>pmem 0 bkpt [expr [pmem 0 pc] + 1]</code>, go ahead and do it. A bit ugly, but on the other hand, simple commands are really, really simple.</p>
<p>And eventually, simple commands become all that matters for the user, because the sophisticated user grows personal shortcuts, which abstract away variables and expressions, so you end up with <code>pmem 0 bkpt nextpc</code> or something. Apparently, <em>flat function calls with literal arguments is what interactive program usage is all about.</em></p>
<p>I'm not saying that I'm going to use Tcl as the extension language of my next self-made lovecraftian toolchain (I was thinking more along the lines of doing that one in D and using D as my scripting language, 'cause it compiles fast enough and it's apparently high-level enough). I haven't thought enough about this, but the grotesque escaping/quoting in Tcl still freaks me out; I don't want to <em>program</em> like that. All I'm saying is that I like the <em>interactive</em> part. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short code matters a lot; short interactive commands matter <strong>much</strong> more.</li>
<li>An interactive command language must be a real language (loops, functions and all).</li>
<li>Tcl allows for the shortest commands and it's a real language. I'm <em>fascinated</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Allow me to elaborate.</p>
<p><strong>Short code vs short commands</strong></p>
<p>Lots of people have noticed that keeping your code short is extremely important. More surprisingly, many people fail to notice this, probably because "1 line is better than 5" doesn't sound that convincing. OK, think about 100K lines vs 500K and you'll get the idea. Oh, there are also those dirty Perl/shell one-liners that make one doubt about this. I've known a Bastard Programmer that used 2K bash one-liners as his weapon of choice. OK then, so the actual rule must be "short code is good unless it's written by a bastard". But it's the same core idea.</p>
<p>So we have the Architect type, who loves lots of classes which delegate work to each other, and we have the Enlightened type, who wants to write and read less. And the Enlightened type can rant and rave all day how Python, or Ruby, or Lisp make it oh-so-easy to define data structure literals, or to factor out stuff using meta-programming, or some other thing an Architect just never gets. And I'm all with it.</p>
<p>And then we have interactive shells. And in Python it's <code>doit("xx","yy")</code>. And in Lisp it's <code>(doit "xx" "yy")</code>, or <code>(doit :xx :yy)</code>, or <code>(doit xx yy)</code> if you make it a macro. And in Ruby it's <code>doit :xx :yy</code>, if you use symbols and omit parens. And that's about as good as you can get without using your own parser as in <code>doit "xx yy"</code>, which can suck in the (more rare) case when you do need to evaluate expressions before passing parameters, and doesn't completely remove overhead. Also note how all these languages use (), which makes you press Shift, instead of [] which doesn't. Ruby and Perl let you omit (), …</p></div></div>

September 5, 2020 | https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-4/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-4/">archive.org</a>

            <p><em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">first</a></em> – <em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-3/">previous</a></em></p>

<p>Welcome back to the “Compiling a Lisp” series. Last time, we finished adding
the rest of the constants as tagged pointer immediates. Since it’s not very
useful to have only values (no way to operate on them), we’re going to add some
<em>primitive unary functions</em>.</p>

<p>“Primitive” means here that they are built into the compiler, so we won’t
actually compile the call to an assembly procedure call. This is also called a
<em>compiler intrinsic</em>. “Unary” means the functions will take only one argument.
“Function” is a bit of a misnomer because these functions won’t be real values
that you can pass around as variables. You’ll only be able to use them as
literal names in calls.</p>

<p>Though we’re still not adding a reader/parser, we can imagine the syntax for
this looks like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>integer?</span> <span>(</span><span>integer-&gt;char</span> <span>(</span><span>add1</span> <span>96</span><span>)))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Today we also tackle <em>nested</em> function calls and subexpressions.</p>

<p>Adding function calls will require adding a new compiler datastructure, an
addition to the AST, but <em>not</em> to the compiled code. The compiled code will
still only know about the immediate types.</p>

<p>Ghuloum proposes we add the following functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>add1</code>, which takes an integer and adds 1 to it</li>
  <li><code>sub1</code>, which takes an integer and subtracts 1 from it</li>
  <li><code>integer-&gt;char</code>, which takes an integer and converts it into a character
(like <code>chr</code> in Python)</li>
  <li><code>char-&gt;integer</code>, which takes a character and converts it into an integer
(like <code>ord</code> in Python)</li>
  <li><code>null?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is <code>nil</code> and false
otherwise</li>
  <li><code>zero?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is <code>0</code> and false
otherwise</li>
  <li><code>not</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is <code>false</code> and false
otherwise</li>
  <li><code>integer?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is an integer and
false otherwise</li>
  <li><code>bool?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is a boolean and
false otherwise</li>
</ul>

<p>The functions <code>add1</code>, <code>sub1</code>, and the <code>char</code>/<code>integer</code> conversion functions
will be our first real experience dealing with object encoding in the compiled
code. What fun!</p>

<p>The implementations for <code>null?</code>, <code>zero?</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>integer</code>?, and <code>bool?</code> are so
similar that I am only going to reproduce one or two in this post. The rest
will be visible at
<a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/tekknolagi.github.com/blob/3d956655e48a124e828a8847282caa71b1c8b63f/assets/code/lisp/compiling-unary.c">assets/code/lisp/compiling-unary.c</a>.</p>

<p>In order to implement these functions, we’ll also need some more instructions
than <code>mov</code> and <code>ret</code>. Today we’ll add:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>add</code></li>
  <li><code>sub</code></li>
  <li><code>shl</code></li>
  <li><code>shr</code></li>
  <li><code>or</code></li>
  <li><code>and</code></li>
  <li><code>cmp</code></li>
  <li><code>setcc</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Because the implementations of <code>shl</code>, <code>shr</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>and</code> are so
straightforward — just like <code>mov</code>, really — I’ll also omit them from the
post. The implementations of <code>add</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>cmp</code>, and <code>setcc</code> are more
interesting.</p>

<h3 id="the-fundamental-data-structure-of-lisp">The fundamental data structure of Lisp</h3>

<p>Pairs, also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons">cons cells</a>,
two-tuples, and probably other things too, are the fundamental data structure
of Lisp. At least the original Lisp. Nowadays we have fancy structures like
vectors, too.</p>

<p>Pairs are a container for precisely two other objects. I’ll call them <code>car</code> and
<code>cdr</code> for historical<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and consistency reasons, but you can call them
whatever you like. Regardless of name, they could be represented as a C struct
like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Pair</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>car</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>cdr</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Pair</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is useful for holding pairs of objects (think coordinates, complex
numbers, …) but it is also incredibly useful for making linked lists. Linked
lists in Lisp are comprised of a <code>car</code> holding an object and the <code>cdr</code> holding
another list. Eventually the last <code>cdr</code> holds <code>nil</code>, signifying the end of the
list. Take a look at this handy diagram.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bernsteinbear.com/assets/img/lisp/03_lists_cons.svg">
  <figcaption>Fig. 1 - Cons cell list, courtesy of Wikipedia.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This represents the list <code>(list 42 69 613)</code>, which can also be denoted <code>(cons
42 (cons 69 (cons 613 nil)))</code>.</p>

<p>We’ll use these lists to represent the syntax trees for Lisp, so we’ll need to
implement pairs to compile list programs.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-pairs">Implementing pairs</h3>

<p>In previous posts we implemented the immediate types the same way in the
compiler and in the compiled code. I originally wrote this post doing the same
thing: manually laying out object offsets myself, reading and writing from
objects manually. The motivation was to get you familiar with the memory
layout in the compiled code, but ultimately it ended up being too much content
too fast. We’ll get to memory layouts when we start allocating pairs in the
compiled code.</p>

<p>In the compiler we’re going to use C structs instead of manual memory layout.
This makes the code a little bit easier to read. We’ll still tag the pointers,
though.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>kPairTag</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x1</span><span>;</span>        <span>// 0b001</span>
<span>const</span> <span>uword</span> <span>kHeapTagMask</span> <span>=</span> <span>((</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>0x7</span><span>);</span>  <span>// 0b000...0111</span>
<span>const</span> <span>uword</span> <span>kHeapPtrMask</span> <span>=</span> <span>~</span><span>kHeapTagMask</span><span>;</span> <span>// 0b1111...1000</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This adds the pair tag and some masks. As we noted in the previous posts, the
heap object tags are all in the lowest three bits of the pointer. We can mask
those out using this handy utility function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>uword</span> <span>Object_address</span><span>(</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>obj</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>obj</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>kHeapPtrMask</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll need to use this whenever we want to actually access a struct member.
Speaking of struct members, here’s the definition of <code>Pair</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Pair</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>car</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>cdr</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Pair</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And here are some functions for allocating and manipulating the <code>Pair</code> struct,
to keep the implementation details hidden:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_heap_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>tag</span><span>,</span> <span>uword</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There a couple important things to note.</p>

<p>First, <code>AST_heap_alloc</code> very intentionally zeroes out the memory it allocates.
If the members were left uninitialized, it might be possible to read off a
struct member that had an invalid pointer in <code>car</code> or <code>cdr</code>. If we
zero-initialize it, the member pointers represent the object <code>0</code> by default.
Nothing will crash.</p>

<p>Second, we keep moving our <code>ASTNode</code> pointers through <code>AST_as_pair</code>. This
function has two purposes: catch invalid uses (via the <code>assert</code> that the object
is indeed a <code>Pair</code>) and also mask out the lower bits. Otherwise we’d have to do
the masking in every operation individually.</p>

<p>Third, I abstracted out the <code>AST_heap_alloc</code> so we don’t expose the <code>calloc</code>
function everywhere. This allows us to later swap out the allocator for
something more intelligent, like a bump allocator, an arena allocator, etc.</p>

<p>And since memory allocated must eventually be freed, there’s a freeing function
too:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>AST_heap_free</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>AST_is_heap_object</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_is_pair</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>AST_heap_free</span><span>(</span><span>AST_pair_car</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>));</span>
    <span>AST_heap_free</span><span>(</span><span>AST_pair_cdr</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>));</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>free</span><span>((</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>Object_address</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This assumes that each <code>ASTNode*</code> owns the references to all of its members. So
<strong>don’t borrow references</strong> to share between objects. If you need to store a
reference to an object, <strong>make sure you own it</strong>. Otherwise you’ll get a double
free. In practice this shouldn’t bite us too much because each program is one
big tree.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-symbols">Implementing symbols</h3>

<p>We also need symbols! I mean, we could try mapping all the functions we need to
integers, but that wouldn’t be very fun. Who wants to try and debug a program
crashing on <code>function#67</code>? Not me. So let’s add a datatype that can represent
names of things.</p>

<p>As above, we’ll need to tag the pointers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>kSymbolTag</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x5</span><span>;</span>      <span>// 0b101</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then our struct definition.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Symbol</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>word</span> <span>length</span><span>;</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>cstr</span><span>[];</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Symbol</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ve chosen this variable-length object representation because it’s similar to
how we’re going to allocate symbols in assembly and the mechanism in C isn’t so
gnarly. This struct indicates that the memory layout of a <code>Symbol</code> is a length
field immediately followed by that number of bytes in memory. Note that having
this variable array in a struct is a <strong>C99 feature</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you don’t have C99 or don’t like this implementation, that’s fine. Just
store a <code>char*</code> and allocate another object for that string.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You could also opt to not store the length <em>at all</em> and instead NUL-terminate
it. This has the advantage of not dealing with variable-length arrays (it’s
just a tagged <code>char*</code>) but has the disadvantage of an <code>O(n)</code> length lookup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we can add our <code>Symbol</code> allocator:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Symbol</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_as_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>);</span>

<span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_new_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>word</span> <span>data_length</span> <span>=</span> <span>strlen</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// for NUL</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span> <span>=</span> <span>AST_heap_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>kSymbolTag</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>Symbol</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>data_length</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Symbol</span> <span>*</span><span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>AST_as_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>);</span>
  <span>s</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>length</span> <span>=</span> <span>data_length</span><span>;</span>
  <span>memcpy</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>cstr</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>data_length</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>node</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See how we have to manually specify the size we want. It’s a little fussy, but
it works.</p>

<p>Storing the NUL byte or not is up to you. It saves one byte per string if you
don’t, but it makes printing out strings in the debugger a bit of a pain since
you can’t just treat them like normal C strings.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some Lisp implementations use a <em>symbol table</em> to ensure that symbols
allocated with equivalent C-string values return <em>the same pointer</em>. This
allows the implementations to test for symbol equality by testing pointer
equality. I think we can sacrifice a bit of memory and runtime speed for
implementation simplicity, so I’m not going to do that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s add the rest of the utility functions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>bool</span> <span>AST_is_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>((</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>node</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>kHeapTagMask</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>kSymbolTag</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>Symbol</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_as_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>assert</span>…</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

    <p>This was originally posted on my personal blog in 2012.  It's still highly relevent today.</p>

<p>Who this is for: developers who have an idea.</p>

<p>Why you should read it: so you don’t waste your life by building something nobody wants.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make: I’m 35, and until last year, I started building companies by creating a product.</p>

<p>Last year, when starting SocialWOD, my biz partner Ryan refused to write code without first talking to 20+ customers and getting commitments to pay us money for a solution to a well-defined problem of theirs.</p>

<p>Having gone down the “build first” path enough without significant success, I was up for trying a new approach. Conceptually it seemed to make sense that we’d be able to better solve our customers’ problems if we understood their problems better.</p>

<p>To boot, we decided not to build until we had verbal financial commitments from customers for our proposed solution.</p>

<p>The result? <strong>We were able to charge money from day one for a two-screen CRUD app. We were able to do so because we had honed in on a specific problem worth paying for, and we had financial commitments before we wrote a single line of app code.</strong></p>

<p>Read on for some of the hard-earned lessons that’ll help you grow your biz.</p>
      <h2 id="dont-build-first">
        
        
          Don’t build first <a href="#dont-build-first">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Building first puts you at a disadvantage. Here’s why:</p>

<p>Your job as an entrepreneur is to increase the odds that your business will succeed. Put another way, your job is to reduce the risks that prevent your venture from succeeding.</p>

<p>There are several types of risk that can kill your company.</p>

<p>Big ones include (but aren’t limited to):</p>

<p>– Team (are <em>we</em> the right people to execute)
– Market (do people want to buy it) ← usually the biggest risk
– Technology (can we build it) ← most hackers start here. Oops.</p>

<p>I’m gonna talk about why most hackers start reducing the technology risk (by building a product) when they should start by reducing the market risk.</p>

<p>And I’m going to give you a script you can use in interviews to learn more about the market side of your biz.</p>

      </h2>

<p>If you’re a developer, writing code is the fun part.  Code can be bent to your will to do what you want it to do. You know when it works, and when it doesn’t. It’s clean.</p>

<p>People have an innate desire for control, and code can be controlled.</p>

<p>Code is your comfort zone, so it’s what you (and I!) fall back on.</p>

<p>But since you can build almost certainly build the solution, it’s almost always the wrong place to start.</p>

      </h3>

<blockquote>“A hacker who has learned what to make, and not just how to make, is extraordinarily powerful.” – Paul Graham</blockquote>

<p>You should start by understanding your market.</p>

<p>This is vague. More precisely, you should understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who your customers are</li>
  <li>the specific problem your potential customers have</li>
  <li>why this is a problem for them</li>
  <li>how painful this problem is for them</li>
  <li>what happens when the problem is not solved</li>
  <li>how they are currently solving this problem, and what else they’ve tried</li>
  <li>how much this problem, when solved, is worth to them</li>
  <li>how they find out about solutions to this problem</li>
  <li>the words your customers to describe this problem</li>
</ul>

<p>The best way to do this is by talking to real live people: picking up the phone, going out to coffee, etc, asking good questions, and listening.</p>

<p>For most hackers, talking to customers to figure out their unmet needs is scary, and always messier than code. It’s out of your comfort zone.</p>

<p>The rational response is “Righty-o! Talk to customers first – that makes sense.”</p>

<p>The emotional response is “Oh shit. Who should I talk to? What should I say? Won’t I just be better off building this feature?”</p>

<p>The way I overcome this emotional trauma is to think about the insights I’ve gleaned from talking to customers in the past, and more importantly: <strong>how much time and frustration these conversations have saved me. Hackers hate working on stuff nobody uses.</strong></p>

<p>Really, it’s simple: the fastest way to build something people want is to understand their problems. And the fastest way to understand their problems is to listen to what they have to say.</p>

<p>Here’s an template of an email we used at SocialWOD when referred to potential customers (we make software for CrossFit Gyms)</p>

<blockquote>Hi First_name,<p>

  <li>what happens when the problem is not solved</li>
  <li>how they are currently solving this problem, and what else they’ve tried</li>
  <li>how much this problem, when solved, is worth to them</li>
  <li>how they find out about solutions to this problem</li>
  <li>the words your customers to describe this problem</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s say you had an idea about product for movie theater owners that would pipe buttered popcorn (and other) smells into theaters to help drive concession sales.</p>

<p>Here’s the sort of questions I would ask a theater owner:</p>

<p>Q: Tell me about your business. What are your biggest problems? What keeps you up at night? Why?</p>

<p>Trying to learn:
What are the big problems they have in their biz? Why are they problems? What happens when those problems aren’t solved?</p>

<p>Q: What are the key metrics that drive your business?
Trying to learn: What are the key levers in their biz – concession dollars per ticket sold? Straight up ticket sales? etc. Is your solution potentially a must-have or a nice to have?</p>

<p>Q: (if they don’t mention concessions) What impact do concessions have on your business?
Trying to learn: Is your solution even potentially valuable to them? How much, or why not? (Make sure you understand this. Keep unpeeling the onion; make sure you understand this fully. Try not to make assumptions here.)</p>

<p>Q: Have you looked at anything to help you with this problem? How have they worked for you? Where did you find them?
Trying to learn: Learning what else is out there? Are those solutions working, or not? What distribution channels might you need to be in?</p>

<p>Q: I have some ideas about products that might be useful. Can I give you a 1-liner description and you tell me if we’re crazy or may be on to something?
Trying to learn: This is to get a sense of whether your idea may even be valuable to them… you don’t want to get into specifics really, just tease them and get high-level feedback.</p>
    
      <h2 id="also-ask">
        
        
          Also ask: <a href="#also-ask">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<ul>
  <li>Is it ok if I follow up as we develop our ideas? (I’ve never had anybody say no to this)</li>
  <li>Is there anybody else who you think we should speak to who have the same kinds of problems you do? (these are the people you call next)</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal with these interviews is to <em>listen</em> and <em>learn</em>, not to sell. Learn where you’re right, where you’re wrong, what words your customers use, what big problems they have, and how you can adapt your solution to solve those problems.</p>

<p>After a couple interviews you’ll be able to provide insight and become valuable to the people you’re speaking with, which makes you
even more trusted (“oh we just spoke to person XYZ at ABC corp… he was feeling the same pain, you’re not alone!” OR BETTER “just spoke to XYZ at ABC… he solved the problem you’re facing by doing 123”.)</p>

<p>And after 10-20 of these you’ll know a crap ton more about your market, and whether this is a problem even worth your time.</p>

<p>This process isn’t easy. But recurring themes will emerge that will help you hone in on a problem worth solving without writing a single line of code. The reason you do this first is because you need to do this whether you write code. You might as well do this <em>before</em> you spend a few months writing code, so you can figure out what to build.</p>

<p>Now that you better understand the problem and market, the next post will cover what you can do with that information (hint: it’s not “build the product”).</p>

	<p>I bet everybody knows this feeling when you get an interesting idea in your head, and 
you think – that is it! I need to do it! You start to dig into, but the first Google 
request shows that somebody has already implemented it. Bummer. I had one of those ideas
the other day.</p>

<p>Since around a year or a bit more, I am into running. For tracking my running time and 
routes I am using an application, of course. It is nice to look at some statistics. After
one of the runs, I looked at the route, and it reminded me of some figure or a drawing.
And then a thought came to me – what if we draw something  on a map while running using a 
GPS tracker?! Just imagine: a whole community running and sharing their routes!</p>

<p>My first deliberate attempt to draw during running was a letter “M“. It is supposed to be 
the first letter in either my wife’s name, or in the word “Metallica“. I’m not sure yet.</p>

<div>
	<figure>

	</figure>
</div>

<p>As it turned out, I am not the only one to come up with this idea. Drawing on a map with 
a GPS tracker is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_drawing">GPS Art</a>. It originated in 90s, and, of course, became more 
popular with a spread of mobile GPS devices. Check out hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gpsart&amp;src=typed_query">#gpsart</a>
on Twitter for inspiration.</p>

<p>The community also has its heroes. For example, the largest drawings on Earth belong to
Japanese artist Yasushi Takahashi. Here is a word “peace“… <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?hl=ja&amp;mid=1nDdvPvZtyeh0a6uOxGTu7rEzRqI&amp;ll=-3.81666561775622e-14%2C26.488384499999995&amp;z=2">60,794 km long</a>.</p>

<div>
	<figure>
		
			<img src="https://guzalexander.com/static/img/posts/gpsart_peace.png" alt="">
		
	</figure>
</div>

<p>And here is “Marry Me“ <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?hl=ja&amp;mid=1m8Sevf2iWZT83ax5x2q6n8P8tBY&amp;ll=38.29853440547071%2C137.199813859375&amp;z=6">over the whole Japan</a>.</p>

<div>
	<figure>
		
			<img src="https://guzalexander.com/static/img/posts/gpsart_marryme.jpg" alt="">
		
	</figure>
</div>

<p>You can check out more of his work at <a href="http://gpsdrawing.info/">http://gpsdrawing.info/</a>.</p>

<p>But anyway, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. So I guess I just go 
put my running shoes on and take a bunch of those single steps for now.</p>

						<p>Why do psychiatric conditions exist?</p>
<p>This question is both unsatisfyingly unanswered and incredibly important. Here we will consider some features of the over-century-long failure of psychiatry to explain mental disorders, before reviewing a theoretical framework which promises to explain these conditions in a way which is not only scientifically sound, but emancipating. The framework in question is evolutionary psychiatry, and its principle thinking is simple: if we use evolutionary theory to explain biology, then we should be using evolutionary theory to explain psychiatric disorder. If evolution was given proper attention and integrated into mainstream psychiatry, we would usher in a new era of understanding and treatment of psychiatric conditions.</p>
<p>Psychiatry is a practice with more than a chequered past, perpetrating horrors even in living memory: Sprees of lobotomising adults and children; purposefully inducing comas in schizophrenics, producing thrashing, spasming and salivating so bad that one psychiatrist reported the scene on a ward as alike to artist Gustave Dore’s depictions of hell; and the widespread demonisation of homosexuality justifying the electrocution and injection of homosexuals with nauseating drugs during slideshows of sexually attractive individuals of the same sex, hoping to train them into being sick at their own sexuality.</p>
<p>Advances in treatment over the decades have come more from the dismissal of old and harmful practices than the inception of new ones. As electrocution and nauseation were slowly recognised as both immoral and ineffective, we are now left with psychotherapies and pharmaceuticals of unreliable and underwhelming efficacy. Tens of billions of dollars and several decades of research have led to few new discoveries. Many drug developers have now left psychiatry for more easily understood and chemically pliable conditions of the body rather than the mind. Leaders in national mental health research have expressed dismay that so little progress has been made. Some research suggests that the burden of psychiatric illness might even be <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/acps.13083">worsening</a>, not lessening.</p>
<p>Psychiatric therapies have never been atheoretical – psychiatrists have always justified their treatments with some school of thought: Freudian psychodynamic theories placed blame on early childhood and subconscious urges; behaviourism justified the application of pain to try and train people out of wrongthink; and more recently, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315533279_Challenging_the_Narrative_of_Chemical_Imbalance_A_Look_at_the_Evidence">chemical imbalance theories</a> were used to advertise pharmaceuticals, despite the narrative of simple dopamine and serotonin dysfunctions having been <a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/debunking-two-chemical-imbalance-myths-again">long dismissed</a> in academic circles. Recent advances in genetics and neuroscience have provided more evidence and complexity, but no promising new theories. Psychiatry today can be considered <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mind-Fixers-Psychiatrys-Troubled-Biology/dp/0393071227">a discipline in crisis</a>, surviving only because psychological and pharmaceutical treatments are effective for some people, some of the time, and so we still need them. The way is open for a new paradigm in psychiatric theorising.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the conclusion of his first edition of <i>Origin of Species</i> in 1859, Charles Darwin prophesied: “In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.”</p>
<p>Darwin’s prophecy manifested itself in psychology around 100 years after his writing. Now, evolutionary psychology has become a common reference point for public discussion and academic research. Evolutionary psychiatry is a late follower, arising in the last years of the twentieth century alongside evolutionary medicine, its foundational work owing to Randolph Nesse, George Williams, John Price, and others.</p>
<p>Evolution by natural selection is the metatheory of biology, linking all species and all biological forms. The process of constant biological variation, reproduction and selection between forms leads to evolution of populations, explaining the form of our bodies and minds. Therefore, the logic of evolutionary medicine and psychiatry goes, evolutionary theory should also be referred to in explaining why our bodies and minds are vulnerable to disorder and disease. All biology is evolutionary, and psychiatry is biological, hence psychiatry should be understood in evolutionary terms. The lack of progress in understanding psychiatric disorders makes sense in this light, because mainstream psychiatry has been ignoring the key theory in biology.</p>
<p>Whilst the fundamental principles of evolutionary psychiatry have been defined, and important works <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Reasons-Bad-Feelings-Evolutionary-ebook/dp/B078VXFZCX">published</a>, there does not yet exist a dedicated evolutionary psychiatry university department or journal. In 2016, the first noteworthy institutional group dedicated to evolutionary psychiatry <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5046779/">was formed</a>, in the Evolutionary Psychiatry Special Interest Group (EPSIG) at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK. This slow start and long build up does not dissuade evolutionary psychiatrists from believing that, in the ever-less-distant future, this theoretical paradigm will be recognised as the way to truly start explaining mental disorder.</p>
<p>A unique advantage of evolutionary psychiatry is its ability to define disease and disorder upon an evolutionary concept of dysfunction. The current diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), the handbook of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), defines mental disorder as dysfunction, but then fails to specify what that means. This allows transparently unscientific activities. Most famously, in 1973, after gay rights protestors had stormed an APA meeting, psychiatrists had donned anonymising hoods and professed their personal homosexuality to a group of their fellows, and national progressive values became a little too loud to ignore, the APA called a vote to reconsider homosexuality’s status as a mental disorder. By a 58% majority, it was struck off.</p>
<p>Voting to decide whether a condition is a disease is not the sign of a mature science, yet to this day consensus alone is the deciding factor of whether a mind is deemed disorderly. Commonly prescribed disorder labels in use today, such as Borderline Personality Disorder, included in the DSM-III because of the vote of a dozen or so psychiatrists, have criteria <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27650639/">based primarily upon</a> single review papers with poor empirical evidence from the 1970’s – even the authors of that paper expected it to be backed up with further evidence before becoming part of canon. In the most recent edition, the DSM-5, ‘internet gaming disorder’ was suggested, justified by comparing online (but specifically excluding offline) gaming to drug and gambling addictions. An international consortium has since <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/add.12457">voted</a> clarifying its features. Evolutionary psychiatry can thankfully supersede this ambiguous line between order and disorder.</p>
<p>Unlike physics and chemistry, which describe things simply as they are, biological processes can be meaningfully considered to function or dysfunction. Biological traits evolved to increase reproductive success – that is their function. Eyes evolved to see, so eyes which cannot see are dysfunctional. Psychological and physical traits functioned to provide reproductive success to our ancestors, and where that function fails or is interrupted, there is dysfunction. Mental disorders can then be defined as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119125563.evpsych242">harmful dysfunctions</a> of the mind.</p>
<p>This analysis of function is inevitably historical (it concerns ancestral evolutionary function, not modern functioning) and so is difficult to ascertain in many cases, especially in psychology, and is complicated by the possibility of random processes of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/genetic-drift/">genetic drift</a>. Nevertheless, this reference to evolutionary function is the <i>only</i> way to define function by an objective biological process rather than relying solely on subjective norms and cultural values – or indeed a vote.</p>
<p>This unique theoretical strength has been followed up by work in evolutionary medicine and psychiatry identifying <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nesse/Articles/Nesse%20-%202015%20-%20Evolutionary%20Psychology%20and%20Mental%20Health.pdf">six reasons</a> why conditions we define as disorder or disease (of body or mind) persist in evolved creatures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Constraints on biological design, because evolution can only make alterations within a certain range.</li>
<li>Pathogens evolve, so we cannot evolve perfect immunity against them.</li>
<li>Design trade-offs and byproducts make perfection impossible.</li>
<li>Evolved defenses against disease and danger often induce harmful symptoms.</li>
<li>Selection is for reproductive success, not health, so we can evolve in ways which are debilitating if they allow us to reproduce more successfully.</li>
<li>Mismatch between evolved systems and modern environments lead to novel, harmful, reactions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of these six reasons, it’s important to note that the last four are the modern result of functioning rather than dysfunctioning processes. The idea that natural selection would only encourage perfect health is mistaken. It’s entirely possible for evolution to lead our bodies and minds into states which we now diagnose and treat as disorders or diseases.</p>
<p>Work in evolutionary psychiatry has considered <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29051086/">depression</a>, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/2019/1/1/5229271">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.longdom.org/open-access/hunters-in-a-farmers-world-adhd-and-hunter-gatherers-2332-0915-1000150.pdf">ADHD</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16005572/">OCD</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9875960/">eating disorders</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23881888/">substance use disorders</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674370304800107">schizophrenia</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230603205_In_cold_blood_The_evolution_of_psychopathy">psychopathy</a>, and many more disorders through the evolutionary framework. Several can be explained as mental tendencies related to adaptations which were advantageous for our hunter-gatherer ancestors.</p>
<p>For instance, some are mismatched psychological systems which are exposed to over-stimulation in the modern environment, becoming the biggest causes of abuse, ruination and early death in developed countries. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23881888/">Alcoholism and drug abuse</a> manipulate natural chemical pathways which exist for evolutionarily advantageous reasons; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25749980/">obesity</a> by overeating is caused by natural desires for sweet and fatty foods; and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15577272/">gambling addiction</a> is likely linked to a history of continuously searching for scarce high-calorie food and other risky but rewarding endeavours.</p>

<p>After years of using LibreOffice, I’ve now switched over to ONLYOFFICE and recommend it over any other office suite on Linux. Now I know a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a> enthusiasts will be unhappy about the idealistic part of the recommendation, but hear me out.</p>



<h2><strong>Top notch Microsoft Office compatibility</strong></h2>



<p>I’m a<a href="https://jatan.space/"> science writer</a> who uses Linux because it just functions better for me than Windows or macOS and because I’m an open source enthusiast. Given my profession, I have to frequently collaborate with people on other operating systems who almost always use either Microsoft Office or Google Docs. After three years of trying, I can tell you that LibreOffice just doesn’t cut it. Either me or the other person will lose some formatting in the documents at some point. And as a document travels from one computer to another, things quickly become a mess.</p>



<p>That is when I found ONLYOFFICE. In over a year of using it, I’ve sent ONLYOFFICE created documents, spreadsheets and presentations to people using Microsoft Office, iWork, smartphone editors, Google Docs, etc., did multiple to and fro edits and it hasn’t broken <em>a single thing</em>! This is something I cannot ignore as a writer and my experience attests to ONLYOFFICE’s claim of top notch Microsoft Office compatibility.</p>



<h2><strong>More features</strong></h2>



<p>Beyond the excellent compatibility with Microsoft Office files, there are other features that make ONLYOFFICE a better alternative to LibreOffice, WPS or any other Linux office suite that I’ve used.</p>



<ul><li>All documents open in the same window as multiple tabs and you can manipulate them just like you’d in a browser. This is amazing.</li><li>Can connect to Nextcloud or OwnCloud for online and collaborative features like Google Docs.</li><li>Unlike LibreOffice, ONLYOFFICE has adequately functional and maintained mobile &amp; tablet apps on both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onlyoffice.documents">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onlyoffice-documents/id944896972">iOS</a>.</li><li>Has Ribbon UI, so in my opinion things are easier to find on ONLYOFFICE compared to LibreOffice’s <strong>“Default”</strong> UI.</li><li>Open source, making it more trustworthy than WPS Office and other proprietary solutions on Linux.</li><li>Available on Windows and macOS too if you don’t want to use Microsoft Office or simply can’t afford its licensing fee.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Go get it</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=200" alt="" srcset="https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=200 200w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=400 400w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"></figure></div>



<p>ONLYOFFICE is officially available to <a href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/download-desktop.aspx">download</a> on Linux as a Deb, RPM, Flatpak and a Snap package so you can use it on any Linux distro you like!</p>



<p>I hope I’ve convinced you to give ONLYOFFICE a shot and see if it solves your problems. If it doesn’t, you can file bugs and feature requests on <a href="https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DesktopEditors">their GitHub repository</a>. In my experience, they’ve been very open to feature suggestions and prompt on bug fixes.</p>



<h2><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>My ideals for FOSS dwindled swiftly when I had to make something work in the real world. Not everyone can use everything truly FOSS all the time. At least ONLYOFFICE is open source (<a href="https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DesktopEditors/blob/master/LICENSE">AGPL-3.0, specifically</a>) and not proprietary like Microsoft Office. Bottomline, ONLYOFFICE is a fantastic office suite that I hope more people discover.</p>

Of course you do! And chances are, you have been using it — or another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What You See Is What You Get (<strong>WYSIWYG</strong>) word processor</a>&nbsp;(e.g., <em>OpenOffice.org Writer</em>,&nbsp;<em>Google Docs</em>)<em> —&nbsp;</em>all along over these years.</p><p>And here is something potentially unpleasant to the ears: what if we were to object that <em>sometimes</em>, they could just be the poor tools designed with the wrong philosophy in mind? Or that they are built primarily for general usage, and is thus ill-suited for <strong>technical publishing</strong> at a wider scale?</p><p>And while these text editors are undoubtedly highly powerful and accessible, there are also 6 <strong>critical flaws</strong> that they tend to suffer from. These range from the ones that may have been annoying you in the past — to the subtler ones that you might not even have been aware of.</p><h3><span id="File_Compatibility"></span><a id="compatibility"></a><a href="#toc">File Compatibility</a><span></span></h3><p>Quick question: How do we open a doc/docx file? With <em>Microsoft Word</em> of course! (or a variant that accepts these filetypes). In other words, opening a <em>Microsoft Word</em> file requires a <em>Microsoft-Word-like</em> application. Try opening these files with basic text editors such as&nbsp;<em>NotePad</em>&nbsp;(or <em>TextEdit</em> in Mac)<em>&nbsp;</em>and see what happens: you’d probably get a bunch of weird and unintelligible symbols that just make no sense!</p><p>In addition to being text-unfriendly, converting these filetypes to other formats — or even just older formats — could very well&nbsp;jeopardize the&nbsp;<strong>formatting</strong>, <strong>alignment</strong>, or other specifications in the document. This would then require another round of judicious manual correction on your own, which could very well be somewhat painful or infuriating. In fact, there have been many recurring episodes of <em>file conversion disasters</em> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#Cross-version_compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">history of <em>Microsoft Word</em></a>&nbsp;(in the olden days at least).</p><h3 id="cost"><span id="Proprietariness_and_Cost"></span><a href="#toc">Proprietariness and Cost</a><span></span></h3><p>How much does a proper <em>Microsoft Word</em><sup>®</sup> costs? Well, here a picture is worth a thousand words:<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/ms-word-price.jpg" alt="The Price of Microsoft Word 2013 - Microsoft Store" width="1024" height="495" title="ms word price">Or if you prefer subscription plans for <em>Office 365</em>, which seems at least a bit cheaper on the surface:<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/office-365-price.jpg" alt="The different subscription plans and prices for Office 365" width="1024" height="719" title="office 365 price">As powerful as word processors are, the <strong>proprietariness</strong> of document preparation applications, while many times justifiable, can hinder the democratization of the publication of creative and scholarly work — a right previously reserved to the elites, and often associated with the publishing industry even decades ago.</p><p>And of course, there are also the <strong>free</strong> / <strong>open-source</strong> variants of <em>Microsoft Word</em> such as <em><a href="https://www.openoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenOffice.org</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LibreOffice</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NeoOffice</a></em> (for Mac OS X) or even <em><a href="https://www.google.ca/docs/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Docs</a></em>. The problem — if there is one — is that they invariably suffer from the typical weaknesses exhibited by a standard WYSIWYG word processor, such as the limitations when it comes to feature extension, and the general clumsiness of the design interface.</p><h3><span id="Unsophisticated_Typography_and_Alignment"></span><a id="typo"></a><a href="#toc">Unsophisticated Typography and Alignment</a><span></span></h3><p>While traditional WYSIWYG editors provide an enormous amount of choices in terms of fonts, font sizes and colors, documents produced using those editors tend to lack the <strong>typographical machineries</strong> to make them visually pleasing and satisfying. For one, the texts in these editors tend to be typeset in low resolution, with usually little to no care on minute ornamentations (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ligature</a>) and spacing/alignment details (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphenation_algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hyphenation</a>) that are commonly observed in professionally produced journals and printed books.</p><p>Poor typography aside. With the traditional WYSIWYG word processors, the end of the lines are — more often than not — poorly aligned. And even if a paragraph is fully-justified, there is usually a lack of <strong>consistency</strong> in the interword spaces — which in turn could make the document look even messier than usual.</p><p>And if you want to produce elaborated <strong>formulas</strong> and <strong>equations</strong> in its full glory, you are pretty much out of luck. After all, while the standard WYSIWYG editors usually allow for the insertion of <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/greek-hebrew-latin-symbols/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greek letters</a> and rudimentary equations, in more likelihood, you’d probably find yourself doing a lot of clicking and hand-and-eye coordination — often with very little in return…</p><figure id="attachment_1027" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1027"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/latex-sample.png" alt="Professional Typesetting - A Sample of What Can Be Achieved In LaTeX" width="915" height="576" title="latex sample"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1027">Try to do this in Microsoft Word, and you’ll soon find yourself in deep despair and fury.</figcaption></figure><p>Some more words of caution: if you run too many <strong>equations</strong>,&nbsp;<b>text boxes</b>&nbsp;or <strong>figures</strong> in the same <em>Word</em> document, you could very well risk of <a href="http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/latex_advocacy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">having your computer run out of memory</a> and freeze to an infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Screen Of Death</a> (BSOD).</p><h3><span id="Inefficient_Formatting_Features"></span><a id="formatting"></a><a href="#toc">Inefficient&nbsp;Formatting Features</a><span></span></h3><p>There is of course no doubt that <em>Microsoft Word</em> and its competitors has evolved to become some formidable text editors&nbsp;over the years. For example, in the newer <em>Microsoft&nbsp;Word</em> (e.g., <em>Word 95</em> and onward), users can determine the position of the images via a simple and intuitive <strong>drag-and-drop</strong>.</p><p>But as it turns out, this intuitiveness can also be problematic at times. as the position of the images can now be altered at the slightest mouse clicks and keyboard taps. And when that happens, the image position would need to be readjusted again — usually with very little feedback as to where the image would land after the readjustment ends…</p><figure id="attachment_1030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1030"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/ms-word-image-misalignment.jpg" alt="A Typical Microsoft Word Image Misalignment" width="321" height="185" title="ms word image misalignment"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1030">“Ahh!!! What have I done to deserve this?”</figcaption></figure><p>And if you manage to integrate some <strong>text boxes</strong> smoothly into the paragraphs, similar formatting issues could then resurface again: you would drag a text box to an intended position, and it would slip away to another position or simply disobey your command. And if you’re really unlucky, it might even disappear from the document altogether, making any attempt of recovery very difficult — if not impossible.</p><h3><span id="Numbering_Chaos"></span><a id="numbering"></a><a href="#toc">Numbering Chaos</a><span></span></h3><p>In a structured document with a large list of <strong>items</strong> such as chapters, captions and references, it usually makes good sense that we number the items — so that we can keep track of them in a fairly simple manner.</p><p>And while it’s certainly possible to do the numbering manually (which admittedly is rather intuitive), this can actually become increasingly difficult — as the number of items increases.</p><p>Moreover, what if we <em>accidentally</em> numbered Chapter 13 as Chapter 12? Or that we later decide to introduce a <em>new section</em> in between Section 5 and Section 6? Well, that can only mean one thing — that our numbering is all messed up and that it needs to be redone all over again!</p><p>But&nbsp;of course, the point here is not <em>just</em> about the chapters and sections, as the same numbering issue could apply to&nbsp;<strong>bibliographical references</strong>, <strong>tables</strong>, <strong>images</strong>, <strong>definitions</strong> and <strong>equations</strong> (if you manage to make some that is!).</p><p>To be fair, <em>Microsoft Word</em> does support <strong>automatic numbering adjustment</strong> in some cases, but it does so at the cost of bringing in more confusion and complexity. Here’s how <a href="http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Numbering/WordsNumberingExplained.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsft Word MVP John McGhie</a> puts it:</p><blockquote><p>Numbering in Word is difficult to understand because Word attempts to hide “<strong>complexity</strong>” from us. In many cases, it provides insufficient detail in the explanation of features. Regrettably, a simplistic explanation does not help understanding of a complex subject. It fills our heads with loose ends, which makes the problem worse!</p></blockquote><p>And of course, the issue runs deeper than simply the numbering of the modules themselves. For example, let’s say that you referred to page 91 where you elaborated a bit on the <em>Keynesian theory of economics</em>, but later edited the text so that the same content now appears on <em>page 87</em>. Well, that’s not a good news, because it means that you would have to change your <strong>reference page</strong> now from 91 to 87!</p><p>And there is more: imagine doing that for <em>hundreds</em> of <strong>page references</strong> for equations, sections, chapters, paragraphs, tables, figures, footnotes and citations… Not exactly a human-friendly task if we may add!</p><h3><span id="Flowery_/_Messy_Graphics_Over_Image_Quality,_Speed_and_Simplicity"></span><a id="graphic"></a><a href="#toc">Flowery / Messy Graphics Over Image Quality, Speed and Simplicity</a><span></span></h3><p>While&nbsp;WYSIWYG text editors provide an intuitive graphical user interface by displaying, <em>in real-time</em>, how the document will look like when it’s printed, in some instances, it has also been argued that it’s this overemphasis on elaborated graphics that forces traditional WYSIWYG editors to water down its <strong>display resolution&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>typesetting quality</strong>. For example, Alain Cottrell, a strong proponent of $ \TeX$, <a href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">puts it this way</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The typesetting algorithm employed by WYSIWYG word processor sacrifices <strong>quality</strong> to the speed required for the setting and resetting of the user’s input in real time. The final product is greatly inferior to that of a real typesetting program.</p></blockquote><figure id="attachment_1066" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1066"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/appearance-substance.jpg" alt="Microsoft Word - Appearance Over Substance?" width="281" height="123" title="appearance substance"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1066">Microsoft Word’s Document Output</figcaption></figure><p>In addition, as the demand for more powerful features and functionalities grow over the years,&nbsp;there is a tendency — for developers of traditional WYSIWYG editors —&nbsp;to sacrifice&nbsp;the cleanness of <strong>user interface</strong> (UI) by featuring&nbsp;an excessive amount of friendly icons, menus, boxes and bars into the editor’s main window. As a result, the users would find themselves performing&nbsp;<em>repetitive mouse clicks&nbsp;</em>and an unnatural amount of fine hand-and-eye coordinations — just to get to some feature which could have been implemented in a more energy-efficient manner.</p><p>What’s worse. The decision to opt for a more <em>graphical</em> — rather than a more <em>minimalist</em> user interface — would eventually take a toll on the <strong>speed</strong> of the text editors, putting additional demands on the computer’s memory and graphic card while making the installation larger and longer as the year progresses.</p><h2><span id="Introducing_LaTeX_and_its_Strengths"></span><a id="latex"></a><a href="#toc">Introducing LaTeX and its&nbsp;Strengths</a><span></span></h2><p>As we have seen, WYSIWYG text editors operate on the philosophy of an intuitive, <strong>output-editing graphical user interface</strong> — one which is easy to maneuver, but which could make document preparation tedious and ineffective for the large-scale tasks with higher professional demands.</p><p>And because of that, we now turn our attention to a different kind of document …</p></section></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>(Updated 2020-09-06 with pointers to related work and a bit more explanation)</p>

<p>This is a bit of a followup to <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/personal/2018/05/10/toward-gpu-json-parsing.html">Towards GPGPU JSON parsing</a>. That proposed a rather roundabout way to parallelize a simple parsing task. Having had more GPU programming experience under my belt, I don’t expect that particular approach to work well, but it did suggest that parallelism exists in the problem.</p>

<p>This post is a writeup of a new idea, but with a caution, no implementation. It probably contains some mistakes, and maybe the idea is flawed. But if it holds up, I think it’s an exciting line of research on how to port sequential algorithms to GPU.</p>

<p>For this post, I’m going to pose an even more simplified version of the problem: for each open bracket, record the index of the parent in the parse tree, and for each close bracket, the index of the corresponding open bracket.</p>

<p>This is a simple sequential program:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>stack</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>None</span><span>]</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>token</span> <span>in</span> <span>input</span><span>:</span>
        <span>result</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>stack</span><span>[</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>stack</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>]</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>token</span> <span>==</span> <span>'['</span><span>:</span>
            <span>stack</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span>
        <span>elif</span> <span>token</span> <span>==</span> <span>']'</span><span>:</span>
            <span>stack</span><span>.</span><span>pop</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To follow the running example from the JSON post, assume the input <code>[[][[][][[]]][][]]</code>. The result is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>index 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
input [  [  ]  [  [  ]  [  ]  [  [  ]  ]  ]  [  ]  [  ]  ]
value -  0  1  0  3  4  3  6  3  8  9  8  3  0 13  0 15  0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Can it be parallelized? It’s challenging to see how, as there are dependencies on previous state. Further, the state itself has unbounded size. It can be O(n); a pathological case is a million open brackets followed by a million close. In practice, depending on the workloads, we might expect more modest nesting depth, but ideally we’d like an algorithm that can handle all cases at least reasonably well.</p>

<p>Maybe we can do something. To longtime readers of my blog (and the “rope science” series before that), it will be no surprise I’ll try to use monoids.</p>

<p>So let’s turn this sequential program into a monoid. If I had a time portal, I’d lens forward in time and use the handy automated tool that some enterprising PhD student will has done by then. But, failing that, I’ll do it in my head.</p>

<p>The monoid is basically a sequence of pops followed by a sequence of pushes. Since the pop operations (in this case) don’t have a payload, they can be represented simply as a count. So the monoid is the pair <code>(n_pops, elements)</code>. The primitive for push is <code>(0, [element])</code>, and for pop it’s <code>(1, [])</code>. The monoid operation is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>combine</span><span>(</span><span>m1</span><span>,</span> <span>m2</span><span>):</span>
    <span>n1</span><span>,</span> <span>s1</span> <span>=</span> <span>m1</span>
    <span>n2</span><span>,</span> <span>s2</span> <span>=</span> <span>m2</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>n2</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s1</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>n1</span> <span>+</span> <span>n2</span> <span>-</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s1</span><span>),</span> <span>s2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>n1</span><span>,</span> <span>s1</span><span>[:</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s1</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>n2</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>s2</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And of course, the identity element is <code>(0, [])</code>. One intuition for this monoid is that it represents a function from the state at the beginning of a sequence of tokens to the state at the end. If it indeed computes this function for arbitrary subsequences, then it it follows that it’s a monoid from the fact that function composition is associative.</p>

<p>Running scan, or generalized <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/gpu/2020/04/30/prefix-sum.html">prefix sum</a>, on this monoid, will result in the desired result at the top of the stack, i.e. the last element of the sequence in the monoid.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Show that this monoid is associative.</p>

<p>I do believe that an automated tool for translating these kinds of simple sequential programs is possible, and that there’s a theory behind it that illuminates ways in which monoids do and do not compose. Some composition is possible, for example you could fairly easily extend this idea so that each child knows its sequence number relative to its siblings. To do that, blend in the “counting monoid,” which is just integer addition.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Extend the monoid to handle sequence numbers.</p>

<p>If we had a bound on stack depth, we’d be pretty well set. The problem is the unbounded case. My original thinking was to have a window of (let’s say size k) elements, and each pass would handle a slice of the stack of size k. I think this can be made to work, but at heart it requires a number of passes proportional to stack depth, so in the worst case O(n^2).</p>

<p>My new idea is to retain the single pass scan, but use a purpose-built data structure to represent the stack. At the top is a window of k elements, then after that is a linked list (or perhaps a linked list of chunks; honestly I haven’t worked through all the implications, much less actually implemented and done performance measurement).</p>

<p>The combine operation tries to fit the new combined sequence in the window (up to a shared link, which it can just retain). But if it overflows, then it must allocate, most likely using an atomic bump allocator into global memory, as is often done in piet-gpu.</p>

<h2 id="performance-analysis">Performance analysis</h2>

<p>To do a <em>real</em> performance analysis would require an implementation, but it should be possible to reason about it a bit.</p>

<p>Clearly performance will be excellent if stack depth is shallow. The rate at which the linked list will be invoked will depend on the workload, and also the parallelism patterns. It’s worth noting that if the scan is run sequentially, then the linked list operations will always be cheap. This is because the concatenation at the heart of the monoid operation is <em>asymmetrical</em> when using a linked list - a large sequence on the left is cheap when the sequence on the right is small, but not the other way around. When running the scan purely sequentially, the monoid on the right is always of size 1 at most.</p>

<p>And the decoupled lookback implementation of scan, which is state of the art, runs essentially sequentially at large granularity; it just tries to exploit as much parallelism as the hardware provides at smaller granularity. Even with extremly deep nesting, it should build and retain a linked list of the stack as it scans, with a relatively smaller window for the part of the problem currently in flight.</p>

<p>There is another reason to be optimistic about performance. While the bandwidth of communication between partitions scales with the window size, that’s not necessarily true for processing <em>within</em> a partition. Putting aside for a moment the relatively challenging problem of implementing an efficient GPU kernel (which by necessity would exploit SIMD parallelism), consider a decoupled look-back implementation running on a more traditional multicore CPU, where each thread is sequential.</p>

<p>Basically, the first pass runs the traditional, sequential stack algorithm, with the modification that some of the input stack might not be available. At the end is the monoid, with “n_pops” being a count of the number of times that happened, and the sequence containing all the elements pushed inside that partition.</p>

<p>In the decoupled lookback phase, this monoid is published for consumption of partitions to the right, and the partition also computes the aggregate from partitions to the left. The cost of the monoid operations in this phase <em>will</em> be proportional to the size of the window, but keep in mind that the number of aggregates is orders of magnitude less than the number of elements.</p>

<p>Finally, in the second pass over the elements, the stack algorithm is run again, and this time elements that were missing in the first pass are available, from the aggregate obtained during the decoupled lookback phase. As another potential optimization, the second pass might “jump over” subtrees that were computed entirely locally within the partition in the first pass, only doing work on subtrees that cross partition boundaries.</p>

<p>Thus, my analysis is that the work factor is <em>extremely</em> good for this algorithm, meaning that on a 64 core processor, it might come within striking distance of 64 times faster than a single core sequential implementation (obviously modulo all the usual other factors that make this challenging).</p>

<p>As I mentioned, an efficient GPU kernel is likely to be challenging, probably requiring tricky techniques to exploit SIMD (warp) parallelism without spending too much time computing the monoid composition, but the fact that it seems to work so well in the multicore case is an encouraging sign that an efficient, fully GPU-tuned implementation is possible.</p>



<p>In an earlier draft, I asked for relevant literature related to this idea. I still haven’t found anything that presents this particular monoid, or a tool that can derive it from its sequential source, but there is a fair amount of related work.</p>

<p>Obviously, <a href="https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson">simdjson</a> is an important exploration of deriving more parallelism from the JSON parsing task, with impressive results. It is, I think, complementary to this exploration, as it exploits parallelism at a fine grain, where this monoid approach is geared towards the larger grain of tree structure. But both are necessary for a performant GPU implementation; anyone intending to really parse JSON on GPU is well advised to study it.</p>

<p>Parsing CSV has some of the same problems as JSON, though not the (potentially deeply) nested tree structure. A recent preprint, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13415.pdf">ParPaRaw: Massively Parallel Parsing of Delimiter-Separated Raw Data</a> presents a GPU implementation.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/1512">PR to cudf</a> implements “JSON Lines” parsing, which seems to me more similar to CSV than full tree-structured JSON parsing, but I haven’t dug into it in detail.</p>

<p>There is also a large literature on incremental parsing, which is related to parallel parsing as well (monoids are useful to both); a relevant example is <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-functional-programming/article/efficient-parallel-and-incremental-parsing-of-practical-contextfree-languages/4D620F0BFADE2B588F854AAAEA252F5C">Efficient parallel and incremental parsing of practical context-free languages</a>.</p>

<p>I linked it in my previous blog, but <a href="https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/handle/2022/24749">Aaron Hsu’s PhD thesis</a> is a remarkable full compiler implementation (for an APL-derived language) on GPU. It <em>does</em> address tree structure, and I believe generally uses adjacency matrices to represent that.</p>

through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond
through the direct equivalent of this fine <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">MNIST CNN example in Keras</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org54ea652">
<h2 id="org54ea652">Specify the network blueprint</h2>
<div id="text-org54ea652">
<p>
We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb8d8bce">
<h2 id="orgb8d8bce">Create the network</h2>
<div id="text-orgb8d8bce">
<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.
</p>

<p>
That's it! The network is ready to learn.

<div id="outline-container-orgae4dec0">
<h2 id="orgae4dec0">Train the network on MNIST data (CPU)</h2>
<div id="text-orgae4dec0">
<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span>time <span>(</span>train net train-images y-train <span>:crossentropy</span> 12 <span>[]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

   <img alt="ADHD mind" src="https://www.kabdebon.com/assets/images/posts/2020-08-25-creative-mayhem-life-as-founder-with-adhd/adhdmind.png">
</p>

<p>This article took me four weeks to finish. During this time, I’ve had ideas for more than ten articles, started writing them in parallel, delaying this one so much that I almost gave up ever publishing it… It wasn’t until I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Driven-Distraction-Revised-Recognizing-Attention-ebook/dp/B005GFII62">Driven To Distraction</a> that I stumbled upon an explanation for why I was struggling to finish. Through this book and my doctor, I’ve discovered that I have a condition called Adult ADHD.</p>

<p>While the adult variant of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#Adult_ADHD_Diagnostic_Expansion">recently</a> started to become a serious subject of research, it’s difficult to find testimonies about it related to work, in particular entrepreneurship. Early results show that there’s a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11187-018-0061-1">positive correlation between ADHD and the desire and act to start a company</a>. I’ll share how adult ADHD can affect a founder’s experience and how it played a role in the successes and stumbles of my life as the cofounder and CTO of <a href="https://www.truework.com/">Truework</a>.</p>

<h2 id="backstory-and-the-entrepreneurship-drive">Backstory and the entrepreneurship drive</h2>

<p>From an early age, I had trouble remembering important things like my birthday (learned around age 7), how to tie shoes (learned age 12), or even why I entered a room in the first place (to this day, this keeps happening). All the way to the end of high school, getting good grades was easy. However, early signs of difficulty focusing popped up here and there: even when required to, I wasn’t able to sit down and learn. For example, in France, students must memorize entire poems, then are expected to recite it back the next day. As hard as I tried, when I stepped in front of the class my mind remained blank, unable to recall the words I had tried to learn the day before. The teacher, exasperated by my silence, called me “lazy” and “rebellious.”</p>

<p>After high school, I was accepted into the best schools in France. Difficulties focusing on homework became more problematic as advanced maths, physics, and chemistry required deeper focus and concentration to understand complex topics. My grades were now in the middle of the class instead of being at the top. For the first time, I started to feel the deep frustration of not being able to focus when I needed it.</p>

<p>As I started my professional life, things became more interesting. I was hired as a Software Engineer at LinkedIn and finally, it was an environment where my creativity could be unleashed. I suffered from “too-many-project-itis”, a made-up condition for engineers who start too many projects and finish too few. I learned to let go of most of them while focusing on the ones that would yield tangible results. Eventually, one of these ideas, a place to get verified information about people, motivated me enough to want to stop working at a big company and create a company that became a real startup: <a href="https://www.truework.com/">Truework</a>.</p>

<p>The pressure of long hours and stress to find product-market fit during early startup days pushed my mind to new highs and lows. What I thought were quirks of my personality quickly became signs that something in my brain was different than my peers. These inherent differences, while frustrating at times, also led to surprising successes for our business. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adult-adhd/symptoms-causes/syc-20350878">Adult ADHD symptoms</a> fall into three categories as they relate to an entrepreneur’s experiences:  the <em>Good</em>, the <em>Bad</em>, and the <em>Ugly</em>. Just like in the famous scene they will, throughout your life, face each other or even duel at times: it’s your responsibility to have the “Good” win.</p>

<p>
   <img alt="Scene from the good, the bad and the ugly" src="https://www.kabdebon.com/assets/images/posts/2020-08-25-creative-mayhem-life-as-founder-with-adhd/thegoodthebadtheugly.jpg">
</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>

<p>“The bad” are the parts of ADHD that are not pleasant to deal with, for you or others. These behaviors, if not dealt with, will be a challenge to your success as an entrepreneur.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Anxiety</strong>. <a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/ajp.2006.163.4.716?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;">Research shows that close to one in two people with ADHD suffer from some kind of anxiety disorder</a>. As with most ADHD symptoms, it’s hard to predict how anxiety will show up in your life. For me, it’s heightened stress during unexpected events, like the departure of a key employee or a serious bug in the code. In these moments, I need to remind myself that it’s OK and surround myself with people who can keep their heads on their shoulders. 
In fact, to cope with anxiety, I’ve built a comprehensive incident management system that we use daily at Truework. Research has a name for it: <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/10/three-leadership-skills-that-c">productive paranoia</a>, an attribute that distinguishes companies that thrive in chaos instead of suffering from it. Anxiety is rarely talked about in entrepreneurship stories, but in my experience is very common. If channeled constructively, it’ll help build defense mechanisms for when bad news strikes. Remember, the journey to build a business is a rocky one and it’ll certainly trigger intense moments of anxiety and doubts.</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of filter</strong>. “insensitive”, “harsh”, “direct”: if you have ADHD, you’ve probably heard these comments about your behavior. For founders, the difference between a successful outcome and a disastrous one often lies in how carefully you choose your words. Over time I’ve trained myself to consciously think before speaking: no more “thinking out loud” in front of my reports. You may need to reach into the depths of your willpower to stop yourself from blurting words that may get you in trouble, but trust me, it’s worth it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h2>

<p>“The ugly” parts are the frustrations of daily life. They’ll make you feel a bit “different” from others or “off”.  I’ve found they have little impact on my journey as a founder but instead can bring your enthusiasm and confidence down. Keeping them under control will improve your overall well being as a person which is very important for founders.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Problem of focus</strong>. This is the first thing people think about when they think ADHD, and with good reason. It’s difficult to describe to a non-ADHD person how quickly the ADHD brain gets distracted. For me, any notification will stop me from writing an important article or work on an important task. For founders, tasks calling for your attention and interruptions will grow exponentially with the size of the company. While disturbing to most people, it can be absolutely overwhelming for people with adult ADHD. Keep it simple: turn off all notifications or go back to pen and paper when deep focus is needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Time management</strong>. Being at a meeting on time, being ready for the meeting, planning in advance. These tasks are not easy for a person with ADHD. Before most deadlines, I seem to remember to do everything but the task I’m supposed to do. Time management is a crucial skill for founders and soon after you start your company your calendar will fill with dozens of meetings and other obligations per week. I’ve found it’s best to hire and rely early on somebody that can help you with organization. Alternatively, reminders, TODO lists, and other software can help you stay on top of tasks and meetings</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>

<p>Finally with the “the good” parts. Let me preface this part by saying that the qualities listed below are not superpowers. But they may give you an edge in specific situations.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Deep Focus</strong>. It appears to contradict the part above about the lack of focus, but people with ADHD <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfocus#ADHD">report having an ability to deeply focus on topics they are passionate about</a>. Currently, I’m reading everything I can get my hands on about the topic of documentation, in particular knowledge organization. I often lose track of time after sitting down with a compelling article and forget to eat a meal As founders start their journeys, they face incredible challenges: only the passion for their work will allow them to continue and overcome obstacles. Founders who are able to channel that “hyperfocus” towards the company’s future will leapfrog their competitors and be the engine that drives their company’s vision forward.</li>
  <li><strong>Creativity</strong>. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-creativity-of-adhd/">Research</a> points out that adults with ADHD show a higher level of creativity compared to other people. It’s been my observation that it has been easier for me to think “outside the box” when faced with a difficult problem than a lot of my peers. For founders, this is an advantage that they need to nurture in themselves, as success for a startup lies in doing things in a way that wasn’t thought possible before.</li>
  <li><strong>Impulsivity/Gut Feeling</strong>. The lack of filter which sometimes negatively impacts personal and professional relationships has a positive aspect as well. The life of a founder is punctuated by moments when it’s necessary to make an important decision with only partial information. It’s crucial to get over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">“analysis paralysis”</a> and trust your instinct. When hiring the first few people who will come to define your company, you’ll need to make a decision of who to bring on board. Trust your gut and go with the people that you think will make you successful.</li>
  <li><strong>Appetite for risk</strong>. Last but not least a rarely discussed aspect of adult ADHD is an above-average appetite for risk. This characteristic is of course essential to even start a business as a founder where nothing is for certain. As you grow, that “risk mindset” will be crucial to keep the company from playing it too safe after finding some initial success. For founders, pushing the boundaries is a requirement to survive as you grow.</li>
</ul>

<p>ADHD traits, described by the media, seem largely dysfunctional. While there’s some truth to it, they affect a founder’s life in contradictory ways: one day you’ll be extremely anxious and wondering why you took the leap in the first place, and the next you’ll be riding high, loving the risk of being an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>It’s too easy to let yourself be defined by the conditions you are born with and see them as roadblocks to your success. With most things in life you don’t get to choose what you’re born with, only what actions you take: if you want to become a founder, ADHD is just one of the problems you’ll need to solve along the way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em><a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/under_construction/">Under Construction</a></em> Friday, September 04, 2020 </p></div><div>

<p>I haven't said anything about Big Sur yet, and since the public beta has  been out for a while, and I'm getting more questions about it, it's time.</p>

<p>At present, it's <strong>not possible</strong> to make bootable copies of Big Sur, even with <code>asr</code>, Apple's own built-in replication utility. As such, we haven't released a Beta, or even an internal Alpha, because it wouldn't meet our own requirements.</p>

<p>So, for the moment, we're holding back, hoping that Apple will fix the issues and allow 3rd party (or even 1st party, given <code>asr</code>) bootable backups. While <code>asr</code> was failing completely in previous builds, in the most recent one it isn't able to back up because the system volume isn't properly 'sealed' (which is ominous, since why wouldn't a standard install be sealed, and if it's not, why wouldn't you be able to back it up anyway).</p>

<p>So, while progress is being made, we're kind of stuck waiting for the king.</p>

<p>In the meantime, my advice for macOS Betas remains as valid as ever: <strong>do not install a macOS Beta</strong> unless you have a <strong>critical business need</strong> to do so. These Betas, even when public, are not for general use, and certainly not for anyone who wants a reliable system for day-to-day work.</p>

<p>If you <strong>must</strong> install it, use Time Machine for backups for now (and, given my advice in <a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/practices_make_perfect_backups/">Practices Make Perfect (Backups)</a>, on a continuing basis in addition to other methods), since it's  at a relatively equivalent Beta quality level to the OS itself and is explicitly tested and supported by Apple.</p>

<p>I'll be back when we have additional news to share. For those in the US, enjoy Labor Day weekend!</p>

September 5, 2020 | https://rillabs.com/posts/crystal-concurrency-with-easier-syntax-than-go | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rillabs.com/posts/crystal-concurrency-with-easier-syntax-than-go">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have been playing around a lot with concurrency in Go over the years, resulting in libraries such as <a href="https://scipipe.org/" target="_blank">SciPipe</a>, <a href="http://flowbase.org/" target="_blank">FlowBase</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rdfio/rdf2smw/" target="_blank">rdf2smw</a>. My main motivation for looking into Go has been the possibility to use it as a more performant, scaleable and type-safe alternative to Python for data heavy scripting tasks in bioinformatics and other fields I've been dabbling in. Especially as it makes it so easy to write concurrent and parallel code in it. Be warned that this context is surely giving me some biases.</p>

<p>I find the concurrency features of Go - with its lightweight goroutines and channels - to be hard to beat in that it also provides true parallelism by mapping the goroutines onto physical operating system threads automatically in the background. Few if any other mainstream languages does that. It lifts off a lot of concerns that you as a developer don't need to deal with.</p>

<p>Still, the Go syntax has always felt rather complex. After 5+ years, I have still not learned how to open up a file and reading from it line by line, and need to check up the syntax on a site like <a href="https://gobyexample.com/" target="_blank">gobyexample.com</a>. This task also requires importing two different libraries (os, and bufio), which you have to remember.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://rillabs.com/site/assets/files/1111/selection_161.120x0-is.png" width="120">With this background, I found it interesting when a new language on the block, <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a>, <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/2019/09/06/parallelism-in-crystal.html">touts to provide the same concurrency features</a>, still in a language with static typing and ahead-of-time compiling, with a much more scriptlike and clean syntax.</p>

<p>In this post, I take a brief look at Crystal by implementing a pattern I have been using a lot in Go: A simple pipeline, where one go-routine does something like read from a file, feeding of the data to another goroutine over a channel to do more work. I this post I will do this by implementing an extremely simple pipeline that does just that, in both of the languages, and then do some observations about the differences between the languages. In more concrete terms, what the program does is: let one go-routine read from a file line by line, and another one calculate the frequency of G and C:s over all of A, T, G, Cs in a DNA-file in the FASTA format.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-67/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.67.dna_rm.chromosome.Y.fa.gz">the (68MB) file I'm using here</a>.</p>

<p>You can find both of the below code files <a href="https://github.com/samuell/experiments/tree/master/govscr" target="_blank">on GitHub here</a>.</p>

<h3>Go implementation</h3>

<p>Here is the Go implementation:</p>

<pre><code>package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	lineChan := make(chan string, 16)

	// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	// Loop over the input file in a separate fiber
	// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	go func() {
		defer close(lineChan)

		gcFile, err := os.Open("Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.67.dna_rm.chromosome.Y.fa")
		defer gcFile.Close()
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}

		scan := bufio.NewScanner(gcFile)
		for scan.Scan() {
			line := scan.Text()
			lineChan &lt;- line
		}
	}()

	at := 0
	gc := 0

	for line := range lineChan {
		if line[0] == '&gt;' {
			continue
		}

		for _, chr := range line {
			switch chr {
			case 'A', 'T':
				at += 1
				continue
			case 'G', 'C':
				gc += 1
				continue
			}
		}
	}

	var gcFrac float64
	gcFrac = float64(gc) / float64(at+gc)
	fmt.Printf("GC fraction: %f\n", gcFrac)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Compile and run with e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>GOMAXPROCS=4; go build -o gcgo gc.go
./gcgo</code></pre>

<h3>Crystal implementation</h3>

<p>... and here is the same functionality, implemented in Crystal:</p>

<pre><code>lines_chan = Channel(String).new(16)

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Loop over the input file in a separate fiber (and thread, if you set the
# CRYSTAL_WORKERS count to something larger than 1), and send its output on a
# channel
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
spawn do
  gcfile = File.new("Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.67.dna_rm.chromosome.Y.fa")                                      
  gcfile.each_line() do |line|                                                                            
    lines_chan.send(line)                                                                                 
  end                                                                                                     
  gcfile.close 
ensure  
  lines_chan.close
end

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Loop over the lines on the channel in the main thread, and count GC fraction.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
at = 0
gc = 0
while line = lines_chan.receive?
  if line.starts_with?('&gt;')
    next
  end
  line.each_byte() do |chr|
    case chr
    when 'A', 'T'
      at += 1
      next
    when 'G', 'C'
      gc += 1
      next
    end
  end
end

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Output results
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gcfrac = gc / (gc + at)
puts "GC fraction: #{gcfrac}"
</code></pre>



<p>Note that to run the Crystal program with true multi-threading, you have to send a flag: -Dpreview_mt, to use it.</p>

<p>Compile and run with e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>CRYSTAL_WORKERS=4; crystal build --release -Dpreview_mt -o gccr gc.cr
./gccr

</code></pre>

<h3>Some differences</h3>

<p>We can note a few differences:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Crystal code is considerably shorter.</li>
	<li>I find the Crystal code easier to read.</li>
	<li>Crystal does not need to create a main()-function, but can include code directly in the file, similar to Python and Ruby.</li>
	<li>In Crystal you don't need to import multiple packages to open a file, and to loop over it.</li>
	<li>In Crystal, as seen in the code, we use "<a href="https://crystal-lang.org/reference/syntax_and_semantics/exception_handling.html#ensure" target="_blank">ensure</a>", between any two "begin/end" clauses, in a similar way as Go:s "defer", to ensure something is done as the very last thing before existing the function.</li>
	<li>In my tests, the Go implementation has always outperformed the Crystal one, so far. This might change with time of course.</li>
	<li>Truly static binary deployments seem to not be fully supported in Crystal just yet (see <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/9285" target="_blank">Issue #9285</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I think it is a bit early to draw to hard conclusions between the two langauges, as Crystal is so new, and this is just a very first test by me. But I find it interesting to have two languages with a similar set of concurrency primitives, to be able to compare various factors, as well as approaches taken.</p>

<p>Crystal looks like a promising alternative to Go, for concurrency use cases which allows writing in a much more script-like syntax. This could potentially make it a really interesting language for scientific fields such as bioinformatics, something that bioinformatics luminary <a href="https://twitter.com/lh3lh3" target="_blank">Heng Li</a> <a href="https://lh3.github.io/2020/05/17/fast-high-level-programming-languages" target="_blank">has been blogging about</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/9285" target="_blank">pointed out a problematic area for deployment</a>, currently).</p>

<p>I'm still worried about whether Crystal will manage to provide the same level of extremely portable, statically linked binaries though (EDIT: <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/2020/02/02/alpine-based-docker-images.html" target="_blank">there's a workaround, using alpine linux</a>), and this might turn out to be a real dealbreaker. Also, with the upcoming generics implementation in Go, some of the complexities of Go might be possible to hide away for end-users of some libraries, by providing high-level abstractions over typical complex tasks. One can of course also wonder if Crystal will be able to reach the level of popularity and size of ecosystem as Go, without a large industry backer (maybe if they can leverage the large number of Ruby-developers looking for a new compiled, fast language?).</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see what happens, as Crystal gets closer to 1.0, and Go soon gets generics into the language. What can be said for sure, is that we will soon have more options, for writing concurrent, performant code.</p>

<article>
  

    <section>
      <p>I recently read a somehow controversial <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56">article</a> on why CEOs are failing software engineers. In the article, software management theorist <a href="https://twitter.com/GeneTBond">Gene Bond</a> argues that since business-educated CEOs only learn about financial and business management, they can't understand the creative management necessary to discover and realise new works of value.</p><blockquote>"<em>New value is a function of failure, not success; and, much of software engineering is about discovering new value. So, in effect, nearly everything [they] are taught as a business major or leader is seemingly incompatible with software engineering.</em>"</blockquote><p>But what if CEOs were former software engineers? Would they still fail the software engineers they lead? Data seems to show otherwise when you know that eight of the ten <a href="https://fxssi.com/most-valuable-tech-companies">most valuable technology companies</a> have <strong>CEOs who also are engineers</strong>. Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, was exposed to tech and coding at a <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1058012110947373057?s=20">young age</a>. Bill Gates, the second richest, fell in love with programming at <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Early-Days-as-a-Computer-Programmer">13 years old</a>, and Mark Zuckerberg, famously kept coding Facebook while being CEO for years. Still, the majority of software engineers think they can only become CTO and have little interest in business.</p><h3 id="top-performing-ceos-have-engineering-degrees"><strong>Top-performing CEOs have engineering degrees</strong></h3><p>Every year since 2014, the Harvard Business Review has published an <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-ceo-100-2019-edition#the-best-performing-ceos-in-the-world-2019">annual ranking</a> of the best-performing CEOs in the world and, for the past three years, there have been <strong>more CEOs with engineering degrees than MBAs</strong>, including this year's number one, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. One likely explanation for this trend is the increase of technology CEOs on the list, as the industry has seen exponential growth in recent years. But maybe there's something else.</p><p>First of all, software engineers know how to set up the right environment for fellow developers because, well, they've been there. They know what developers <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/07/a-field-guide-to-developers/">look for in a job</a>. It's not surprising that <strong>twelve out of the twenty tech CEOs most favoured by their </strong><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Top-CEOs-LST_KQ0,8.htm"><strong>employees</strong></a><strong> have an engineering background</strong> or coded at some point in their careers. As Stack Overflow and Trello founder Joel Sposkly <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/">puts it</a>: "<em>building the company where the best software developers in the world would want to work [leads] to profits as naturally as chocolate leads to chubbiness or cartoon sex in video games leads to gangland-style shooting sprees</em>". After all, he did build two multi-million companies that considerably impacted the software ecosystem.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oPXEuhoN05pnwuxbStZyMOftjkpqzRkpZdIxi2KImveOn3p8CL0VOEr7OGcuXQjFr0_MsfHaGx4QJ9ps3JSHJd8TXpv7dSUypZTTqf0jURKiGppNFiGi4aXfiLGbiJ9xBZAa6UwD" alt=""><figcaption>Joel Spolsky’s formula on how to build profitable software companies</figcaption></figure><p>I also believe that having a software engineering mindset, even if self-taught, allows CEOs to manage their companies very differently than financially focused peers.</p><h3 id="approaching-business-processes-like-programming-tasks"><strong>Approaching business processes like programming tasks</strong></h3><p>While Microsoft valuation hardly moved during Steve Ballmer's fourteen years tenure as CEO, it grew over 200 % since Satya Nadella took over in 2014. The difference? Steve Ballmer was a sales-oriented business school drop-out, while Nadella is a former software engineer turned executive.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SCzxw685G5KsYSWFfNKU1WiU6J7yXXk1nZ-ZBMh-LpSe4gqKLKHwrLT6KCWZJl9bI2E7QHnssM1gCdMRRDVAuabgxYCNn9lQ9xLnbkSNTJ7vgMIhDM7sJecme7mGO_Wqhgxdatg4" alt=""><figcaption>Microsoft stock price under Satya Nadella - CB Insights<span>‌‌</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what does Nadella, and other engineers-turned-CEOs have in common? Well, suppose we take aside the ability to understand technology and have a long-term vision about it. In that case, I believe one of their key attributes is the ability to <strong>approach business processes like programming tasks</strong>.</p><p>Do you know what programmatic marketing, growth hacking and the lean startup have in common? They're all business methodologies that were created by engineers. They leverage <strong>logic and processes</strong> instead of intuition; they're <strong>data-driven</strong> and promote <strong>iterative experimentation</strong>. And, when you go beyond the buzzwords and watch the results, they're behind the wild success of tech companies like Dropbox and Slack (whose CEOs are, by the way, former developers).</p><p>Another trait of software engineers is their inclination to <strong>automate recurring and tedious tasks</strong>. As Bill Gates is known to say, "<em>I always choose a lazy person to do a hard job, because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.</em>" And software engineers are known to be lazy. So, as CEOs, they're more likely to look for scalable solutions through automation, rather than merely hiring more human beings. Some CEOs take this thinking to another level like GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij, who started the company's famous <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/">handbook</a> because he didn't want to repeat himself for every batch of new hires.</p><p>What's even more interesting is when software engineers become CEOs of non-software companies. In this case, they run their firm like a software company, <strong>making software the cornerstone of their strategy</strong>, like Elon Musk with Tesla. One key component of electric automaker Tesla's success, as <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation">spotted</a> by Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer, is that "<em>it introduced a new hardware and software architecture. For example, a Tesla has more software than the average vehicle and it is integrated around a single central software architecture. Although most gas-powered cars have software too, they typically have less software and operate on a different architecture making it more challenging to imitate Tesla's ability to update software and optimise vehicle performance.</em></p><p>Last but not least, they understand like Jeff Bezos that "<em>failure and invention are inseparable twins.</em>" In his famous <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm">letters to shareholders</a>, Bezos often shares that what makes Amazon successful is their ability to accept the failed experiments necessary to get to invention.</p><blockquote>“<em>Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten [...] In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs.</em>”</blockquote><h3 id="why-so-few-software-engineers-want-to-become-ceos"><strong>Why so few software engineers want to become CEOs</strong></h3><p>So if software engineers can become excellent CEOs, even in non-tech businesses, why so few of them make it to the top? According to a 2019 Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2019/10/05/new-ceo-study-the-undergraduate-degrees-and-majors-of-fortune-100-ceos/#623b360e4130">study</a>, still, 64% of F100 CEOs had a business-related undergraduate degree. I don't think it's just about software engineers' dislike for business. I believe it's also about how few of them consider the CEO position as a career choice. They're always told that if they're interested in management, the highest possible job is CTO. When hiring software engineers for a startup job, they first think they should be CTO.</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt=""></figure><p>Of course, not everyone wants to start a startup, the surest way to become CEO. But with more and more tech CEOs <strong>promoted from within after technology management roles</strong>, it's a choice to consider.</p><h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h3><ul><li>CEOs with a background in financial and business management often fail to understand software engineers</li><li>Former software engineers and self-taught developers make excellent CEO</li><li>One of their key attributes is their capacity to approach business like programming</li><li>CEO is a valid career choice for software engineers and they shouldn’t be afraid to consider it if they’re attracted to the business side</li></ul><h3 id="reading-list"><strong>Reading List</strong></h3><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56"><strong>Why are CEOs failing software engineers?</strong></a> - &nbsp;Gene Bond</p><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/"><strong>Hitting the High Notes</strong></a> - Joel Spolsky</p><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation"><strong>Lessons from Tesla’s Approach to Innovation</strong></a> - Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer</p>

      <p>Long-time readers will know that I’m <a href="https://davidyat.es/2017/05/18/rss-nothing-better/">a big fan of RSS feeds</a>. An RSS reader has been essential to my web experience since I first came online, and I’ve doggedly stuck to using them even as the web has centralised onto a few platforms and much digital ink spilt about the “death of RSS”. Luckily, I’m not the only one who prefers this old-school, human-curated approach to the web over today’s platforms and their algorithms.</p>
<p><a href="https://fraidyc.at/">Fraidycat</a> is a browser extension for following people on the web, created by someone named Kicks Condor, whose <a href="https://www.kickscondor.com/">main internet presence</a> as of this writing appears to an elaborate act of performance art. Previously it was a blog, and maybe it will be one again, who can say?</p>
<p>Like a latter day <a href="https://davidyat.es/2017/09/23/review-whys-poignant-guide-to-ruby/">_why</a>, Kicks combines clever programming with a colourful and quirky aesthetic to create software that is both useful and a little odd, hence the name and colourscheme.</p>

<p>Fraidycat differs from traditional RSS readers (ala the late Google Reader) in two key ways:</p>
<p><strong>1. It’s not just an RSS reader</strong>. In addition to RSS (and Atom, and JSON) feeds, you can use Fraidycat to follow Twitter and Instagram accounts, Youtube channels, TiddlyWikis, <a href="https://davidyat.es/2019/06/24/indieweb/">indieweb</a> h-feeds and <a href="https://github.com/kickscondor/fraidycat#follow-support">a whole bunch more</a>. The explicit goal of the project is provide a universal interface for following people regardless of the platforms they use.</p>
<p>Although I don’t share the author’s complete aversion to using social media sites, I find Fraidycat very useful for following a few high signal-to-noise accounts on various platforms, so I can make sure I see everything they post.</p>
<p><strong>2. It doesn’t look like an email client.</strong> Most feed readers carefully track and even save each post from each of your subscriptions. Posts are marked as read or unread, and, where possible, the full body text of each post is embedded in the reader’s interface. Fraidycat doesn’t even try to do either of these things. No distinction is made between read and unread items (beyond your browser’s visited/unvisited link colouration), and no tally is kept. No interface exists for reading post content. Every site/account you subscribe to is shown with links to its ten most recent posts. Clicking a link takes you to the post in question, and if you want to see the eleventh most recent post, well, you can go to the site itself.</p>
<p>These feature omissions are my favourite things about Fraidycat. I follow a lot of different sites for a lot of different reasons. With some, I want to read every post. With others, I just want to see the latest headlines and dip into when one catches my eye. Every RSS reader I’ve used in the past has irritated me by running up unread counts for the latter category.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my post about <a href="https://davidyat.es/2020/03/14/reader-modes/">browser reader modes</a>, I usually prefer to read articles on their original websites – partly so that they don’t all blend together like Medium sludge, and partly because syndicated content has an uncomfortably high probability of losing formatting and even chunks of text. So Fraidycat’s philosophy of linking rather than rendering is ideal for my usecase. The world could probably do with more developers who <a href="https://github.com/kickscondor/fraidycat/wiki/Rejected-Features">intentionally leave out features</a>.</p>
<p>Fraidycat allows you to categorise your subscriptions on two levels: category and importance. Categories are up to you to define, and are shown as tabs at the top of the page. One subscription can appear in multiple categories. Kicks’s preferred aesthetic is to use emojis as category names, but you can use words too.</p>
<p>Importance is unique to Fraidycat, and provides a way for you to prioritise content and shape your reading habits. Each subscription can appear in one of the below importances:</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This allows you to determine how often you’ll want to check in on a given site/account/person, which is likely to be a function of how frequently they post, the lengths of their posts, and how interested you are in their content. A favourite Twitter account, for example, may be placed in Real-time, while a rarely updated blog, or one you seldom have time to read, may be placed in Sometimes, to be glanced at when you’re not doing anything else.</p>
<p>I wasn’t completely sold on this feature when I first started using Fraidycat, as I’d often forget to check the last two tabs, but that’s basically the point of having them – not everything needs to be checked for updates all the time. In any case, you can just put everything in Real-time or Frequent and never bother with time sensitivity if it doesn’t work for you.</p>
<p>Before switching to Fraidycat about a year ago, I used web-based RSS readers like <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> and <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">Inoreader</a>. My main concern with switching was that my subscriptions would be tied to my main PC. Fortunately, the extension integrates with browser sync, so subscriptions will be synced between devices. This functionality didn’t exist the last time I tried using a browser extension feed reader, and its absence would have been a dealbreaker (and also a heartbreaker).</p>
<p>There’s currently no way to get Fraidycat on a smartphone, but I don’t need it there. Even the feeds I follow in real-time aren’t quite important enough that I need to check them when I’m not in front of a computer. Which, I think, is very much in keeping with the application’s philosophy. Fraidycat produces no notifications, applies no machine learning to your subscriptions to recommend content you might like, and doesn’t gamify your actions or track you. You choose who to follow and how to follow, and the app does nothing outside of that. Fraidycat is the best RSS reader I’ve ever used because of what it leaves out.</p>

<p>Permutation City is a great novel with a very interesting philosophical argument embedded inside it. Many people don’t want to read the whole novel, so here is my short explanation of Egan’s Dust Theory.</p>



<p>If you think experience is simulatable, you buy computational or “patternist” theories of identity, there are some very strange implications that are not commonly brought up. </p>



<p>Because computation is sort of subjective, just a set of relations that can be usefully interpreted as representing a function, this seems to imply that the function you identify with can be interpreted as being simulated by any sufficiently complex set of relations. </p>



<p>That is, for any random set of relations with enough complexity to represent a human mind, Egan claims, there exists an exotic encoding scheme that can interpret this set of relations as representing any arbitrary function, including the function that you would call “I”.</p>



<p>Now you cannot access this information usefully, so most functions can be said to not usefully exist within this randomness. But if you buy the whole “I think therefore I am” business this does not matter for those functions that are conscious, because consciousness is self-justifying. </p>



<p>So the function that is you is being “run” far more often in random noise than engineered computers or ‘real’ physical reality. This is sort of like the Boltzmann brain idea but even worse because it applies to any set of relations. According to Egan’s argument all possible experiences that can be computed by any sufficiently complex set of relations are in fact computed by them. </p>



<p>In fact, even if you imagine a static set of relations that do not evolve in time there still exists encoding schemes that can interpret this set of relations as any arbitrary function, so in some sense the set of mathematical objects that represent “you” and “me” and all possible minds can be said to exist in these timeless relations. </p>



<p>Egan discusses some counterarguments to the idea here: <a href="https://www.gregegan.net/PERMUTATION/FAQ/FAQ.html">https://www.gregegan.net/PERMUTATION/FAQ/FAQ.html</a></p>

September 5, 2020 | https://www.reenigne.org/blog/8086-microcode-disassembled/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.reenigne.org/blog/8086-microcode-disassembled/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>Recently I realised that, as part of his 8086 reverse-engineering series, Ken Shirriff had posted online a <a href="https://www.righto.com/2020/06/a-look-at-die-of-8086-processor.html">high resolution photograph of the 8086 die with the metal layer removed</a>. This was something I have been looking for for some time, in order to extract and disassemble the 8086 microcode. I had previously found very high resolution photos of the die with the metal layer intact, but only half of the bits of the microcode ROM were readable. Ken also posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/kenshirriff/status/1278713580351700993">high resolution photograph of the microcode ROM of the 8088</a>, which is very similar but not identical. I was very curious to know what the differences were.</p>



<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/SiliconAnalysis/bitract">bitract</a> to extract the bits from the two main microcode ROMs, and also from the translation ROM which maps opcode bit patterns onto positions within the main microcode ROM.</p>



<p>The microcode is partially documented in <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4363091">US patent 4363091</a>. In particular, that patent has source listings for several microcode routines. Within these, there are certain patterns of parts of instructions which I was able to find in the ROM dump. This allowed me to figure out how the bit patterns in the ROM correspond to the operands and opcodes of the microcode instruction set, in a manner similar to cracking a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. My resulting disassembly of the microcode ROM can be found <a href="https://www.reenigne.org/misc/8086_microcode.zip">here</a> and the code for my disassembler is <a href="https://github.com/reenigne/reenigne/blob/master/8088/8086_microcode">on github</a>.</p>



<p>This disassembly has answered many questions I had about the 8088 and 8086. The remainder of this post contains the answers to these questions and other interesting things I found in the microcode.</p>



<p><strong>What are the microcode differences between the 8086 and the 8088?</strong></p>



<p>The differences are in the interrupt handling code. I think it comes down to fact that the 8086 does two special bus accesses to acknowledge an interrupt (one to tell the PIC that it is ready to service the interrupt, the second to fetch the interrupt number for the IRQ that needs to be serviced). These are word-sized accesses for some reason, so the 8088 would break them into four accesses instead of two. This would confuse the PIC, so the 8088 does a single access instead and relies on the BIU to split the access into two. The other changes seem to be fallout related to that.</p>



<p><strong>Are the microcode listings in the US4363091 accurate?</strong></p>



<p>Mostly. There are differences, however (which added some complexity to the deciphering process). The differences are in the string instructions. For example, the "STS" (STOSB/STOSW) instruction in the patent is:</p>



<pre>CR  S      D      Type  a     b     F
-------------------------------------
0   IK     IND    7     F1    1
1   (M)    OPR    6     w     DA,BL
2   IND    IK     0     F1    0
3                 4     none  RNI</pre>



<p>In the actual CPU, this has become:</p>



<pre>0   IK    -&gt; IND       7   F1    RPTS
1   M     -&gt; OPR       6   w     DA,BL
2   IND   -&gt; IK        0   NF1      5
3   SIGMA -&gt; tmpc      5   INT   RPTI
4   tmpc  -&gt; BC        0   NZ       1
5                      4   none  RNI</pre>



<p>The arrow isn't a difference - I just put that in my disassembly to emphasize the direction of data movement in the "move" part of the microcode instructions. Likewise, the "F1 1" in the patent listing is the same as the "F1 RPTS" in my disassembly - I have replaced subroutine numbers with names to make it easier to read.</p>



<p>The version in the patent does a check for pending interrupts in the "RPTS" routine, before it processes any iterations of the string. This means that if there is a continuous "storm" of interrupts, the string instruction will make no progress. The version in the CPU corrects this, and checks for interrupts on line 3, after it has done the store, allowing it to progress. This was probably not a situation that was expected to occur in normal operation (in fact, I seem to recall crashing my 8088 and 8086 machines by having interrupts happen too rapidly to be serviced). The change was most likely done to accommodate debugging with the trap flag (which essentially means that there is always an interrupt pending when the trap flag is set). Without this change, code that used the repeated string instructions would not have progressed under the debugger.</p>



<p><strong>How many different instructions does the 8086 have, according to the microcode? What are they?</strong></p>



<p>The CPU has 60 instructions, and they're in a fairly logical sort of order:</p>



<p>(Numbers are: number of opcodes handled, size of top-level microcode routine.)</p>



<pre>MOV rm&lt;-&gt;r     4  3
LEA            1  1
alu rm&lt;-&gt;r    32  4
alu rm,i       4  5

RET/RETF iw    4  4
JMP cw/JMP cb  2  6
JMP cd         1  7
Jcond         32  3
MOV rmw&lt;-&gt;sr   2  2
LES            1  4

SAHF           1  4
LAHF           1  2
ESC            8  1
XLAT           1  5
STOS           2  6 (discontinuous)
CMPS/SCAS      4 13 (discontinuous)
MOVS/LODS      4 11 (discontinuous)
JCXZ           1  5 (discontinuous)
LOOPNE/LOOPE   2  5
LOOP           1  4
DAA/DAS        2  4
AAA/AAS        2  8
AAD            1  4
AAM            1  6
INC/DEC rw    16  2
INT ib         1  2
INTO           1  4
INT 3          1  3</pre>



<p>The discontinuous instructions were most likely broken up because they had bug fixes making them too long for their original slots. Similarly "POP rmw" appears to have been shortened by at least 3 instructions as there is a gap after it. Moving code around after it's been written (and updating all the far jump/call locations) would probably have been tricky.</p>



<p><strong>Which instructions, if any, are not handled by the microcode?</strong></p>



<p>There is no microcode for the segment override prefixes (CS:, SS:, DS: and ES:). Nor for the other prefixes (REP, REPNE and LOCK), nor the instructions CLC, STC, CLI, STI, CLD, STD, CMC, and HLT. The "group" opcodes 0xf6, 0xf7, 0xfe and 0xff do not have top level microcode instructions. So none of the instructions with 0xf in the high nybble of the opcode are initially handled by the microcode. Most of these instruction are very simple and probably better done by random logic. HLT is a little surprising - I really thought I'd find a microcode loop for that one since it only seems to check for interrupts every other cycle.</p>



<p>The group instructions are decoded slightly differently but the microcode routines handling them break down as follows:</p>



<pre>INC/DEC rm        3
PUSH rm           4
NOT rm            3
NEG rm            3
CALL FAR rm       8
CALL rm           8
TEST rm,i         4
JMP rm            2
JMP FAR rm        4
IMUL/MUL rmb      8
IMUL/MUL rmw      8
IDIV/DIV rmb      8
IDIV/DIV rmw      8</pre>



<p>Then there are various subroutines and tail calls (listed in translation.txt). Highlights:</p>



<ul><li>interrupt handling (16 microinstructions)</li><li>sign handling for multiply and divide, flags for multiply (32)</li><li>effective address computation (16)</li><li>reset routine (sets CS=0xffff, DS=ES=SS=FLAGS=PC=0) (6)</li></ul>



<p><strong>Does the microcode contain any "junk code" that doesn't do anything?</strong></p>



<p>It seems to! While most of the unused parts of the ROM (64 instructions) are filled with zeroes, there are a few parts which aren't. The following instructions appear right at the end of the ROM:</p>



<pre>A     -&gt; tmpa      5   INT   FARCALL2      011100011.0110
[  5] -&gt; [ a]      5   UNC   INTR     F    011100011.0111</pre>



<p>There doesn't appear to be any way for execution to reach these instructions. This code saves AL to tmpa (which doesn't appear to then be used at all) and then does either an interrupt or (if an interrupt is pending) a far call. In the interrupt case it also does a move between a source and a destination that aren't used anywhere else (and hence I have no idea what they are). This makes me wonder if there was at one point a plan for something like an "INT AL" instruction. With the x86 instruction set we ended up with, such a thing has to be done using self-modifying code, a table of INT instructions, or faking the operation of INT in software).</p>



<p>The following code is also inaccessible and appears to do something with the low byte of the last offset read from or written to, and the carry flag:</p>



<pre>IND   -&gt; tmpaL     1   LRCY  tmpc     F      01010?10?.1010</pre>



<p>No idea what that could be for - nothing else in the microcode treats the IND register as two separate bytes.</p>



<p><strong>Are there are any parts of the microcode that are still not understood?</strong></p>



<p>When the WAIT instruction finishes in the non-interrupt case (i.e. by the -TEST pin going active to signal that the 8087 has completed an instruction) the microcode sequence finishes using this sequence:</p>



<pre>                   4   [ 1]  none
                   4   none  RNI</pre>



<p>I don't know what the "[ 1]" does - it isn't used anywhere else.</p>



<p>There is also a bit (shown as "Q" in the listings) which does not have an obvious function for "type 6" (bus IO) operations. This Q bit is only set for "W" (write) operations, and is differentiated in the listing by write operations without it being shown in lower case ("w"). There seems to be no pattern as to which writes use this bit. The string move instructions use it, as does the stack push for the flags when an interrupt occurs, and the push of the segment for a far call or interrupt (but not the offset). It would make sense if this bit was used to distinguish between memory and port IO bus accesses, but the CPU seems to have another mechanism for this (most likely the group decode ROM, which I have not decoded as there are …</p></div></div>

<blockquote><p>The article has been updated to accommodate changes since the original four months ago.</p></blockquote>



<p>Like everyone else, I got excited about the latest Ubuntu LTS release, 20.04, and installed it on day one. A month in, I’m sorry to say that I leave disappointed. The amount of unready <em>snap</em> features being effectively forced onto Ubuntu is affecting my usability and user-friendliness.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=640" alt="" width="409" height="230" srcset="https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=409 409w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=200 200w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=300 300w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px"></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Software center can’t install Flatpak apps</strong></h2>



<p>In 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu’s Software Center was switched from being a .deb version of GNOME Software to a <em>snap</em> app. The new snapped store can handle management of <em>snap</em> applications and traditional .deb ones, but it can’t install or remove Flatpak applications, like the .deb version could.</p>



<p>Users wanting to install Flatpak apps <a href="https://personal.jatan.space/2020/04/25/how-to-install-flatpak-apps-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts/">need to revert to using the .deb version</a>. It’s not an ideal solution when previous Ubuntu Software releases could handle all three formats. In all, the latest Ubuntu Software is a step back.</p>



<h2><strong>Browsing the Snap Store sucks</strong></h2>



<p>Good apps, and finding them, are central to the success of any modern operating system. Even without Flatpak apps, I was expecting the snapped store to at least do what it’s supposed to do well–help find apps. It turns out that instead Ubuntu prioritizes snap apps over .deb ones in store search results at any cost! So you’ll see a long list of non relevant entries of snap apps above .deb ones, even if your search term exactly matches the latter. -_-</p>



<p>Needless to say this is a serious issue for discovering software, especially for users switching from Windows or Mac. The snapped store isn’t just a step back, but is downright unreliable.</p>



<h2><strong>Slow and forced Chromium snap</strong></h2>



<p>On the latest Ubuntu, if you try to download the .deb version of Chromium using either the Software Store or the command line, it acts as an alias and installs the snap version! Essentially, Chromium snap is shoved down your throat even if you explicitly asked for the .deb version. This is not cool Ubuntu; Just because Chromium may be easier to maintain as a snap app doesn’t justify this forced behavior.</p>



<p>Besides, a typical user doesn’t care how the app is managed in the backend, all they care about is how it works. And that’s another place where snaps don’t shine. They are slow. I hate that Chromium’s snap takes more than 10 seconds to load on cold boot on a freaking SSD, whereas .deb and Flatpak apps load in 1-2 seconds. Snaps are simply not fast enough to be default <em>anything</em> yet.</p>



<h2><strong>No control over updates</strong></h2>



<p>Snap applications auto-update and that’s fine if Ubuntu wants to keep systems secure. But it can’t even be turned off manually. Auto-updating of snaps can only be deferred at best, until at some point, like Windows, it auto-updates anyway. Even on metered connections, snaps auto-update after a threshold time. This is unacceptable. Even Apple has easy options to disable automatic software updates.</p>



<p>Ubuntu’s update process with 20.04 LTS is a deal breaker for people on limited bandwidth connections or who want to know exactly what they’re updating and when they’d like to. Even at best, this behavior is causing me issues like slowing down my connection abruptly and using a major chunk of my limited data for the day. My <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/is-ubuntu-software-going-to-be-remove-for-snap-snap-store/14542/25?u=uncertainquark">discussion on the Ubuntu forums</a> on the topic and many such raised issues by others didn’t go well, read the <em>full thread</em> if interested.</p>



<h2><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>Ubuntu was my first Linux-based operating system and is what attracted me to the ecosystem. I have a soft spot for it, especially the amazing Unity days. As such, it is disappointing to see this snap obsession that has taken over Ubuntu. An OS once lauded for its sane defaults and user friendliness is actively going against the user’s will.</p>



<p>What’s especially concerning is that this is the Ubuntu version that millions of people will use for at least two years. I don’t hate snaps but being forced to use it especially when in a clearly premature state is forcing me to hate it. Snaps simply aren’t ready for system-wide daily usage and Ubuntu should’ve known better. Perhaps Ubuntu should’ve created a separate snap-based OS image, like Fedora’s <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/what-is-silverblue/">Silverblue</a>, and only swap the default when it’s ready.</p>



<p>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS’ snap obsession has snapped me off of it. I have switched to macOS as my daily driver, for many other reasons. I don’t have the time to keep fixing things on Linux Desktop and be constantly finding ways to work around standard OS features that should otherwise just be available and work.</p>



<p>For those on Linux, I recommend using <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">Pop!_OS 20.04</a> instead of Ubuntu as it is basically Ubuntu but without the snap, and some unique features. <a href="https://elementary.io/">elementary OS</a> is what I use on my now secondary device, mainly because of its <a href="https://appcenter.elementary.io/">app ecosystem</a>, <a href="https://personal.jatan.space/2020/03/21/why-i-love-elementary-os-file-manager/">excellent file manager</a> and the <a href="https://personal.jatan.space/2020/04/04/my-contributions-to-elementary-os-and-how-you-can-too/">welcoming nature</a> of their developers for contributions and suggestions.</p>

    <p>The programming world is moving towards functional programming (FP). More developers are using languages with an explicit bias towards FP, such as Scala and Haskell, while object-oriented (OO) languages and their communities adopt FP features and practices. (A striking example of the latter is the rise of Typescript and React in the Javascript community.) So what is FP and what does it mean to write code in a functional style? It’s common to view functional programming as a collection of language features, such as first class functions, or to define it as a programming style using immutable data and pure functions. (Pure functions always return the same output given the same input.) This was my view when I started down the FP route, but I now believe the true goals of FP are enabling local reasoning and composition. Language features and programming style are in service of these goals. In this post I attempt to explain the meaning and value of local reasoning and composition.</p>
<h2 id="what-functional-programming-is">What Functional Programming Is</h2>
<p>I believe that functional programming is a hypothesis about software quality: that software that can be understood before it is run and is built of small reusable components is easier to write and maintain. The first property is known as local reasoning, and the second as composition. Let’s address each in turn.</p>
<p>Local reasoning means we can understand pieces of code in isolation. When we see the expression <code>1 + 1</code> we know what it means regardless of the weather, the database, or the current status of our Kubernetes cluster. None of these external events can change it. This is a trivial and slightly silly example, but it illustrates a point. A goal of functional programming is to extend this ability across our code base.</p>
<p>It can help to understand local reasoning by looking at what it is not. Shared mutable state is out because relying on shared state means that other code can change what our code does without our knowledge. It means no global mutable configuration, as found in many web frameworks and graphics libraries for example, as any random code can change that configuration. Metaprogramming has to be carefully controlled. No <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">monkey patching</a>, for example, as again it allows other code to change our code in non-obvious ways. As we can see, adapting code to enable local reasoning can mean quite some sweeping changes. However if we work in a language that embraces functional programming this style of programming is the default.</p>
<p>Composition means building big things out of smaller things. Numbers are compositional. We can take any number and add one, giving us a new number. Lego is also compositional. We compose Lego by sticking it together. In the particular sense we’re using composition we also require the original elements we combine don’t change in any way when they are composed. When we create by <code>2</code> by adding <code>1</code> and <code>1</code> we get a new result but we don’t change what <code>1</code> means.</p>
<p>We can find compositional ways to model common programming tasks once we start looking for them. React components are one example familiar to many front-end developers: a component can consist of many components. HTTP routes can be modelled in a compositional way. A route is a function from an HTTP request to a handler function or a value indicating the route did not match. We can combine routes as a logical or: try this route or, if it doesn’t match, try this other route. Processing pipelines are another example that often use sequential composition: perform this pipeline stage and then this other pipeline stage.</p>
<h3 id="types">Types</h3>
<p>Types are not strictly part of functional programming but statically typed FP is the most popular form of FP and sufficiently important to warrant a mention. Types help compilers generate efficient code but types in FP are as much for the programmer as they are the compiler. Types express properties of programs, and the type checker automatically ensures that these properties hold. They can tell us, for example, what a function accepts and what it returns, or that a value is optional. We can also use types to express our beliefs about a program and the type checker will tell us if those beliefs are incorrect. For example, we can use types to tell the compiler we do not expect an error at a particular point in our code and the type checker will let us know if have made an incorrect assumption. In this way types are another tool for reasoning about code.</p>
<p>Type systems push programs towards particular designs, as to work effectively with the type checker requires designing code in a way the type checker can understand. As modern type systems come to other languages they naturally tend to shift programmers in those languages towards a FP style of coding.</p>
<h2 id="what-functional-programming-isn%E2%80%99t">What Functional Programming Isn’t</h2>
<p>In my view functional programming is not about immutability, or keeping to “the substitution model of evaluation”, and so on. These are tools in service of the goals of enabling local reasoning and composition, but they are not the goals themselves. Code that is immutable always allows local reasoning, for example, but it is not necessary to avoid mutation to still have local reasoning. Here is an example of summing a collection of numbers. First we have the code in Typescript:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>numbers<span>:</span> Array<span>&lt;</span>number<span>&gt;</span></span><span>)</span><span>:</span> number <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>let</span> total <span>=</span> <span>0.0</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>    numbers<span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>=&gt;</span> total <span>=</span> total <span>+</span> x<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>    <span>return</span> total<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here’s the same function in Scala:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> sum<span>(</span>numbers<span>:</span> List<span>[</span><span>Int</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>var</span> total <span>=</span> <span>0.0</span></span><br><span>  numbers<span>.</span>foreach<span>(</span>x <span>=&gt;</span> total <span>=</span> total <span>+</span> x<span>)</span></span><br><span>  total</span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In both implementations we mutate <code>total</code>. This is ok though! We cannot tell from the outside that this is done, and therefore all users of <code>sum</code> can still use local reasoning. Inside <code>sum</code> we have to be careful when we reason about <code>total</code> but this block of code is small enough that it shouldn’t cause any problems.</p>
<p>In this case we can reason about our code despite the mutation, but neither the Typescript nor the Scala compiler can determine that this is ok. Both languages allow mutation but it’s up to us to use it appropriately. A more expressive type system, perhaps with features like Rust’s, would be able to tell that <code>sum</code> doesn’t allow mutation to be observed by other parts of the system<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. Another approach, which is the one taken by Haskell, is to disallow all mutation and thus guarantee it cannot cause problems.</p>
<p>Mutation also interferes with composition. For example, if a value relies on internal state then composing it may produce unexpected results. Consider generators in Javascript. They maintain internal state that is used to generate the next value. If we have two generators we might want to combine them into one generator that yields values from the two inputs. Here’s the code in Typescript:</p>
<pre><code><span>type Gen<span>&lt;</span>a<span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> Generator<span>&lt;</span>a<span>,</span> <span>void</span><span>,</span> never<span>&gt;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span>number<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>let</span> index <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>yield</span> index<span>++</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> zip<span>&lt;</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>left<span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span>a<span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> right<span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span>b<span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span><span>[</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>]</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>zipIt</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>const</span> l <span>=</span> left<span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>        <span>const</span> r <span>=</span> right<span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>l<span>.</span>done <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>r<span>.</span>done<span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>            <span>const</span> result<span>:</span> <span>[</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>l<span>.</span>value<span>,</span> r<span>.</span>value<span>]</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>            <span>yield</span> result<span>;</span></span><br><span>        <span>}</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>return</span> <span>zipIt</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This works if we pass two distinct generators to <code>zip</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>zip</span><span>(</span><span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>value<span>;</span> </span></code></pre>
<p>However if we pass the same generator twice we get a surprising result.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>const</span> inf <span>=</span> <span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>zip</span><span>(</span>inf<span>,</span> inf<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>value<span>;</span> </span></code></pre>
<p>The usual functional programming solution is to avoid mutable state but we can envisage other possibilities. For example, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_system">effect tracking system</a> would allow us to avoid combining two generators that use the same memory region. These systems are still research projects, however.</p>
<p>So in my opinion immutability (and purity, referential transparency, and no doubt more fancy words that I have forgotten) have become associated with functional programming because they guarantee local reasoning and composition, and until recently we didn’t have the language tools to automatically distinguish safe uses of mutation from those that cause problems. Restricting ourselves to immutability is the easiest way to ensure the desirable properties of functional programming, but as languages evolve this might come to be regarded as a historical artifact.</p>
<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h2>
<p>I have described local reasoning and composition but have not discussed their benefits. Why are they are desirable? The answer is that they make efficient use of knowledge. Let me expand on this.</p>
<p>We care about local reasoning because it allows our ability to understand code to scale with the size of the code base. We can understand module A and module B in isolation, and our understanding does not change when we bring them together in the same program. By definition if both A and B allow local reasoning there is no way that B (or any other code) can change our understanding of A, and vice versa. If we don’t have local reasoning every new line of code can force us to revisit the rest of the code base to understand what has changed. This means it becomes exponentially harder to understand code as it grows in size as the number of interactions (and hence possible behaviours) grows exponentially. We can say that local reasoning is compositional. Our understanding of module A calling module B is just our understanding of A, our understanding of B, and whatever calls A makes to B.</p>
<p>We introduced numbers and Lego as examples of composition. They have an interesting property in common: the operations that we can use to combine them (for example, addition, subtraction, and so on for numbers; for Lego the operation is “sticking bricks together”) give us back the same kind of thing. A number multiplied by a number is a number. Two bits of Lego stuck together is still Lego. This property is called closure: when you combine things you end up with the same kind of thing. Closure means you can apply the combining operations (sometimes called combinators) an arbitrary number of times. No matter how many times you add one to a number you still …</p></div></div>

        <p>
          This article dives into the architecture and design of Radicle Link—the peer-to-peer replication
          protocol that powers Radicle. We discuss our decision to build on Git, how we ensure data availability,
          and how we replicate data across the network.

        <p>
          Behind every repository is a version control system—the most popular of these being Git, created in
          2005 by Linus Torvalds for the development of the Linux kernel. Git marked the rise of distributed version
          control systems as developers realized the centralized model of SVN and CVS didn't scale well with the
          number of contributors. In fact, Git was only created when Linus’ free <a href="http://www.bitkeeper.org/">Bitkeeper</a> license was revoked after a Linux kernel contributor tried to
          <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/git-origin-story">reverse engineer its networking protocols</a>.
          Git brought distributed version control to the forefront and changed the way software is developed today.

          Code collaboration platforms, or <q>forges</q>, started building on top of Git: they introduced
          search and discovery, canonicity, and social collaboration (issues &amp; code review) to Git-based workflows,
          albeit not always following the same distributed model that Git was designed for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radicle was designed to provide this same functionality while retaining Git’s peer-to-peer nature, building on
          what made distributed version control so powerful in the first place.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Git gossips well
        </h2>
        <p>
          The earliest version of Radicle adopted a generalized approach to replication—it wasn’t tailored to
          replicating collaboration artifacts or source code and as we discovered, was ill-suited to the demands of
          real-world code collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the current iteration is specifically designed for this use case. The most outstanding
          difference is the decision to <strong>use Git as our storage and replication layer</strong>, instead of a
          decentralized storage network such as IPFS. In our experimentation with decentralized storage, we realized
          that replicating Git repos on the storage layer didn't permit the use of <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Packfiles">packfiles</a>, one of the key protocols that
          makes Git useable at scale.  Essentially, this approach would make source code a second-class citizen—
          making it impractical to store repositories with large histories. The reason is simple: <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Transfer-Protocols">the packfile protocol is
          interactive</a>, which means before data is transferred between two parties, they determine exactly what needs
          to be sent over the wire, and the server puts together a packfile on the fly, before sending it downstream.
          This incredibly efficient approach isn't compatible with simple file storage protocols such as IPFS,
          which operate on the premise that content is usually <em>static</em>, unlike active code repositories that are
          constantly updated.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The dumb protocol is simple but a bit inefficient, and it can't handle writing of data from the client
            to the server.  The smart protocol is a more common method of transferring data, but it requires a process
            on the remote end that is intelligent about Git—it can read local data, figure out what the client has and
            needs, and generate a custom packfile for it.

          In order to keep Git's efficiency when it comes to data replication, while offering global decentralized
          repository storage, we chose to design Radicle as a peer-to-peer networking layer on top of Git's smart
          transfer protocol. Radicle would take care of discovering peers, offloading the actual data transfer to Git.

          <a href="https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-link">Radicle Link</a> is a peer-to-peer protocol with a
          generic distributed version control backend. It aims to be general enough to be used on top of systems such as
          <a href="https://pijul.org/">pijul</a> or <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">mercurial</a>, though
          it's initial implementation is focused on supporting Git.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radicle Link extends Git with <strong>peer-to-peer network discovery</strong>. Taking inspiration from <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, a peer-to-peer protocol for social networking, data is
          disseminated via a process called <strong>gossip</strong>. That is, participants in the network share and
          spread data they are "interested" in by keeping redundant copies locally and sharing deltas with peers. With
          Radicle, we replicate data across connected repositories according to a “social graph” of contributors and
          maintainers, enabling source code and changesets to be disseminated according to use and value: the more peers
          who are interested in a certain project, the more available this project is made to the network.
        </p>

        <h3>
          How it works
        </h3>
        <p>
          Repositories are the base <em>unit of replication</em> in Radicle. To publish a repository to the network, it
          must first be initialized as a <em>project</em>. Projects combine source code, issues and proposed changes
          under a single umbrella, and carry a unique, shareable peer-to-peer identifier. The entirety of the project
          data and metadata, including social artefacts such as comments, are stored within the repository. To create a
          project, the owner of a repository defines a <em>project identity</em>. In the background, a
          <em>project.json</em> file is created in a predetermined disjoint branch of the repository, by convention
          <code>rad/id</code>. This file contains important metadata such as the project name, list of maintainers, as
          well as any related links.
        </p>
        <p>
          The owner of the repository thus becomes the founder of the project and signs the initial version of the
          project metadata file (<em>project.json</em>) with their private key. The digest of the initial version,
          becomes the <em>Project ID</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the repository, a Radicle <em>project</em> includes the <em>identities</em> of all its
          maintainers: peers with designated rights over the project's identity. Initially, the only
          maintainer is the <em>founder</em>. By adding other maintainers to the project metadata, additional layers of
          trust can be introduced around the project. Any update to the project metadata <strong>must</strong> be signed
          by a quorum of maintainers, providing a cryptographically secure way to manage project state &amp; metadata,
          for example in the case of transferring ownership. The history of the metadata file is backed by the
          underlying DVCS, and is verified upon replication,  ensuring it was't tampered with.
        </p>

        <h3>Replication and validation</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure data integrity and authenticity in the peer-to-peer network, we adopt an algorithm similar to the
          root file update process from <a href="https://theupdateframework.io/">The Update Framework</a> (TUF). In this
          process, peers can fetch and verify the project metadata before replicating the latest changesets and
          revisions. This is important, since it effectively allows data to be served by <em>any peer</em>, in a secure
          manner. The physical location from which project data is fetched becomes irrelevant to the user.

        <h3>Tracking and discovery</h3>
        <p>
          When a project is published to the network the specific repository or <em>source tree</em> becomes
          identifiable by the maintainer of this tree. This allows repositories to be addressed by a shareable URL,
          which is then resolved to a physical location on the network, for the purpose of replication. This URL has the
          following form:
        </p>
        <pre>rad://&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;maintainer-id&gt;</pre>
        <p>
          Peers decide what data to replicate through the <strong>tracking</strong> of projects. Tracking a project
          signals interest, and means to impliestracking its maintainers, therefore replicating the data within their
          social graphs. In the context of a project, maintainers of a repository may choose to <strong>track</strong>
          the repositories of other owners (this is called a <strong>remote</strong> in Git terminology: a named
              reference to a remote repository). If the remote repository is found to track other remotes, the tracking
          repository shall also transitively track those, up to a configurable <em>N</em> degrees out.

        <h3>Availability</h3>
        <p>
          To improve data availability, participants in the network can choose to act as <strong>seeds</strong>. This is
          similar in concept to a <em>pub</em> in <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>: seeds
          are <q>always-on</q> nodes that automatically track discovered projects, thereby increasing the availability of
          these projects on the network. Since seeds may track a large number of repositories for a given project,
          replicating a project from a seed will greatly increase the connectedness of the tracking graph. Tracking a
          seed will also increase the number of paths leading back to the original upstream, ensuring that contributions
          can flow back up to the project maintainers even if they come from participants not within the set of tracked
          repositories of the maintainer.

        <h2>Offline and local-first</h2>
        <p>
          With the introduction of hosted platforms came new ‘enhanced’ workflows like pull requests, issue tracking,
          and code reviews. These workflows were unique because they were non-Git native but still tied to source code
          through rich user interfaces and features. As a result, they have further defined the common developer
          experience by making collaboration more than just code—the social interactions captured in issues,
          code …</p></article></div></section></div>

<h2 itemprop="headline">Top 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks in 2020</h2>

<div itemprop="description">
<p>Unique web app features become possible when developed as part of a robust framework. Software engineers choose the libraries and tools that best suit the final goal, and everything necessary to achieve it. Web solutions traditionally involve a custom approach, and consequently – a custom network. Since JavaScript frameworks are notoriously useful for building websites, web creators prefer them. But what framework is best for what project? Here’s what we found out. </p>
<div><p>JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted, lightweight, or just-in-time (JIT) compiled programming language, which utilizes first-class functions. JavaScript can undoubtedly be called the most popular programming language when it comes to building web pages and web applications. Not only that, but non-browser environments have widely used it. Some of the famous examples include Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, dynamic language, which happens to be multi-paradigm and single-threaded. It supports imperative, object-oriented, and declarative styles.</p><p>
In terms of demand, JavaScript can be put right after Python, which remains the most used programming language overall. In this article, we are going to talk about the Top 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks that are in demand in 2020. So, if you are a beginner looking to learn JavaScript and its frameworks, or a professional looking to update your knowledge about the latest JavaScript frameworks, you are in luck.</p><p>The criteria that we are going to use to stack up these 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks include:</p></div><ul><li>Popularity (based on reliable sites like Google Trends, NPM Trends and GitHub)</li>
<li>Establishment (this factor includes how mainstream or established a framework is in the programming community or industry)</li>
<li>Support (based on how much community support a particular framework has)</li>
<li>Future Prospects (this one includes the strength of the framework going towards the future, i.e., it is not fading away in the future).</li></ul><p>The top 10 JavaScript frameworks according to our above-discussed criteria are as following:</p>
<h2>React</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-react.jpg" alt="React JS"></p>
<div><p>While React might not be the earliest JavaScript framework in the industry of JS-based web frameworks, it is, for sure, the most powerful and disruptive framework at the moment. React was created by Jordan Walke and a group of Facebook engineers. React is a component-based framework with only one-way data flow, and react single-handedly changed the way front-end web development is done.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>It happens to be one of the most unbiased and neutral frameworks in which React-Core is just a component-based library for the View layer.</li>
<li>React also happens to be very versatile, which shows in their slogan ‘Learn Once, Write Anywhere,’ meaning that developers who have once learned React can then go on to create anything from websites, mobile apps, desktop applications, and back-end development.</li>
<li>It has recently introduced new features like React-Fiber for better concurrency, React hook for less boilerplate code, and suspense for better rendering.</li>
<li>React framework offers the best server-side rendering (SSR) along with excellent search engine optimization (SEO) support.</li>
<li>Finally, having the backing of Facebook, React framework is continuously under development and only keeps improving, thanks to the rigorous battle testing by 2.6 billion users of Facebook.</li></ol>
<h2>Node.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-node.jpg" alt="Node JS"></p>
<div><p>From the day JavaScript was created, there have been several attempts to use JS in server-side development. Still, none of them was very successful until 2009, when Ryan Dahl, created an asynchronous and event-driven server-side JavaScript runtime framework called Node.js.</p><p>
This brought JavaScript into the territory of server-side development, and from that day onwards, JavaScript and Node.js shot up in popularity. With many frameworks and libraries, including node package manager (NPM), node.js has left behind many more developed frameworks owing to its asynchronous and event-driven nature. Node.js is lightweight with a fast runtime, making it one of the best.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>As discussed earlier, its main feature is being an asynchronous and event-driven framework and can build scalable network applications.</li>
<li>Like react, Node.js is also cross-platform, and once you have mastered it, you can work on pretty much anything, including windows, macOS, iOS, Linux and Android, etc.</li>
<li>Because of its smaller size and a relatively faster startup, node.js is favorable in serverless computing.</li>
<li>Node.js is an open-source framework run by OpenJS Foundation and supported by tech giants like IBM, Microsoft, and Netflix, which makes its development and new advancements very easy.</li></ol>
<h2>Angular</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-angular.jpg" alt="Angular JS"></p>
<div><p>AngularJS was created by Google, as one of the earliest JavaScript frameworks, but the advent of frameworks like React exposed the design flaws that existed in AnuglarJS. It was in 2016 that the google team stroke back with an all-new SPA framework and called it Angular. While it might sound similar to the last one, these two are very different frameworks. Angular is slowly catching up to all the hype that frameworks like react and node.js enjoy, and it won’t be long before it might surpass them.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>It is an end-to-end framework with “out of the box” support to develop Enterprise Application. The Angular CLI happens to have one of the best command-line tools in all of JavaScript.</li>
<li>Angular is uniquely suited to enterprise-grade large codebase due to the separation of the template from styling and business logic.</li>
<li>Built-in features like DOM sanitization make Angular the most secure front-end framework.</li>
<li>While Google may not be backing Angular as some other tech giants back their frameworks, it does, however, release new features every now and then.</li>
<li>Angular 9 has introduced a new rendering engine called Ivy, which reduces startup time, response time, and bundle size.</li></ol>
<h2>Vue.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-vue-2.jpg" alt="Vue JS"></p>
<div><p>There was one thing that was common amongst all three of the frameworks we discussed before, and it was that they are all being backed by some huge tech giant, which ensures their continuous development and keeping them up to date. Vue.js, on the other hand, was created by an ex-Google engineer Evan You. You made the Vue.js by bringing together all the best parts of different JS frameworks that include view layer from AngularJS and virtual DOM from React. It is now considered one of the easiest frameworks that developers can use to work on front-end development and write SPA applications with minor effort.</p><p>
Vue.JS can work as an end-to-end framework with routing having the capabilities of both, i.e., state management like Angular or a view layer like React.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Vue.js offers the best in class documentation and progressive app development. It helps you progressively modernize your codebase, especially if you have a large legacy JavaScript codebase.</li>
<li>Vue.js is one of the few frameworks with equal support for both JavaScript and TypeScript.</li>
<li>It offers reactive two-way data binding (like Angular) and Virtual DOM, Event Sourcing (like React). It comes with two other features, including an opinionated end-to-end framework and a view layer with state management.</li>
<li>It is currently going under an overhaul and will return stronger than ever with Vue.js 3.0.</li></ol>
<h2>Next.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-next.jpg" alt="Next JS"></p>
<div><p>As we have established before that React is a very unopinionated framework where React-Core only offers the view layer. This left room for a framework that is based on React but is an end-to-end opinionated framework. That is where Next.js comes in, created by Tim Neutkens and a group of other engineers from a Dutch company called Zeit. Next.js is an end-to-end higher-level web framework on top of React and Node.js. It offers both static websites for desktop, mobile devices, and web as well as server-rendered.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Next.js was built with two of the most powerful JavaScript frameworks that are React and Node.js</li>
<li>Like many others before it, you only need to learn Next.js once, and then you can utilize its versatility to develop for pretty much any platform you want.</li>
<li>It offers server-side rendering with exceptional search engine optimization support and a quick startup.</li>
<li>Next.js supports data fetching and built-in CSS support that is easy-to-use.</li></ol>
<h2>Express</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-express.jpg" alt="Express JS"></p>
<div><p>Express.js is perhaps the only JavaScript framework with minimalistic web framework Sinatra in mind. It was created by TJ Holowaychuk and appeared shortly after Node.js came to be. It is a minimalistic web framework to develop REST API and web application, which makes it extremely fast and less opinionated. Many other JavaScript frameworks have used express as a base.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Express.js is so minimalistic that it could be considered default JavaScript Server Side Framework.</li>
<li>It is a complete application framework with everything from middleware to routing and template.</li>
<li>Express.js offers robust routing.</li>
<li>It also supports content negotiation.</li></ol>
<h2>Meteor</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-meteor.jpg" alt="Meteor JS"></p>
<div><p>Meteor happens to be the first isomorphic, and open-source full-stack JavaScript framework creating by a group of engineers in 2012. Meteor is wholly based on node.js and supports building end-to-end applications for all major platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile. Meteor also integrates well with front-end development frameworks like react etc.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Meteor offers full-stack framework for application development starting from the back-end and finishing till the front-end.</li>
<li>While it does have its engine for front end development, most developers integrate meteor with other popular-front end development platforms like Angular, React, or Svelte.</li>
<li>Like many other cross-platform frameworks, meteor also allows web development across all platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile.</li></ol>
<h2>Svelte</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-svelte-2.jpg" alt="Svelte JS"></p>
<div><p>Svelte was a groundbreaking idea ever since its inception, developed by a Guardian software engineer named Rich Harris. Svelte is a JavaScript framework with no framework-specific runtime. The main idea behind this creation was to use the svelte compiler, which would help compile the code that was framework …</p></div></div></div></article></div></div>

				<div>
					<p>My heart was racing. My palms sweating. I was going to be fired.</p><p>Performance reviews had just ended, and it was time to meet my manager and be told my results. Except I knew what it would say. How else do you rate a programmer who doesn’t code?</p><p>As I stood up from my desk, my eyes fell on my Ship-it plaque, congratulating me for helping release Windows 7. I had joined Microsoft a mere two weeks before it was released, a fresh college hire. There wasn’t a single character I had contributed to that code.</p><p>The plaque was a lie. Just like me.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1325w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My manager had booked a private conference room to share the results, far away from ears that might overhear anything said. Or begged. The long walk began, each step echoing down the corridor.</p><p>I racked my brains, grasping for an excuse to justify keeping my job. Instead my mind kept going back to the last bug I was supposed to fix. I’d spent all day failing to find the problem, finally giving in and asking a teammate for help. He found it in 10 minutes. I was way out of my league.</p><p>My boss must have seen it too, I bet that was why he assigned me, the kid, to help government auditors analyze our source code. Help <em>them</em>? I barely understood it myself! But this was more of a “people project.” If it didn’t require writing code, why waste real programmers on it? And so it came to me. I barely stayed afloat, constantly asking my manager for explanations and struggling to relay them to the auditors.</p><p>Yeah, I was doomed.</p><p>How would I tell my parents? Would I ever get another job? The only coding I did here was with an obsolete technology that no other company cared about; I didn’t even have the skills to land a new job.</p><p>What made me think I could work at Microsoft?</p><p>I reached the conference room, could I stall any longer? Huh, It’s the same room he interviewed me in two years ago. I doubt he remembers.</p><p>Okay, this is it. Deep breath, poker face on. No matter what, I wouldn’t let him <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares#tip-3-be-open-to-learning-during-the-interview">see me sweat</a>.</p><p>I stepped inside. Scott was sitting at the table, laptop carefully angled to hide the screen.</p><p>“Have a seat” he said, gesturing to his right. As I sat down, Scott looked straight at me. He opened his mouth to give me the news. But it wasn’t what I expected.</p><p>“Congratulations, you’ve been promoted”</p><p>Huh? No way I heard that right. Keep that poker face tight.</p><p>“Keep up the great work! Anything you’d like to ask?”</p><p>Wait but...when did I...what?</p><p>He hadn’t noticed? I wasn’t about to point out his mistake. Can’t let any surprise show.</p><p>“Great, thanks.” That was all I trusted myself to say.</p><p>I was safe. For now.</p><p>He’d catch on in a few months, I was sure. I couldn’t hide forever.</p><p>I spent the next few years preparing for that inevitable day, desperately trying to work on projects that could teach me the skills that would catch a recruiter’s eye. I had to become hireable.</p><p>I needed a stronger resume, with skills people cared about. I switched to a new team which built stuff for the cloud: Azure Web Apps. Companies love the cloud, right? Surely I’ll learn industry relevant skills there.</p><p>Fast forward four years: I still didn’t feel like I was anything special, yet I kept getting promoted. I kept fooling them somehow, the <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/hacking-the-bureaucracy-to-get-stuff-done/">bureaucratic</a> review process hiding my flaws. But something else also started happening, hinting that, just maybe, I wasn’t as clueless as I thought.</p><p>What changed?</p><p>People started coming to me for answers.</p><p>I still didn’t feel like I knew that much. I was just telling people about the stuff I’d worked on, occasionally pointing younger engineers towards tactics I had seen work well. That didn’t feel like anything original, but folks were finding it useful.</p><p>It got really weird when the more senior engineers started asking <em>me </em>about the code base. These were brilliant people who had often helped me over the years. Didn’t they already know everything?</p><p>I guess not, but they were still way above my league. It’s not like I knew enough to offer <em>them </em>real advice.</p><p>But still...my team seemed to think I was doing well. Would other companies think so too? Was I finally hireable? Only one way to find out: I started <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares">applying</a>.</p><p>I couldn’t believe the results when multiple job offers came in. And one was from Google! I couldn’t pass that one up. I made the switch.</p><p>During orientation, Google spent a lot of time discussing Impostor Syndrome, the feeling of accomplished people belittling their own talents and constantly being terrified of being discovered as a fraud. That’s a thing?</p><p>“Raise your hand if you have this feeling” Hah, yeah right, and have me be the only one raising my...oh, wow, that’s a lot of hands. Mine joined the crowd.</p><p>As I started working, impostor syndrome came up constantly. It was mentioned at company meetings, folks made memes admitting to it. It was everywhere.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/when-someone-comments-on-my-design-doc.gif" alt=""></figure><p>People freely admitted to not knowing stuff. Teammates admitted to not understanding the code, or having no idea how a tool worked. All the stuff I didn’t know, many others didn’t get either.</p><p>Seeing everyone admit their ignorance <strong>freed me</strong> from my own fear. Suddenly, feeling clueless seemed normal. &nbsp;It was a psychological quirk, not the truth.</p><p>My self-confidence grew. And gradually, without quite realizing it, something magical happened.</p><p>Impostor syndrome became a tool. I discovered the <strong>impostor’s advantage</strong>.</p><p>Did I notice feeling intimidated about asking a question? I started pushing myself to ask that question. Turns out other people had felt afraid as well, asking that question helped improve everyone’s understanding. &nbsp;When I started openly admitting to being unfamiliar with a tool or some code, my teammates felt like less of an impostor themselves. Their confidence went up. And they in turn became more likely to admit the same, creating a virtuous cycle boosting the entire team’s morale.</p><p>The impostor’s advantage was a super power.</p><p>And it offered new insights.</p><p>That feeling of being an impostor is your subconscious telling you something: It’s saying you’re about to push yourself past your comfort zone and into the growth zone. Now when an opportunity shows up and impostor syndrome starts twitching in the pit of my stomach, <strong>that’s a sign I should jump at it!</strong> This led me to take on <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer/#research-like-a-detective">bigger and more ambitious</a> projects, without worrying about being exposed. Somehow I still delivered results, helped by the various people I was no longer afraid to reach out to.</p><p>Every project still started with the thought, “I have no idea what to do here.” But then I’d remind myself, “no one else does either.” That was a surprising lesson about the more senior positions: <strong>Their work is so valuable </strong><em><strong>precisely because </strong></em><strong>no one knows exactly what needs to be done. It’s ambiguous.</strong> And it requires people who can still push through the uncertainty and forge a path forward.</p><p>They embrace the impostor’s advantage.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 666w"></figure><p>Looking back, I realize now that in my early days I'd been evaluating myself with biased glasses. &nbsp;<strong>I was comparing myself to people much more senior than me</strong>. Of course there would be a skill gap. <strong>If one person understood something, I assumed everyone knew it</strong>. That was false. As the “systems grow it’s impossible for one person to keep it all in their head”[1]; each person just knew the areas they had personally worked on.</p><p>My biggest mistake: <strong>I didn’t value the soft skills I brought to the table</strong>. Fresh out of college I had taken a significant load off my manager's plate by being the main point of contact with auditors and other teams. The fact that I was not writing code made me think I wasn’t doing anything useful, when in fact the soft skill of being able to work with them was incredibly valuable to the team.</p><p>As I continue working and taking on bigger projects, I suspect impostor syndrome will never completely go away. But now I take that as a good thing. An advantage. It’s a sign that I’m growing and stretching myself past my comfort zone.</p><p>And in thost darkest moments, when self doubt is at its highest, I remind myself:</p><p>I haven’t been fired yet.</p><p>[1] <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897">The Manager’s Path</a></em>, by &nbsp;Camille Fournier</p>
