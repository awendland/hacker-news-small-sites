<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/">← Back to Kevin's homepage</a><span>Published: 2021 March 7</span></p><p>I’ve spent the last year <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/">building keyboards</a>, which has included writing firmware for a variety custom circuit boards.</p>

<p>I initially wrote this firmware in Rust, but despite years of experience with that language I still struggled quite a bit.
I eventually got my keyboards working, but it took an embarrassingly long time and wasn’t <em>fun</em>.</p>

<p>After repeated suggestions from my much more Rust-and-computing-experienced friend <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/">Jamie Brandon</a>, I rewrote the firmware in <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>, which turned out swimmingly.</p>

<p>I found this quite surprising, given that I’d never seen Zig before and it’s a pre-1.0 language written by a <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_kelley">fellow PDX hipster</a> with basically just a <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.7.1/">single page of documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The experience went so well, in fact, that I now feel just as likely to turn to Zig (a language I’ve used for a dozen hours) as to Rust (which I’ve used for at least a thousand hours).</p>

<p>This, of course, reflects as much about me and my interests as it does about either of these languages.
So I’ll have to explain what I want from a systems programming language in the first place.</p>

<p>Also, to explain why I struggled with Rust I’ll have to show a lot of complex code that I’m obviously unhappy about.
My intent here is not to gripe about Rust, but to establish my (lack of) credibility: It’s so you can judge for yourself whether I’m using Rust’s features in a reasonable way or if I’ve totally lost the plot.</p>

<p>Finally, while it risks falling into the dreadfully boring “language X is better than Y” blog trope, I feel that it’d be more helpful to some readers if I explicitly compare Rust and Zig, rather than write a wholly positive “Zig’s great!” article.
(After all, I’d steadily ignored six months of Jamie gushing about Zig because, “that’s great buddy, but I already know Rust and I just want to get my keyboard done, okay?”)</p>

<h2>What I want from a systems language</h2>

<p>I was educated as a physicist and learned programming so I could make data visualizations.
My first languages were PostScript and Ruby (dynamic, interpreted languages) and I later moved to JavaScript so I could draw on the web.
That led me to Clojure (using ClojureScript to draw on the web), where I’ve spent much of my career.</p>

<p>In 2017 I decided to learn a systems language.
Partly this was intellectual curiosity — I wanted to become more familiar with concepts like the stack, heap, pointers, and static types which had remained mucky to me as a web developer.
But mostly it was because I wanted the capabilities that systems languages promised:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To write code that was <em>fast</em>; that could take advantage of how computers actually worked and run as fast as the hardware allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>To write applications that could run in minimal environments like microcontrollers or web assembly where it just isn’t feasible (in time or space) to carry along a garbage collector, language runtime, etc.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My interest was not (and still isn’t) in operating systems, programming language design, or safety (with respect to memory, formal verfiability, modeling as types, etc.).</p>

<p>I just wanted to blink the litle squares on the screen on and off very quickly.</p>

<p>Based on its growing popularity in the open source community and tons of beginners-to-systems-programming documentation, I picked up Rust around version 1.18.</p>

<p>Since then, Rust has undoubtedly helped me achieve those capabilities I was after: I was able to compile it to WASM for a <a href="https://github.com/lynaghk/subform-layout">layout engine</a>, build and sell a <a href="https://keminglabs.com/finda">fast desktop search app</a> (Rust <a href="https://keminglabs.com/blog/building-a-fast-electron-app-with-rust/">shoved into Electron</a>), and compile Rust to an stm32g4 microcontroller to drive a <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/newsletter/2020_02_robot_update/">track saw robot</a> (I even <a href="https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32-rs/pull/335">found a typo</a> in the register definitions; the full “hard-mode” embedded debugging experience!).</p>

<p>Despite all this, I still don’t feel <em>comfortable</em> with Rust.
It feels fractally complex — seemingly every time I use Rust on a new project, I run into some issue that forces me to confront a new corner of the language/ecosystem.
Developing my keyboard firmware was no exception: I ran into two problems, and each required learning a completely new language feature.</p>

<p>These problems aren’t really specific to embedded, but they’re representative of the sorts of challenges I’ve run into using Rust over the past three years.</p>

<p>If you want the gory embedded details or understand why I’m writing my own firmware using newfangled languages at all, see my notes on <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/">building keyboards</a>.</p>

<h2>Conditional compilation</h2>

<p>The first challenge I ran into with Rust was getting my firmware to run on hardware varying from 4-button dev-kit PCBs to the left/right halves of a wireless split to a single <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/">Atreus</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/rust-zig/typical_keyboards.jpg" alt="Various keyboard hardware"></p>

<p>Varying the features of firmware at compile-time is known as “conditional compilation”.
(It needs to be done at compile-time rather than run-time because microcontrollers have limited program space, roughly 10–100kB in my case.)</p>

<p>Rust’s solution to this problem is “features”, which are defined in <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[dependencies]</span>
<span>cortex-m</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.6"</span>
<span>nrf52840-hal</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.11"</span><span>,</span> <span>optional</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>default-features</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span>
<span>nrf52833-hal</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.11"</span><span>,</span> <span>optional</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>default-features</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span>
<span>arraydeque</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.4"</span><span>,</span> <span>default-features</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span>
<span>heapless</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.5"</span>

<span>[features]</span>
<span>keytron</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52833"]</span>
<span>keytron-dk</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52833"]</span>
<span>splitapple</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52840"]</span>
<span>splitapple-left</span> <span>=</span> <span>["splitapple"]</span>
<span>splitapple-right</span> <span>=</span> <span>["splitapple"]</span>

<span># specify a default here so that rust-analyzer can build the project; when building use --no-default-features to turn this off</span>
<span>default</span> <span>=</span> <span>["keytron"]</span>

<span>nrf52840</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52840-hal"]</span>
<span>nrf52833</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52833-hal"]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>For example, the <code>keytron</code> feature is enabled for a specific keyboard hardware design.
That hardware depends on the <code>nrf52833</code> feature (representing a kind of a microcontroller), which depends on the <code>nrf52833-hal</code> crate (actual code which maps that microcontroller’s peripheral memory addresses to Rust types).</p>

<p>My Rust code can then use attribute annotations to conditionally enable stuff.
E.g., a namespace can import the microcontroller-specific crate:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"nrf52833"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>nrf52833_hal</span>::<span>pac</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>hw</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"nrf52840"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>nrf52840_hal</span>::<span>pac</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>hw</span><span>;</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>or call the appropriate key scanning routine:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>read_keys</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>Packet</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>device</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>unsafe</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>hw</span>::<span>Peripherals</span>::<span>steal</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>};</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>#[cfg(any(feature = </span><span>"keytron"</span><span>, feature = </span><span>"keytron-dk"</span><span>))]</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>u</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>p0</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>device</span><span>.</span><span>P0</span><span>.</span><span>in_</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>bits</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>p1</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>device</span><span>.</span><span>P1</span><span>.</span><span>in_</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>bits</span><span>();</span><span></span>

<span>        </span><span>//invert because keys are active low</span>
<span>        </span><span>gpio</span>::<span>P0</span>::<span>pack</span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>p0</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>gpio</span>::<span>P1</span>::<span>pack</span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>p1</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>};</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"splitapple"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>u</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>gpio</span>::<span>splitapple</span>::<span>read_keys</span><span>();</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>Packet</span><span>(</span><span>u</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Getting this conditional compilation working required learning a lot of stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li>the attribute annotation conditional mini-language (the <code>any</code> in <code>#[cfg(any(feature = "keytron", feature = "keytron-dk"))]</code>)</li>
<li>the <code>optional = true</code> that must be added to the device crates in <code>Cargo.toml</code> (even though the source is already conditionally requiring them!)</li>
<li>how to enable features when building a static binary (<code>cargo build --release --no-default-features --features "keytron"</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>I still have many unresolved questions, too!</p>

<p>At some point I gave up trying to pass device peripherals as function arguments because I couldn’t figure out how to add conditional attributes to types — the “obvious” thing doesn’t work:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>read_keys</span><span>(</span><span>port</span>: <span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"splitapple"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>                   </span><span>nrf52840_hal</span>::<span>pac</span>::<span>P1</span><span></span>
<span>                   </span><span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"keytron"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>                   </span><span>nrf52833_hal</span>::<span>pac</span>::<span>P0</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>Packet</span><span> </span><span>{}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>There’s a neat embedded framework, <a href="https://rtic.rs/0.4/book/en/preface.html">RTIC</a>, whose main entry point is an <code>app</code> annotation that takes the device crate as an, uh, argument:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[app(device = nrf52833)]</span><span></span>
<span>const</span><span> </span><span>APP</span>: <span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>//your code here...</span>
<span>};</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>How does one conditionally vary this argument at compile-time?
I have no idea.</p>

<h2>Types and macros</h2>

<p>Rust also proved challenging even within a single hardware configuration.</p>

<p>Consider scanning a keyboard matrix: If we don’t have enough microcontroller pins to connect each keyboard switch directly to a pin, we can arrange the switches with diodes (one-way valves) into a matrix:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/rust-zig/key_matrix.png" alt="circuit schematic of key matrix"></p>

<p>We then set a single column high and read out the the rows to find state of the switches on that column.</p>

<p>In this example, if we set pin 1.10 high (col0) and then read pin 0.13 (row1) as high, we know that switch K8 is pressed.</p>

<p>Pretty simple in theory, but complex in Rust because:</p>

<ol>
<li>Device crates expose hardware peripherals as distinct types</li>
<li>One does not simply compute with distinct types in Rust</li>
</ol>

<p>Say I need to initialize all the columns as output pins.</p>

<p>Doing this for a single pin, say peripheral port P0’s pin 10, is simple enough:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>P0</span><span>.</span><span>pin_cnf</span><span>[</span><span>10</span><span>].</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>w</span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>input</span><span>().</span><span>disconnect</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>dir</span><span>().</span><span>output</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>w</span><span></span>
<span>});</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>But my column pins are spread across two ports, so what I <em>want</em> to write:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>port</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>pin</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>[(</span><span>P0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>P1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>7</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>..</span><span>.]</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>port</span><span>.</span><span>pin_cnf</span><span>[</span><span>pin</span><span>].</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>w</span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>input</span><span>().</span><span>disconnect</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>dir</span><span>().</span><span>output</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>w</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>});</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>isn’t going to fly because now the tuples have different types — <code>(P0, usize)</code> and <code>(P1, usize)</code> — and so they can’t hang together in the same collection.</p>

<p>Here’s the solution I came up with:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>PinIdx</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>u8</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>type</span> <span>Port</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>u8</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>const</span><span> </span><span>COL_PINS</span>: <span>[(</span><span>Port</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>PinIdx</span><span>);</span><span> </span><span>7</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>[(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>13</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>15</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>29</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>17</span><span>)];</span><span></span>

<p>Yup, good ol’ copy-paste to the rescue.</p>

<p>But wait, I hear you asking, what about <em>macros</em>?
Oh yes, my friend, I shaved the macro yak in the actual scanning routine:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>read_keys</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; …</pre></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/">← Back to Kevin's homepage</a><span>Published: 2021 March 7</span></p><p>The electronics design and fabrication technologies available to motivated individuals today is incredible.
Compared to even just 6 years ago when I <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/phonetron/">made a cell phone</a>, we amateurs now have access to powerful CAD/CAM, low-cost/qty PCB assembly, sorta-usable free EDA software, powerful new embedded languages, and a huge corpus of tacit knowledge on YouTube.</p>

<p>I’ve spent the last year exploring this frontier by building wireless mechanical keyboards.
I’ve designed a dozen PCBs, written bare-metal microcontroller firmware in three languages, and commissioned or fabricated myself a ton of parts from aluminum, acrylic, Corian, resin, and fabric:</p>

<p>This page isn’t a tutorial or comprehensive reference on any particular technical topic (though I’ll link to my favorites below).
Rather, it’s a rough diary and reflection on the process.
My hope is that:</p>

<ol>
<li>it gives you a flavor of the overall experience and demystifies the work between “idea” and “functioning prototype”</li>
<li>you’ll discover at least one weird trick that you can apply to your own projects</li>
</ol>

<h2>Motivation: Why keyboards?</h2>

<p>I’ll start with a little secret: I don’t care much about keyboards.
Most of my typing is on an 11" Macbook Air from 2013, though my fingers sometimes grace client-provided hardware like Dell laptops, IBM/Lenovo ThinkPads, and newer Macs with those butterfly keyboards that Twitter/HN people got real mad about.
They’re all fine, really.</p>

<p>I first learned of the custom keyboard scene when I convinced a friend to <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/notes/pricing-niche-products/">sell his keyboards for $1,668</a>, but personally never developed any burning desire to acquire (or bring into existence) a keyboard the way my friend and his fans did.</p>

<p>Rather, keyboards appeal to me as a playground of design constraints and technical challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Electrically, keyboards can be wired (drawing power and communicating over USB) or wireless, the latter raising issues of power (selecting batteries, charging and load-sharing circuitry, etc.) and communication (to host devices and between halves of a split keyboard).</p></li>
<li><p>Physically, keyboards have functional size constraints (relating to one’s fingers) but are not subject to serious mechanical loads, so a huge variety of materials and designs can be explored for aesthetic qualities (visual look, key feel, typing sound, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Functionally, keyboard logic can range from simple “press key for character” behavior all the way to elaborate schemes involving multiple layers, tapping keys, special sequences, and even acting as a computer mouse.
(See the open source <a href="https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/guides">QMK firmware</a> for the more popular tricks.)
In addition to its behavior as an input device, a keyboard might also need to handle activities like Bluetooth pairing, signaling battery status, and blinking lights in amusing ways.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While these three domains — electronics, physical design/fabrication, and firmware — are all interesting to me on their own, they become even more fascinating combined together.</p>

<p>It’s immensely satisfying, for example, to find optimizations and novel product functionality by synthesizing knowledge across these disciplines:</p>

<ul>
<li>restricting the hardware to a subset of GPIO pins simplifies the firmware, allowing it to run faster and consume less battery</li>
<li>PCBs can function load-bearing mechanical parts</li>
<li>I’d never heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication">NFC</a>, but after discovering it in my microcontroller’s datasheet I was inspired to develop a “type on your phone by tapping it to the keyboard” quick-switching feature</li>
</ul>

<p>As a problem space, keyboards have a “low floor and high ceiling”.</p>

<p>Finally, as a long-time web developer I’m attracted to the minimalism of embedded hardware products.
Application code running in a web browser is subject to the whims of operating system schedulers, JavaScript JITs, and millions of lines of “system” code running underneath.
Working in such a complex environment, it’s easy to develop a learned helplessness around performance, understandability, and even determinism.</p>

<p>While surely some of this is “grass-is-greener” thinking — yes, I’m aware of cosmic rays, bad solder joints, and thermal variation — I’ve found it an enjoyable change of pace to switch from StackOverflow comments and ever-changing dependencies to bare-metal code (mostly mine) running on physical hardware (also mine) that I can power-cycle instantly, documented by 1000-page datasheets which discuss worst-case timing guarantees in microseconds.</p>

<h2>Retrospective overview + timeline</h2>

<p>My <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/newsletter/2020_04_keyboards_rethinking_desktops/">original product concept</a> was a “split ergonomic travel keyboard”, but I ended up spending far more time on technical pursuits and process development than I did getting a tightly-scoped product out the door.
However, I managed to complete three functional prototypes:</p>

<h3>v1</h3>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/v1.jpg" alt="V1 keyboard"></p>

<p>My initial focus was on maximally compact mechanical keyboard.
I chose a 5x5 grid (no real reason) of Kailh’s low-profile “Choc” switches and selected components that would fit between the stems of the switches on the PCB backside.</p>

<p>This keyboard involved a lot of personal firsts: Using KiCAD, designing an nRF52-based board and firmware, designing a battery protection and charging circuit (my first use of a P-type MOSFET), drawing footprints for a mid-mount USB connector, etc.</p>

<p>In hindsight I’m amazed it all actually worked on the first revision, and I’m still tickled that I sourced custom, adorable-sized 2 x 13 x 80 mm lithium polymer cells ($200 for 50pcs from <a href="https://www.fentcell.com/">Battsys</a>).</p>

<p>This v1 PCB worked great as a platform on which to develop firmware and refine my understanding of the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and USB protocols  (as exposed via Nordic Semiconductor’s SDK — I’m not yet ambitious enough to bit-bang the radio antenna myself).</p>

<h3>The “Split Apple”</h3>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/split_apple.jpg" alt="Split Apple keyboard"></p>

<p>As soon I paired with a computer and actually tried using the v1 split keyboard , I realized I couldn’t be bothered to re-learn how to type on 50 ortholinear keys.
So, for the next iteration, I decided to just split of Apple’s keyboard layout.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not all the necessary keycap sizes were available for Choc switches, so I had to make this one with taller Cherry MX switches.
Rather than wait ~5 weeks for PCBWay assembly, I designed with parts from JLCPCB’s catalog (~1 week turnaround) and soldered myself the nRF52840 dongle.</p>

<p>Because JLCPCB doesn’t assemble USB connectors, the Split Apple also pushed me to implement wireless charging hardware and over-the-air firmware updates (with associated bootloader stack).</p>

<p>By this point I’d found an sign shop here in Taipei that was happy to same-day laser cut acrylic from PDF drawings, and I relied on them extensively for cheap and fast (about $5 per 150mm laser-cut acrylic part) material mock-ups while prototyping the keyboard’s “PCB + acrylic + acrylic” stack-up construction (an idea I stole from this <a href="https://github.com/PancakeLegend/Keyboards/wiki/MiT-Ortholinear:-Assembly-Guide">PancakeLegend keyboard</a>).</p>

<p>Because of the complexity of its layout (not just a 5x5 grid) and stacked-layer construction, the Split Apple forced me to develop a programmatic process to carry designs from <a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/">keyboard-layout-editor.com</a> (of course that’s a thing) to my PCB and mechanical CAD software.
This process came in quite handy for all subsequent work.</p>

<h3>The Atreus</h3>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/atreus.jpg" alt="Atreus keyboard"></p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/bamboo_atreus.jpg" alt="Atreus keyboard"></p>

<p>In November I got access to a desktop CNC mill and immediately started exploring designs using Corian, an artificial stone-like material typically found in fancy kitchen countertops.
I wanted to explore fabricating a small production run (~50 keyboards?) myself, so I machined <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/">Phil Hagelberg’s Atreus</a> design as a prototype design, for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The keyless area in the middle highlights the Corian material and (internally) provides room for standard-sized lithium polymer batteries (a fallback I wanted in case shipping my custom lil’ ones proved too difficult).</li>
<li>A single-piece keyboard is half the assembly/QA work of a two-piece keyboard.</li>
<li>The Atreus design seemed as good as any other on which to ramp up machining capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>The production framing encouraged me to optimize my design for manufacture (minimize the number of setups and endmills), develop fixtures, and really dial in the feeds &amp; speeds to maximize the material removal rate.</p>

<p>To keep the Atreus from slipping around a desk, I also investigated several silicone and polyurethane materials and mold design techniques.</p>

<h3>Timeline</h3>

<ul>
<li>2020 March: Rust “hello world” LED blinking on nRF52 dongle</li>
<li>April: BLE and USB stack running on nRF52 dongle</li>
<li>May: Design and order first custom PCB (v1)</li>
<li>June: While waiting for v1, make <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/touchpad/">touchpad</a> as an excuse to try JLCPCB’s assembly service</li>
<li>July: Reorganize firmware architecture (have Nordic’s Makefile link to Rust rather than Rust compile Nordic’s code)</li>
<li>August: BLE for split board</li>
<li>Sept: Try to use v1 keyboard, implement layers, keymaps, etc.</li>
<li>Oct: Design full-sized Apple-layout split keyboard and matrix-scanning firmware</li>
<li>Nov: Start pushing on industrial design: laser cut acrylic and metal prototypes, get access to a CNC machine</li>
<li>Dec: Optimize machining and workholding for Corian designs, rewrite firmware in Zig </li>
<li>2021 Jan: Machine Atreus and design its PCB, consider production run, product photography</li>
<li>Feb: Write this retrospective</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/">r/MechanicalKeyboards</a> subreddit loves anodized aluminum.
Yes, amazing material: lightweight, strong, corrosion resistant, etc., etc.
But also sorta boring — I mean, we can already buy those keyboards at the Apple store!</p>

<p>I’m much more interested in materials like leather, cork, Corian, and fabric.</p>

<p>Finding such materials and related tooling was difficult in the first few months after I moved Taiwan (<a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/newsletter/2020_11_online_retail/">I miss McMaster-Carr</a>), but eventually I managed with a lot of legwork and Google Translate-mediated conversations.</p>

<p>I hoped leather might serve as a non-slip “bottom” that could be stitched around or glued to the v1 PCBs:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/leather_base.jpg" alt="leather bottom"></p>

<p>however the thick, already stiff leather became brittle after laser cutting (also, the smell!) and wasn’t actually very grippy (I suspect the v1 PCB is simply …</p></div></div>

   </p>
   <p id="post-excerpt">
    It seems to be widely accepted that creating a powerful, useful Emacs setup "by hand" is just too much trouble, and you should choose a "distro" like Doom Emacs. But is it really all so bad? If you go the route of "hand-made", will you suffer through endless nights of fixing your setup? The answer is: probably not, but read on for more details! <a href="#footnote-1"><sup id="footnote-ref-1">1</sup></a>
   </p>
   
   <h3 id="why-custom-">
    <a href="#why-custom-">→ </a>Why Custom?
   </h3>
   <p>
    I've got a lot of respect for the various Emacs "distros" out there, but my inclination for DIY as well as for understanding my tools keeps me from going that route. I'd rather spend some time reading and researching than running a prefab setup that's effectively a mystery to me.
   </p>
   <p>
    At the end of the day I do spend time on my configuration, but it's hardly the part-time job folks make it out to be. And throughout the years, I've learned a substantial amount about how Emacs actually works.
   </p>
   <p>
    Prefab setups are usually nice until you hit some usability wall, or find a leak in the abstraction. Sometimes, you end up putting as much effort into learning your abstraction as you would have put into just learning the thing you tried to abstract. This is why I'm fine with getting my hands dirty with Emacs.
   </p>
   <h3 id="desired-features">
    <a href="#desired-features">→ </a>Desired Features
   </h3>
   <p>
    Before getting into the details of customizing Emacs, it's good to lay out some goals. This will help keep the project focused and prevent you from bloating your setup with things you don't really need. For me, the list looks something like this:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Automated, idempotent setup that can be repeated easily
    </li>
    <li>
     Declaratively install packages
    </li>
    <li>
     LSP support for languages that have a supporting server, powerful autocompletion for those that don't
    </li>
    <li>
     Quality-of-life packages and modes
    </li>
    <li>
     A wealth of custom keybindings to make life better
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    I personally don't need a full-on project management system, or deep IDE-like integration, but indeed all of that is available if you'd want it. Anyways, with these goals in mind, let's begin to discuss implementation.
   </p>
   <h4 id="automatic--idempotent-setup">
    <a href="#automatic--idempotent-setup">→ </a>Automatic, Idempotent Setup
   </h4>
   <p>
    I want to be able to erase my entire setup, clone it down from a git repo, run Emacs, and be back to where I was before I nuked it all (assuming I've got no local, uncommitted changes). Additionally: I want to have a lockfile-like setup for freezing package versions.
   </p>
   <h5 id="straight-el">
    <a href="#straight-el">→ </a>straight.el
   </h5>
   <p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el">straight.el</a> package manager is extremely powerful and allows for extreme reproducibility. It does so via:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Installing packages via git clone versus a tarball or some other archive <a href="#footnote-2"><sup id="footnote-ref-2">2</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Easy integration of customized packages into your own setup, if desired <a href="#footnote-3"><sup id="footnote-ref-3">3</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A lockfile for controlling versions of each package <a href="#footnote-4"><sup id="footnote-ref-4">4</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Integration with <code>use-package</code> (more on that <a href="">later</a>) <a href="#footnote-5"><sup id="footnote-ref-5">5</sup></a>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    The straight.el bootstrap process allows for a totally self-installing setup. For example, with my configuration you just clone my repo to <code>~/.emacs.d</code> and run Emacs; straight.el bootstraps itself and handles installing everything that I need.
   </p>
   <p>
    Check out the exquisite straight.el documentation or <a href="https://hristos.co/init.el">my own init.el</a> file for details about how to get setup. It can do far more than what I've described here, so prepare for a deep dive. <a href="#footnote-6"><sup id="footnote-ref-6">6</sup></a>
   </p>
   <h4 id="declarative-package-installation">
    <a href="#declarative-package-installation">→ </a>Declarative Package Installation
   </h4>
   <p>
    As described above and in the project README, straight.el brings a nice element of reproducibility and control over packages and versions, but to take it even further I handle all package installations and their related config with <a href="https://jwiegley.github.io/use-package/">use-package</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
    Integrating use-package with straight.el does require some configuration; again: see the straight.el documentation or <a href="https://hristos.co/init.el">my own init.el</a> file for specifics. I strongly advise giving the project README a good look, it is high-quality documentation. <a href="#footnote-7"><sup id="footnote-ref-7">7</sup></a>
   </p>
   <h5 id="use-package--installing">
    <a href="#use-package--installing">→ </a>use-package: Installing
   </h5>
   <p>
    use-package is extremely powerful and also very simple to use. The straight.el integration is done well too; consider this example for setting up OCaml support:
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> tuareg <span>:</span>defer t <span>:</span>straight t<span>)</span>
</code></pre>
   <p>
    The use-package syntax is simple and explicit, but what's happening here?
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     I'm installing the <code>tuareg-mode</code> package <a href="#footnote-8"><sup id="footnote-ref-8">8</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     I'm telling use-package to not load this package until it's needed
    </li>
    <li>
     I'm telling straight.el to handle the installation
    </li>
    <li>
     By default, straight.el will try to find the package on Github
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Of course that's a very simple example; the use-package readme describes all the various features you can use to tune your setup.
   </p>
   <h5 id="use-package--configuring">
    <a href="#use-package--configuring">→ </a>use-package: Configuring
   </h5>
   <p>
    use-package allows configuring packages before and after they are loaded via the <code>:init</code> and <code>:config</code> keyword arguments, respectively.
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> flycheck-status-emoji
  <span>:</span>straight t
  <span>:</span>config
  <span>(</span><span>flycheck-status-emoji-mode</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre>

<pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> marginalia
  <span>:</span>straight t
  <span>:</span>init
  <span>(</span><span>marginalia-mode</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre>
   <h5 id="use-package--key-binds">
    <a href="#use-package--key-binds">→ </a>use-package: Key Binds
   </h5>
   <p>
    use-package also allows for configuring key binds on package load:
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> windmove
  <span>:</span>straight t
  <span>:</span>bind
  <span>(</span><span>"M-e"</span> . windmove-left<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>"M-u"</span> . windmove-right<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>"M-k"</span> . windmove-up<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>"M-j"</span> . windmove-down<span>))</span>
</code></pre>
   <p>
    All keybinds then live in your configuration, nicely inside the package declarations themselves.
   </p>
   <h5 id="use-package--hooks">
    <a href="#use-package--hooks">→ </a>use-package: Hooks
   </h5>
   <p>
    The last feature I'm going to discuss is use-package's syntax for hooks:
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> html-mode
  <span>:</span>no-require t
  <span>:</span>hook <span>(</span><span>web-mode</span> . skewer-html-mode<span>))</span>
</code></pre>
   <p>
    This should be starting to feel familiar, and again it's nice to have hooks defined with the related packages in an idiomatic way.
   </p>
   <h4 id="language-server">
    <a href="#language-server">→ </a>Language Server
   </h4>
   <p>
    But enough about the awesomeness of straight.el and use-package! One of the main things I wanted when I moved to Emacs was a powerful system for auto-completing code. Emacs has several ways to achieve this, but what I've come to use for almost every mode is <a href="https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/">lsp-mode</a> for integrating <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server</a> capabilities into Emacs.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm using lsp-mode with almost all of the languages I work with regularly, except Lua. At least for now and for me, the current LSP experience with Lua wasn't as good as using company-mode. I'll definitely revisit that in the future though.
   </p>
   <p>
    There's isnt much else to say that isn't better said on the project documentation: but you can also refer to <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~hristoast/dot-emacs/tree/2bb9a7dd5ca8cb281c4f8a9a8bea0508464b5c63/item/lib/h-lsp.el">my configuration</a> for usage examples if desired.
   </p>
   <h4 id="quality-of-life">
    <a href="#quality-of-life">→ </a>Quality Of Life
   </h4>
   <p>
    Aside from that, there are a number of other things I've tuned to make my Emacs experience more to my liking:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     A dark theme for the editing area <a href="#footnote-9"><sup id="footnote-ref-9">9</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A dark theme for the mode line <a href="#footnote-10"><sup id="footnote-ref-10">10</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A dashboard or "startup page" <a href="#footnote-11"><sup id="footnote-ref-11">11</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Emoji icons for Flycheck status <a href="#footnote-12"><sup id="footnote-ref-12">12</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A handful of helper functions
    </li>
    <li>
     ws-butler, to clean up whitespace in edited files <a href="#footnote-13"><sup id="footnote-ref-13">13</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     "TODO" keyword highlighting <a href="#footnote-14"><sup id="footnote-ref-14">14</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Rainbow parenthesis <a href="#footnote-15"><sup id="footnote-ref-15">15</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Yasnippet for inserting various snippets <a href="#footnote-16"><sup id="footnote-ref-16">16</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     And many many more
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Software that's as endlessly customizeable as Emacs allows for all kinds of personal tweaks and touches. Over the year's I've built up my own collection of these and it continues to grow as I learn new things about Emacs.
   </p>
   <h4 id="custom-keybindings">
    <a href="#custom-keybindings">→ </a>Custom Keybindings
   </h4>
   <p>
    Last but not least: most folks will end up wanting to change a key binding at some point. Some go as far as to change the entire paradigm of the keybinds to do something like offer Vim bindings.
   </p>
   <p>
    I keep most of the default Emacs bindings but have changed more than a handful to suit my own needs. Some of these are defined with their related packages, others are just general additions or changes to some default Emacs binding. <a href="#footnote-17"><sup id="footnote-ref-17">17</sup></a>
   </p>
   <p>
    If you've never done so, I highly encourage taking a look at <code>M-x describe-bindings RET</code>. It's a high-level view of all bindings in your setup.
   </p>
   <h3 id="conclusion">
    <a href="#conclusion">→ </a>Conclusion
   </h3>
   <p>
    This was definitely not written for the unitiated, but I hope it was somewhat useful as a reference to "modding" Emacs.
   </p>
   <p>
    In particular, I'd like to highlight the power and usefulness of managing the editor configuration with Lisp code rather than clicking endlessly through some user interface (the general experience of most other editors).
   </p>
   <p>
    Having Lisp specifically and having it so tightly integrated with Emacs is where the majority of this power comes from. Learning to use it and work with it has been and continues to be a really great experience for me.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>‍<strong>A few personal thoughts on why self-supervised learning will have a strong impact on AI. From recent NLP to computer vision papers.</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>This is not a prediction but rather a summary of personal findings and trends from research and industry. </p><p>‍</p><p>First, let’s discuss the difference between self-supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Whether there actually is a difference between the two is still an open discussion.<br><strong>Unsupervised learning</strong> is the idea of models learning without any supervision. Clustering algorithms are often an example of unsupervised learning. There is no supervision or training involved on how clusters are formed (at least not for simple methods such as K-Means).<br>In <strong>self-supervised learning</strong>, we use the data itself as a label. We essentially turn unsupervised learning into supervised learning by leveraging something called a proxy task. A proxy task is different from the downstream or model task because we are not interested in the proxy itself. </p><p>‍</p><p>In <strong>NLP</strong> popular methods such as Googles <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf" target="_blank">BERT, 2019</a> use a pre-training procedure where the model would predict missing words within a sentence or the next sentence based on the current sentence. We can create a sentence with a missing word by simply removing a single word from it. Now the ground truth information (our label) is the missing word. We can train the model in a self-supervised way.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/60070083605e885ce378d565_1*PyNyC1q8d5nY7PoqaQZjbQ.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Image from the original BERT paper</figcaption></figure><p>In <strong>computer vision</strong>, we can apply the very same technique to train a model. We take an image and remove part of it (we essentially color it with a single color). The task of the model is to predict the missing pixels (we call this image inpainting). Since we have access to the original image and the missing pixels (ground truth) we can train the model in a supervised way. The paper <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Pathak_Context_Encoders_Feature_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf" target="_blank">Context Encoders: Feature Learning by Inpainting, CVPR, 2016</a> is an example of such a self-supervised training procedure using inpainting. Unfortunately, this approach in computer vision doesn’t work that well. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/600700831fbe4b9d4b33d8d0_1*6Cm9WFWYQtzmW-xuPwd_fA.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>From original paper Context Encoders. The illustration shows how the model has to reconstruct the white area in the image. To fulfill the task it needs to understand the context (needs to learn good representations).</figcaption></figure><p>Newer methods use image augmentations. A single image would go twice through an augmentation pipeline. We end up with two new versions of the original image (we call them views). If we do the same for multiple images we can train a model to find the pairs which belong to the same original image (before augmentation). We essentially learn the model to be invariant to whatever augmentation we choose.</p><p>‍</p><p>Now, let’s have a look at the advantages self-supervised learning can bring to the world of AI.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Lifelong Learning</h3><p>When we talk about AI we all think about some smart system learning over time and improving itself. Unfortunately, this is quite difficult. Supervised learning systems require new labels for new data to be trained on. Improving the systems require continuous re-labeling and re-training. <br>However, using self-supervision we don’t require human labels anymore. There has been some great work into that direction from <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/" target="_blank">Alexey Efros Lab</a> like the following paper using self-supervised learning for adapting to new environments in reinforcement learning: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05363.pdf" target="_blank">Curiosity-driven Exploration by Self-supervised Prediction, ICML, 2017</a> </p><p>‍</p><h3>Data Labeling</h3><p>Supervised learning requires ground-truth data. We call them labels or annotations and in domains such as computer vision, they are mostly generated by humans. A single label can cost between a few cents and up to multiple dollars. It all depends on how much time the annotation task takes and how much expertise is required. Whereas lots of people can draw a bounding box around a car and a pedestrian fewer can do the same for medical images.<br>Self-supervised learning can help to reduce the required amount of labeling. On one hand, we can pre-train a model on unlabeled data and fine-tune it on a smaller labeled set. A popular example is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05709.pdf" target="_blank">A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations, ICML 2020</a>. Btw. the last author of this paper is no one else than Turing Award winner Geoffrey Hinton. Another way to help with labeling efficiency is that we can use the obtained features from a self-supervised model to guide the selection process of which data to label. One approach is to simply pick the data samples which are diverse and not similar. We do this at <a href="http://lightly.ai/" target="_blank">Lightly</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p>I hope you got an idea of how self-supervised learning works and why there is a good reason to be excited about it. If you’re interested in self-supervised learning in computer vision don’t forget to check out our <a href="https://github.com/lightly-ai/lightly" target="_blank">open-source Python framework for self-supervised learning on GitHub</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p>Igor, co-founder<br><a href="https://lightly.ai/" target="_blank">Lightly.ai</a></p><p>‍</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Through a series of examples, this article deals with limitations of classic controllers and control strategies in 
<em>Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning</em> (HVAC) systems, and draws a comparison with <em>intelligent agents</em> (supported
by artificial intelligence techniques) and their benefits. As such, we take as a basis of comparison a common HVAC
system type (<em>Variable Air Volume</em> or VAV) and show where classic control technics fall short while intelligent agents
bring in better performance.</p>

<h2 id="hvac-components-control-optimization-context">HVAC components control optimization: context</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/reports/2012/energyusage/">US Energy Information Agency</a>, HVAC
systems were responsible for not less than 40% of energy consumption in commercial buildings in 2012. With such a 
significant footprint, everyone has an interest in optimizing their control and operations.</p>

<p>Below diagram gives a simplified description of such HVAC system, of <em>VAV</em> type, as we find in many buildings in US,
Europe and Asia since 1980 onwards. This type of system, as its name suggests, varies the amount of air to meet heating,
cooling and air renewal demands in building spaces. While its installation cost is higher than previous generation 
(namely, <em>Constant Air Volume</em>), it has replaced it advantageously since it brings better comfort guarantees and less
energy expenses. We encounter this in medium to large size buildings mainly, in every kind of facilities.</p>

<p><img src="https://airboxlab.github.io/assets/pid_vs_ai/ncc_hvac_schematics.svg" alt="sources"></p>
<center><i>fig. 1: simplified schematics of a typical Variable Air Volume (VAV) HVAC system, with central mechanical cooling and hot water reheat</i></center>


<p>As we can observe, a VAV is a centralized system: most of the ventilation, cooling and heating happens in one place, and
this requires to be configured and operated to meet all demands. By intuition, one can already imagine the challenges
that such systems face: a single (or a handful of) equipment of any kind must satisfy potentially dozens of open spaces,
cell offices, meeting rooms, … This requires proper sizing, configuration and control.</p>

<p>To do so, HVAC industry relies on processes, hardware and techniques that, for some of them, are decades-old. Given
investment costs to design and promote new equipment or control techniques, but also to replace those already installed,
there is some inertia, legitimate to some extent. But as we’ll discuss in next sections, optimisation or removal of
existing limitations don’t require many capital expenditure anymore. Modern, software-based approaches can
bring dramatic improvements without a full-fledged retrofit.</p>

<h2 id="shortcomings-of-classic-controllers-in-hvac-systems">Shortcomings of classic controllers in HVAC systems</h2>

<p>To understand what can go wrong, let’s begin our short study by describing classic control systems and strategies in
HVAC systems, backed by concrete examples of sub-optimal control in an actual building.</p>

<h3 id="a-classic-controller-case-study-proportional-integral-derivative">A classic controller case study: Proportional-Integral-Derivative</h3>

<p>Proportional-Integral-Derivative, or <em>PID</em>, are the three calculation terms employed in this type of controller to
obtain a process control loop. For many decades, it’s the go-to in industrial processes, and HVAC systems are no
exception.</p>

<p>However, they have known limitations, that are common to all PID controllers or more specific to HVAC-related processes.
Below we summarize some of them, in order to build a first intuition on what could be optimized.</p>

<h4 id="typical-limitations-of-a-pid">Typical limitations of a PID</h4>

<p>Let’s take an example with an actual PID controller used to vary supply air fan speed in a VAV system. A common control
strategy is to make the most-open VAV box damper position reach 90%. So this PID has the maximum of all dampers position
as input, a fixed set point of 90%, and outputs fan speed.</p>

<p>The first limitation is intrinsically coming from how PID works: it requires a margin in the set point to produce stable
results when the controlled process is mechanical (e.g. fan speed can’t go higher than 100% or lower than 0%). When the 
limit of process range is reached, errors accumulate but the controlled process can’t go further in the same direction. 
This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_windup">integral windup</a>. When it comes to fan control, a 
typical strategy is then to fix the set point below range limit, usually 90%.</p>

<p>The second limitation is also inherent to PID internals: a large change in set point or in input value will produce
excessive change in the output (mostly due to derivative part of the PID: on a large change, derivative term will be
very large). A common solution is to use ramping either on set point or on PID input (in some “enhanced” controllers).
This produces very slow responses, on a fan start-up that means a long delay before reaching the set point. This can be
observed on below chart, where it takes more than 30min for the PID to reach the set point.</p>

<p><img src="https://airboxlab.github.io/assets/pid_vs_ai/pid_fan_rampup.png" alt="sources"></p>
<center><i>fig. 2: supply fan speed controlled by a PID and most-open VAV damper position (used as PID input) show a slow 
ramp-up of about 30min</i></center>

<p>Note: ramping is still necessary to deal with mechanical constraints, a common rule is to avoid changes larger than 10%
per minute on fan speed.<br></p>

<p>A third limitation comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller#Loop_tuning">PID gains tuning</a> which is a
tedious and time-consuming process. Even when controllers come with pre-defined and safe tunings for a particular class
of equipment, the HVAC engineer will have to reconfigure them to reach good performance, since each ventilation system
is unique. However, this tuning, performed once for all (HVAC configurations are only partially revised from time to
time), has about zero chance to cover all operating conditions. This results in typical PID problems like <em>overshooting</em>
,
<em>oscillations</em> or <em>hunting</em>. This can be observed in chart below, where the desired set point is still fixed at 90%</p>

<p><img src="https://airboxlab.github.io/assets/pid_vs_ai/pid_fan_oscillations.png" alt="sources"></p>
<center><i>fig. 3: supply fan speed controlled by a PID subject to large oscillations</i></center>


<p>Last but not least, PID controllers are often driven by a single input: in our case, most-open VAV damper position.
However, is this really the goal of a supply fan or did we just find a proxy to accommodate with controller
specifications? The actual real goal is to maintain good thermal and air quality comfort in occupied spaces, while
minimizing energy consumption.</p>

<p>While the proxy target of 90% can satisfy first part, it has no consideration for energy
savings. How does this translate? This is very usual to find one damper open at 90% while others are way below. This isn’t
just a PID problem (or more specifically, just with the PID controlling the fan), but it’s natural to have zones with
less air demand than others, and zones that are almost always in demand (also known as rogue zones). With a PID, one
can’t do anything about that. Figure 4 illustrates this problem, where a large difference occurs between damper
positions.</p>

<p><img src="https://airboxlab.github.io/assets/pid_vs_ai/pid_dampers_position.png" alt="sources"></p>
<center><i>fig. 4: supply fan control strategy leading to large differences between VAV boxes dampers position</i></center>


<h4 id="if-only-i-had-known-that-before">“If only I had known that before…”</h4>

<p>A PID is only reacting: for a given change in input, it will vary its output to keep as close as possible to its set
point. It has no way to anticipate changes or take proactive actions, since it has neither explicit nor inferred knowledge of
the controlled system. Moreover, its single input gives it a very partial view of the process at hand.</p>

<p>With such <em>observer model</em>, anticipation isn’t possible, while simple intuitions could be used to save bits of energy
here and there. A simple example: when HVAC scheduled end of operations is in sight, one could be tempted to slowly
reduce heating or cooling equipment use but not too much to reach end time between desired spaces set points. This is
something a PID can’t do.</p>

<p>If we generalise this example, <strong>the optimal system should learn building thermal dynamics and discover best control
strategies</strong>. There are many, and they depend on building use and characteristics.</p>

<h3 id="design-conditions-versus-reality">Design conditions versus reality</h3>

<p>As stated in <em>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</em>
report <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/pnnl-22072.pdf">Energy Savings for Occupancy-Based Control (OBC) of Variable-Air-Volume (VAV) Systems</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each terminal box has a minimum air-flow rate that ensures the ventilation requirements of the occupants of the zone served are met. This minimum air-flow rate is maintained at a constant value based on the design occupancy of the zone, which often corresponds to the maximum occupancy, because measurements of actual occupancy are not currently used to adjust the flow rate. […] In practice, control system integrators and installers often set the cooling minimum air-flow rate for ventilation to between 30% and 50% of the maximum air-flow rate of the terminal box.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The process of <em>Testing, Adjusting and Balancing</em> (TAB) of a building HVAC system is meant to deliver sufficient amount
of air, and make sure there will be enough heating and cooling capacity. All the calculation and testing is performed
using building <em>design conditions</em>. In practice, it is undertaken when building is still unoccupied, during one or a
handful of days (so during a particular season, with specific weather conditions). It doesn’t cover the actual use of
the building, which will vary over the course of its life: daily changes - with spaces more or less occupied depending
on the hour of the day - and more profound and permanent changes, like when exceptional conditions arise (Covid-19 and 
its cascade of lockdowns), or simply because tenants’ activity changes.</p>

<p>Another source of HVAC system misconfiguration and excessive energy use is the small and repetitive adjustments made 
over time by people who are responsible for occupants comfort, or to deal with system instability (operational conditions not
tested during initial setup). While it seems natural they make everything they can to guarantee satisfactory living
conditions, this often results in more energy wasted due to narrowed operational behaviour (e.g. raising minimum set
points).</p>

<h3 id="non-linearity-in-controlled-systems">Non-linearity in controlled systems</h3>

<p>HVAC systems are (highly) non-linear: they will respond non-linearly depending on controlled equipment, command
magnitude, and current state of the system (for instance: cooling or heating mode).</p>

<p>A classic example can be …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>The goal of the Jakarta EE 9.1 release is to deliver a set of specifications functionally equivalent to Jakarta EE 9 and adding the support for the Java SE 11 runtime.</p>

<p>The Platform team sees Jakarta EE 9.1 as an extension to the foundational Jakarta EE 9 release.
No API updates are expected in Jakarta EE 9.1.
Only the Platform and Web Profile Specifications along with the TCK and Compatible Implementations should be affected by Jakarta EE 9.1.</p>

<h2 id="java-se-11">Java SE 11</h2>
<h3 id="api-source-level">API Source Level</h3>

<p>The APIs will continue to be compiled at the Java SE 8 level.
The APIs need to be usable by both Java SE 8 and Java SE 11.
Thus, keeping the same Java SE 8 source/target level for the APIs will still be required.</p>

<h3 id="tck-source-level">TCK Source Level</h3>

<p>The TCKs will continue to be compiled at the Java SE 8 level.
This would allow the same TCK to be used for Compatibility testing with either Java SE 8 or 11 runtime.</p>

<h4 id="signature-tests">Signature Tests</h4>

<p>Currently, the TCK Signature Tests are specific to the level of the Java SE runtime which is being used for testing.
The TCK may need to be updated to include the Java SE 11 signatures.</p>

<h4 id="corba-and-rmiiiop-tests">CORBA and RMI/IIOP Tests</h4>

<p>For Jakarta EE 9, the CORBA tests were left as-is and these tests were executed by default, but the RMI/IIOP tests were removed as part of the default execution.
Since the CORBA ORB was removed from Java SE 11, there will be an impact to the TCK to support these CORBA tests.
To minimize the impact to Jakarta EE 9.1, the expectation is to leave the CORBA tests in the TCK, but make them optional.</p>

<h4 id="web-services-tests">Web Services Tests</h4>

<p>Many of the Web Services related features (XML Binding, XML Web Services, Web Services Metadata, and SOAP with Attachments) were dropped from Java SE 11.
But, they were picked up for optional inclusion with Jakarta EE 9.
Since these optional features were provided with the Java SE 8 runtime, the TCK may need to be adjusted when running with the Java SE 11 runtime where they are no longer provided.</p>

<h3 id="compatible-implementation-ci-source-level">Compatible Implementation (CI) Source Level</h3>

<p>How a Compatible Implementation supports the Java SE 11 runtime will be left as a vendor-defined solution.</p>

<h2 id="specification-project-minor-point-releases">Specification Project Minor (Point) Releases?</h2>

<p>A few of the Jakarta Specification projects are already working on their “next” releases.
This type of new, innovative work needs to be encouraged and promoted.</p>

<p>Since the ultimate goal of Jakarta EE 9.1 is to support the Java SE 11 runtime in a timely manner, no Specification API updates will be included in 9.1.
If the Specification text or Javadoc needs to be updated to clarify some processing without any functional impact to the API, those types of changes should be entertained via a Service Release (x.y.z).
The exact process for Specification Service Releases (extent of changes, reviews required, ballots required, etc) is still being worked out.</p>

<p>The preferred approach would be for these Specification projects to continue with their proposed “next” releases – taking them through the required plan and review processes.
But, don’t attempt to tie them to the Jakarta EE 9.1 release.
These would just be independent updates to the Jakarta Specifications that could be discussed for inclusion in a future Jakarta EE Platform release.</p>

<h2 id="deliverables-in-jakarta-ee-91">Deliverables in Jakarta EE 9.1</h2>

<p>The following details the specifications and APIs included within the Jakarta EE 9.1 Platform.</p>

<h3 id="jakarta-ee-91-specifications">Jakarta EE 9.1 Specifications</h3>

<p>List of existing specifications in Jakarta EE 9.1.

  <li>Jakarta XML Web Services 3.0 (Optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="jakarta-ee-91-apis">Jakarta EE 9.1 APIs</h3>

<p>The Platform and Web Profile API jar files will be re-generated to correspond with the 9.1 release designation.
The intent is that the content of the 9.0 and 9.1 jar files are the same, but update the maven coordinate artifacts to make them easy to find and use.</p>

<h2 id="release-milestones">Release Milestones</h2>

<p>The Jakarta EE 9.1 platform project is proposing that this release plan covers all specifications targeted for Jakarta EE 9.1.
As stated in the scope, specifications will not be making functionality changes for inclusion in this release, therefore individual specification release plans are not necessary.</p>

<h3 id="full-platform-and-web-profile-release-candidate">Full Platform and Web Profile Release Candidate</h3>

<p>Although the Jakarta EE 9.1 release is limited in scope, at least one Release Candidate for Jakarta EE Platform and Web Profile will be produced.
These Release Candidates will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Release candidates for all API JARs in Maven Central</li>
  <li>Release candidate Bill of Material pom files for Web Profile and Full Platform in Maven Central</li>
  <li>Release candidate TCKs</li>
  <li>Release candidate compatible implementation(s)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the release candidate has been validated and any issues ironed out, the full 9.1 release will proceed with all deliverables required for submission to the specification committee for approval.</p>

<h3 id="proposed-progress-reviews">Proposed Progress Reviews</h3>

<p>Since this Jakarta EE 9.1 release is limited in scope, no interim progress reviews are expected.
The overall schedule for Jakarta EE 9.1 will be maintained on <a href="https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-platform/jakartaee9/JakartaEE9.1#jakarta-ee-9.1-schedule">this separate page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="compatible-implementation">Compatible Implementation</h3>

<p>The JESP requires us to have a Compatible Implementation of the Full Profile and Web Profile available before the Platform Project can deliver a final specification.
At this stage, it is assumed that this implementation will be Eclipse GlassFish.
However, the Platform project has no control over the release dates of Eclipse GlassFish.
The platform project will maintain close coordination with the Eclipse GlassFish project for the duration of the Jakarta EE 9.1 release development.</p>

		<p><strong>Updated 5 March 2021</strong></p>
<p>Peter Lobner</p>
<p>Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTG), also called Radioisotope Power Systems (RTS), commonly use non-weapons grade Plutonium 238 (Pu-238) to generate electric power and heat for National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) spacecraft when solar energy and batteries are not adequate for the intended mission. In comparison to other RTG heat sources (Strontium-90, Cesium-137), Pu-238 has a relatively long half-life of 87.75 years, which is a desirable property for a long-life RTG.</p>
<p>Approximately 300 kg (661 lb) of Pu-238 was produced by the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Savannah River Site between 1959 – 1988. After U.S production stopped, the U.S. purchased Pu-238 from Russia until that source of supply ended in 2010.</p>
<p>Limited production of new Pu-238 in the U.S re-started in 2013 using the process shown below. This effort is&nbsp;partially funded by NASA. &nbsp;Eventually, production capacity will be about&nbsp;1.5 kg (3.3 lb) Pu-238 per year. The roles of the DOE national laboratories involved in this production process are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Idaho National Engineering Lab (INEL):
<ul>
<li>Store the Neptunium dioxide (NpO<sub>2</sub>) feed stock</li>
<li>Deliver feed stock as needed to ORNL</li>
<li>Irradiate targets provided by ORNL in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR)</li>
<li>Return irradiated targets to ORNL for processing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL):
<ul>
<li>Manufacture targets</li>
<li>Ship some targets to INEL for irradiation</li>
<li>Irradiate the remaining targets in the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR)</li>
<li>Process all irradiated targets to recover and purify Pu-238</li>
<li>Convert Pu-238 to oxide and deliver as needed to LANL</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Los Alamos National Lab (LANL):
<ul>
<li>Manufacture the Pu-238 fuel pellets for use in RTGs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Source: Ralph L McNutt, Jr, Johns Hopkins University APL, 2014</em></p>
<p>In 2015, the U.S. had an existing inventory&nbsp;of&nbsp;about 35 kg (77 lb) of Pu-238 of various ages. &nbsp;About half was young enough to meet the power specifications of planned NASA spacecraft. The remaining stock was more than 20 years old, has decayed significantly since it was produced, and did not meet specifications. &nbsp;The existing inventory&nbsp;will be blended with newly produced Pu-238 to extend the usable inventory. To get the energy density needed for space missions while extending the supply of Pu-238, DOE and NASA plan to blend “old” Pu-238 with newly produced Pu-238 in 2:1 proportions.</p>
<p>Since 2010, NASA’s RTG for spacecraft missions has been the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), which It is based on the SNAP-19 RTG flown on the two Viking Mars landers (circa 1975) and the Pioneer 10 and 11 deep space probes (circa 1972). At beginning of life, the current MMRTG can provide about 2,000 watts of thermal power and 110 watts of electrical power from eight General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) modules that contain a total of 10.6 pounds (4.8 kilograms) of plutonium dioxide fuel. Electric conversion efficiency is about 6%.</p>

<p>NASA had a program to develop an Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG), which was designed to produce about four times the power of the MMRTG per unit of Pu-238. Electric conversion efficiency was about 26%. The ASRG required a total of 2.7 pounds (1.2 kilograms) of plutonium dioxide in two GPHS modules. However, the ASRG would produce less waste heat, which can be used productively to warm electronics in the interior of a spacecraft, such as the Mars rover Curiosity.&nbsp; In November 2013, NASA announced that ASRG development had been discontinued because of budget cuts.

<p><strong><span>9 February 2016 Update:</span></strong></p>
<p>On 22 December 2015, DOE reported the first U.S. production in nearly 30 years of Pu-238.&nbsp; &nbsp;This production demonstration, which was partially funded by the NASA, was performed at ORNL and yielded 50 grams of Pu-238.&nbsp; The last U.S. production of Pu-238 occurred in the late 1980s at the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina.</p>
<p>DOE reported that it plans to set an initial production target of 300 – 400 grams (about 12 ounces) of Pu-238 per year. After implementing greater automation and scaling up the process, ORNL expects to reach the the production target of&nbsp;1.5 kg (3.3 lb) Pu-238 per year.</p>
<p>The next NASA mission that will use an RTG is the Mars 2020 rover, which will use an MMRTG, &nbsp;as used on NASA’s Mars rover Curiosity.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>3 January 2019 Update:</u></strong></p>
<p>In the past three years, ORNL has made scant progress in producing Pu-238.&nbsp; In a 13 December 2018 article, <em>“NASA Doesn’t Have Enough Nuclear Fuel For Its Deep Space Missions,”</em>author Ethan Siegel reports:&nbsp; “Although current production (at ORNL) yields only a few hundred grams per year (less than a pound), the laboratory has the eventual goal of ramping up to 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds) per year by 2023, at the earliest.&nbsp; Ontario Power Generation in Canada has also begun producing Pu-238, with the goal of using it as a supplemental source for NASA.” &nbsp;You can read the complete article on the Forbes website at the following link: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/12/13/nasa-doesnt-have-enough-nuclear-fuel-for-its-deep-space-missions/%231a73d47e1c18">https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/12/13/nasa-doesnt-have-enough-nuclear-fuel-for-its-deep-space-missions/#1a73d47e1c18</a></p>
<p>The Canadian plans for becoming a source of Pu-238 was announced on 1 March 2017:&nbsp; “Ontario Power Generation (OPG) and its venture arm, Canadian Nuclear Partners, are participating in a project to produce isotopes in support of deep space exploration. Under the agreement, OPG would help create isotopes at the Darlington nuclear station east of Toronto that will help power space probes.” You can read the complete OPG press release here: <a href="https://www.opg.com/news-and-media/news-releases/Documents/20170301_DeepSpace.pdf">https://www.opg.com/news-and-media/news-releases/Documents/20170301_DeepSpace.pdf</a></p>

<p><strong><u>4 August 2020 Update:</u></strong></p>



<p>The NASA Mars rover, Perseverance, was launched from Cape Canaveral on 30 July 2020, with an expected landing date of 18 February 2021 in the Jezero crater on Mars. Once on the surface, Perseverance will be powered by an MMRTG.</p>



<p>The Pu-238 and some other special materials for the Perseverence MMRTG were produced in the U.S. at ORNL, as described in the following short (2:03 minutes) video, “ORNL-produced tech fuels NASA’s Perseverance mission to Mars”:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>In a 20 July 2020 news release, ORNL provided more information on the U.S. production process for Pu-238 and reported that, “the lab has been consistently increasing its Pu-238 production capabilities, aiming to produce 1.5 kilograms per year by 2026.”&nbsp;&nbsp;You can read this ORNL press release here: <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/ornl-produced-plutonium-238-help-power-perseverance-mars">https://www.ornl.gov/news/ornl-produced-plutonium-238-help-power-perseverance-mars</a></p>



<p>At the planned U.S. production rate for Pu-238, NASA should be able to conduct an MMRTG mission at about four-year intervals.  If NASA MMRTG missions will be more frequent than this, the U.S. will need to purchase additional Pu-238 from another source, perhaps Canada.</p>



<p><strong><u>5 March 2021 Update:</u></strong></p>



<p>The Perseverance rover landed on Mars on 18 February<strong>&nbsp;</strong>2021, in the planned target area in Jezero Crater.&nbsp;&nbsp;Power from the MMRTG was nominal after landing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perseverance will spend at least one Mars year (two Earth years) exploring the landing site region.</p>



<p>The next NASA mission with an MMRTG-powered spacecraft is the Dragonfly mission to Saturn’s moon Titan, which will launch in 2026 and arrive on Titan in 2034.</p>



<p>The Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft were launched in 1977, each with three RTGs delivering a maximum of 470 watts of electrical power at the beginning of the mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both spacecraft have left the solar system (Voyager 1 in 2013 and Voyager 2 in 2018) and continue to transmit from interstellar space in 2021 with their RTGs operating at a reduced power level of about 331 watts after 44 years of Pu-238 decay during the mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;NASA plans to continue the Voyager missions until at least 2025.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Dear new developer,</p>
<p>You are probably going to be dealing with text files sometime during your development career. These could be plain text, csv, or json. They may have data you want to get out, or log files you want to examine. You may be transforming from one format to another.</p>
<p>Now, if this is a regular occurrence, you may want to build a script or a program around this problem (or use a third party service which aggregates everything together). But sometimes these files are one offs. Or you use them once in a blue moon. And it can take a little while to write a script, look at the libraries, and put it all together.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to learn some of the unix tools available on <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2019/02/04/learn-the-command-line/">the command line</a>. Here are three that I consider “table stakes”.</p>
<p><strong>awk</strong></p>
<p>This is a multi purpose line processing utility. I often want to grab lines of a log file and figure out what is going on. Here’s a few lines of a log file:</p>
<p><code>54.147.20.92 - - [26/Jul/2019:20:21:04 -0600] "GET /wordpress HTTP/1.1" 301 241 "-" "Slackbot 1.0 (+https://api.slack.com/robots)"<br>
185.24.234.106 - - [26/Jul/2019:20:20:50 -0600] "GET /wordpress/archives/date/2004/02 HTTP/1.1" 200 87872 "http://www.mooreds.com" "DuckDuckBot/1.0; (+http://duckduckgo.com/duckduckbot.html)"<br>
185.24.234.106 - - [26/Jul/2019:20:20:50 -0600] "GET /wordpress/archives/date/2004/08 HTTP/1.1" 200 81183 "http://www.mooreds.com" "DuckDuckBot/1.0; (+http://duckduckgo.com/duckduckbot.html)"</code></p>
<p>If I want to see only the ip addresses (assuming these are all in a file called logs.txt), I’d run something like:</p>
<p><code>$ awk '{print $1}' logs.txt<br>
54.147.20.92<br>
185.24.234.106<br>
185.24.234.106</code></p>
<p>There’s lots more, but you can see that you’d be able to slice and dice delimited data pretty easily. Here’s a <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/l-awk1/">great article which dives in further</a>.</p>
<p><strong>sed</strong></p>
<p>This is another line utility. You can use it for all kinds of things, but I primarily use it to do search and replace on a file. Suppose you had the same log file, but you wanted to anonymize the the ip address and the user agent. Perhaps you’re going to ship them off for long term storage or something. You can easily remove this with a couple of sed commands.</p>
<p><code>$ sed 's/^[^ ]*//' logs.txt |sed 's/"[^"]*"$//'<br>
- - [26/Jul/2019:20:21:04 -0600] "GET /wordpress HTTP/1.1" 301 241 "-"<br>
- - [26/Jul/2019:20:20:50 -0600] "GET /wordpress/archives/date/2004/02 HTTP/1.1" 200 87872 "http://www.mooreds.com"<br>
- - [26/Jul/2019:20:20:50 -0600] "GET /wordpress/archives/date/2004/08 HTTP/1.1" 200 81183 "http://www.mooreds.com"</code></p>
<p>Yes, it looks like line noise, but this is the power of regular expressions. They’re in every language (though with slight variations) and worth learning. sed gives you the power of regular expressions at the command line for processing files. I don’t have a great sed tutorial I’ve found, but googling shows a number.</p>
<p><strong>jq</strong></p>
<p>If you work on the command line with modern software at all, you have encountered json. It’s used for configuration files and data transmission. Sometimes you get an array of json and you just want to pick out certain attributes of it. Tools like sed and awk fail at this, because they are used to newlines separating records, not curly braces and commas. Sure, you could use regular expressions to parse simple json, and there are times when I’ve done this. But a far better tool is <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>. I’m not as savvy with this as with the others, but have used it whenever I’m dealing with an API that delivers json (which is most modern ones). I can pull the API down with <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> (another great tool) and parse it out with jq. I can put these all in a script and have the exploration be repeatable.</p>
<p>I did this a few months&nbsp; ago when I was doing some exploration of an elastic search system. I crafted the queries with curl and then used jq to parse out the results so that I could make some sense of this. Yes, I could have done this with a real programming language, but it would have taken longer. I could also have used a gui tool like postman, but then it would not have been replicable.</p>
<p>sed and awk should be on every system you run across; jq is non standard, but easy to install. It’s worth spending some time getting to know these tools. So next time you are processing a text file and need to extract just a bit of it, reach for sed and awk. Next time you get a hairy json file and you are peering at it, look at jq. I think you’ll be happy with the result.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

<p>Currently, the collision of artists and cryptocurrencies is playing out across Twitter and other platforms, dividing artists who normally praise and support each other into two camps. One camp wants to make money selling their art as NFTs, and the other camp hates the idea.</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fun to see cryptoart/NFTs bring a class war to the digital art community. I love see artists that have followed each other for years block each other. This is exactly the thing this community needed</p>— RJ Palmer (@arvalis) <a href="https://twitter.com/arvalis/status/1367982561079697408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2021</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>
<p>If you haven’t heard already, NFTs are enjoying increasing popularity alongside the current record-high cryptocurrency values. NFT stands for <strong>Non-Fungible Token</strong> – an atomic digital token that can be traded for cryptocurrency. Many artists are now selling “digital editions” of their artwork as NFTs on special-purpose marketplaces – the buyer can call themselves the owner of a piece of digital art, similar to how one might purchase a limited edition print. Some of these art NFTs have been trading for the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars, despite granting the buyer no physical copy, no reproduction rights, or anything other than the ability to say, “Yes, I own this token,” and to sell it to someone else.</p>
<p>What’s been particularly divisive is the objection to the shockingly high energy usage of the most popular cryptocurrencies. <a href="https://memoakten.medium.com/the-unreasonable-ecological-cost-of-cryptoart-2221d3eb2053">One estimate</a> puts the energy consumption involved in a single NFT sale at around 340 kWh, equivalent to driving 1,000km in an ICE car. Most of this is due to the proof-of-work algorithm that’s core to Ethereum[1], the blockchain that most of these NFT sales take place on. Essentially, many objectors see making and selling NFTs as something akin to clearcutting rainforests in order to grow crops.</p>
<p>The artists putting their work up as NFTs see this as an opportunity to live the artist’s dream – to produce highly sought-after pieces for which collectors will pay large sums of money. It’s simultaneously an elevation of their value and status, and also their ticket to a life free from the struggle of paying the bills. Is it so easy to pass on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime chance at wealth, even when people are telling you that it’s contributing to environmental harm?</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I want to make tens of thousands of dollars off one piece of art. I want to be wealthy and comfortable off of my artwork.

</div></figure>
<p>The YES NFT camp has a few arguments, including that NFT transactions are not 1:1 correlated with increased energy use[2], and aren’t you eating meat anyways?</p>
<p>The NO NFT camp seems to have been already stressed out by anti-maskers, racial injustice, income inequality, and all the other ills of the world, only to find out that their beloved colleagues are willing to sell out the environment for a chance to make a quick buck. Depending on who you ask, the whole thing smacks of tech-bro[3] greed, a pyramid scheme, or abandoning your morals.</p>
<p>This has caused some heated threads on Twitter around these talking points, and since it doesn’t seem totally fair to air all the drama – Twitter is very public though! – I’ll put my predictions here instead:</p>
<div><div>
<p>The NFT gold rush won’t last forever. Yes, some artists and speculators have made a good chunk of change selling NFTs. But the idea of artists simultaneously having trouble getting $1,000 commission work while selling old JPEGs for tens of thousands of dollars doesn’t add up. The money that’s buying NFTs is either speculators hoping to resell it for more, or people who previously accumulated cryptocurrency and are either reluctant to cash out or are under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect">endowment effect</a>. They wouldn’t spend $1,000 on a digital picture, but would happily spend 0.7 ETH ($1,137).</p>
<p>As more NFTs are minted and put up for sale (supply increases) and the cryptocurrency wealth sloshing around settles or hype dies down (demand decreases), I think NFT prices and volume will settle down to lower levels. No artist to my knowledge has become wealthy by selling NFTs yet, but in the future the chances of even paying your bills via NFTs will be very low.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Despite my negative outlook on NFTs, I think they’ll be around in the long run with limited use[4] along the lines of Patreon – if people are willing to pay monthly to support an artist, why not also be the Digital Owner of one of that artist’s works? It’s a way to publicly show your support for your favorite artists.</p>
<p>[1] Ethereum is not scheduled to move to proof-of-stake until some time in 2022. The NFT gold rush may run out of steam by then.</p>
<p>[2] The USD price of a cryptocurrency has a bigger correlation to its mining electricity consumption. The higher the price, the more profitable it is to keep your computer on all night mining cryptocurrency, thus the best way to fight the environmental cost is to crash the USD exchange rate. There’s even a plausible scenario where artists selling their earned ETH to pay their bills puts downward pressure on the USD-ETH rate, reducing ETH’s electricity consumption.</p>
<p>[3] The artists selling NFTs seem to be mostly men, like cryptocurrency enthusiasts who are also mostly men. This is based on my limited non-scientific browsing of NFT marketplaces.</p>
<p>[4] One legitimately interesting use case for NFTs could center around tracking ownership of Original Characters (OCs), for which there already is a thriving market for trading and selling. Basically, the artist draws a cool/fierce/cute/sexy paladin/drow/khajiit/whatever character, and the buyer gets exclusive rights to own that character, use it for role playing, take the included “refsheet” to other artists to commission custom art of said character, or resell the character. It’s all very ad-hoc and exists largely outside the world of copyright law as we know it. The demographic also seems to be teenagers, which might hamper adoption of NFTs.</p>

<p><span>This page will be an ever-evolving log of my backyard shedquarters. The last update was February 28th.</span></p>
<p>During 2020 I began working full-time from home in our 2 bedroom house. I completely took over the kitchen table
for a while because I thought the pandemic would only last a few weeks, which was adorable in hindsight. After a
couple of months I moved to the spare bedroom and set up shop in there. Our company has since decided to go
fully remote forever, so I needed a more dedicated space for working</p>
<p>I've always wanted a shedquarters because it seems so fun to build out the perfect workspace, so I decided to
pull the trigger on it sometime in October.</p>
<p>If you want to follow along on Twitter, here's the thread:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">About a month ago, I got a 10x20 shed
        delivered so I could build out a shedquarters office in my backyard. It's been a ton of fun (and
        work) so far! I'm going to share a lot of it on this thread over the next couple of months until it's
        done. (Also at <a href="https://t.co/qAXSKUZdyk">https://t.co/qAXSKUZdyk</a>.)

        1, 2020</a></blockquote>

<h2>Build vs Buy</h2>
<p>The first question I had to answer was whether I was going to try to build a shed from the ground up, or buy a
pre-made one. Having never built anything before I thought it might be fun to try something relatively
low-stakes like a shed. I watched a ton of YouTube videos and felt pretty confident I could pull <em>something</em>
off.</p>
<p>However, in the end I decided that it would take <em>way</em> longer than I wanted to build it from the ground up, and
I have a lot of other projects that would suffer if I spent 3 months building a shed. I am so, so glad I decided
to buy a pre-made shell instead.</p>
<h2>Choosing a Builder</h2>
<p>There are lots of fancy options that come totally pre-done and look beautiful (<a href="http://kangaroomsystems.com/">Kanga
Rooms</a> being one of them). Those were way too expensive for my budget, and didn't
leave me quite enough room for customizing to my liking.</p>
<p>Those fancier options are really geared toward "turn-key home offices", while what I wanted was more of "a shed
I can turn into an office".</p>
<p>There are a shed load (get it) of shed manufacturers to choose from, at least here in Texas! The one I settled
on was <a href="https://www.lonestarstructures.com/">Lone Star Structures</a>. Their prices are great, their customer
service is amazing, and they have an online shed designer that lets you build out exactly what you're looking
for. They also delivered and leveled it for me, but more on that later.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot from my 3D design:</p>

<h2>Building Size</h2>
<p>I decided to go with a 10x20 building, for two reasons. The first is that we only have about 10 feet of space in
the spot where the shed was going to go, so that limited the width. The second reason is that anything &lt;= 200
square feet does not require a permit.</p>
<p>We had an old shed that was 10 feet wide and 12 feet long, you can see how tight the width is:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/old-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/old-1.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/old-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/old-2.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The only access to our backyard is through a large gate that is just over 11ft wide.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/gate.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/gate.jpg"></a>
</p>
<p>I have some pictures and videos of the delivery, you'll see just how tight it was even with the 10ft model.</p>
<h2>Floor Plan</h2>
<p>We don't have a garage, so that old shed was serving the purpose of storing "garage stuff", which the new
building would have to do as well. To accomodate both the needs of a new office and "garage stuff", I decided to
split the shed into two sections. A 10x16 space for the office, and a 10x4 space for the garage stuff.</p>
<p>Lone Star Structures has the option to add a 4 foot "loft" in their configuration tool, so I added the loft and
then specifically requested that they build out a wall underneath.</p>
<p>Here's a floor plan overview:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/floor-plan.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/floor-plan.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And here's what it looks like in real life:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/loft.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/loft.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The large, double doors open from the yard into the storage area. You can see the stud wall Lone Star built for
me to partition the space. Eventually there will be a proper wall there and the two spaces will be totally
discrete.</p>
<p>Here's a shot from the inside looking out. You can see the "loft" that will be accessible from the office and
give me a bit more air conditioned storage space.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/pano.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/pano.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The astute reader will now note that when the wall is completed... there will be no way to get into the office!
More on that soon.</p>
<h2>Demolition of the Old Shed</h2>
<p>Before the new shed came, I had to get rid of the old one. I tried for a week or two to <em>give it away</em> on
Craigslist, but that failed hysterically. A couple of people asked if it would fit in their SUV. It's a 10x12
shed that weighs hundreds of pounds!</p>
<p>After being disappointed by Craigslist once again, I decided to borrow a sawzall and demolish it myself. It was
a lot of hard work, but this timelapse makes it look super easy:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OxhCjshVRvU?modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Preparing the Pad for the New Shed</h2>
<p>Since the new shed is 8 feet longer than the old shed was, I needed to make the pad 8 feet longer. Lone Star was
responsible for leveling the shed (which they did a great job of), I just had to provide a pad that was within
12 inches (!) of level.</p>
<p>The old pad was a few inches lower than the surrounding ground, so I wanted it to be a little more uniform.</p>
<p>I started by tilling the ground and then used the broad side of a pick axe to break it up more. I repeated that
process for... ever. Tilling, axing, raking, over and over.</p>
<p>After I got it all level enough, I wanted to compact it down. Since I didn't have a tamper and didn't want to
spend 40 bucks on one I'll never use again, my genius neighbor and I made a pretty janky makeshift tamper out of
a sledgehammer and some boards. It mostly kind of worked!</p>
<p>It also looks hysterical and insane.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/tamper.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/tamper.jpg"></a>
</p>
<p>Turns out the best tamper is not a sledgehammer attached to some boards, but rather an SUV. Maybe my best idea
so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/suv-tamper.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/suv-tamper.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Again, the timelapse make it look super easy, but it was a lot of work. Please validate me!</p>

<h2>Delivery Day</h2>
<p>The day the shed was delivered I was nervously just waiting around for them to show up. We live on a quiet
residential street that is not super wide, so I was a bit worried that they wouldn't be able to make it down the
street. I was also worried that they wouldn't be able to make it down our driveway, which is also not very wide.</p>
<p>Then a full on 18-wheeler turned the corner and I thought to myself</p>
<p><img src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/mistake.gif"></p><p>Not only did he have my shed on there, he had another one too! Like it was no big deal!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D-bHsgYG2KM?modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the face of a concerned person whose neighbors are coming outside to see what the ruckus is.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/concerned.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/concerned.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And here I am talking to him trying to figure out just exactly what the plan is here, as if I could help.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/joe-convo.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/joe-convo.jpg"></a></p>
<p>As it turns out, the guy that does this for a living (not me) was less concerned than the average software
developer (me), and apparently it <em>was</em> no big deal because he just tipped the magic trailer back and plopped it
in the street like a boss.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/shed-unload.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/shed-unload.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The guy (Joe) that drove the shed down the driveway and positioned in place was a wizard with his tiny little
forklift. I have no idea how he did it, because we had only inches to spare.</p>
<p>I'm so pumped for my new shed that I pre-emptively celebrate with a Diet Coke while Joe is toiling away
somewhere actually getting stuff done.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/celebrating.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/celebrating.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I did have to cut trees back in a few places on both sides of the driveway, so I wasn't <em>totally</em> useless.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/trees.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/trees.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Here's the whole 1-2 hour process nice and sped up.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XKfLARMYZ_o?modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once it was in place, Joe spent another 30 or 45 minutes getting it all level.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/leveling.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/leveling.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And now I have a shed! Monster is concerned that it may be too much house for him to handle, I haven't broken
the news that it's not actually for him.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/monster-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/monster-1.jpg"></a></p>
<h2>Adding a French Door</h2>
<p>Because I'm going to be having two separate partitions in the building with a wall in between, I'll need a way
to access the office. The doors that are already present on the shed access the tool/yard storage area.</p>
<p>When I was designing the shed I had the option to add a door and some windows using their online design tool,
but everything they offer is geared towards sheds because... they build sheds. I wanted something that looked
a little nicer since this is going to be my office and take up a large portion of our yard.</p>
<p>One of my friends recommended that I put in french doors that can serve both as an access point and let in a ton
of light. I found a good <a href="http://www.craddocklumber.com/">local lumber company</a> that I bought the door from. I
was able to customize it so that it swings <em>out</em> instead of in, because there isn't a ton of room for an
in-swinging door in the office.</p>
<p>They also delivered it for me. Turns out it's very very heavy. And beautiful!</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-delivery.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-delivery.jpg"></a></p>
<p>For this part of the project I recruited my Dad and my brother-in-law because I knew it was going to be a tough
one to do solo.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-team.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-team.jpg"></a></p>
<p>We started by clearing the studs out of the section that the door was going to fit in. The placement was figured
so that I have enough room to put my desk in one corner without it overlapping into the door. We used a combo of
sledgehammer + prybar to get the studs out.</p>
<p>Note that this shed is so small (and has the loft wall), that there is
basically no load carried by this wall, so we could just knock the studs out without worrying. We did of course
frame the door in, but there's just so little to worry about in this regard because of the size of the building.</p>
<p>If you do something like this, don't listen to some guy on the internet, ask someone who actually knows what
they're doing.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-placement.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-placement.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Once we got it framed up, we took a sawzall and just started cutting it out! There's no going back from this
point, which was very scary.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-first-cut.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-first-cut.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-breakthrough.gif" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-breakthrough.gif"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-cleared.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-cleared.jpg"></a></p>
<p>With the wall gone, it was time to dry fit the door and start getting it installed. This was the first time any
of us had ever installed a french door, so I was pleased that we got it pretty close! I think the rough
opening was bigger than it needed to be, but we added an extra 2x4 and lots of shims and that seemed to make it
fit well enough. <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></p>
<p>Before we did this part I watched a lot of videos on YouTube, and my neighbor (who is <a href="https://www.micekmade.com/">a …</a></p></div></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>There are several reasons to consider deleting Facebook. A couple good ones are user privacy and psychological impact. First, as a company it has been fairly hostile to user privacy concerns, even when controlling for the fact that as a major platform it attracts more scrutiny than the vast majority of other software companies. Second, as a platform it works a bit like a slot machine, in that it promotes addictive behaviours and keeps you from engaging in deep work.</p>

<p>A few things might keep you from wanting to fully leave, however if you’re reading this in all likelihood you don’t use Facebook to the same extent you once did, considering that their key market is now the less tech-native segment of the baby-boomer generation. Many people have found that they don’t feel like they’re missing out on anything of value after leaving the platform, and I include myself among those that have enjoyed adopting a more minimalist approach to their digital lives.</p>

<p>A relevant concept here is Dunbar’s number - a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships - named after British anthropologist Robin Dunbar. That number is 150, however it’s worth bearing in mind that is the upper limit. In reality, most of us never come close to maintaining 150 close relationships at any one time.</p>

<p>Should you want to go ahead with deleting your account, there are a few things worth considering. One of Facebook’s main uses is as a reminder for your friends’ birthdays, so we want to make sure we export its calendar. Another thing we might want to do is a bit of privacy-focused prevention: delete our posts, leave all groups, download and delete our photos, and unlike all of our liked pages. This is in case Facebook’s ghost profiles turn out to be a real practice, and the evidence seems to suggest they are. Ghost profiles are accounts that Facebook creates, with information it contains on people that aren’t signed up to the platform. Finally, we might want to let our contacts know that we’re leaving the platform and ask them to not upload any photos or information about us, should privacy be a concern.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download all photos</li>
  <li>Download Facebook’s calendar</li>
  <li>Unfriend, unlike, and delete all photos</li>
  <li>Announce departure</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2 id="1-download-all-photos">1: Download all photos</h2>

<p>It’s fairly easy to export all of the photos you uploaded by simply using using Facebook’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=your_facebook_information">download your information tool</a>. It’s less easy to download photos you’ve been tagged in. For this you’ll have to use some external tools, and most likely have to make use of a little programming.</p>

<p>The first and most simple option is using one of these IFTT recipes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://ifttt.com/applets/126727p-back-up-photos-you-re-tagged-in-on-facebook-to-an-ios-photos-album">FB to iOS</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ifttt.com/applets/47704776d-save-photos-you-re-tagged-in-on-facebook-to-a-dropbox-folder">FB to Dropbox</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If for whatever reason you want to use another alternative you can follow <a href="https://matthew-johnston.com/DownloadAllFacebookTaggedPhotos/">this tutorial</a>. Essentially go to your photos page at <a href="https://facebook.com/me/photos">facebook.com/me/photos</a> and  run this JS script in your browser console to get the “FBIDs” of your photos:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>link</span> <span>of</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementsByTagName</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span><span>'</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span> 
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>link</span><span>.</span><span>href</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>?fbid=</span><span>"</span><span>))</span> <span>continue</span><span>;</span> 
    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>URL</span><span>(</span><span>link</span><span>.</span><span>href</span><span>).</span><span>searchParams</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>fbid</span><span>"</span><span>));</span> 
    <span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then feed that list to <a href="https://github.com/mgjohnston/fmpd/tree/patch-1">this python script</a> which downloads your photos.</p>

<p>I would recommend then hosting your photos on another cloud-hosting provider such as Apple Photos.</p>

<h2 id="2-download-facebooks-calendar">2: Download Facebook’s calendar</h2>
<p>You can use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/birthday-calendar-extract/imielmggcccenhgncmpjlehemlinhjjo">this Chrome extension</a> for that, it’s quite straightforward.</p>

<p>There are quite a few command line interfaces that can help you with this:</p>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/spieglt/fb-delete">https://github.com/spieglt/fb-delete</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/weskerfoot/DeleteFB]">https://github.com/weskerfoot/DeleteFB</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Another strategy is to scramble the information before you delete your account, however this requires a fair bit more time and programming some custom scripts.</p>

<h2 id="4-announce-departure">4: Announce departure</h2>
<p>As a final step I suggest announcing to your network that you’re leaving the platform, leaving alternative contact details and requesting that others don’t upload photos of you.
The process should take a few days to complete on Facebook’s end, at which point your data is <em>supposedly</em> deleted from their servers.</p>

<p>Now enjoy being away from the platform - try to select for high value activities to do in your free time, and notice how you’ll focus more on your most meaningful and rewarding relationships.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><small>Unsharpen may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site.</small></p><div>

                                
                                <p>Many people see fountain pens as occasional writing instruments, maybe for doing some journaling or writing a letter, but that doesn’t have to be the case. The right fountain pen can be a great everyday tool, even if it never approaches the tool-like functionality of a ballpoint pen.</p>

<h2><span id="What_To_Look_For_In_An_Everyday_Fountain_Pen">What To Look For In An Everyday Fountain Pen</span></h2>
<p>An everyday pen is going to vary widely based on what your everyday looks like. For many of us this means sitting at a desk and looking at a computer screen, which means that our pen needs to be comfortable, functional (without being utilitarian), and ready to go at all times.</p>
<p>For others, an everyday fountain pen might require some sort of for transportation friendliness and perhaps some degree of toughness, which veers off from the “everyday fountain pen” to the “everyday carry fountain pen.” While a perfectly valid use case, we’ll differentiate between pens that need to go with you and pens that are simply going to see a lot of use each and every day.</p>

<p>The attributes you’ll want sort through for this “workhorse” pen are…</p>
<ol><li>Reliability</li>
<li>Ease of Use (cap type, etc.)</li>
<li>Ease of Maintenance</li>
<li>Price</li>
</ol><p>I put these in order based on the impact each will have on your use of the pen and how long it lasts as your everyday writer.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong> is key because the pen has to be ready to go when you want to use it. If you are on a Zoom and you need to write something down, your pen has to be at-the-ready. If your fountain pen can’t accomplish this, you simply won’t use it all the time and will revert to the ballpoint next to it on your desk.</p>
<p>Next comes <strong>ease of use</strong>, which means the pen has to be simple and trouble-free for you and your work style. This may mean that you opt for a pen that uses cartridges and has a snap-on cap instead of a screw-on one, because both of these things make pens easier to operate. This isn’t about what’s coolest or most desirable, but rather <em>removing the factors that hinder you from using a fountain pen</em>.</p>
<p>Much of the ease of use will come from the sensitivity of the nib and the choice of a filling system. First of all, it’s critical that you find your pen’s nib to be comfortable but not overall sensitive. If every time you want to dash off a thought you are worried about about holding the pen at exactly the right angle and the nib in its perfect “sweet spot” your work will be hindered.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of maintenance</strong> might be seen as an extension of ease of use, but for people who use their fountain pen as a primary writing tool, it’s worth distinguishing between the two. A pen that is easy to maintain will have old ink cleaned out quickly, featuring a feed that lets go of ink freely. The pen will be free of sensitive parts and most parts will be easy to cheap to replace, as well as user serviceable.</p>
<p>Any talk of <strong>price</strong> must be done relative to one’s own price sensitivity as well as your budget. If you are a professional scribe (not exactly a popular choice these days) or a calligrapher, an everyday pen might be one of your most expensive purchases. For most of us, an everyday pen shouldn’t be too expensive, because it’s something we want to use, not to baby, and you won’t mind then it takes a few inevitable bumps.</p>
<p>A good price range for an everyday pen would be $20 to $180, but this is only a loose guideline. Some people are less price sensitive and will be more inclined to use the pen — that is to say, to work — with a more expensive one, but be careful with this logic as the need to use a new purchase to justify its cost will wear aware quickly.</p>
<h3><span id="A_Note_On_Affordable_Pens">A Note On Affordable Pens</span></h3>
<p>While many excellent pens are sold under the $20 price point, they don’t have the same level of fit and polish of more expensive pens. The will also not last as long as pens that are a step up in price, so you’ll find small problems accruing, like loose caps and bent clips. This is why this list doesn’t have otherwise solid pens like the <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/platinum-prefounte/">Platinum Prefounte</a>&nbsp;— they just won’t go the distance of these workhorse pens.</p>
<h2><span id="Top_Choices_For_Everyday_Fountain_Pens">Top Choices For Everyday Fountain Pens</span></h2>
<p>Here are some pens that make for excellent everyday usage over extended period of time.</p>
<ul><li><strong><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/lamy-safari-fountain-pen/">Lamy Safari</a></strong>: Affordable and highly usable, this will be the pen that comes to mind for many people. When combined with Lamy’s excellent cartridges its one of the most practical fountain pens sold today. The <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/lamy-vista-fountain-pen/">Vista</a> is just as good.</li>
<li><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/twsbi-eco-fountain-pen/"><strong>Twsbi Eco</strong></a>: This is a $30 pen that writes and has the features of a pen that’s easily twice the price. It’s highly rebuildable and pleasant both use and to maintain.</li>
<li><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/penbbs-456-fountain-pen/"><strong>Penbbs 456</strong></a>: A large, good-looking pen with a vacuum-filling mechanism that means it carries a lot of ink. The nib is surprisingly good and while it looks underwhelming is writes smoothly and reliably.</li>
<li><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/platinum-procyon/"><strong>Platinum Procyon</strong></a>: This is a pen that doesn’t get as much attention as it should. It has a stout metal body, a responsive steel nib, and a handsome design. It also has all the smart design decisions found in Platinum’s modern fountain pens, like a nib that basically never seems to try out and use of Platinum’s very good cartridges.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2ZlLIip" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lamy Studio</strong></a>: Lamy’s best mid-range fountain pen. It has more weigh than the Safari but is a good deal more affordable than the 2000. It’s a really solid choice in a sub-$100 metal fountain pen.</li>
<li><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/platinum-3776-century-fountain-pen/"><strong>Platinum 3776 Century</strong></a>: Unsharpen’s favorite fountain pen under $200, this pen writes like a dream and has a simple, reliable cartridge/converter system. The cap works great and it seals so well that the pen is always ready to write.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/pilot-custom-74-fountain-pen/">Pilot Custom 74</a></strong>: If you want a super smooth writer that has a lot of polish as well as a classic fountain pen look than the Custom 74 is a popular pick.</li>
<li><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/lamy-2000-fountain-pen/"><strong>Lamy 2000</strong></a>: This is another excellent gold nib fountain pen that is designed to last for year of writing. It’s not quite as easy to service as the rest of the pens on the list, but it is rebuildable. You get a fantastic nib and a body that shows natural wear after use, so you can really feel this pen changing over time and becoming yours.</li>
</ul><h2><span id="Pens_That_Didnt_Make_It">Pens That Didn’t Make It</span></h2>
<p>Here are some pens you might have thought would be on the list, but aren’t along with the reason they didn’t make it.</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/pilot-metropolitan/"><strong>Pilot Metropolitan</strong></a>: A good pen, but lacking in the polish of the pens on the list. Also the nib is less enjoyable and too utilitarian to be a pen that you look forward to using for years on end.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/pilot-vanishing-point/">Pilot Vanishing Point</a></strong>: Despite being a very popular pen, we’ve found the nib to be too finicky for everyday use and the likelihood of ink spitting. The pen is a bit complex on the inside too means it requires more care than any of the pens on the list.</li>
<li><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/kaweco-classic-sport-fountain-pen/"><strong>Kaweco Sport</strong></a>: A fine mini-pen but it’s a bit small and the undersized nib isn’t quite at the quality level of the others on this list. This pen is quite close to making it though.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Crossplane is often compared to HashiCorp’s Terraform. It’s common for enterprise platform teams to find Crossplane as they outgrow Terraform and look for alternatives. There are parallels between the two projects:</p><ul><li>Both allow engineers to model their infrastructure as declarative configuration</li><li>Both support managing a myriad of diverse infrastructure using "provider" plugins</li><li>Both are open source tools with strong communities</li></ul><p>The key difference is that Crossplane is a control plane, where Terraform is a command-line tool - an interface to control planes. This post touches on a handful of pain points that enterprises commonly face as they scale Terraform, and highlights how Crossplane addresses these&nbsp;issues.</p><h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2><p>Enterprises often adopt Terraform via their operations team. It’s a great way for a small team of engineers to begin to wrangle their organisation’s infrastructure. Representing infrastructure as declarative configuration allows an operations team to benefit from software engineering best practices - keeping the configuration in revision control where changes can be peer reviewed and reverted when necessary.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Cone@0.25x.png"></figure><p>Where Terraform can fall apart is when more engineers need to collaborate to manage their organisation’s infrastructure. Terraform relies on a monolithic state file to map desired configuration to actual, running infrastructure. A lock must be held on this state file while configuration is being applied, and applying a Terraform configuration is a blocking process that can take minutes to complete. During this time no other entity - no other engineer - can apply changes to the configuration. Similarly, Terraform uses a monolithic ‘apply’ process - there’s no recommended way to modify only one piece of infrastructure within a configuration. If you use the same configuration to manage your caches and your databases you must always update both - you can’t update only your caches.</p><p>Terraform recommends breaking a monolithic configuration up into increasingly more granular configurations. So while the operations team might start with a Terraform configuration that represents ‘production’, they’re encouraged to factor that out into scoped configurations like ‘production billing’ and ‘production auth’. It’s hard to get this right up front, so it can require <em>a lot</em> of refactoring over time, and often results in a complex mesh of Terraform configurations coupled by their inputs and outputs.</p><p>Collaboration scales in Crossplane because the Crossplane Resource Model (XRM) promotes loose coupling and eventual consistency. In Crossplane every piece of infrastructure is an API endpoint that supports create, read, update, and delete operations. Crossplane does not need to calculate a graph of dependencies to make a change, so you can easily operate on a single database, even if you manage your entire production environment with Crossplane.</p><h2 id="self-service">Self Service</h2><p>Modern organisations are evolving from centralised management of infrastructure to a self service model in which an operations team - often called a platform team - defines opinionated infrastructure abstractions that the development teams they support can consume on demand. Terraform has evolved to support this model through the use of <em>modules</em>. A module is not unlike a software library. Like Crossplane, Terraform resources are high-fidelity representations of an external API resource. A module provides a simplified abstraction atop a broader configuration of these resources - for example <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/rds/aws/latest">the RDS module</a> abstracts eight distinct Terraform resources into a single “RDS instance” concept.</p><p>Treating application teams as consumers of a “library” of Terraform configuration means they are subject to Terraform’s collaboration constraints. Application developers are invited to collaborate on their organisation’s infrastructure as if they were an operations team with a narrower focus. The platform team invites application development teams to share their workflow, rather than offering them a service. This means application teams must learn a new, special purpose toolset and language - Terraform and the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). It also raises the level of <em>configuration abstraction</em> for application developers without raising the level of <em>access control abstraction</em>. While the platform team can publish a module that allows an application team to manage “RDS instances”, access control remains down at the cloud provider API level and is thus framed around “database subnet groups” and “database parameter groups”.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/MulticloudCrane@0.5x-2.png"></figure><p>The Crossplane equivalent of a Terraform module is a Composite Resource - an XR. Each XR is exposed as an API endpoint. A platform team can define and document the OpenAPI schema of each XR - each API - and enforce Role Based Access Control (RBAC) at the API level. This means that if a platform team decides to frame the abstraction they offer to their development teams as “an AcmeCo PostgreSQL database” they can grant RBAC access to create, read, update, or delete an AcmeCo PostgreSQL database, rather than having to manage access to various underlying cloud concepts like RDS instances or subnet groups. Because Crossplane builds on the battle hardened Kubernetes RBAC system a platform team can easily support many teams of application developers within a single control plane. Each team can be granted access only to the abstractions they need - some might be able to manage only storage buckets, while others may be allowed to manage caches and databases.</p><p>Self service scales even further in Crossplane because any one XR may offer several classes of service. Crossplane decouples an XR’s inputs and outputs - its spec and status in Kubernetes parlance - from its implementation, which is described by a Composition. If an application developer has been granted access to create AcmeCo PostgreSQL databases, they may easily select from any of the classes of service - any of the Compositions - their platform team has declared to be compatible with said databases. These classes of service could represent production, staging, and development; AWS, Azure, and GCP; fast and slow; or any combination thereof.</p><h2 id="integration-and-automation">Integration and Automation</h2><p>Terraform sits in front of many APIs, but it does not offer its own. This leads many teams automate it by committing their Terraform configuration(s) to revision control - git - and executing Terraform as part of their CI/CD pipeline. This is an improvement relative to a team running Terraform from their laptops, but it exposes a key issue that organisations face when attempting to scale their use of Terraform. Terraform is a command line tool - not a control plane. Because it is a short lived, one-shot process it will only attempt to reconcile your desired configuration with actual infrastructure when it is invoked. Whether run from a CI/CD pipeline or a laptop Terraform is typically invoked only when an engineer <em>expects</em> that infrastructure needs updating.</p><p>Terraform’s conservative, ‘on-demand’ approach to reconciling desired with actual infrastructure state can lead to a novel deadlock. Recall that the process of applying a Terraform configuration is all-or-nothing - if you describe your caches and your databases in the same configuration you must always update both to update either. This means that if anyone in your organisation circumvents Terraform the next person to trigger a Terraform run will be faced with a surprising plan as it attempts to undo the change. Consider for example a scenario in which an engineer is paged in the middle of the night to handle an incident, makes some quick edits to the production cache configuration via the AWS console, and forgets to reflect those changes in Terraform. It’s not unheard of for infrastructure to drift so much that applying a Terraform configuration becomes a risky, intimidating proposition.</p><p>Crossplane, on the other hand, is built as a series of long lived, always-on control loops. It constantly observes and corrects an organisation’s infrastructure to match its desired configuration whether changes are expected or not. This disincentivizes teams from circumventing Crossplane. When Crossplane has been asked to manage a piece of infrastructure any change made outside it will automatically and persistently be reverted.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Terraform-Stack.svg"></figure><p>A continued theme among the pain points organisations face with Terraform is that it does not offer an API. Integrating with Terraform is challenging because it is configured using a Domain Specific Language (DSL) - HCL - and invoked by calling a command line tool. Crossplane exposes a REST API - the lingua franca of automation. Whether a team writes mostly shell scripts, mostly Python, or mostly Erlang common patterns and libraries will exist for integrating with REST APIs and thus for integrating with Crossplane.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Crossplane-Stack.svg"></figure><p>Crossplane doesn’t expose any old REST API. Building on the Kubernetes API means that teams can orchestrate all of their infrastructure - cloud and otherwise - using tools like kubectl. The same tools they use to orchestrate their containerised applications. Crossplane can even expose the details an application needs to connect to infrastructure as a Kubernetes secret to ease integration. It can be paired with projects like ArgoCD, Gatekeeper, or Velero to enable GitOps, advanced policy, and backups. Need bespoke automation? Leverage one of many well documented frameworks to build your own Kubernetes operator that integrates with Crossplane.</p><h2 id="why-not-both">Why Not Both?</h2><p>Crossplane and Terraform can both orchestrate an organisation’s infrastructure. There are similarities between the two, but each project approaches orchestration differently. Terraform offers a command-line interface to control plane APIs, while Crossplane is <em>itself</em> a control plane that can be used to build abstractions atop other control planes. Because Crossplane enables a platform team to offer their own control plane it avoids many of the challenges platform teams face when scaling Terraform.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Crossplane-Stack-with-Terraform.svg"></figure><p>Savvy readers might notice …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    <div>
      <p>I recently proposed a new research project idea: let’s take all of GitHub (or &lt;insert your preferred VCS host&gt;) and create a multi-language (even partially language-agnostic) concrete syntax tree of all the code so that we can do some otherwise impossibly difficult further research and answer incredibly complex questions.</p>

<p>This project is named <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree">World Syntax Tree</a>, or WST in short.</p>

<p>Originally I started the project using MongoDB and storing references between nodes as <code>ObjectID</code>s, but I quickly realized that a tabular format was not performant enough to be able to effectively represent a true tree.</p>

<p>So instead I switched over the whole project to the first and foremost graph database I came across: Neo4j.</p>

<p>As I quickly learned the new database paradigm I also quickly learned that there are a lot of problems between me and inserting literally hundreds of terabytes of data into a single graph…</p>



<p>The very first designs used <a href="https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neomodel">neomodel</a> to control the layout and define the graph connections, and in fact <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/06c58a8ce5e06e3150334e454aeee89ae4a6bbb1/wsyntree/tree_models.py">we still use neomodel</a> for the less performance-sensitive parts of the collection process.</p>

<p>After running with neomodel for a fairly long time it was obvious it was far too much overhead when I inspected the collector process with <code>cProfile</code> and <a href="https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/">snakeviz</a>.</p>

<p>Using neomodel there were more than twice as many required queries for simply inserting one syntax node (<code>WSTNode</code>), extra checks like Cardinality and multiple statements just to set properties on newly created nodes were quite slow: at best I found I could insert a few hundred nodes per second using 128 processes.</p>



<p>From just the first few google results it was clear that writing my own raw cypher queries was the next move in order to better control exactly what operations needed to happen.</p>

<figure>
  
  <a href="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/n1.png"><img src="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/n1.png" alt="Profiler view: Majority of runtime stuck inside neomodel's checks"></a>
  
  <figcaption>Profiler view: Majority of runtime stuck inside neomodel's checks</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The next PR that came from these efforts reworked the WSTNode creation routine into a series of functions that each did a distinct task: <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/c8d3f9f2c04f231dd93b4504b72a3f4da097edcf/wsyntree_collector/neo4j_collector_worker.py#L31-L91">create the node, connect the node, add the node text, connect the node text,</a> etc.</p>

<p>This did improve compared to using neomodel, but now the major bottleneck was really waiting on the network socket.</p>

<figure>
  
  <a href="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/n2.png"><img src="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/n2.png" alt="Profiler view: Reduced total runtime and approximately even split between each function call"></a>
  
  <figcaption>Profiler view: Reduced total runtime and approximately even split between each function call</figcaption>
</figure>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each of those 5 blocks corresponds to one of the 5 functions used during insertion of a WSTNode, noticing how they were all approximately the same size led me onto my next improvement…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Once I saw how long each query took to initialize a connection and read back the results I figured I should reduce the total number of queries, which was quite easy really.</p>

<p>Instead of creating a node, returning the ID, running a new query to connect using that ID… just rewriting the create query to connect the new node as well meant an entire query less to execute!</p>

<p>So now that we <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/ea9dcc968e83534318a049268ca5c674b7ae6d1c/wsyntree_collector/neo4j_collector_worker.py#L31-L107">reduced the number of calls made per node by more than half</a> we saw a reasonable improvement, but we’re still only talking about a few hundred nodes per second even with more than a 100 workers.</p>



<p>Now we’re at the difficult part of the problem. Because we’re inserting a collection of nodes that refer to each other, we can’t iterate them all in parallel, otherwise some nodes might not have their parent node written to the database yet.</p>

<p>So in order to do this I needed to add another property to the WSTNode structure: <code>preorder</code>. This property was unique for nodes within a file and is calculated before we insert the WSTNode into the database, meaning we can use this property to refer to nodes before they are given a node ID by neo4j.</p>

<p>Once we have a way to refer to nodes uniquely within the file we can batch together large numbers of node insertions by using the super-magical <code>UNWIND</code> cypher statement. Essentially this allows us to pass a huge query parameter (like 10,000 node’s worth of properties in a list) and <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/06c58a8ce5e06e3150334e454aeee89ae4a6bbb1/wsyntree_collector/neo4j_collector_worker.py#L71-L86">execute a single query to create those 10,000 nodes</a>.</p>



<p>If any experienced Neo4j user has followed along so far, they might have already realized that the <code>preorder</code> property on my WSTNodes is not unique within the graph, so even though <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/06c58a8ce5e06e3150334e454aeee89ae4a6bbb1/wsyntree/tree_models.py#L65">we do have an index on that property</a>, when your graph grows to terabytes in size, you will have far too many nodes with the same <code>preorder</code> to efficiently search them all to find the one that has a relationship to the same <code>WSTFile</code> node we’re working in.</p>

<p>Because of <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/06c58a8ce5e06e3150334e454aeee89ae4a6bbb1/wsyntree_collector/neo4j_collector_worker.py#L75">this single extra condition inside the WHERE clause</a> the Neo4j database regularly would pin all 128 hardware threads of our lab server just searching through <code>WSTNode</code>s with the same <code>preorder</code> just to find the one that has a relationship to our <code>WSTFile</code>.</p>

<p>So instead I needed a way to refer to the nodes I just created with a constant-time lookup. I spent a whole day just thinking about how to overcome this problem, and finally ended up just accepting the fact that it would be faster to just execute two queries rather than continue banging my head against cypher syntax quirks.</p>

<p>After the first query I use the returned created node IDs to do the constant-time relationship creation in the second query. There might be some way to create relationships based on results from an <code>UNWIND</code>, but as long as we’ve got constant-time inserts on the db side I am happy.</p>

<p>And it was indeed faster:</p>

  <figcaption>Snakeviz of single-file run</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>How’s that for performance improvement? We went from 330 seconds to under 3! Of course, 330 seconds for a single file was kind of absurd in the first place.</p>

  <figcaption>Terminal progress view via tqdm: inserting over 100k WSTNodes per second via 128 processes</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now that my program was blazing fast, Neo4j has trouble keeping up:</p>



<p>These are problems I encountered outside the scope of my own program.</p>

<h2 id="too-many-transactions-in-memory">Too many transactions in memory</h2>

<figure>
  
  <a href="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/oops.png"><img src="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/oops.png" alt="Watching our 512GB of RAM get used and Neo4j gets OOM'd"></a>
  
  <figcaption>Watching our 512GB of RAM get used and Neo4j gets OOM'd</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>My initial guess for large batch sizes was around 10,000 nodes per query, however when we multiply that by 128 (processes running in parallel) and a conservative estimate for RAM usage, we’re looking at trying to processes transactions in memory at multiple gigabytes per second.</p>

<p>The solution to this was to manually set the memory settings in <code>neo4j.conf</code>, since I have a fairly large system dedicated to research work I could steal quite a bit of memory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Settings from memrec had to be changed a bit vs what was recommended:
# I need at least 128G left over for my own code to run on the same system
</span><span>dbms</span>.<span>memory</span>.<span>heap</span>.<span>initial_size</span>=<span>31</span><span>g</span>
<span>dbms</span>.<span>memory</span>.<span>heap</span>.<span>max_size</span>=<span>128</span><span>g</span>
<span>dbms</span>.<span>memory</span>.<span>pagecache</span>.<span>size</span>=<span>259500</span><span>m</span>

<span># It is also recommended turning out-of-memory errors into full crashes,
# instead of allowing a partially crashed database to continue running:
</span><span>dbms</span>.<span>jvm</span>.<span>additional</span>=-<span>XX</span>:+<span>ExitOnOutOfMemoryError</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="database-not-up-to-the-requested-version">Database not up to the requested version</h2>

<div><div><pre><code>neo4j.exceptions.TransientError: {code: Neo.TransientError.Transaction.BookmarkTimeout} {message: Database 'top1k' not up to the requested version: 113071. Latest database version is 113054}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a tricky one, I still haven’t fully pinned down the exact conditions for this to happen, but it boils down to the database not applying the transactions in a timely manner, meaning the current “live version” could be more than a few transactions out of date. (With my scale of data it ranged from 5-20 versions out of date.)</p>

<p>The best solution I could come up for this problem was to only run half as many worker processes, my guess is that the database was having trouble handling 128 consecutive transactions at a time.</p>

<p>I’d like to know why exactly this happens, and if possible I would much rather prefer the query to stall until the requested version is met (or error the original query if that version can’t be reached) rather than fail a query later on.</p>

<p>If you happen to know something about why or how this happens, please leave a comment, email me, or even <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree">open an issue on our project</a>!</p>

<h3 id="a-persistent-problem">A persistent problem</h3>

<p>I thought if I reduced the load on the database significantly it would have no problem keeping up, so I brought the batch size down to just 100 and ran only 8 processes, and yet we still arrive at the same problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Database ‘top1k’ not up to the requested version: 2282021. Latest database version is 2282020</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is my database stuck in 2020 you ask? Not a clue, so this is really where the adventure begins.</p>

<p>Over the few days since initial release of this post, I have been trying nothing but to get to the bottom of why this is occuring, I have carefully picked through both the neo4j <code>debug.log</code> and <code>query.log</code> and nothing really stood out as a problem.</p>

<p>One thing notable about these errors is they always seem to happen after passing around ~250GB of data stored. The most I could store before being stopped by this error was ~319GB (uncompressed) in the neo4j data directory. There are only ~500 million nodes and ~1.7 billion relationships at this point, meaning the average inserted node was well under a kilobyte, all within reason.</p>

<p>I can definitively confirm that there’s no problem with the hardware, the data directory is stored on a RAIDZ (zfs) array of all SSD storage, and I’ve confirmed that I/O time is not the bottleneck, and there are over 50 unused CPU cores to spare.</p>

<p>So my thoughts now are that the insert time for these nodes might not actually be constant as I thought, otherwise we’d see the same behavior between millions of nodes and just a few thousand. Perhaps there’s nonlinear work being done in some of the indexes? Maybe the data is too large to be indexed fully? There are a number of reasons to test, so finding the real cause will take quite a bit of time.</p>

			<p>I like to make things as difficult for myself as possible, so first, I decided to become an independent-minded female immigrant in a parochial and patriarchal nation; then, when that got boring, I decided to become a woman in tech, where I found myself giving conference talks to rooms of professionals who could, technically and biologically, be my grown adult children.</p>

<p><span>T</span>hen, when that got boring, I pivoted out of code tech to policy tech, where I now find myself in much more forgiving company. Which is to say, for the first time since my non-tech career, I work alongside and in partnership with other Gen Xers.</p>
<p><em>Insert any number of Buzzfeed listicles here about what it’s like to be a GenXer in tech: we learned on floppies and dialup; we coded out of print magazines; we sowed our teenage wild oats on the parental tether of nothing more than a coin in a pay phone; we lived entire years of our student lives without a single photograph being taken of us; we navigated 9/11 on dumb cell phones which had antennas; we now live datafied existences, raising datafied children attending datafied virtual schools, in a world where everything we were raised to believe would sort us for life turned out to be boomer bullshit.</em></p>
<p>All of those formative experiences give us (cough) fortysomethings a perspective on the internet which the boomers who birthed us lack, and which the millenials who followed us will never know.</p>
<p>In fact, we’ve gotten a lot of mileage out of the trope of the internet being threatened by elderly politicians who don’t understand it, or us. And that trope, for the most part, is as true as it ever was.</p>
<p>I can count on one hand the number of boomer-aged Parliamentarians in my network who well and truly understand the internet and its culture. They’re good folks who have my time, anytime. The rest, sadly, have more in common with the editorial board of the now-unreadable Glasgow broadsheet which issues weekly diatribes against the internet and all those who sail in her: every word steeped in all the offended sense of entitlement that bitter old men can muster, every rant beating the same dead horse against an internet which took away the newspaper readership that should, in their opinions, be hanging on every word that comes out of their privileged white Scottish male mouths.</p>
<p>So goes it for lawmakers, who – by nature and by privilege – have been insulated from the social and economic changes which necessitated the shift from the web as a geek hobby to the web as democratised culture. The ones who legislate aginst the web as if trying to restore an old world which existed before it, a world which only ever benefited people who looked and sounded like them.</p>
<p>Those lawmakers were who I expected to spend most of my time dealing with after my full-time pivot to policy.</p>
<p>The reality has been a lot more mind-blowing to comprehend than that.</p>
<p>Brace yourself.</p>
<p>When I was in my early twenties, in the late 90s and early 00s, running work missions across downtown Washington DC – pop into the Capitol complex here, run a folder to the White House there, drop off something for the Secretary of State on a long lunch break – everyone I encountered looked like me. The same age, the same countenance, the same Scully red hair (hey, it worked on me). Government may have been directed by professional politicians, but its actual daily mechanics were run by kids just out of university who had all the energy in the world and nothing and no one holding them down.</p>
<p>That’s universal, and it hasn’t changed. Government and policy – the mechanics and grunt work, not the media showmanship – are powered by an army of hard-working, very young people who have all of the academic knowledge and very little of the practical experience. Those young folks, now, in 2021, who were in nappies when I was on the Hill, now run whatever corridors of power they (virtually) travel through, in professional support of those older politicians.</p>
<p>And it’s these young professionals – <em>not the boomer career politicians</em> – who are setting the tone of internet policy.</p>
<p>And here’s the thing.</p>
<p>We – the GenXers – think of the internet as the open web. The land of dialup telnet Unix systems, the days of table layout, the days of dot com, the days of early tech startups, the days of the internet as a connector, the days of the internet as a business opportunity, the days of the internet as a path to social justice and revolutions, the days of the internet as a light in the darkness. That’s all we have ever known.</p>
<p>Today’s policy facilitators – the millenials – think of the internet as MySpace and Facebook. The closed web. The land of always-on broadband and wifi, the days of content management systems, the days of tech bros, the days of the internet as a divider, the days of the internet as an acquisition for the giants, the days of the internet as a path to radicalisation and hatred, the days of the internet as petrol on a spark. That is all they have ever known.</p>
<p>And that is what they draft policy briefings, proposals, and legislation against.</p>
<p>Laws on freedom of speech. Laws on privacy. Laws on encryption. Laws on private surveillance. Laws on state surveillance.</p>
<p>The truths I held to be self-evident are things they have never known.</p>
<p>And, politically, they are in the driving seat. They are running the show.</p>
<p><em>Not me. Not the old folks. Them.</em></p>
<p>Just like I was, a long time ago, with my Scully hair, in my Unix dialup world, a world before the TV signal briefly went out because the antenna which controlled the TV signal was on top of the tower with the plane-shaped hole in it, the hole which turned one of my university classmates into a centimetre-long fragment of a finger recovered 18 months later.</p>
<p>Today’s young tech policy professionals are are, quite rightfully, responding to the only internet in the only world they have ever known. The awful one. The one where the internet <em>was and is</em> a handful of billion-pound companies. The one where the internet has only ever been petrol on a fire. The one where the internet has been essential infrastructure like water and heat, not a thing you had to request and master. The closed internet made for them. Not the open internet I got to make.</p>
<p>So if you think that the biggest threat to encryption is elderly politicians who still need their secretaries to print out emails for them, it’s time you found yourself in a meeting with someone under the age of 30 who is going to war against encryption because <em>he</em> has never needed encryption in his life.</p>
<p>If you think that the biggest threat to internet freedom is old white men who hate the internet because it does not allow them to attack anyone who does not look or sound like them, it’s time you found yourself in a meeting with someone under the age of 30 who is unabashedly in favour of mandatory identity verification for all users of the internet to protect people who look and sound like her.</p>
<p>And if you think that the biggest threat to freedom of speech on the open web is a tech billionaire in California, it’s time you found yourself in a meeting with someone under the age of 30 who sees a legislative victory against online freedom of speech, cloaked in the mantle of a victory against the tech billionaire, as a useful stepping stone to his political ambitions.</p>
<p>Those old Thatcherites still in politics, the elderly dames in the Lords, the newspaper editors with the offended senses of entitlement, they can whinge all they want about how the internet has changed the world they knew. And you can continue to waste your time on them, and their tropes, if it makes you feel better about yourself.</p>
<p>But political power, now, rests in the hands of young professionals who are – <em>rightfully – </em>legislating to change the only internet they have ever known.</p>
<p>The shitty corporate one.</p>
<p>The open web we let slip through our fingers.</p>
<p>And maybe, just maybe, the best things standing in their way of their spite and their avarice and their political aspirations are the Gen X fortysomethings who saw something better about the open web, and comprehended what was on their screens in a way that nothing has ever touched them since, and still believe in what the open web can be, and understand where things went wrong, and have an idea of how to put things right, and know how to create and use and fork the tools to make it so, and know the north stars they navigate home by, and have never, ever forgotten them, and who need a little bit of reminding, in chaotic times, of what it was like to telnet into a blank screen which contained the entire world.</p>

March 6, 2021 | https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/kubernetes-operator-pattern/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/kubernetes-operator-pattern/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a name="cut"></a>
I've been using Kubernetes for almost a year now and, to be honest, I like the experience so far. Most of my use cases were rather trivial and thanks to its declarative approach, Kubernetes makes deploying and scaling stateless services pretty simple. I usually just describe my application in a YAML file as a set of interconnected services, feed it to Kubernetes, and let the built-in <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/">control loops</a> bring the state of the cluster closer to the desired state by creating or destroying some resources for me automagically.</p>
<p>However, many times I've heard that <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/screaming-in-the-cloud/the-staying-power-of-kubernetes-with-kelsey-hightower/">the real power of Kubernetes comes with its extensibility</a>. Kubernetes designed for automation. It brings a lot of useful automation out of the box. But it also provides extension points that can be used to customize Kubernetes capabilities. The cleverness of the Kubernetes design is that it encourages you to keep the extensions feel native! So when I stumbled upon the first few Kubernetes Operators on my Ops way, I could not even recognize that I'm dealing with custom logic...</p>
<p>In this article, I'll try to take a closer look at the Operators pattern, see which Kubernetes parts are involved in operators implementation, and what makes operators feel like first-class Kubernetes citizens. Of course, with as many pictures as possible.
<a name="eofcut"></a></p>
<h2 id="a-namekubernetes-objects-and-controllersakubernetes-objects-and-controllers"><a name="kubernetes-objects-and-controllers"></a>Kubernetes Objects and Controllers</h2>
<p>Everything in Kubernetes seems to revolve around <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/">objects</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/">controllers</a>.</p>
<p>Kubernetes objects such as Pods, Namespaces, ConfigMaps, or Events are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster. Objects are also used as "records of intent." By creating (or removing) objects one can describe the <em>desired</em> state of the Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p><i>Objects are like data structures.</i></p>
<p>On the other hand, controllers are infinite loops that watch the <em>actual</em> and the <em>desired</em> states of your cluster. When these two states diverge, controllers start making changes aiming to bring the current state of the cluster closer to the desired one.</p>
<p><i>Controllers are like algorithms.</i></p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/kubernetes-operator-pattern/kube-control-loop-3000-opt.png" width="100%" alt="Kubernetes Control Loop">
</p>

<p>I'll get to the controllers part later in this article and now let's focus on the objects.</p>
<h2 id="a-namekubernetes-api-architectureakubernetes-api-architecture"><a name="kubernetes-api-architecture"></a>Kubernetes API Architecture</h2>
<p>All interactions with Kubernetes objects, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/client-libraries/">directly</a> or <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/">indirectly</a>, happen through <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/">Kubernetes API</a> - a highly structured masterpiece of software design.</p>
<p>There is a ton of documentation written on Kubernetes API and related topics and I spent quite some time digesting it. Since we are going to talk about the Kubernetes Operator pattern which heavily depends on the capabilities of the Kubernetes API, it's important to familiarize ourselves with the API design principles first. Following is my super-condensed excerpt from the docs.</p>
<p>Kubernetes offers a RESTful declarative HTTP API. Still remember those Kubernetes objects? <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-resources">A collection of objects of a certain kind form an <em>API resource</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A resource is an endpoint in the Kubernetes API that stores a collection of API objects of a certain kind; for example, the built-in pods resource contains a collection of Pod objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can always check the list of available API resources using <code>kubectl api-resources</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl api-resources
NAME          SHORTNAMES   APIVERSION   NAMESPACED   KIND
namespaces    ns           v1           false        Namespace
nodes         no           v1           false        Node
pods          po           v1           true         Pod
deployments   deploy       apps/v1      true         Deployment
jobs                       batch/v1     true         Job
...</code></pre>
<p>OK, great, we've got resources. But Kubernetes evolves quickly. What if a new attribute needs to be added to an existing resource definition? API versioning is always hard. <i>&lt;speculation mode&gt;</i>Apparently, Kubernetes API started with a common prefix <code>/api/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;resource&gt;</code> for all the API resources. However, a change in a single resource would require a whole API version bump. So, with the growth in the number of available resources, the need for some sort of grouping and subversioning emerged.<i>&lt;/speculation mode&gt;</i></p>
<p>API groups to the rescue! <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-groups-and-versioning">A bunch of related resources forms an API group</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To make it easier to evolve and to extend its API, Kubernetes implements API groups that can be enabled or disabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also check the list of available API groups and their versions using <code>kubectl api-versions</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl api-versions
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
apiregistration.k8s.io/v1
apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
apps/v1
...</code></pre>
<p>Well, at this point, I should warn you - it seems that in the documentation, the term <em>resource</em> is often used in the meaning of an <em>object</em> (but not vice versa). So, context matters.</p>
<p>In Kubernetes, objects of the same kind are distinguished by their names. So, if you start two Pods, both should get a unique name. But clusters can be pretty big and since names are supposed to be unique within a cluster, we need a mechanism to prevent collisions. Something like lots of logical clusters within one physical cluster. Allow me to introduce you to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#when-to-use-multiple-namespaces"><em>namespaces</em></a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Namespaces provide a scope for names. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces. Namespaces cannot be nested inside one another and each Kubernetes resource can only be in one namespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, API objects are fully qualified by their API group, resource type, namespace (unless cluster-scoped), and name.</p>
<p>Have you become totally confused by this time? No, worries, I've got a <del>simple</del> diagram for you 🙈</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/kubernetes-operator-pattern/kube-api-structure-3000-opt.png" width="100%" alt="Kubernetes API structure"></p><p><i>Kubernetes API structure.</i></p>
</div>

<p>So, a quick summary - we've learned about objects, resources, groups, and namespaces. But what's up with the promised customization?</p>
<h2 id="a-namekubernetes-custom-resourcesakubernetes-custom-resources"><a name="kubernetes-custom-resources"></a>Kubernetes Custom Resources</h2>
<p>It seems like there is <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-api-machinery/README.md">a great deal of effort</a> in keeping the Kubernetes API coherent but extensible.</p>
<p>What do I mean by <em>coherent</em> here? Kubernetes API consists of endpoints called <em>resources</em>. These API resources adhere to a set of common requirements - they are nouns and manipulated in a declarative manner (RESTful CRUD), they should be updated relatively infrequently and be reasonably small in size, their names should be <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-subdomain-names">valid DNS subdomains</a>, etc.</p>
<p>These restrictions allow unifying the resource workflows. For instance, you can get, describe, or update a collection of Pods in pretty much the same way as a collection of Services, Nodes, or RBAC roles:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl get pods
$ kubectl get services
$ kubectl get roles

$ kubectl describe pods  # or services, or roles

$ kubectl edit pods  # or services, or roles</code></pre>
<p>Not only <code>kubectl</code> benefits from this uniformity. Here is a full list of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#common-features">common features</a> enabled by the unified design:</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/kubernetes-operator-pattern/kube-api-common-features-3000-opt.png" width="100%" alt="Kubernetes API common features"></p>
</div>

<p>It's pretty handy, isn't it?</p>
<p>So, if I were to extend the API, it'd be reasonable for me to expect that my endpoints would benefit from this common functionality as well. But that would mean that the API extension should be done by adding more resources!</p>
<p>And indeed, in Kubernetes, one can easily register <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-resources"><em>custom resources</em></a>. The procedure is fully dynamic and doesn't require restarting or updating the API server.</p>
<p>How such a custom resource can be added? Well, again, it's Kubernetes! Of course, by interacting with another, already existing resource! There is a special API resource called <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions">CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The CustomResourceDefinition API resource allows you to define custom resources. Defining a CRD object creates a new custom resource with a name and schema that you specify.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#create-a-customresourcedefinition">from another documentation page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you create a new CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), the Kubernetes API Server creates a new RESTful resource path for each version you specify.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-namehow-to-create-custom-resourceahow-to-create-custom-resource"><a name="how-to-create-custom-resource"></a>How to Create Custom Resource</h2>
<p>Let's try to create a custom resource. Remember, a resource specifies a certain kind of Kubernetes object. Canonically, objects possess some attributes. So, our CustomResourceDefinition should be mostly concerned with describing the attributes of our future resource. Additionally, it's good to know that custom resources can be either namespaced or cluster-scoped. This is specified in the CRD's scope field.</p>

If there's anything you'd like to say, be welcome to <a href="#comments">add a comment</a> (at the bottom of the blog post).</p><p><img src="https://graphql-api.com/images/building-in-the-open-episode-1/welcome.png" alt="A welcome to the newsletter, by your host" loading="lazy" width="928" height="550"></p><h2 id="heading-what-we've-been-coding-on">What we've been coding on<a href="#heading-what-we've-been-coding-on"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>If you notice the <a href="https://graphql-api.com/guides/">Guides</a>, section "Extending the GraphQL API" is still pretty empty:</p><figure><img src="https://graphql-api.com/images/building-in-the-open-episode-1/guides-extending-section.jpg" alt="Guides for &quot;Extending the plugin&quot; are not yet complete" loading="lazy" width="928" height="965"><figcaption>Guides for 'Extending the plugin' are not yet complete</figcaption></figure><p>My priority is to complete these guides. But before I do that, I want the plugin's code to be as simple as possible. The simpler it is, the less documentation is required, and the more anyone and everyone is able to understand it.</p><p>With this in mind, I've decided to refactor the code, to have it be fully based on <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection.html">Symfony's DependencyInjection Component</a>.</p><p>The idea is that any extension to the plugin (such as a custom <code>TypeResolver</code>, <code>FieldResolver</code> or <code>DirectiveResolver</code>) is simply defined as a service in the container, and the service is automatically configured via <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/compiler_passes.html">Compiler passes</a>.</p><p>Fully relying on Symfony's dependency injection has several advantages:</p><p>✅ There is a single, consistent way to create extensions<br>✅ Just creating a PHP class implementing some interface does the whole job, and the developer needs not be aware of the nitty-gritty details<br>✅ Symfony's documentation is very extensive. By pointing developers to it, that is documentation that <strong>I do not need to write</strong></p><p>Interested in the code? Check out my latest merged PRs (<a href="https://github.com/leoloso/PoP/pull/453">#453</a>, <a href="https://github.com/leoloso/PoP/pull/452">#452</a>, <a href="https://github.com/leoloso/PoP/pull/449">#449</a> and several others).</p><p>I will keep working on this code for the upcoming weeks, until the migration is 100% complete, and I get to write the missing guides.</p><h2 id="heading-traffic-to-graphql-api.com">Traffic to graphql-api.com<a href="#heading-traffic-to-graphql-api.com"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>Let me be clear on something: I care about how many people visit the plugin's website, as a proxy to know how many people know about the plugin.</p><p>I don't have deep pockets to publicize my plugin. And even if I did, I wouldn't spend my money on promoting it, since that goes against the spirit of open source. (This would be different if open source were just a channel to sell some product or service, but that's not my case.)</p><p>That means that I rely fully on word of mouth to promote it. For that, I've been devoting plenty of effort in writing high-quality content for <a href="https://graphql-api.com/blog/">the plugin's blog</a>, hoping this content would get shared around, reaching people who would otherwise not know about the plugin.</p><p>And so far, I'm pretty happy with the results.</p><p>During the past month, I've had 4.5k visitors, with 6k page views:</p><figure><img src="https://graphql-api.com/images/building-in-the-open-episode-1/traffic.jpg" alt="Show me the money!" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="940"><figcaption>Show me the money!</figcaption></figure><p>Let's break down these stats.</p><p>Most of my visitors come from Hacker News, where I managed to pull a few "Show HN" front pages, and Reddit, mostly from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/">/r/PHP</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/graphql/">/r/graphql</a> (where I always share my articles).</p><p>I managed to <a href="https://twitter.com/losoviz/status/1365873932675391488">rank #1 on Google when searching "wordpress core graphql"</a>, and that brought plenty of traffic. Unfortunately, it was a one time-off: after 24hs it went away as suddenly as it arrived. Otherwise, on a typical day I get between 3 and 10 visitors from Google.</p><p>Twitter and Facebook bring a sizable amount of traffic, but I don't know from who (not from me, since I am extremely bad at social media). I do share my articles on Twitter, but they seldom get retweeted. And I do not use 👎🏾 Facebook.</p><p>(Btw, for those of you who share my articles on social media, thanks ❤️)</p><p>I get some modest but consistent traffic from the <a href="https://graphql.org/code/#php">listing of GraphQL servers in PHP on graphql.org</a>, and from <a href="https://dev.to/leoloso/executing-multiple-queries-in-a-single-operation-in-graphql-goe">an article I've published on dev.to</a>, which ranks #1 when <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=graphql+execute+multiple+queries">googling "graphql execute multiple queries"</a>.</p><p>Finally, my articles consistently appear in WordPress' main newsletters (including <a href="https://wpowls.co/">WP Owls</a>, <a href="https://wpmail.me/">wpMail.me</a>, <a href="https://poststatus.com/newsletter/">Post Status</a>, <a href="https://wpbuilds.com/">WP Builds</a>, and <a href="https://thewpweekly.com/">The WP Weekly</a>). I don't know exactly how much traffic each of them brings, since the referrer will appear as Gmail and similar others. However, when taken together, these newsletters produce a sizable number of visitors.</p><p>My blog posts are by far my most popular content, with the last three (<a href="https://graphql-api.com/blog/why-wordpress-should-have-a-graphql-api-in-core/">this one</a>, <a href="https://graphql-api.com/blog/graphql-api-vs-wpgraphql-the-fight/">this one</a> and <a href="https://graphql-api.com/blog/rejuvenating-wordpress-through-graphql/">this one</a>) bringing over 1k visitors each.</p><p>These numbers look pretty good, more since I barely launched the website less than 2 months ago. However, not everything looks good: At 88%, the bounce rate is quite high. I need to work on that.</p><h2 id="heading-metrics">Metrics<a href="#heading-metrics"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>Traffic to the site is only a decorative metric, to estimate awareness of the plugin. But far more important to ask is: How many people started using the plugin during the past month?</p><figure><img src="https://graphql-api.com/images/building-in-the-open-episode-1/multiply.png" alt="My reputation precedes me" loading="lazy" width="928" height="550"><figcaption>My reputation precedes me</figcaption></figure><p>During the past month, the plugin fared like this:</p><p>🎯 Number of plugin downloads: 170<br>⭐️ GitHub stars: 27</p><p>The number of downloads can be retrieved from the GitHub API, passing param <code>per_page=3</code> to include only the 3 releases created during the last month:</p><pre><code><span><span>curl</span> -H <span>"Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json"</span> https://api.github.com/repos/leoloso/PoP/releases?per_page<span>=</span><span>3</span> <span>|</span> <span>grep</span> <span>"download_count"</span></span></code></pre><p>I am neither happy nor unhappy about these numbers. They are not great (and I wish they were better), but they are a good start.</p><p>Concerning <strong>downloads</strong>, it is said that getting the first user is the most difficult task. Only after a few people start using the plugin, and start talking about it, that its use will become more widespread. I am still within this initial stage of finding the first batch of commited users.</p><p>Concerning <strong>GitHub stars</strong>, I must say it looks pretty flat: around 1 star per day on average. This is certainly nothing great. If you like what I'm building with the GraphQL API for WordPress, and you don't mind showing some ❤️ love, then please consider <a href="https://github.com/leoloso/PoP">giving it a ⭐️ star on GitHub</a>.</p><h2 id="heading-financial-sustainability">Financial Sustainability<a href="#heading-financial-sustainability"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>This one is the tough issue: the project must be financially sustainable. It either generates a bit of money, or it won't make it for long.</p><figure><img src="https://graphql-api.com/images/building-in-the-open-episode-1/cheese.png" alt="In this goes my life" loading="lazy" width="928" height="800"><figcaption>In this goes my life</figcaption></figure><p>If I am able to make an income for myself, then I can keep working on it, for as long as needed. That's all I need: an income. Not investors knocking on my door looking for millions. Just a couple thousands per month, to pay for the roof above my head.</p><p>My goal is to keep the plugin fully open source. For that, I'm currently reaching out to a couple of potential sponsors, asking if they'd like to help fund the development of the plugin. It will be a win-win situation.</p><p>Why am I resorting to some "big guns" sponsors, instead of relying on regular sponsorship, by anyone from the community?</p><p>Yes, I've been trying that too: I am on <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/leoloso">GitHub Sponsors</a>. However, it doesn't really work, unless you already have thousands of users, followers, or people subscribed to your mailing list, to whom you can reach out to, expecting many of them to fund you.</p><p>For instance, asking for a standard u$d 5 or 10 per month, I'd need several hundred funders for this approach to fund my work. And I'm nowhere near that stage.</p><p>But even more, who can really succeed with this approach? I know that Caleb Porzio (creator of Livewire) <a href="https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it">has made it</a>, and has now <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/calebporzio#sponsors">reached over 1350 sponsors</a>! But that's more the exception than the norm.</p><p>Take Composer, for instance. Composer has fundamentally changed how we develop PHP applications, yet <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/composer">they barely have 90 sponsors</a>. How could I ever expect to get more sponsors than Composer?</p><p>That's why my current approach is to create a win-win situation for my project and the few companies willing to sponsor it. Let's hope it will work out, and the GraphQL API is free for everyone, for all the features, and I don't need to lock the good stuff behind a paywall.</p><p>(If you'd like to find out how it's a win-win, please <a href="https://graphql-api.com/contact">send me an email</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/losoviz">DM</a>. Maybe your company may be interested too?)</p><p>I'll give this approach a few months, hopefully I will make it happen. If I don't succeed, only then I will need to consider building a PRO version of the plugin, and restricting some of the features for the paid version. (Yeah, that would suck, so I hope I can avoid that stage.)</p><p>In the upcoming newsletters, I will keep you updated if I managed to get sponsors or not.</p><h2 id="heading-blog-posts">Blog posts<a href="#heading-blog-posts"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>The blog posts have been my absolute pride and joy.</p><p><strong>Heads up:</strong> Did you know there's an <a href="https://graphql-api.com/feed.xml">RSS feed on the site</a>?

But inspired by Charles Elton's seminal work on invasive biology, he transferred into the zoology program at North Dakota State University. He then went on to study under Elton at Oxford University, where he graduated with his doctorate in 1968.</p>  <h2>'Playing chess with a gorilla'</h2>  <p>But despite the credentials, Vinebrooke says Schindler&nbsp;was not interested in having his work cloistered inside the ivory tower. Instead, he pursued projects, such as Experimental Lakes, that would make ecology accessible to the public, following in the steps of Elton and Rachel Carson's<em> Silent Spring</em>, another significant influence.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"He always put it in some sort of a context where it could benefit greater human society," said Vinebrooke, professor of aquatic ecology at the University of Alberta.&nbsp;</p>  <p>That commitment to vocal public education often put him at odds with politicians, including&nbsp;a clash with then-Premier Ralph Klein in the 1990s over pulp mill contamination in the Athabasca River. He would go on to criticize the rollback of water protections under Prime Minister Stephen Harper and castigate what he called the disregard for treaty rights in the oilsands, according to his Order of Canada biography.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But the science was always more fun than&nbsp;the public forays, Schindler told the CBC in a 2010 profile.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"It isn't in hassling with politicians and that, which is to me rather like playing chess with a gorilla. The game is boring and you know you are going to win, but you have to be prepared to duck once in a while when they get angry and take a swing at you," he said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In a three-part reflection authored on the eve of his retirement in 2013, Schindler issued an entreaty to young scientists to take up the cause of preserving earth's biodiversity and to question the "shameless promotion of growth and consumption."&nbsp;</p>  <p>"So, future scientists, we desperately need your help to show us the way," he said. "The future of our species, our province, our country and our planet are at stake."&nbsp;</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The Bauhaus greatest achievement was to make artists interested in the creative use of technology, to design things that are useful and nice to use. And they did that without knowing a lot about tech.</p>

<hr>

<p>Product, experience, interaction, industrial designers, creative technologists. If somehow you are a creative interested in making things that are useful and nice to use, you owe that to the Bauhaus. It’s also because of that school and their influence on art education that we can enjoy things designed by people with an artistic sensibility. Rather than only having things designed by engineers.</p>

<p>At the time, few artists were willing to collaborate with the industry to create mass-manufactured objects. Architect Walter Gropius, founder and director of the school, was especially passionate about social architecture and in general in creating things for the common people. Mass-manufacturing technology could allow that at scale. So some years after the creation of the school, he adjusted the focus in the Bauhaus curriculum. And since 1925, when the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, the school new motto became ‘Art and technology: a new unity’.</p>

<hr>

<p>But despite the ambition of the Bauhaus to teach students how to design for the industry, few of the tutors at the time had experience in industrial production. The school method was still based on a combination of applied arts and academic education, and the students’ practical lessons were given by craftsmen whose experience was in making things by hand and not in designing for production.</p>

<p>For instance, in the metal workshop under Moholy-Nagy, students would handmade prototypes with a style they thought would be easy to reproduce industrially. For instance using spheres, cylinders and other basic shapes. Except that due to their ignorance of industrial processes, those objects were hard to make in a mass-production facility.</p>

<p>But the strongest critique of the Bauhaus lack of technological knowledge was Buckminster Fuller. Fuller was familiar with the work of the Bauhaus due to the Black Mountain College in the US, where he and other former Bauhaus tutors were teaching. According to him, the ‘International Style’ brought to the US by the Bauhaus, simple replaced the previous decorative style with a new simplified one made of basic shapes and colours. A new exterior, but that was leaving unchanged the structural and functional elements of the building.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In short they only looked at problems of modifications of the surface of end-product, which end-products were inherently sub-functions of a technically obsolete world</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Obviously, Bucky did all the things he was criticising Gropius and the Bauhaus about. But that’s a story I’ll save for some other time).</p>

<hr>

<p>The excitement of the Bauhauslers for new technologies is still present among designers now. And so is that limit in understanding fully a new innovation that can be used in a new product or service. I feel that every time I’m working with machine learning. But what the Bauhaus achieved was to get artists interested in bringing their sensibility in the creative use of technology. And whatever Bucky thinks, that remains.</p>

<p>
Welcome to the first edition of our online reading session. This is a
tiny book club. In the first edition, we will be diving into the
beautiful world of <em>number theory</em>.
</p>



<p>
  <small>
  †
  The Matrix room and Freenode channel are bridged together, so if you
  join one of them, you will automatically receive the updates and
  messages from the other one too. If you are not an active Freenode
  user, prefer joining the Matrix room because it is more convenient,
  e.g., you can close your browser or client and your chat session will
  still stay alive. You can connect back the next day and catch up with
  the messages. Doing that with Freenode IRC requires slightly more work
  (setting up IRC bouncers etc.).
  </small>
</p>


<h2 id="reference">Reference Material<a href="#reference"></a></h2>

<p>
The primary reference book for these meetings is going to be:
<em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> written by Tom M.
Apostol. Admittedly, the book is quite expensive but you may find a
relatively cheap paperback (softcover) copy on some websites. A DRM-free
PDF eBook is available for purchase at <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387901633">springer.com/gp/book/9780387901633</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you are unable to buy the reference book, you can still participate
in this book club activity by downloading freely available notes from
  the University of Illinois: <a href="https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~hildebr/ant/main.pdf">main.pdf</a>.
</p>

<p>
For solutions to exercise problems, refer to this excellent PDF created
by Greg Hurst: <a href="https://greghurst.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/apostol_intro_to_ant.pdf">apostol_intro_to_ant.pdf</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ<a href="#faq"></a></h2>

  <li id="faq-who">
    <h3>
      Who are you?
      <a href="#faq-who"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hi! I am <a href="https://susam.in/">Susam</a>. I am just someone
      who enjoys mathematics, Lisp, and Emacs and wants to spread the
      joy of spending time with these beautiful things. I have been
      working as an information security professional for about 15
      years. Of these 15 years, close to 7 years were spent working with
      probability theory, calculus, and combinatorics, and another 3
      years in implementation of cryptographic utilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do a lot of teaching as hobby. This is my way of giving
      something back to the technology community. I have taught Common
      Lisp, Emacs, Python, C, Vim, and various areas of mathematics. In
      each one of my previous workplaces, I have created communities
      around mathematics, algorithms, and/or, cryptography. In the
      online world, I created the <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/##algorithms">##algorithms</a>
      channel on Freenode IRC (my nick there is <code>spal</code>). What
      started as a tiny hobby club around algorithms 13 years ago is now
      a thriving community with over 200 members. (Disclosure: I don't
      participate in it anymore but a highly talented group of
      moderators helps maintain the channel).
    </p>
    <p>
      These hobbies of teaching and forming local and online communities
      have also led me to write some open source projects. Some are
      mildly popular and some not so popular but have managed to find
      its own niche community of users. For example, <a href="https://github.com/susam/texme">TeXMe</a> and <a href="http://mathb.in/">MathB.in</a> were born out of the need to
      share mathematics problems and solutions within these communities.
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/uncap">Uncap</a> was born when I
      used to teach Vim and I wanted Windows users to have a good
      ergonomic experience. Similarly, <a href="https://github.com/susam/emacs4cl">Emacs4CL</a> was born
      while teaching Common Lisp with Emacs and SLIME.
    </p>
    <p>
      To summarize, I work in information security by profession and I
      am an open source software developer by hobby. I want to use some
      part of my leisure time in hosting book club meetings where we
      pick up good books and work through them together.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-why">
    <h3>
      Why are you doing this?
      <a href="#faq-why"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      During the course of my career and hobbies, I have found
      Mathematics, Lisp, and Emacs to be extraordinarily elegant and
      beautiful and it is my goal to introduce as many people to these
      things as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Software development these days focus a lot around stitching
      together many libraries to accomplish complex tasks. I understand
      that this is more economical and productive. This approach has
      certainly made it possible to develop huge and complex
      software-based infrastructure that has changed the way we live.
      However, I think, in this fast-paced software development world,
      the simpler joys of devising or implementing algorithms from
      scratch and appreciating the underlying beauty of mathematics is
      taking a backseat. I intend to introduce more and more people to
      some of these simpler joys, especially, the joy of unravelling the
      mysteries of prime numbers, appreciating the simplicity and
      elegance of Lisp, experiencing the remarkable extensibility of
      Emacs, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the more I help others work though a formidable book like
      <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em>, the more it helps
      me too to appreciate some finer and deeper points that I may not
      have paid due attention to when I read the book for the first
      time. So I benefit from these reading sessions too. Similarly, the
      more I help someone with Common Lisp programming, the more I have
      to dive into the Common Lisp HyperSpec which often teaches me a
      few new things too, so I gain from the experience too.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-book">
    <h3>
      Have you read the entire book?
      <a href="#faq-book"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      No, I have read approximately half of the book (Introduction to
      Analytic Number Theory) and I am enjoying it so far. This means
      that I am a good number of chapters ahead of someone who has just
      begun reading this book, so I can maintain a steady pace in the
      reading sessions and also be able to tell if some topics or areas
      of confusion in an earlier chapter will be clarified in a later
      chapter.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-lisp">
    <h3>
      You mentioned Lisp. Can you do a book club for it?
      <a href="#faq-lisp"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Yes, Lisp and Emacs are two other areas at the top of my mind.
      Once there has been sufficient progress in the number theory book
      club, I plan to start a Lisp one next. Join the <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#susam:matrix.org">Matrix
      room</a> or <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#susam:matrix.org">follow me
      on Twitter</a> to receive further updates about this.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-but">
    <h3>
      But I want to do group reading sessions for another book!
      <a href="#faq-but"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Start your own book club around it! This is mine. I have chosen
      number theory as the topic of discussion for now. After a few
      months, I will move on to topics around Lisp and Emacs. If you
      have a different topic or book in mind, start your own book club
      for it. You can reuse my channels (see top of this page) for it or
      you can do it your own way. If you let me know about it and if I
      can find the time, I will join your book club too! I think, we
      need more book clubs, not less!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-recording">
    <h3>
      Will these sessions be recorded?
      <a href="#faq-recording"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Not at this time because we often refer to a few pages of the book
      via screen sharing during the reading session. I don't know the
      copyright implications of recording such sessions as videos and
      sharing them with everyone online. If you have expertise in this
      area, I would like to know if my concern is genuine and if there
      is a way to resolve it.
    </p>

<p>There is something charming about games using their desktop platform's standard windows and controls for the user interface.  It is even more so if they use the limited standard palette.  This page tries to convey their charm.</p>

<p>The release dates are for the initial release of the game unless indicated otherwise.</p>

        <p><img src="https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_11p1s4/styles/communityIcon_82qz1x1k5uj41.png" alt="SerenityOS Logo"></p>

<p>Recently I have taken an interest in a project called SerenityOS. Stolen straight from the <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity">GitHub</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SerenityOS is a love letter to ’90s user interfaces with a custom Unix-like core. It flatters with sincerity by stealing beautiful ideas from various other systems.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the goal is a marriage between the aesthetic of late-1990s productivity software and the power-user accessibility of late-2000s *nix. This is a system by us, for us, based on the things we like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a surprisingly featured hobby operating system with quite a welcoming community behind it. It caught my radar after a series of videos by LiveOverflow and Andreas (the developer) detailing a few exploits made during the <a href="https://hxp.io/blog/79/hxp-CTF-2020-wisdom2/">2020 hxp CTF</a>, so I decided to explore the system myself. Eventually, I found a memory corruption bug in some networking code that could be leveraged into kernel-mode code execution.</p>

<p>The vulnerability can be hit so easily by some bad code that I’m surprised it wasn’t found by a fuzzer immediately. At its core, it’s a stack overflow in the function <code>TCPSocket::send_tcp_packet</code>. To see how, let’s take a look at the implementation.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp">KResult TCPSocket<span>::</span>send_tcp_packet(u16 flags, <span>const</span> UserOrKernelBuffer<span>*</span> payload, size_t payload_size)
{
    <span>const</span> size_t buffer_size <span>=</span> <span>sizeof</span>(TCPPacket) <span>+</span> payload_size;
    <span>alignas</span>(TCPPacket) u8 buffer[buffer_size];
    <span>new</span> (buffer) TCPPacket;
    <span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> tcp_packet <span>=</span> <span>*</span>(TCPPacket<span>*</span>)(buffer);
    ASSERT(local_port());
    tcp_packet.set_source_port(local_port());
    tcp_packet.set_destination_port(peer_port());
    tcp_packet.set_window_size(<span>1024</span>);
    tcp_packet.set_sequence_number(m_sequence_number);
    tcp_packet.set_data_offset(<span>sizeof</span>(TCPPacket) <span>/</span> <span>sizeof</span>(u32));
    tcp_packet.set_flags(flags);
    <span>//...
</span><span></span>    <span>if</span> (payload <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>payload<span>-&gt;</span>read(tcp_packet.payload(), payload_size))
        <span>return</span> EFAULT;
    <span>//...
</span><span></span>    <span>if</span> (tcp_packet.has_syn() <span>||</span> payload_size <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>) {
        <span>//...
</span><span></span>        send_outgoing_packets();
        <span>return</span> KSuccess;
    }
    <span>//...
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>This function is called when attempting to use the <code>send()</code> syscall on a TCP socket (naturally). None of the parent callers in the chain (<code>Process::sys$sendmsg</code>, <code>IPv4Socket::sendto</code>, and <code>TCPSocket::protocol_send</code>) do any bounds checking on the user-provided <code>payload_size</code> other than ensuring the value is in userspace. Unfortunately, a value being in userspace is quite a lax requirement when then using the value to make a stack allocation. The problem line is:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>alignas</span>(TCPPacket) u8 buffer[buffer_size];
</code></pre></div><p><code>buffer</code> is then a Variable-length Array (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_array">VLA</a>) which is a really cursed feature from C99 that is as bad as it sounds. It attempts to dynamically resize the stack-frame using the value we provided, which can do some very unexpected things when the value is larger than the stack size (Serenity seems to use a stack size of 2^16 in the kernel). We can thus easily obliterate the stack and trigger a crash by calling something to the effect of:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp">send(tcp_socket, user_buffer, <span>0xdeadaa</span>, <span>0</span>); <span>//BOOM!
</span></code></pre></div><p>This is all well and good, but can we actually do something useful with this? First and foremost, we need to make sure there’s no funny business going on with the allocation itself. Examining the code produced by gcc:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="r"><span>...</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>+749</span><span>&gt;:</span> test   eax,eax
<span>&lt;</span><span>+751</span><span>&gt;:</span> jg     <span>0xc018a36f</span> <span>&lt;</span>Kernel<span>::</span>TCPSocket<span>::</span><span>send_tcp_packet</span>(unsigned short, Kernel<span>::</span>UserOrKernelBuffer const<span>*</span>, unsigned long)<span>+771</span><span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;</span><span>+762</span><span>&gt;:</span> push   eax

<span>&lt;</span><span>+774</span><span>&gt;:</span> lea    esi,[ebp<span>-0</span>x58]
<span>&lt;</span><span>+777</span><span>&gt;:</span> add    eax,<span>0xf</span>

<span>&lt;</span><span>+785</span><span>&gt;:</span> lea    eax,[ebp<span>-0</span>x70]
<span>...</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Seems to do exactly as advertised, just a <code>sub esp</code> with our value (and with the shiny UB sanitizer attached). So now that we can be confident the allocation won’t mess with any memory, the next step is using it safely. Nearly right after the allocation, we have our userspace buffer being copied into the kernel buffer:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>if</span> (payload <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>payload<span>-&gt;</span>read(tcp_packet.payload(), payload_size))
    <span>return</span> EFAULT;
</code></pre></div><p>This could be bad news for us <em>if</em> we provide a valid-sized user buffer because then we’d at the very least hit the guard page below the stack and fail. But that’s a big <em>if</em>. Providing a non-valid user buffer is totally fair game, too. How would the kernel know? What I mean by this is that our buffer isn’t as long as we say it is. The result is that as <code>payload-&gt;read</code> attempts to copy over our bytes, it’ll fault when it hits our bad memory. But this time, the fault will be on the <em>user side</em>, meaning the function will gracefully exit on the kernel’s end.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp">u8<span>*</span> stack_smash <span>=</span> (u8<span>*</span>)mmap(<span>nullptr</span>, ST_BUFFER_LEN, PROT_READ <span>|</span> PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED <span>|</span> MAP_ANONYMOUS, <span>-</span><span>1</span>, <span>0</span>);
...
send(socket_fd, stack_smash, send_len, <span>0</span>); <span>//send_len is much, much larger than ST_BUFFER_LEN!
</span></code></pre></div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/patrickwardle">@patrickwardle</a> has a nice visual of this regarding a similar idea on macOS:</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvYgh2MVIAYT_8I?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="macOS partial write"></p>
<p>This is wonderful, as this chain of events means we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>sub esp</code> with a user-controlled value</li>
<li>An arbitrary write with another user-controlled value/length</li>
<li>A graceful exit</li>
</ul>
<p>I reported the <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/issues/5310">issue</a> and it was fixed within 15 minutes. This guy is a beast!</p>
<p>Now we have all the tools necessary to exploit this :)</p>

<p>We have essentially what is an arbitrary write primitive, so first we must choose what we want to write to. We have to keep in mind that we are writing from an offset from the stack, though, which might make things a little unpredictable. Thankfully, there is little to no KASLR on the system (as far as I’ve seen) but general system noise and randomness make specific writes fairly difficult. That makes directly writing to a critical structure out of the question, but what about staying in the realm of the stack? As the bug is a stack overflow we can’t write to anything already on our stack (as it continues to grow downwards), but I did notice the offsets between stacks seems to remain constant:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cs">...
<span>[#0 SystemServer(5:5)]</span>: Created kernel stack: <span>0</span>xc35df000
<span>[#0 SystemServer(5:5)]</span>: Created kernel stack: <span>0</span>xc35f0000
<span>[#0 SystemServer(5:5)]</span>: Created kernel stack: <span>0</span>xc3601000
<span>[#0 SystemServer(5:5)]</span>: Created kernel stack: <span>0</span>xc3612000
...
</code></pre></div><p>The offset is 0x11000, which is just the stack size 0x10000 plus the guard page size 0x1000. And so, if we can’t write to our own stack… we can still write to another process stack fairly reliably. It then just becomes a case of winning a race condition between what the other process is doing and the write that we do. This is not a problem however as we control the ‘victim’ process, so we can just make it do something as trivial as call sleep, giving us an arbitrary race window. There is also one final annoyance of some randomization that is done whenever we call a syscall:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>// Apply a random offset in the range 0-255 to the stack pointer,
</span><span>// to make kernel stacks a bit less deterministic.
</span><span>// Since this is very hot code, request random data in chunks instead of
</span><span>// one byte at a time. This is a noticeable speedup.
</span><span></span><span>if</span> (g_random_byte_buffer_offset <span>==</span> RandomByteBufferSize) {
    get_fast_random_bytes(g_random_byte_buffer, RandomByteBufferSize);
    g_random_byte_buffer_offset <span>=</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>This slight randomization to the stack bases makes writing to an exact address of the victim’s stack unreliable (granted, it could be brute-forced in a millisecond). But once again the stars align as the sleep syscall does not care very much about how the stack is laid out as it returns. During its call, it eventually reaches the function <code>Processor::switch_context</code>, which is the final stage before swapping contexts. In it, it does:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="r"><span>...</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Pretty much saving the state and restoring it afterwards. Crucially, it loads <code>esp</code> with a value on the stack, then returns shortly after. Accuracy doesn’t matter here, we can just spray the stack with a new stack pointer and have it return from there… code execution! At this point, we just need to put a ROP chain in some kernel memory and have the stack be redirected to there. I chose to just spray some heap memory with the ROP, but this part was extremely iffy. The offset between the current stack and the heap is not something I could reasonably predict so I had to pretty much blast the entire heap with the code. I used something like a nop sled but with a bunch of rets instead (a ret sled?) to make the ROP chain execution reliable but it would still crash half the time if the offset was too large and I wrote to some bad memory. There’s probably a better way to store the ROP but for my purposes, it will suffice.</p>
<p>The ROP chain I ended up with was very similar to the one in vakzz’s awesome <a href="https://devcraft.io/2021/02/11/serenityos-writing-a-full-chain-exploit.html">exploit chain</a>, writing root to our processes permission bits.</p>

<p>The results of this experiment are not exactly close to my target as you can see, but I thought it was worth a blog post anyway. There was this rough idea I’ve been thinking about in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a> for a really long time.</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wonder if it's possible to use some kind of stochastic algorithm that gives you an initial state which forms legible text after many cycles.</p>— yakinavault (@yakinavault) <a href="https://twitter.com/yakinavault/status/1291586306489761792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>I came across <a href="https://kevingal.com/blog/mona-lisa-gol.html">an article</a> of the same title by Kevin Galligan recently and I thought I could do something similar using a different approach. What if instead of using SAT Solvers, I use some kind of heuristic algorithm that could somehow “program” a large world of Game of Life to display an image after a few generations?</p>

<p>There are other ways of achieving this. One is by placing still life states at specific pixels as described in this <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/38573/paint-a-still-life-or-a-moving-one-draw-an-image-in-the-game-of-life">codegolf question</a>.</p>

<p>What I’m thinking of is to display Mona Lisa for a single frame/generation of ‘non-still’ Game of Life.</p>



<p>I began working on a proof of concept using the hill climbing algorithm. The idea was very simple. Iteratively modify a random 2D Game of Life state until it’s Nth generation looks similar to Mona Lisa. Here’s the full algorithm.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    best_score := infinity
    target := mona lisa with dimensions m x n
    canvas := random matrix of m x n
    best_result := canvas
    do
        modified_canvas := Copy of canvas with a single random cell inverted
        nth_modified_canvas := Run N generations of Game of Life modified_canvas
        Compute a score of how close nth_modified_canvas is with target
        if score &lt; best_score then
        	best_score := score
            best_result := modified_canvas
        canvas := best_result
    while(max_iterations limit passed or best_score &lt; threshold)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I hacked up a single core prototype.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>def modify(canvas, shape):
    x,y = shape
    px = int(np.random.uniform(x+1))-1
    py = int(np.random.uniform(y+1))-1
    canvas[px][py] = not canvas[px][py]
    return canvas

def rmse(predictions,targets):
    return np.sqrt(np.mean((predictions-targets)**2))

while best_score&gt;limit:
    canvases = np.tile(np.copy(best_seed), (batch_size, 1, 1))
    rms_errors = []
    for canvas in range(len(canvases)):
        canvases[canvas] = modify(states[state], (m,n))
        rmse_val = rmse(target, nth_generation(np.copy(canvases[canvas])))
        rms_errors.append(rmse_val)
    lowest = min(rms_errors)
    if lowest &lt; best_score:
        best_score = lowest
        best_result = canvases[rms_errors.index(lowest)]

<p>Hill Climbing works by finding the closest neighboring state to a current state with the least error from a ‘target_state’ (Mona Lisa). The way I find the closest neighbor in every step is to create a copy of the best solution we have so far and invert a random cell. This change is small enough that we don’t risk stepping over any local minima. Also we use root mean square error metric to compare the best state and the target. Other error metrics can be experimented with, but for this problem, I found that RMSE was sufficient.</p>

<p>After a few days of CPU time(!), I was able to obtain something that resembled Mona Lisa after running 4 generations of life.</p>

<video loop="" autoplay="" muted=""> <source src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/lisa_cpu.webm" type="video/mp4"> </video>

<p>It was reassuring that my algorithm did indeed work, but I realize I made a bunch of mistakes and of course it’s not really scalable for larger images or fast.</p>



<p>Target Mona Lisa against which our random state was compared with was the medium resolution version taken from Wikipedia and converted to monochrome using PIL’s <code>Image.open('target.png').convert('L')</code></p>

<p>When you’re comparing against boolean variables, It’s better that we the target as a binary matrix rather than the whole grayscale range.</p>

<p>In this attempt, I simply rounded these grayscale values to 0s and 1s. This was a mistake as it washed away a lot of details.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-18-39-11.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We could just not round at all and compare against the grayscale version, but there is a better way.</p>



<p>Not every random matrix of 0s and 1s are a valid Game of Life state. States that can never be an nth generation (n&gt;0) of any Cellular Automata are called Garden of Edens. It is almost impossible that our monochrome-rounded Mona Lisa is a valid Game of Life generation. We can only hope to have a solution that’s approximately close to the target.</p>

<p>This is a portion of the 4th generation of the state we just prepared.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-19-08-47.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Judging by the texture, the way life patterns evolve and from just experimenting with images, I found that comparing against a 1-bit dithered version the target should improve the quality of results.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-19-04-26.png" alt=""></p>

<cap>1-bit Dithering on Mona Lisa</cap>

<p>Dithered image has a somewhat even distribution of 0 and 1 cells which is somewhat close to what a randomly initialized Game of Life state will look like after a few generations. This property is also maintained when you scale up the image, (which we’ll optimize for soon).</p>

<p>We could do this using PIL (it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering">Floyd–Steinberg dithering</a>) using <code>Image.open('target.png').convert('1')</code></p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-18-54-34.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Also you can see from the last result, it’s impossible to get a continuous array of white cells because they will be killed off by the overpopulation rule. Completely dark areas are stable in life. The end result will be a higher contrast, but slightly darkened version of Mona Lisa. At higher resolutions, this effect is not as apparent.</p>



<p>The single core unvectorized version is extremely slow. I tried running this in both my 8th gen Core i7 and the Google Colab CPU machines, but you need to wait for hours/days (depending on target resolution) to get something that resembles the original.</p>

<p>Fortunately, This problem is well suited for parallelization.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/jax/master/images/jax_logo_250px.png" alt=""></p>

<p>JAX is a python library that lets you use a version of numpy and compile it to highly vectorized code that can be run on a GPU/TPU. We need to rework this algorithm for a GPU.</p>

<p>GPUs generally suited to high-throughput type computations that has good data-parallelism. We need to exploit the SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) architecture to gain faster execution speeds.</p>

<p>We extrude the <code>target</code>(Mona Lisa) and <code>canvas</code>(initial random state) to 3rd dimension with 3rd dimension being <code>batch_size</code> long tensor loafs (Consider a loaf of bread, with each slice being dithered Mona Lisa).</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/untssitled-another-copy.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/untssitled-copy.png" alt=""></p>
<cap>Initial canvas will be completely random(unlike the figure).</cap>

<p>We set <code>best_canvas</code> to the initial random canvas before our hill climbing loop.</p>

<p>Also, for every loop iteration, we need to produce a random tensor called mutator(same shape as <code>target</code>) with this property: Each slice should have all zeros except a single one place at a random location.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/untssitled-3rd-copy.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Something like</p>

<div><div><pre><code>array([[[1, 0],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]],

       [[1, 0],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]],

       [[0, 0],
        [0, 1],
        [0, 0]],

       [[0, 1],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]],

       [[1, 0],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]]])
</code></pre></div></div>

<cap><br>Example mutator with shape 5, 3, 2. batch_size being 5</cap>

<p>The idea is that in every loop, we use the mutator to calculate the nearest set of neighboring states from our best_canvas like this <code>canvas = (best_canvas + mutator)%2</code>.</p>

<p>We compute N generations of game of life across every slice of this modified canvas. Then, we do a 3D RMSE(mean being calculated for the slice only) on the Nth generation canvas against Mona Lisa, and find the slice with the lowest error.
This is slice is then extruded and set to best_canvas and the loop repeats till a finite number of iterations pass.</p>

<p>The notebook for this project is <a href="https://github.com/avinayak/mona_lisa_gol_jax/blob/main/mona_lisa_overdrive.ipynb">available in github</a>. I’ll explain what every block is doing in this section. If you want to see results, skip to the end of the article.</p>

<p>The core of this project, the game of life function is actually taken from <a href="http://www.bnikolic.co.uk/blog/python/jax/2020/04/19/game-of-life-jax.html">this post</a>. Thank you  Bojan Nikolic :). I followed his convention of importing <code>jax.numpy</code> as <code>N</code>, <code>jax.lax</code> as <code>L</code>.</p>

<p>Next, <code>wget</code> Mona Lisa</p>

<p>This is not a crazy high res version.It’s only 483px wide.</p>

<p>This quickstart guide is inspired by <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/">Ruby in Twenty Minutes</a>. It makes the assumption that you already have <a href="https://docs.toit.io/installation/toitcli/">Toit installed</a> on your machine.</p>
<p>Toit is an object-oriented programming language for the internet of things. The Toit language has the following desirable properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern, simple, and approachable</li>
<li>High-level and object-oriented</li>
<li>Declarative and statically analyzable</li>
<li>Safe and garbage collected</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's get started with some programming!</p>
<h2 id="hello_world">Hello, World<a href="#hello_world" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>A local installation of Toit comes with support for running small programs directly from the command line. If you put the following code in a file called <code>hello.toit</code></p>


<p>you can run it from the command line like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
</code></pre></div>

<p>What just happened? The <code>toit</code> command line tool read your source code (<code>hello.toit</code>) and started running it from the <code>main</code> method that you defined. The <code>main</code> method consists of all the indented statements just below the method declaration line <code>main:</code>. Toit is indentation-based like Python, so the spaces you add to your programs are significant.</p>
<p>Once the program ran, it printed <code>Hello World!</code> in your terminal. This is because the only statement in <code>hello.toit</code> is a method call, where you invoke the <code>log</code> method with a single argument, which is the string to be logged (in this case, printed to the terminal). If you wanted to output more than one line from your program, you could update it to:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  log "Hello World!"
  log "Hello World!"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>When you run the updated program, you will see two lines of output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
Hello World!
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="defining_a_method">Defining a method<a href="#defining_a_method" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>What if you want to say "Hello" a lot without getting your fingers all tired? You should define another method:</p>


<p>and call that from <code>main</code>:</p>


<p>Calling a method in Toit is as simple as mentioning its name. If the method doesn’t take arguments that’s all you need.</p>
<p>What if we want to say hello to one person, and not the whole world? Just redefine hi to take a name as an argument.</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>hi name:
  log "Hello $name!"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This way, <code>hi</code> is a method that takes a single argument. We can use that from <code>main</code>:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  hi "Lars"
  hi "Kasper"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>and it works!</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello Lars!
Hello Kasper!
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="inserting_strings_in_strings">Inserting strings in strings<a href="#inserting_strings_in_strings" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>What’s the <code>$name</code> bit? That’s Toit's way of inserting something into a string. It is called <em>string interpolation</em>. The bit after the <code>$</code> is turned into a string (if it isn’t one already) and then substituted into the outer string at that point. You can also use this to make sure that someone’s name is properly trimmed so leading and trailing whitespace is ignored:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>hi name = "World":
  log "Hello, $name.trim!"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This way, we call the <code>trim</code> method on the <code>name</code> string before we insert it into the outer string. If we call <code>hi "   Lars  "</code> we still get the familiar greeting <code>Hello Lars!</code> and not <code>Hello   Lars  !</code>. You can add parentheses around the <code>name.trim</code> expression in the string to make it clearer which parts belong to the outer string:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>  log "Hello, $(name.trim)!"
</code></pre></div>

<p>Maybe you already spotted that we went ahead and added one other trick to the code above? We added a default value for the <code>name</code> parameter, so if the name isn’t supplied when you call <code>hi</code>, we use the default name "World". Now we can try:</p>


<p>and get the following output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
Hello Kasper!
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="evolving_into_a_greeter">Evolving into a greeter<a href="#evolving_into_a_greeter" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>What if we want a real greeter around, one that remembers your name and welcomes you and treats you with respect. You might want to use an object for that. Let’s create a <code>Greeter</code> class:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name := null

  constructor .name = "World":

  say_hi: log "Hi $name.trim!"

  say_bye: log "Bye $name.trim, come back soon."
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>The new keyword here is <code>class</code>. This defines a new class called <code>Greeter</code> and a bunch of methods for that class. Pay special attention to the method <code>constructor</code>. There is nothing after the <code>:</code> and the <code>constructor</code> method isn’t followed by any indented lines, so the constructor has no statements in it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>  constructor .name = "World":
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is a constructor and it defines how you can construct objects from the class. It says the class <code>Greeter</code> takes a single argument (<code>name</code>), but the <code>.</code> prefix to the <code>.name</code> parameter actually tells us that the name is immediately stored as a field on <code>Greeter</code> objects. The field is defined just above the constructor with the <code>:=</code> syntax.</p>
<p>The field parameter <code>.name</code> still has a default value, so if we don’t pass a name, the <code>Greeter</code> will greet the world.</p>
<p>The <code>say_hi</code> and <code>say_bye</code> methods are introduced on the next two lines. The methods both have a single statement in them, so we can keep them on one line each. The <code>say_hi</code> and <code>say_bye</code> method both use the <code>name</code> field from the object they are called on. You can refer to fields in the class of a method simply by mentioning them (<code>name</code>).</p>
<h2 id="creating_a_greeter_object">Creating a greeter object<a href="#creating_a_greeter_object" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Now let’s create a greeter object and use it:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := Greeter " Helena "
  greeter.say_hi
  greeter.say_bye
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>We create an object simply by mentioning the constructor, <code>Greeter</code>. The greeter object remembers the name and uses it for the two separate greetings. If we run this, we get the following output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hi Helena!
Bye Helena, come back soon.
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you want to get the name from a greeter, you can ask a greeter by calling the <code>name</code> method on it:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := Greeter " Helena "
  log "How are you $(greeter.name)?"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This would show <code>How are you  Helena ?</code>. Almost neat, right? Unfortunately, the name isn’t trimmed like we expected. Let’s fix that!</p>
<h2 id="fields_and_methods">Fields and methods<a href="#fields_and_methods" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>As you have just seen, a field on an object introduces a method with the same name. If you wanted to hide a field from the outside world, you could make it private. By convention, methods and fields that end with an underscore (<code>_</code>) are private and not supposed to be touched from the outside:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name_:= null
  constructor .name_ = "World":
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This removes the <code>name</code> method from greeters, but if we really want to allow accessing the name from the outside, we could reintroduce a getter with the same meaning as before.</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name_ := null

  constructor .name_ = "World":

  name: return name_
  say_hi: log "Hi $name_.trim!"
  say_bye: log "Bye $name_.trim, come back soon."
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>Here we use the new keyword <code>return</code> to specify the value a method returns. We could make it slightly more interesting and trim it in the process:</p>


<p>In this way, access to the name from the outside also gets the trimming and we can avoid repeating the call to <code>trim</code>:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name_ := null

  constructor .name_ = "World":

  name: return name_.trim
  say_hi: log "Hi $name!"
  say_bye: log "Bye $name, come back soon."
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>We can check that it works by running:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := Greeter " Erik "
  log "How are you $(greeter.name)?"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>and you should see <code>How are you Erik?</code>. Inside <code>main</code>, we store the greeter in a local variable (<code>greeter</code>) so we can keep referring to the same object. You can think of it as a way to give a specific object a name that is only valid and useful inside the <code>main</code> method.</p>
<p>Just like introducing a member variable, we can use the <code>:=</code> syntax in methods and functions like <code>main</code> to introduce local variables.</p>
<h2 id="greetings_everyone">Greetings everyone!<a href="#greetings_everyone" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>This greeter isn’t all that interesting though, it can only deal with one person at a time. What if we had some kind of MegaGreeter that could either greet the world, one person, or a whole list of people? Let’s try to build that. We will start with a class definition:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class MegaGreeter:
  names := []

  constructor name = "World":
    names.add name
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>So MegaGreeter objects have a list of <code>names</code>. The <code>names</code> field is initialized to the empty list (<code>[]</code>). The body of the <code>MegaGreeter</code> constructor adds the given <code>name</code> argument to the end of the list of names. Notice that this is different than using a <code>.name</code> parameter that automatically assigns to the field called <code>name</code>. Mega greeters don't have a single name and no <code>name</code> field, so here the <code>name</code> is just an ordinary parameter that we can use in the body of the constructor. All in all, this code:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := MegaGreeter
  log "The names are $greeter.names"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>will lead to this output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
The names are ["World"]
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can now go ahead and add greeter methods that show all the names:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>// Greeter that says hi to everybody.
class MegaGreeter:
  names := []

  constructor name = "World":
    names.add name

  say_hi:
    // Greet everyone individually!
    names.do: log "Hello $it!"
  say_bye:
    everyone := names.join ", "
    log "Bye $everyone, come back soon."

main:
  greeter := MegaGreeter
  greeter.say_hi
  greeter.say_bye

  greeter.names.add "Lars"
  greeter.names.add "Kasper"
  greeter.names.add "Rikke"
  greeter.say_hi
  greeter.say_bye
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>If you run this, you’ll get this output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
Bye World, come back soon.
Hello World!
Hello Lars!
Hello Kasper!
Hello Rikke!
Bye World, Lars, Kasper, Rikke, come back soon.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s dive into the new constructs in the next sections.</p>

<p>Not everything in your source files is meant to be run by the Toit compiler. Sometimes, it is nice just to add comments that explain interesting things related to your code. In the example in the last section, there were a few single line comments:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>// Greeter that says hi to everybody.
class MegaGreeter:
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>Such comments start with <code>//</code> and tell the system to ignore the rest of the line.</p>
<p>You have already seen the use of indentation to give hierarchical structure to your code. The general structure is that after a <code>:</code> you can have a single construct if it fits on one line:</p>


<p>or you can add a newline after the <code>:</code> and let the following lines that are indented relative to the outer construct …</p></article></div></div></main></div></div>

          <p><b>Wave Computing has emerged from bankruptcy proceedings with the surprise news that it’s taking the name of its MIPS subsidiary and moving to the free and open-source RISC-V ISA for future processor IP.<br>
</b></p>
<p>Wave Computing <a href="https://abopen.com/news/wave-computing-announces-mips-open-initiative/">dipped its toes in the free and open-source silicon movement back in 2018</a>, announcing that its subsidiary MIPS Tech, acquired from Imagination Technologies in June that year, would provide 32- and 64-bit versions of the MIPS instruction set architecture (ISA) and full licences to its MIPS-related patent portfolio free of licensing fees and royalty payments. “We invite the worldwide community to join us in this exciting journey,” MIPS IP president Art Swift said at the time, “and look forward to seeing the many MIPS-based innovations that result.”</p>
<p>In March 2019 <a href="https://abopen.com/news/wave-computing-announces-first-mips-open-release/">the first MIPS Open IP hit the market</a>, but seven months later <a href="https://abopen.com/news/wave-computing-shutters-mips-open-programme-with-immediate-effect/">the MIPS Open initiative shuttered with immediate effect</a>. The decision seemed inexplicable – until Wave Computing filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April last year, unveiling financial troubles.</p>
<p>Now, that process is complete – and Wave Computing is back, but under a new name: Wave Computing is now MIPS, and is to push forward with a focus on its processor IP. That focus, interestingly, includes a move away from its in-house MIPS ISA for future designs: instead, the company’s eighth-generation cores will be based on the free and open-source RISC-V architecture with which Wave Computing’s MIPS Open had hoped to compete.</p>
<p>The reborn MIPS has not yet indicated whether it plans to release its eighth-generation IP under open terms or to keep it proprietary.</p>
