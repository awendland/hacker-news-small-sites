<p>I decided that I was spending too much time writing instructions in random Google docs, vi’ed files, and GitHub repos. I wanted to have a single location that I could use as a way to publicly document all the things that I tinker with:</p>



<ul><li>Kubernetes</li><li>Docker (who doesn’t?)</li><li>Splunk</li><li>Raspberry Pi</li><li>Random tech integrations (this list could go on forever)</li></ul>



<p>With all of that, I felt that it was time to put it all into a blog. As I travel through life building these random things, I intend to document them here and link to any files, repos, or websites that I have created myself or used along the way.</p>



<p>Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>How often do you check your phone? Every 30 minutes? Every 5 minutes? Every 30 seconds?</p><p>Smartphones can be incredibly addictive. Tap, tap, tap and you’re playing a game, tap tap and you’re replying to a friend.&nbsp;<em>Ping!</em>&nbsp;and woooooh, someone liked your photo!</p><p>And so it goes, minutes pass. Then hours. And then you look up, and you still haven’t studied for the exam or worked on that proposal. Time has passed and you have nothing to show for it.</p><p>We know this problem well. We’ve faced it and overcome it. Here are some practical suggestions that helped us cut down from an average of hours on the phone to about 30 minutes.</p><p>Let’s start with the most obvious.</p><h2>Step #1: Turn notifications off</h2><p>Notifications are fun. Did someone message me? How many people liked my post? Who mentioned me?...</p><p>Social media and other apps that rely on notifications want to draw us in. They feed on our insecurity and want us to return to their product and tap away. That’s the purpose of notifications.</p><p><strong>Turn them off.</strong></p><p>We used to have them on too. Those likes sure felt nice. Seeing them come in, one by one. But you know what didn’t feel nice? Lack of focus. Inability to work. Feeling bad at the end of the day, knowing you didn’t do your best.</p><p><strong>We recommend that you turn off all notifications with the possible exception of direct messages from friends (if you don’t get too many of those).</strong></p><h2>Step #2: Delete unnecessary apps</h2><p>You probably don’t need Twitter, Facebook, Reddit or YouTube on your phone. Seriously.</p><p>They make it too easy to waste your own time.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/remove_apps.png" alt="Remove unnecessary apps" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p>I (co-founder Vita) used to have all of those apps on my phone. Every time I was bored, I reached for my phone and tap, Twitter, scroll and scroll and scroll…</p><p>It’s too easy. Too easy to waste hours every day, tens of hours every week, hundreds of hours every month. For what? Internet points?</p><p>Those hours could be better spent writing your thesis, working on your presentation, or building your business. Since I deleted the most distracting apps from my phone, I’ve used my time better and have been much happier with myself.</p><p>You can always check Twitter or Facebook on your computer, where you can better control the environment - use a site-blocker like ours to limit how much time you can waste.</p><p>With the possible exception of Instagram and Snapchat, you can get everything you need from the website version of the product, if you need to.</p><p>Remove games from your phone too. They eat up time faster than a sped-up Pacman and only leave you with guilt at the end of the day. They’re too much fun. You might install them thinking “I’ll play for 5-15 minutes at the end of the day,” but before you know it, you’re playing an addictive game at 10AM instead of doing what you need to do.</p><p><strong>Remove the most time-sucking apps from your phone.</strong></p><h2>Step #3: Make your phone less visually appealing</h2><p>We’re visual creatures. If you reach for your phone, unlock it, and see a familiar icon with a red dot in the corner, you’re going to tap it. It’s one of the easiest and worst habits to get into.</p><p>So, here are 3 tips to make your phone screen less enticing.</p><ul><li><p><strong>No non-productive apps on your first screen.</strong><br>Put every app that has the potential to distract you on your second screen. No social media, no video apps, no messaging apps. If you have them on the first screen you see, you will tap them and destroy your productivity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Group distracting apps in folders.</strong><br>You can also make distracting apps less appealing by putting them into folders. E.g. Messenger, Slack, and email into&nbsp;<em>Communication.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Grayscale your phone.</strong><br>Ever notice that games are super colorful and bright? It’s that way for a simple reason - we biologically wired to like bright and rich colors. It’s fun to look at and fun to interact with colorful and animated screens.</p><p>So, make it less fun by turning everything gray.&nbsp;For iPhones go to&nbsp;<em>Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display Accommodations &gt; Color Filters</em>&nbsp;and then tap on Grayscale.</p><p>For Android phones, google “How to enable grayscale mode on android” - the process is more complicated.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Make your phone less visually appealing and you’ll be less tempted to use it too often.</strong></p><p>That’s it for once-and-done steps, now time for habits.</p><h2>Habit #1: Use the Rule of 3 senses - keep your phone out of sight, out of reach, and out of hearing</h2><h3>Sight: Keep your phone out of sight</h3><p>Imagine your desk looks like this:</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/table_phone.png" alt="Phone on the table is a distraction" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p>Normal, no?</p><p>There’s a catch. Our brain sees this:</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/table_phone_brain_bg.png" alt="Our brain is wired to notice a phone on your desk" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p>If you have your phone in your field of vision, it’s a constant reminder that you could be doing something fun (dopamine!) instead of doing something that feels like work (but is productive).</p><p><strong>When you want to work, hide your phone from sight.</strong></p><h3>Touch: Have your phone out of reach</h3><p>Even if you don’t see your phone, if you have it within easy reach, it’s easy to succumb. All you need to do is extend your hand and an hour is gone and you still haven’t done anything productive.</p><p>Put your phone out of your reach. Ideally, have it in a different room entirely.</p><p>If you’re not home or at work, you can put it in your backpack or purse and put it out of easy reach.</p><p>You can assign your phone a dedicated spot. A spot in your bookshelf, a cupboard, or a drawer. Anywhere far away from where you want to work is good.</p><p><strong>Have your phone out of reach.</strong></p><h3>Hearing: Put your phone on silent (Do Not Disturb on)</h3><p>A funny video, a question about your weekend, a photo from a trip… they aren’t that urgent. You’re much better off not seeing those notifications and definitely not hearing a loud&nbsp;<em>ping!</em>&nbsp;when you’re just starting to get focused.</p><p>You can check all the notifications and replies once you got a solid piece of your work done or wrote a page of a paper you have due.</p><p>You don’t need to see every like or post as they happen. That might make engineers at Twitter or Facebook happy, but definitely not you in the long-term.</p><p>You can check everything when you take a 5 min break&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;doing something productive.</p><p><strong>When you want to focus and be productive, put your phone out of sight, out of reach, and out of hearing (on silent).</strong></p><h2>Habit #2: No phone first thing in the morning</h2><p>If you use your phone as your alarm clock, you might want to consider buying an analog one.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Here’s frequent scenario for many:</p><p><em>Dingdingdingding!!!!</em><br><em>rolls over, grabs phone and presses Stop</em><br><em>Oh, look at these messages. And an email from a co-worker. And someone mentioned me in their Insta story….</em><br><em>an hour passes</em></p><p>This is hardly a good, positive, or active way to start the day.</p><p>Almost any kind of morning routine is better than getting snared in a time-sucking black hole of checking&nbsp;<em>everything</em>.</p><p><strong>Solution: buy an analog alarm clock.</strong></p><p>They don’t have notifications. You can then leave your phone in a different room.</p><p><strong>Alternative solution: put your phone in airplane mode when sleeping.</strong></p><p>This way, you wake up without a full screen of things to respond to.</p><h2>Habit #3: Embrace boredom (instead of checking the phone)</h2><p><em>Waiting in a line? Check phone.</em></p><p><em>Friend went to the bathroom? Check phone.</em></p><p><em>Want to focus? Check phone.</em></p><p>Wait, scratch the last one!</p><p>Every time you check your phone, you reinforce the habit. Since it’s often within reach, in your pocket or on the table, it’s easy to do again and again, looking for a bit of something&nbsp;<em>new.</em></p><p>This habit can quickly get out of control. You start opening the same apps, over and over again, even though there’s nothing new there. It becomes a behavior tic to escape any kind of boredom.</p><p>But boredom isn’t bad. In fact, it can be helpful. When you’re bored, your mind starts to wonder. Vast networks of neurons activate in your brain and that often leads to interesting insights and ideas. Those ideas can lead you to naturally make progress with whatever you were procrastinating on.</p><p>Many people become de facto zombies, only looking for&nbsp;<em>NEW!!!</em>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;<em>brainzzz</em>.</p><p><strong>Embrace boredom. Let your mind wander.</strong></p><h2>Pick a step or a habit to apply to your life</h2><p><strong>3 steps to being less distracted by your phone:</strong></p><ul><li>Turn off notifications</li><li>Delete unnecessary apps (and games)</li><li>Make your phone less appealing</li><ul><li>Remove distracting apps from your first screen</li><li>Put distracting apps into folders</li><li>Grayscale your phone</li></ul></ul><p><strong>3 habits to become more focused:</strong></p><ul><li>Use the&nbsp;<strong>Rule of 3 Senses</strong>:&nbsp;keep your phone out of sight, out of reach, and out of hearing</li><li>Use an analog alarm clock or put your phone into airplane mode.</li><li>Embrace boredom.</li></ul><p>If you do these things, you will start spending less and less time on your phone and become more and more productive.&nbsp;<em>If</em>&nbsp;you do them.</p><p><strong>Take action today. Pick 1 app to remove from your phone, turn off notifications for Instagram or Twitter, or buy an analog alarm clock. Reclaim your attention.</strong></p></article></div>]]>

<p>Photo taken on July 17, 2020 shows an office of online marketplace Pinduoduo in east China's Shanghai. Photo: Xinhua</p><p>A 22-year-old employee who worked at Chinese e-commerce platform Pinduoduo died suddenly after finishing work late at night and fainting on the way home. The news has caused a strong response on the internet. The exact cause of her sudden death requires authoritative medical conclusions, but public resistance and condemnation of excessive overtime has become the mainstream attitude on the internet.</p><p>Hopefully, all companies and institutions will attach great importance to this attitude of the public, take necessary measures to protect the employees' legitimate rights and interests and do not regard employees' excessive overtime as the basis of the companies' achievement. The Labour Law should also be more strictly enforced.</p><p>The excessive overtime of internet company employees is well known. Two years ago, there was a condemnation of the "996" culture - working from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm six days a week - but the problem has not really been alleviated because of the fierce competition among internet companies. People's competition in jobs is also fierce. The two kinds of competition have seriously squeezed the room for workers to defend their rights of not working overtime. Many public discussions have shifted to the so-called principle of fairness that employees who work overtime must be properly paid.</p><p>Objectively speaking, frequent overtime is not just a matter for internet companies. There are many other such industries in China. It is also very common for policemen to work overtime, as well as some other civil servants. They usually have no overtime pay, or only a very small amount of overtime pay. Some local and department leaders take this for granted and some managers even proudly tell others how their departments work seven days a week or work from day to night.&nbsp;</p><p>In Chinese society, there is a traditional value that regards working overtime as an honor. Many descriptions of good people will include the content of how he or she works overtime for a long time, or works late at night. From government departments to enterprises, leaders and managers often appreciate employees who take the initiative to work overtime. Such value is deeply rooted in Chinese society.</p><p>When China was backward and shaking off poverty was the No.1 task, the abovementioned values were naturally formed. But when a huge middle class has been formed in urban China, the choice is subtly changing. People are putting more emphasis on their right to time off. There is heavy criticism online against the "996" working model, which is a clear sign of such a change.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, people have diversified pursuits. There are still people willing to improve their lives by working exhaustively. But such a working style as a collective value has been shaken. More and more young people wish to strike a balance between working hard and playing hard. They want to keep moving ahead, but also take it easy.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a broad trend. The more China grows further, achieving higher GDP per capita, such a value choice will attract more people. In addition, international society is scrutinizing China on labor protection, which is a term often mentioned when China conducts deep economic cooperation with foreign countries. Chinese society needs to adjust the concept of working overtime.</p><p>China's economic and social development cannot rely too much on people's long-time work as a driving force. We should improve labor efficiency and reduce formalism and useless work. People hope for more rest hours, and from this we need to find positive elements that promote development. We should try our best to unify development and the protection of people's rights.</p><p>Chinese people who often travel abroad will find that in a developed society, it is very difficult to hire drivers and translators who are willing to work overtime, not even if they're paid more. This cannot be simply regarded as "lazy."</p><p>Our economic and social development needs to be explored toward the gradually reduced cost of all citizens. Of course, this cannot be achieved overnight. After all, China is still not a rich country, and the low-income group is still large. Overtime work in some positions is inevitable. The spirit of enduring hardship cannot be absent in our society. In particular, we must not give up the encouragement of dedication. In some key sectors, it is very important to let such spirit continue to flourish. We need to constantly adjust to the progress of society and achieve a new balance.</p><p>Chinese society needs to rethink the internet sentiment opposing the "996" work model and the strong reaction to the Pinduoduo employee's sudden death. We should let such thinking rationally penetrate into the rhythm of social progress.</p><p><em>The author is a commentator with the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn</em></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-w-id="45d72c63-4641-3f9f-f271-8df897413c12"><p>Today the consumer market is moving towards Omni-channel experience, and the developer and UX designers need to focus more on web and mobile-friendly user experience than ever before. The developer and designer work more closely to provide a better user experience for the website or app they develop. Technical errors on the software are the critical reason for the app deletion.&nbsp;</p><p>Over 90% of the downloaded apps are erased after one use due to poor user experience. Similarly, according to expert's studies, 80% of users never return to a low user experience website. This is why UX design is a crucial factor in software or application development. The user expects extraordinary experience on apps, websites they use every day. They never provide 2nd change on the software. In this article, let's look in detail at why developers want to learn UI/UX design.</p><p>‍</p><p>The 15 reasons I've highlighted here for you:</p><p>‍</p><ol role="list"><li>Interface vs. Experience</li><li>How User Experience Shapes Software Development</li><li>Excellent Ux Design Encourages to Develop of a More User-Centric Product</li><li>Make the Product More Popular With Ux Design.&nbsp;</li><li>Reduce Flaws and Development Cost</li><li>Ux Plays a Vital Role in Software Architecture</li><li>Limited Resource</li><li>Designing in the Browser</li><li>Front End Development &amp; Ux Design</li><li>&nbsp;Ux Can Make You a Better Developer</li><li>Gets Higher Return on Investment (ROI)</li><li>&nbsp;Learn Skills That Complement Your Existing Talents</li><li>Gain Skills That Can’t Be Automated</li><li>Execute Your Code Towards the User Experience</li><li>User Empathy Will Help You Stand Out in the Business Market</li></ol><h2>1. Interface vs. Experience</h2><p>Before we get down to detail, let's understand the difference between the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>User Interface is anything that the user interacts with the website or app. In another term, UI is the point where the user interacts with the digital product or service. They come in three categories Graphical user interfaces( GUIs), Voice-controlled interface (VUIs), and Gesture-based interfaces.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Graphical user interfaces:</strong> Users interact with electronic devices through graphic icons. The best example is the computer's desktop.</p><p><strong>Voice-controlled interface: </strong>Users interact with the application through their voices. E.g., Siri, Alexa, etc.</p><p><strong>Gesture-based interface: </strong>Users engage with 3D design spaces through real movements, e.g., Virtual reality (VR) games.</p><p>In contrast, User Experience is the complete look and feel of the website or application. UX is the final impression of the user about the product or service.</p><h2>2. How User Experience Shapes Software Development</h2><p>UX and UI design are essential for any application development. Five significant reasons show you need to focus more on the design during product development. Research says that the product's experience influences 97% of customer decisions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Usability</strong></p><p>When software or application works great but is not user-friendly, people will not prefer to use it. The software has to attract and retain the user. User interface and experience are upfront on the development.</p><p><strong>2. Lower development costs</strong></p><p>Identifying the roadblocks and issues in the client experience before development with save you time on modifying code.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3</strong>. <strong>Faster development time</strong></p><p>Great UX and UI configuration save time in the development cycle.</p><p><strong>4. Increase revenue</strong></p><p>People prefer to download or ready to pay for the application that suits their needs and easy to use. If you develop a product with useful UI and UX will increase the app's purchase or downloading.</p><p><strong>5. Better Client retention</strong></p><p>User-friendly apps will keep people returning. The application will become an integral part of their everyday life. If developing a poor UX will leave a lasting impression. The developer has to identify the design problems before deployment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Excellent Ux Design Encourages to Develop of a More User-Centric Product</h2><p>UX design offers insights about what your users want from the product that you are developing. It is the core point for product design. User research and usability testing at each step of the development prove how the user-friendly product evolved.</p><div><p>Before product development, conduct user research and speak with the end-users and understand their needs. The study will help to develop the best user experience application or software.</p><p>In the end the builders (in this case developers) need to have an understanding of the outcome of what they’re building.</p></div><h2>4. Make the Product More Popular With Ux Design.&nbsp;</h2><p>According to statistics, nearly 67% of consumers are more likely to purchase the product if they are happy with their user experience.</p><p>Creating a straightforward user journey or planning the best end-user experience makes client retention and retains the existing customers. This boost in product purchase.</p><p><a href="https://bugreporting.co/">BugReporting</a> is a user feedback tool for websites and apps. It allows users to record full-length video feedback. The application also captures the data to replicate any errors that users face. A BugReporting software is an automatic tool that helps developers and designers view the exact bugs that are user-facing on the UI/UX.</p><h2>5. Reduce Flaws and Development Cost</h2><p>When you combine user's demands in your application's development process, it will considerably decrease UX problems in the later stage of the product journey.</p><p>A basic understanding of UX design will help understand which will not work for the user before product development. Mockups and prototypes will reduce user-related bugs' chances, and it will minimize the development cycle time. The developers can make a clear decision on software development with prototyping.</p><h2>6. Ux Plays a Vital Role in Software Architecture</h2><p>High performance and software stability can only be achieved by the developers. These two are the unsung heroes of user experience design.</p><p>For example, Website visitors will leave the page if they face low page loading. Unnecessary redirects, server delays, heavy images, heavy CSS, HTML, JavaScript files, fancy animated effects or page widgets, etc., may cause inadequate loading speed. The developer needs to fix these defects to improve the user experience. Suppose there is a lag in site loading due to server delay. In that case, the coder needs to find suitable hosting for their website. In this way, the developer will enhance the user experience, product accessibility, and usability.</p><h2>7. Limited Resource</h2><p>In many startups or small businesses, there won't be any dedicated resource for design. Developers out there want to tackle projects entirely on their own, who can't afford to hire a designer (or require to spend the money elsewhere). They will be able to learn to design for their products until they identify the valuable resource.</p><p>Another main reason developers need to learn design is to work more effectively with designers. If the developer understands the basic design, it will help create stunning UI and create a better user experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Learning about design improves the relationship between designer and developer. The developer can easily understand the user interface correction that is provided by the designer. Learning makes the developer view the design on the designer's view for the application development.&nbsp;</p><h2>8. Designing in the Browser</h2><p>Many designers hesitate to perform designing on the browser because they need to know the necessary CSS and HTML programming or codes to create on the browser. That is the specific reason behind why it's an excellent fit for engineers getting into designing.</p><p>There are many tools and browser plugins available today, which assist you in designing the browser. Which makes the developer and designer's life easy. Here are some useful tools for coder and UI/UX designers includes Sketch, Axure, InVision Studio, Craft, Proto.io, Adobe XD, Webflow, Figma, and more&nbsp;</p><h2>9. Front End Development &amp; Ux Design</h2><p>Not all designers need to know to write coding in contrast to the front-end developer, which doesn't mean it is necessary to know UX. But both the UX design and Front end development work more excellently together. If a front-end developer has both, the knowledge will help in creating significant and usable applications. Learning will bridge the gap between the designer and developer and can complete the quality-assured application.</p><h2>10.&nbsp;Ux Can Make You a Better Developer</h2><p>The demand for programming engineers is developing by 22% consistently until 2029. Among all the developers with a special in user experiences are ahead of the job compilation. Users are the priority of any app or web app development, so many recruits look for candidates who have sound knowledge of software development, and UX design is considered more. As a developer, expand your career horizons by continuous learning. A basic understanding of UX design will increase the chance of landing your dream job.</p><h2>11.

</a>

by <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/index.html">Luke Smith</a>

<p>
<i>A parable on the Logical Postivist "interpretation" of scientific models.
<!-- Granted, I use the term "logical positivist" in a somewhat expanded but specific sense, -->
<!-- loosely the idea that "science is good models" or what was called in the past "instrumentalism." -->
</i>
</p>

<h2>The Parable</h2>

<p>
Suppose an alien race comes to Earth and wants to observe our games.
They are very interested in chess, despite the fact that they have eyes with properties that make it impossible to make out what actually happens on a chess board.
(The whites and blacks and squares all blur together.)
</p>

<p>
They can still learn about chess experimentally, they know they can sit two players (a so-called "white" and "black" player) down to play it, and they can tell behaviorally who at the end wins.
</p>

<p>
After extensive experimentation, they realize this: 50% of the time, the white player wins and 50% of the time, the black player wins (we'll ignore draws and any first-move advantage for the example).
</p>

<h3>The "best" model</h3>

<p>
A logical positivist alien thus creates the ultimate, long-term model of chess as an iterated game:
Chess amounts to just a drawn-out coin flip.
Half of the time white wins, half of the time black wins, just as if they were tossing a quarter.
</p>

<p>
The aliens then decide to model chess as a coin flip, as a 50-50 game with no underlying principles.
While this statistical technique might not be useful for predicting a single game, over the long run and over iterated games, <em>it is the most efficient and parsimonious possible model</em>.
</p>

<h3>"Inferior" models</h3>

<p>
Suppose, however that a "crank" scientist of the alien race posits that "God doesn't play dice" and that chess is a more complicated game, despite the fact that the aliens cannot observe it.
Suppose even he asks around and determines from humans that there are actually pieces on the board with functions, and he even devises a machine that allows his alien eyes to see the first move of the game of chess.
</p>

<p>
Seeing this move allows him to create a new theory and model of the game,
one that takes into account the first move made and he tries to generate a new set of probabilities of victory based on that move.
The model he makes, is of course highly arbitrary, stipulated and <em>ad hoc</em>.
In fact,
this model is inferior on many inevitable accounts.
For example:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>It is less predictive over iterated games than the coin flip model.</li>
    <li>It is not as parsimonious/minimal as the coin flip model.</li>
    <li>It adds new variables to the theory (pieces) that are suspect.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Which model is "right?"</h2>

<h3>Which model is closer to truth?</h3>

<p>
Since we, unlike the aliens, are not prevented by defect from observing chess, we know that the second, "inferior" theory of chess is truer.
Its theoretical categories, if apparently arbitrary in the eyes of the aliens, are getting at the actual underlying mechanics of chess.
Even if the model is less effective, it is certainly <em>righter</em>.
</p>

<h3>Which will cause fruitful scientific inquiry?</h3>

<p>
The coin flip model is a scientific dead-end.
Firstly, the coin flip model is constructed statistically, which presents the underlying mechanism to be randomness, and thus unworth of inquiry.
This isn't statistics hoisted above random variation we know to exist, instead, it's utterly blind statistics that covers over whatever principles underlie it.
</p>

<p>
Secondly and more importantly, in order to actually improve that model, it has to <em>lose</em> empirical solvency:
embracing the abstractions of pieces means introducing mess and
deviating in some way from the empircal generalization that half of all chess games are won by white and half by black.
</p>

<h3>This is not an abnormal circumstance.</h3>

<p>
The parable here, really an <em>example</em> is not abnormal.
In most affairs in science, whether that be physics or neuroscience or economics or chemistry, we are exactly like the partially-blind aliens.
</p>

<h3>"But science isn't about truth!"</h3>

<p>
Yeah, it is dude.
</p>

<p>
Even if you are pretending that science is about "models" or fitting equations and the like, again, the well-fit model is impossible to perfect, while the flawed, yet more true to reality model does have a potential over the long-term to be a superior one.
After exhaustive inquiry, an alien race might not only discover the pieces and the full set of rules behind chess, they might be able to predict what moves are good or bad and predict individual chess games.
Even on the standards of mere instrumentalism, the mindless positivistic theory is still actually inferior.
</p>

<h2>Local maxima</h2>

<img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/pix/maximum.gif" alt="Local maximum">

<h3>The plot</h3>

<p>
One of the ways I visualize science and models is that each model is really like an n-dimensional optimization plot.
"Truth," or if you deny truth as metaphysics, "accuracy in data" or "well-fit equations" are upwards and the goal of science is to get further that way.
</p>

<p>
At the point you're at, you can tell which direction you can go to move upward, or, which little changes you can make to improve your model.
That is what incremental science is, after all: don't change assumptions and just fine-tune your equations.
The endless fine-tuning is sometimes thought of as "progress."
Of course I don't think that this is <em>bad</em>, but it is a very minor and scientifically less important part of science as a whole.
</p>

<p>
The reality of incremental science is that once you're at a local maximum, once you've fine-tuned your equations about as perfectly as possible,
it's over.
Everything next to you <em>looks</em> like a disimprovement.
It <em>looks</em> just like those inferior theories of alien chess that posit the existence of pieces.
From that, you might erroneously conclude that you have found the <em>global</em> maximum, which
due to the nature of the complexity of the universe and the multiplicity of
possible answers and theories, you flatly haven't.
</p>

<p>
Logical positivism is kind of theoretical lobotomy that implicitly tells scientists that they should never, ever, ever change foundational assumptions:
tweaking equations like an oblivious autist is Science®️ and everything else is "philosophy" or "metaphysics" or "pseudoscience."
This amounts to keeping each scientific field on whatever local maximum is closest, utterly unable to extricate themselves from it even when they see on the horizon abberant data.
<strong>If you want to understand the stagnation of science or any other specific field, this is where it comes from.</strong>
</p>

<h3>Purposefully "bad" science</h3>

<p>
In <i><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/notrelated/S02E01_-_Against_Method_and_For_Pseudoscience.ogg">Against Method</a></i>, Paul Feyerabend, in what an unreflective mind might misinterpret as a "troll," says that it is important for science that people have biases, financial interests, interfering religious and political doctrines and the like in science.
Looking at the plot, you might now see why.
When we are stuck on a local maximum, every new data keeps our already-optimized model where it is no matter how low that maximum actually is.
What you need to shake it up is an external shock that totally moves our theoretical position somewhere new on the plot where we can try to optimize at another point, and then compare.
</p>

<h3>Basic assumptions</h3>

<p>
A prudent person should be able to question, "Am I even on the right track or am I playing with some model that has a fundamental flaw?"
I can guarantee you, optimizing for data and fitting math and equations is easy.
<strong>All theoretical programs are wrong because they make incorrect core assumptions.</strong>
This is very hard for the ego of scientists because it means:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Possibly illiterate dilettantes on the internet might see and bring to attention legitimate theoretical flaws.</li>
    <li>All the years you spend in graduate school counting angels on pinheads in your respective theoretical framework is mostly a waste of time.</li>
    <li>The borders of science are borders more of a sociological club than being the border of raw rigor.</li>
    <li>Most of the scientific work is not meaningful outside of the theoretical framework that gave rise to it.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>I guess this is the first blog post of the new year, even though I’m not someone who is keen on celebrating a new year, I sincerely hope every one would have a very bright 2021.</em></p>
<p>Most of you are enjoying unlimited internet at your homes, but sadly <a href="https://ruky.me/2020/12/28/sri-lanka-need-unlimited-internet-connections/">I’m coming from a part of the world that charges according to the data I use. </a></p>
<p>I basically pay for my data and I have monthly cap, and if I exceed that data limit I will have to buy an expensive data add-on. So data is something precious to me.</p>
<p>In the month of December, may be due to a technical error by the ISP my data add-on finished and I made a tweet criticizing them.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Scammed again by <a href="https://twitter.com/SriLankaTelecom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SriLankaTelecom</a> you should be ashamed of your practices </p><p>Bought a zoom package and data add-on today because I need zoom to work</p><p>But then suddenly by noon the internet got slower.

<p>The ISP was kind enough to reach out to me and I received an email detailing the data use of my internet connection.</p>
<p>It is a table with the websites/protocols I used, the data transmitted to that website/protocol in bytes.</p>
<p>One thing that immediately caught my eye was what’s at number 2, it was <strong>Pinterest</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>There has been 17 connections to Pinterest and Pinterest has sent me more than 1.2GB of data.</strong></p>
<p>Even the 2000+ requests to Facebook has only downloaded roughly 300MB of data.</p>
<p>Why Pinterest is sending so much data in just 17 requests? What do they contain?</p>
<p>Maybe they are preloading or caching images for better user experience. But still 1.28GB of images is likely to have more than 1000 images.</p>
<p>Another explanation can that the ISP is trying to give me an explanation why my data vanished. But both explanations doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p>Since data is valuable to me I will try to block requests to Pinterest, and see if that will make a difference to my data usage.</p>
<p>I’ll request another report at the end of the month to see my data usage for the month of January to compare before and after blocking Pinterest.</p>
<p>Has anyone had a similar experience in Pinterest or is it just me?</p>

		<p>Splitting headache at 10am. Not a fine way to start the day.</p>
<p>For the last 10+ years, I’ve consumed 2-5 cups of coffee every day. I was hooked to coffee is an understatement. It had gotten so bad that if I didn’t get coffee by 9am, I’d get a debilitating migraine for the rest of the day. I also had restless sleep, bordering on insomnia, where I wouldn’t sleep at all for a couple nights a month.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.wints.org/img/articles/2021.01.04/coffee.jpg" alt="Coffee"></p><figcaption>Sleep killer, headache giver, kick in the butt</figcaption>
</div>
<p>In February 2020, I got the worst flu in years (don’t think it was COVID). The first three days were extra painful with withdrawal headaches.
I decided a change was in order. My last coffee was January 31st, 2020.
The rest of the process was not predetermined. I tried to follow my body needs and didn’t push to quit with a definite date in mind.</p>
<p>After I recovered from the flu, I switched to black tea for the next several months.
I felt physically sluggish and mentally slower.</p>
<p>Black tea was followed by green tea for about two months. My sleep dramatically improved, however still felt lethargic. After green tea, I still didn’t feel ready to stop all together.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.wints.org/img/articles/2021.01.04/tea.jpg" alt="Jasmine Pearl Tea"></p><figcaption>Savior, kinda</figcaption>
</div>
<p>Enter <u><a href="https://amzn.to/3pwj3Cc">jasmine pearl tea</a></u>. It’s rolled up into a ball and each ball has 1-3 tea leaves. I started using three tea balls for my morning tea. Over the course of three months, I’m down to <i>one tea ball every other day</i>. It’s been a useful tool for measuring caffeine intake. Final quitting day is February 1st, 2021.</p>
<p>The few things I’ve learned along the way:</p>
<h5 id="a-dont-plan-for-every-eventuality">A. Don’t plan for every eventuality</h5>
<p>It was tempting to outline every possible aspect of this challenge – what to drink, when to drink it, how often, when to decrease dosage, what to do in case of a backslide etc. I consciously avoided this for two reasons. One, making a full blown plan feels so satisfying that the actual challenge doesn’t feel compelling anymore, leading me to underperform or give up. And two, I might give up if I backslide so badly that my plan doesn’t account for it. That’s pretty demoralizing.</p>
<h5 id="b-celebrate-positive-consequences">B. Celebrate positive consequences</h5>
<p>I still have headaches if I miss my “caffeine window”. But they are far less painful and much more manageable. That’s a win! I sleep so much better now too.</p>
<h5 id="c-take-your-time">C. Take your time</h5>
<p>It took 10 years to get to this level of caffeine dependence. Spending one year to unwind this addiction is relatively fast! I felt a lot slower mentally in the first 6 months and still do as I continue to reduce my caffeine. I expect that once I no longer depend on caffeine, my body will pick up the slack.</p>
<p>All in all, This has been another step in discipline and a healthier me.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The principle of maximum entropy states that the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest entropy, in the context of precisely stated prior data (such as a proposition that expresses testable information). These prior data serves as the constrains to the probability distribution.</p>



<p>Given the second law of thermodynamics (principle of increase of entropy), isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy, maximum entropy distributions become the most natural distributions under certain constrains. In this blog post, I would like to discuss entropy maximization and a couple of maximum entropy distributions.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="gaussian-integral">Gaussian Integral</h4><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>I will skip the proof here, since the proof from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integral">Wikipedia</a> is not that difficult to understand.</p>

<h4 id="useful-integrals">Useful Integrals</h4><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x e^{-x^2} dx &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} d(-x^2) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} e^{-x^2} \big\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty}\\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 e^{-x^2} dx &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x d (e^{-x^2}) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \Big( x e^{-x^2} \big\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty} - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx \Big) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \Big( 0 - \sqrt{\pi} \Big) \\
&amp;= \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \\

<h3 id="entropy-maximization">Entropy Maximization</h3>

<h4 id="discrete-probability-distribution">Discrete Probability Distribution</h4>

<p>Suppose $P$ is a discrete probability distribution. The entropy is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H(P) &amp;= - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We further have some constrains on $P$:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$P(x) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) = 1$</li>
  <li>$\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) r_i(x) = \alpha_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two constrains are trivial given $P$ is a probability distribution. The third constrain is optional and it indicates a constrain on the entire system. Notice that there could be more than one constrain if $m &gt; 1$.</p>



<p>We would like to maximize the entropy.</p><p>

\[\max_{P} H(P) = \max_{P} \Big( - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) \Big)\]

</p><p>Letâ€™s try to solve this optimization problem. We would use Lagrange multiplier for the constrains.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) + \lambda_0 \Big(\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \sum_{x \in X}^{} \Big(P(x) r_i(x) - \alpha_i \Big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We take the derivative of $L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m)$ with respect to $P(x)$ and the derivative should be $0$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \log P(x) - 1 + \lambda_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x) \\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{e^{1 - \lambda_0}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) = 1$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) &amp;= \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1} \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[e^{1 - \lambda_0} = \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)}\]

</p><p>With this, we could rewrite $P(x)$ as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="continuous-probability-distribution">Continuous Probability Distribution</h4>

<p>Similarly, suppose $P$ is a continuous probability distribution. The entropy is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H(P) &amp;= - \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) dx \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>With the following constrains</p>

<ul>
  <li>$P(x) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx = 1$</li>
  <li>$\int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x) dx = \alpha_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, to maximize the entropy, we maximize the Lagrangian for the continuous case.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) dx + \lambda_0 \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We take the derivative of $L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m)$ with respect to $P(x)$ and the derivative should be $0$. We will also use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations">calculus of variations</a> to compute the derivative, which is slightly more complicated. Without going into all the details, we have the following derivatives.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x)  dx + \lambda_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
&amp;= - \int_{X}^{} \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \big( P(x) \log P(x) \big)  dx + \lambda_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
&amp;= - \log P(x) - 1 + \lambda_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x) \\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{e^{1 - \lambda_0}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx = 1$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx &amp;= \int_{X}^{} e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } dx \\
&amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1} \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[e^{1 - \lambda_0} = \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx\]

</p><p>With this, we could rewrite $P(x)$ as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h3 id="maximum-entropy-distribution-examples">Maximum Entropy Distribution Examples</h3>

<h4 id="roll-dice">Roll Dice</h4>

<p>A conventional dice has 6 faces. $X = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$. Because we donâ€™t have additional constrains, therefore</p><p>

\[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_m = 0\]

</p><p>So, the maximum entropy probability distribution of getting each face of the dice is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{0} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{0} } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ 6 } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="uniform-distribution">Uniform Distribution</h4>

<p>The only constrain we put on a distribution is $X = [a, b]$. Because we donâ€™t have additional constrains, therefore</p><p>

\[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_m = 0\]

</p><p>So the maximum entropy probability distribution is actually uniform distribution.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{0} }{ \int_{a}^{b} e^{0} dx } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ b - a } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="gaussian-distribution">Gaussian Distribution</h4>

<p>We could also derive Gaussian Distribution using entropy maximization. The constrains for the maximum entropy distribution are</p>

<ul>
  <li>$X = (-\infty, \infty)$</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x P(x) dx = \mu$</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mathbb{E}[X]^2 = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mu^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 P(x) dx - \mu^2 = \sigma^2$</li>
</ul>

<p>which translates to</p>

<ul>
  <li>$m = 2$</li>
  <li>$r_1(x) = x$, $\alpha_1 = \mu$</li>
  <li>$r_2(x) = x^2$, $\alpha_2 = \sigma^2$</li>
</ul><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \big( \lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2 \big) dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \Big[ \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2^2} \Big] \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2} \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( -(-\lambda_2) \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Here we assume $\lambda_2 &lt; 0$, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( -(-\lambda_2) \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }} \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)^2 \bigg) d \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)  \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>To make it more clear, we set</p><p>

\[y = \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)\]

</p><p>So using Gaussian integral, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }} \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - …</p></div></div>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A few years ago, while using the Line app, I noticed a feature called "People nearby." The feature lets you connect with other Line users within the same area. The feature would give you the exact distance from you to the other users. If someone spoofs their latitude, longitude, they can triangulate a user and find their location. I reported an issue in the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://line.me/en/" target="_blank"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Line app</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and They paid me $1000 for it.

I tried to see if I can unmask other users' locations, and I found they have the same issue I discovered in the Line app a few years ago. I reported the problem to Telegram security, and they said it's not an issue.&nbsp;<strong>If you enable the feature of making yourself visible on the map, you're publishing your home address online. </strong><span>Lot of users don't know this when they enable that feature.

They’re structured as <strong>event-driven systems. </strong>That basically mean they react to “events” that can occur at any time.  That’s physical event sources like button presses, battery alerts, and sensors inputs, but also to incoming Bluetooth communications from an App. In our experience, even top-tier chip vendors like Nordic Semiconductors provide subpar guidance on how to best orchestrate this system of events and reactions. An unsuspecting developer may feel they’re using a lean approach, linking event sources in code to their corresponding reactions in a piecemeal fashion. The complexity of this patch network soon grows exponentially and starts feeling like a firmware savant is required just to make sense of it all.   As the project grows, the <strong>event-reaction mappings grow in quantity </strong>and<strong> </strong>likely require being dynamically re-mapped in different modes of operation. If left untreated, the affliction can get the best of you, spreading faster than you add features. If you’re anything like us, there’s an inevitable face-the-music moment where this event-driven <strong>spaghetti code </strong>can no longer be tolerated. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1579741448937_7867"><div>

It’s the kind that<em> </em>compiles into bytes and bites to deal with. If you’re not aware of spaghetti code and its nauseating effects, then let’s briefly recap.  “Spaghetti code” is a slang term for code with convoluted structure, so much that it’s difficult to debug and and maintain it.</p><p><strong>What problems are caused by event-driven spaghetti code?</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Bugs: the worst kind of bugs.</strong> It’s the ugly should-have-been-avoidable bugs that crop up and continue to crop up when you lose a handle on the structure of your application.</p></li><li><p><strong>Code duplication.</strong> The completely unnecessary there-must-be-a-better-way kind of duplication. When the system for handling events is poorly structured, developers struggle to repurpose code across similar events and states of operation. For example, a “battery charging” and “charge complete” state should be able to elegantly share a lot of charging-related functionality. </p></li><li><p> <strong>Loneliness</strong>, also known as staffing problems due to your unmaintainable codebase.<strong> </strong> No one likes to work alone, so restructure your application in a way that your coworkers and future coworkers cherish. </p></li></ol></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1579801278944_6416"><div><h2><strong>Fret Not</strong></h2><p>I want to recommend a system that’s worked for me — two steps for developers like us to immunize against the spaghetti affliction right from the start. </p><p><strong>Overview of the Steps to Avoid Spaghetti Code:</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Use an atomic <strong>event queue</strong>. Rather than reacting to events all over your different interrupt execution contexts, an event queue allows you to consolidate those portions of your code into one place. It’s your conduit for “deferring” the handling of events from many contexts (like interrupts) into one main context. It additionally solves the issue of thread/interrupt safety, by avoiding concurrent access of shared resources across different contexts..  For example, you don’t want a SPI peripheral used in two contexts that can interrupt one another. Instead, both contexts can queue events for the main function to perform the SPI operations sequentially. </p></li><li><p>Use a <strong>hierarchical state machine (HSM)</strong>, and a framework to implement one. An HSM is the  knockout punch for our spaghetti foe. It provides an intuitive and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton">deterministic</a> scheme to define how events should be handled throughout various modes of operation. HSMs are “hierarchical” in the sense that each state can be configured to inherit behaviors from a “superstate”, a more general state that encapsulates it and potentially other states. The hierarchical aspect of HSMs make them far more practical for real-world firmware applications than a textbook flat state machine. A “battery charging” and “charging complete” state could both inherit and share a bulk of their code from an “charger attached” state. </p></li></ol></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1579801278944_14942"><div><h2><strong>Immunization Step 1 of 2: <br>Take a queue from your vendor</strong></h2><p><strong>An event queue is the essence of event-driven architecture</strong>.

In the case of some dead-simple events, you might get away handling them right there in the interrupt; But, generally that’s bad practice.

Many developers would be hard-pressed to develop complex applications without it. You use the queue to take all your events and  funnel them into a single context where they’re processed one at a time. Right off the bat, that gains you cozy-warm assurances of thread/interrupt safety because event handling isn’t strewn across all sorts of overlapping execution contexts.</p><p>Courteous silicon vendors usually provide developers with some form of an atomic queue. <strong>Nordic </strong>provides <strong>nRF52</strong> developers with <a href="https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/sdk_nrf5_v16.0.0/lib_scheduler.html?cp=7_1_3_39">their “app scheduler”</a><em>. </em><strong>Texas Instruments</strong><em> </em>provides <strong>CC2640</strong> developers with <a href="http://dev.ti.com/tirex/content/simplelink_cc2640r2_sdk_2_40_00_32/docs/blestack/ble_user_guide/html/ble-stack-tirtos/queues.html">their queue module</a> accompanying their TI-RTOS.

  <article>
    

    <p><strong>Monday, January  4, 2021</strong></p>

    <p>If you're building an application that needs to scale—and we all tell ourselves that we are—then at some point you have to figure out if it <em>does</em> or not. This is where load testing comes in: if you want to see whether or not your application can handle scale, just <em>generate</em> scale and see if it can handle it! It sounds straightforward enough.</p>
<p>Then you try to actually generate load. This is straightforward if your application is dead simple, because you can use something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_JMeter">Apache JMeter</a> to generate repeated requests. If you can do this, I envy you: every system I've worked on is more complicated and requires a more intricate testing plan.</p>
<p>Your application gets slightly more complicated, so you then turn to tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatling_(software)">Gatling</a>. These let you simulate virtual users going through scenarios, which is a lot more helpful than just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_(software)">besieging</a>&nbsp;one or a handful of URLs. Even this isn't sufficient if you're writing an application that uses both WebSockets <em>and</em> HTTP calls, over a long-lived session, and requires certain actions repeated on a timer. Unless I severely missed something in the documentation, I cannot see a way to, say, setup a heartbeat that runs ever 30 seconds, do certain actions upon response to a WebSocket message, and also do some other HTTP actions, all with the same HTTP session. I haven't found a way to do that in <em>any</em> load testing tool (which is why I wrote my own at work, which I hope to open source if I can make the time to clean it up and separate out proprietary bits).</p>
<p>But let's suppose you <em>do</em> have a tool that works, out of the box, like Gatling or Locust, and it fits your needs. Great! Now let's write that test. In my experience, this is the hardest bit yet, because you have to first figure out what realistic load looks like — welcome to a day or three of dredging through logs and taking notes while you peer at the network tools in your browser as you click around in your web application. And then after you know what realistic load looks like, you get to write what boils down to a subset of your application to pretend to be a user, hit the API, and do the things your user would do.</p>
<p>And we're not done yet! This is fine, we have our load test written and it's realistic. But this is a moving target, because updates keep going out. So now you have the maintenance problem, too: as your application changes, how do you keep your load test up to date? There isn't great tooling to do this, there is little out there to help you. You have to make this part of your process and hope you don't miss things. This is not a satisfying answer, and that's why this is also one of the hardest parts of load testing an application.</p>
<p>We'll just skip the whole "running it" part, because honestly, if you've gotten this far through a load test, then running it shouldn't be the hardest part.</p>

<p>So basically, here's where we are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most load testing tools support simplistic workloads, and even the complex ones don't let you do everything that's realistically needed to simulate <em>real</em> usage of a web application.</li>
<li>Writing the test with a simulation of real usage is the hardest part, even if the tools do support what you need.</li>
<li>Maintaining the test is the second hardest part, and the tooling here does not help you in the slightest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at these in detail and see how much complexity we can pare away.</p>
<h2 id="simulating-users-do-we-have-to">Simulating users. Do we have to?</h2>
<p>I'm a "yes" here, although it might depend on your application. And for these purposes, we're talking about the user <em>of a service</em>; if you have a monolith, this is your users as a whole, but if you have microservices the "user" might be another one of your services! For the applications I've worked on, I have had minor success with targeted tests of specific endpoints. But these end up requiring such complicated setup that you aren't better off than you were with the load test itself! And while it may yield some results and improvements, it doesn't get to everything (you may have endpoints that interact) and you don't get a realistic workload.</p>
<p>"When do you <em>not</em> need to simulate users?" is probably a better question. Seems to me like this is when you <em>know</em> that your endpoints are all independent in performance, you don't have any stateful requests, and the ordering of requests does not impact performance. These are big things to assume and it's hard to have confidence in them without testing their independence, at which point, we're back to writing that whole dang test.</p>
<p>The best you can do here is probably at the API and system design time, not at your test time. If you design a simpler API, you're going to have far less surface area to test. If you design a system with more certainly independent pieces (distinct databases per service, for example) then it's easier to test them in isolation than in a monolith. Doing this also lets you use a tool that is simpler, so you get two wins!</p>
<h2 id="writing-the-tests-is-hard-so-is-maintenance">Writing the tests is <em>hard.</em> So is maintenance.</h2>
<p>Creating a load test is hard because you have to do a few things: you have to understand what the flow through <em>usage</em> of your API is, and you have to write a simulation of that usage. Understanding that flow means understanding other systems than the one under test and since your system is presumably not the focus of their documentation, there is not going to be a super clear diagram of when and how it's called; this often looks like sifting logs until you figure out what the representative usage is. And then writing that simulation is certainly not trivial, because you need to manage the state for a large number of actors representing users of your API!</p>
<p>Oh, and you get to write integration tests for this now, too.</p>
<p>There's some research out there on how to make some of these tasks easier. You can figure out what you need for the initial test, and detect regressions (missing new workloads) from automated analysis of the logs, for example. But as far as I can tell, there is no software on GitHub, let alone a product I can buy, that's going to do that for me. So it doesn't seem like it has much of any traction in industry. It would be a big project to implement it on your own, which might be why it has languished (or is done at big companies, and is not spoken of).</p>

<p>There's a lot of complexity in load tests, and there is not a lot of tooling to help you with it. So maybe the answer is: write fewer of these types of tests, and don't expect them to give you all the answers to how your system performs.</p>
<p>You have a few options for getting a great picture of how your system performs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good old analysis.</strong> Sit down with a notebook, a pen, an understanding of your systems as a whole, and an afternoon to spare, and you can figure out with some napkin math what the general parameters and bounds of scaling on your system are. When you find the bottleneck, or you have some unknowns (how many transactions per second <em>can</em> our database support? how many do we generate?) then you can go test those specifically!</li>
<li><strong>Feature rollouts.</strong> If you can roll out features slowly across your users, then you don't necessarily have to do any load testing at all! You can measure performance experimentally and see if it's good enough. Good? Roll forward. Bad? Roll back.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic replay.</strong> This doesn't help at all with new features (see feature rollouts ten words ago for that) but it does help with understanding your system breaking points for existing features without as much development. You can take the traffic you saw before and replay it (multiple times over, even, by combining multiple different periods' traffic) and see how the system performs! (Side note: I would <em>love</em> tooling to help with this, and with amplifying traffic when doing this, so if anyone has a recommendation... hit me up.)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have some silver bullet I've missed, or a fantastic research paper in this area you'd recommend reading, or a story of terrible times with scaling that you want to share with me, please email them to <a href="mailto:me@ntietz.com">me@ntietz.com</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>For the past while, I’ve had the goal of learning a functional programming language in the back of my mind but never acted on it for various reasons. However, during a recent weekend afternoon of winter COVID-lockdown web browsing, I stumbled across the terrific <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/" target="_blank">F# for fun and profit</a> which piqued my interest and convinced me to take the plunge and learn FP in 2021. I believe that learning different programming paradigms helps you become stronger in all languages, and with C# incorporating more and more features from F# (records among other things for example) learning functional programming would be a benefit in a few different ways.</p>

<p>In addition, as I’ve been spending quite a bit of time working with C# and .NET 5 recently, F# felt like a natural fit due to the interoperability with the rest of the .NET ecosystem. In addition, F# has support for OO and so you can use a hybrid model in situations where pure FP may not be possible.</p>

<h2 id="initial-thoughts">Initial Thoughts</h2>

<p>As a small learning project, I created a simple program which asks the user for a username and password and prints a message if the user enters the correct combination (if they get the combination wrong the function is called recursively and asks them for their credentials again). Figuring out the implementation details proved to be a bit more challenging than if I were to code the solution in C# as you don’t want to use statements such as if and while in functional programming which would normally be my go-tos in a case like this. After much trial and error, I found my solution to be quite elegant:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>open</span> <span>System</span>

<span>type</span> <span>LoginModel</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>Username</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span> <span>Password</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>}</span>

<span>// By making Admins a Set.OfList we can use .Contains later.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>Admins</span> <span>=</span> <span>[{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>"MJ"</span><span>;</span><span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>"M"</span><span>};</span> <span>{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>"Joe"</span><span>;</span><span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>"C"</span><span>}]</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Set</span><span>.</span><span>ofList</span>

<span>[&lt;</span><span>EntryPoint</span><span>&gt;]</span>
<span>let</span> <span>main</span> <span>args</span> <span>=</span>

    <span>// The LoginRoutine() is a recursive function we call until the user enters the correct credentials.</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> <span>LoginRoutine</span><span>()</span> <span>=</span> 
        <span>printfn</span> <span>"Welcome to VMS Version V!"</span>
        <span>printf</span> <span>"Enter your username to continue: "</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>usernameAttempt</span> <span>=</span> <span>Console</span><span>.</span><span>ReadLine</span><span>()</span>
        <span>printf</span> <span>"Enter your password to continue: "</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>passwordAttempt</span> <span>=</span> <span>Console</span><span>.</span><span>ReadLine</span><span>()</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>loginCredentials</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>usernameAttempt</span><span>;</span> <span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>passwordAttempt</span><span>}</span>
        <span>match</span> <span>Admins</span><span>.</span><span>Contains</span> <span>loginCredentials</span> <span>with</span>
        <span>|</span> <span>true</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>printfn</span> <span>"You are logged in"</span>
        <span>|</span> <span>false</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>LoginRoutine</span><span>()</span>
    
    <span>let</span> <span>login</span> <span>=</span> <span>LoginRoutine</span><span>()</span>

    <span>0</span> <span>// Terminate program</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In comparison to C#, we see several big differences in the code. Aside from the lack of brackets and semicolons, the program uses a match expression rather than an if statement to evaluate the user’s credentials. Pattern matches are powerful expressions and from what I’ve seen can allow for complex branching.</p>

<p>Also note the creation of the Admins list:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>Admins</span> <span>=</span> <span>[{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>"MJ"</span><span>;</span><span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>"M"</span><span>};</span> <span>{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>"Joe"</span><span>;</span><span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>"C"</span><span>}]</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Set</span><span>.</span><span>ofList</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>During the binding, we never specifed the actual type! F#’s powerful type inference means that I can skip a lot of boilerplate that I would normally use in C# while still having all the benefits of a strongly typed language.</p>

<p>We also make use of the pipe forward operator |&gt; in order to take the admins list and turn it into a set. Converting the list to a set allows us to use .Contains on our admins list in the match expression later on in the code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        <span>match</span> <span>Admins</span><span>.</span><span>Contains</span> <span>loginCredentials</span> <span>with</span>
        <span>|</span> <span>true</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>printfn</span> <span>"You are logged in"</span>
        <span>|</span> <span>false</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>LoginRoutine</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since the LoginRountine function has been marked with the rec (recursive) keyword, it will continue to call itself until the match returns true. This eliminates the need for using a while loop while keeping our method immutable.</p>

<p>In addition, its important to note that F# executes code from the top down which I find makes following program flow much easier. Despite this, I did run into a few compiler errors until I got the hang of the execution flow and making sure to put functions in the proper order.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>So far, my biggest issue hasn’t been with the language itself, but rather the lack of learning resources compared with other, more popular languages. <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-f-sharp" target="_blank">Get Programming with F#</a> has been a terrific book for learning, but the paradigm shift that functional programming requires can be quite significant and I find myself constantly Googling certain issues and being able to count the number of (usually not very related) Stack Exchange topics on one hand. I did however find a great small but active <a href="https://discord.gg/vs4U6HQhAG" target="_blank">F# Discord community</a> which has been great at answering smaller one-off questions that I’ve had regarding the language.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>My next steps are to think about a project that I’d like to undertake in F# to help me continue my learning. I find I tend to learn best when I have a project and write a build log documenting the process, and I’m hoping that I’ll be able to combine an F# project with my <a href="https://markjames.dev/2020-12-09-back-to-school/" target="_blank">cloud computing program</a> that I’ll be attending at the end of January. I also plan to write a few more articles exploring the language a bit more in-depth in the coming months, so stay tuned!</p>

The delivery driver who brought his groceries from Vons mentioned that drivers across the state are getting fired by Vons, Pavilions, and other California stores owned by Albertsons Companies in late February. Stores will instead turn to a third-party delivery service using independent contractors.</p><p id="d033">â€œI was disturbed and disappointed that Vons would eliminate these jobs. I felt like they were the only remaining company that treated delivery drivers ethically but no longer,â€� said Dylan.</p><p id="1f42">After publication, an Albertsons representative sent the following statement: â€œWe will transition that portion of our eCommerce operations to third-party logistics providers.â€� She added â€œWhile we know that this move will help us create a more efficient operation, it wasnâ€™t a decision we made lightly or without a great deal of consideration.â€�</p><p id="10d5">Drivers under the Albertsons Companies umbrella are employees, while Ralphs delivery is operated by Instacart and Target uses Shipt, a similar app. At Bay Area stores, drivers are unionized, and will not be affected by the layoffs. For southern California shoppers, this move leaves them without a grocery delivery option that treats drivers as employees.</p><p id="baaa">Unions are vowing to fight the change, says Jim Araby, Director of Strategic Campaigns at UCFW5. â€œThe only drivers that kept their jobs were the unionized drivers in the Bay Area. All the other drivers in California were laid off because they were non-union. We represent those drivers and they will keep their job.â€�</p><p id="4b12">These layoffs are unsurprising after the passage of Proposition 22, which gutted worker protections while making it easier for companies to shift financial burdens onto newly-designated â€œindependent contractors.â€� In a <a rel="noopener" href="https://knock-la.com/the-case-for-voting-no-on-ca-prop-22-a64d25b2828d">piece for KNOCK</a> last year, Keith F. Eberl predicted this exact outcome in the opening paragraph:</p><blockquote><p id="95b6">â€œContrary to the companiesâ€™ deceptive ad campaign and intimidating messages to their workers, Prop 22 does not preserve driver flexibility or save drivers from politicians. What Prop 22 does do is change current law so the companies can shift their costs to the driver and diminish or remove driversâ€™ rights, protections, and benefits. Prop 22 will also block driversâ€™ ability to organize so they canâ€™t collectively bargain a contract. In addition, this proposition will block local governments from writing or enforcing protections for drivers.â€�</p></blockquote><p id="a03f">The only surprise is the speed at which Albertsons reversed course on its commitments to workers. This move comes after nearly a year of celebrating grocery store workers for feeding communities. <a href="https://www.vons.com/steps-we-are-taking-at-your-grocery-store.html" rel="noopener">Earlier this year</a>, Albertsons Companies President &amp; CEO Vivek Sankaran said the company was â€œtaking care of our team.â€� Albertsons Companies â€œare workingâ€¦ to ensure that every member of our team who faces a crisis can have peace of mind that we will help them get through it.â€�</p><p id="c5d5">Albertsons was happy to reap public goodwill during the pandemic. But once Prop 22 gave the company the option of replacing workers with lower-paid contractors, they jumped at the opportunity. Employees received notice during the holidays that their employment would end one month into the new year.</p><p id="66cc">Early in the pandemic, union members demanded hazard pay, additional medical leave, and employee protections during the pandemic. In March, Safeway and Northern California grocery workers <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Coronavirus-Safeway-reaches-new-agreement-for-15150811.php" rel="noopener">reached an agreement</a> providing these additional benefits.</p><p id="452b">Labor and management were able to cooperate in April, requesting that grocery workers be designated as first responders. In an April j<a href="https://www.albertsonscompanies.com/helping-you-through-covid-19/albertsons-companies-ucfw-launch-joint-effort.html" rel="noopener">oint statement</a>, Sankaran and United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) President Marc Perrone wrote:</p><blockquote><p id="c86a">â€œThis joint action is an example of how all Americans must work together to protect everyone working on the frontlines. This includesâ€¦ associates at our nationâ€™s grocery stores who are providing communities with the essential food and supplies needed to weather this public health crisis.â€�</p></blockquote><p id="0a33">Negotiations in October <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2020/10/08/grocery-warehouse-workers-truck-drivers-give-notice-of-potential-strike/" rel="noopener">turned contentious</a>, as members of the Teamsters issued a notice of potential strike due to rising healthcare costs. Lou Villavazo, who chairs the bargaining effort, told the <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2020/10/08/grocery-warehouse-workers-truck-drivers-give-notice-of-potential-strike/" rel="noopener">Orange County Register</a> that â€œemployers have been bargaining in bad faith. Weâ€™ve had over 18 bargaining sessions with them and we provided our economic proposal â€¦ but no response.â€�</p><p id="e2db">Organized labor made the difference for drivers in the Bay Area, who will remain as employees for now. But without the power of a union, southern California drivers lack an organizational structure through which to fight back.</p><p id="b343">Many, myself included, turned to Vons and Albertsons stores for their groceries, knowing that drivers were employed with benefits. Unionized drivers offered a clear alternative to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-24/no-holiday-cheer-for-gig-workers-hunting-your-last-minute-gifts" rel="noopener">hellscape of gig-economy apps</a> like Instacart.</p><p id="a579">In a <a href="https://www.albertsonscompanies.com/newsroom/appreciation-pay-for-front-line-associates.html" rel="noopener">March 2020 statement</a>, Sankaran said â€œthese times are unprecedented in the grocery industryâ€¦ [a] simple â€˜thank youâ€™ doesnâ€™t seem like quite enough.â€� He was right. Delivery drivers deserve healthcare, job protections, and fair wages. Workers won those fights this year because they fought as a union. With DoorDash taking over in February, that united front will be gone.</p><p id="26c2">You can contact Albertsons Companies and let them know what you think of this move:</p><p id="2910">Vons Retail Store/Corporate Phone Number: 877â€“723â€“3929</p><p id="2f7e">Albertsons Retail Store/Corporate Phone Number: 877â€“723â€“3929</p><p id="2b59"><em>EDITORâ€™S NOTE: After publication, Albertsonâ€™s responded to KNOCKâ€™s request for comment. This piece has since been edited to clarify that union drivers will not be laid off and that workers facing layoffs in Southern California are non-union, as well as to include statements from both Albertsons and UCFW5. The scheduled date of the layoffs was also corrected.</em></p></div></div></section></div>]]>

I'm completely transparent about how this website makes money as well as the methods and limitations of my product selection methodology. Every affiliate link on this site is properly disclosed and wrapped in a "rel sponsored" tag. I take the time to read scientific and medical research as it relates to the topics that I cover, and when I find a product that is potentially harmful (like weighted eye masks), I share my findings with every major publisher who has written positive things about that product. I use my expertise to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johndefeo_if-you-support-a-charity-via-amazonsmile-activity-6737737229449379840-vc6I/">support charity</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johndefeo_to-my-friends-in-journalism-be-cautious-activity-6733095426775404544-FbxR/">to teach colleagues about scams</a>.

These media mentions drove hundreds of thousands of visits. Nevertheless, if someone who was referred to this website two years ago is looking for a cheap portable generator today, he or she is much more likely to Google "cheap portable generator" than to come to my homepage.</p><p>It's understandable. Alas, without search visibility, this site in invisible.</p><h2><strong>Can a Domain Be Cursed?</strong></h2><p>I did my due diligence before I registered goodcheapandfast.com. It had no backlink history and it had only existed previously as a parked domain in 2013. There are no obvious skeletons in this domain's closet, yet strange things have been afoot, almost since day one.</p><p>For example, Bing didn't even index this website's homepage a month after <em>Good, Cheap and Fast</em> was linked to from websites like Esquire and Slate. I contacted bingwb@microsoft.com with my concerns and received this response:</p><blockquote><p>Good day and thank you for your patience while we investigated the issue.</p><p>Firstly, I am happy to provide you information that our product review group succeeded in removing the block of the site. After submitting your site to be reviewed the team has decided to lift the  block. Please allow up to 2-3 weeks for your site to be crawled indexed and serving again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am unable to provide you the specifics of the block as our product review team does not share details of the block.</p></blockquote><p>The mystery didn't end there. Two years later, this website has received fewer than 100 total referrals from Bing. That's not normal and neither is this: Since 2019, pages on this website started dropping in-and-out of Google's results. An article that ranked #1 would disappear entirely, then reappear, then disappear, then reappear. These were like mini strokes. Sometimes the traffic bounced back in full; other times it gradually faded away.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607704925648_28921"><div>

The best that I've gotten in return was a <a href="https://twitter.com/dannysullivan/status/1327323523828703232">superficial acknowledgement</a> that resulted in a dead end.</p><p>I get it.

It dragged on for two years.)</p></blockquote><p>There's an old proverb, "Who knows what is good and what is bad." </p><p>Maybe my own plight, which admittedly doesn't even register as a drop in the sea of 2020 misery, is part of something good that has yet to reveal itself. </p><p>I'm doing the best that I can to stay positive, but it isn't easy.</p><p>———</p><p><strong>Update, 12/15</strong> - My traffic has settled into a 90% loss.

            I am no stranger to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling">Doom Scrolling</a>. 
            I am guilty of scrolling through r/coronavirus (I don't even want to link it) on Reddit. 
            This was a great source of stress for me: I was counting every number, looking at infection 
            rates across populations, observing hospital capacities, and to put it candidly, watching 
            people die. I decided to cut back on coronavirus news, and found that my days were generally 
            happier. At a certain point, though, I cut the news out all together. Why?
        </p>
        <h2>I Already Know What I Need To Do</h2>
        <p>
            I have come to realize that no coronavirus news will (or should) change my behavior. 
            I should wear my mask and I should socially distance. What else do I need to know?
            If you've felt the stress of reading about coronavirus news, I personally recommend 
            you try cutting it out. Seriously, you're not going to miss much.

<article>
  <p>
    Sometimes, when we make seamless patterns out of several objects,
    we need to deal with the situations where the objects are on the borders.
    Usually we create copies of the objects and place them
    at proper positions to make the tiling work with no seams.
  </p>
  <!--more-->

  

  <p>
    In CSS, there's a possible way to do it without creating
    copies manually or doing any calculations to the positions,
    by utilizing the CSS <code>background</code> property.
  </p>

  <p>
    Background in CSS is repeatable by default,
    if we create objects using <code>background</code> or <code>background-image</code>,
    they can be tiled automatically regardless of their positions.
  </p>

   <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>background-image</span><span>:</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155a6</span> <span>30%</span><span>,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>

  <span>/* default */</span>
  <span>background-size</span><span>:</span> <span>100%</span> <span>100%</span><span>;</span>
  <span>background-repeat</span><span>:</span> <span>repeat</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
    
    
  </div>

  <h2>Pattern fragment</h2>

  <p>
    We start with specifying the size of the fragment which is being used for tiling,
    This is an essential step since it determines the repeatable space of the pattern.
  </p>

<div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
    
  </div>

  <p>
    Create a circle object using <code>radial-gradient</code> in the background.
  </p>

 <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>background-image</span><span>:</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155a6</span> <span>30%</span><span>,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
    
    
  </div>

  <p>
    The circle is being tiled properly even though you can't see the edges.
    Move it to somewhere else using <code>background-position</code>.
    No need to worry about getting over the edges,
    the browser has taken care of it for us.
  </p>


 <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>background-image</span><span>:</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155a6</span> <span>30%</span><span>,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
  <span>background-position</span><span>:</span> <span>-110px</span> <span>-20px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
    
    
  </div>

  <p>
    We can add more objects by adding more background images.
  </p>


<div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>background-image</span><span>:</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155a6</span> <span>30%</span><span>,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155a6</span> <span>20%</span><span>,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155a6</span> <span>10%</span><span>,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
  <span>background-position</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-110px</span> <span>-20px</span><span>,</span>
    <span>-20px</span> <span>-75px</span><span>,</span>
    <span>20px</span> <span>40px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

    
    
  </div>


<p>
  This element can be used to make a seamless
  pattern by tiling.

  The only problem is that the element itself cannot be tiled as easily as background images.
  We need to create many identical elements and place them in the grid.

  Although taking a screenshot of the element and saving it in PNG format is a quick solution.
</p>

<h2>Using css-doodle</h2>

<p>
  One of the exciting features <a href="https://css-doodle.com/">css-doodle</a> provides is the ability to generate background
  image from another css-doodle element with the <code>@doodle</code> function.
  If we create the pattern fragment in css-doodle, it can be used for background image.
  Which means the pattern fragment can be tiled.
</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* container size */</span>
<span>@grid</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>/</span> <span>100%</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>

<span>/* pattern dimension */</span>
<span>background-size</span><span>:</span> <span>180</span><span>px</span> <span>180</span><span>px</span><span>;</span>

<span>/* pattern fragment */</span>

  <span>@</span><span>grid</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>/</span> <span>100%</span><span>;</span>
  <span>background-image</span><span>:</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155</span><span>a6</span> <span>30</span><span>%,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155</span><span>a6</span> <span>20</span><span>%,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155</span><span>a6</span> <span>5</span><span>%,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
  <span>background-position</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-110px</span> <span>-20px</span><span>,</span>
    <span>-20px</span> <span>-75px</span><span>,</span>
    <span>20</span><span>px</span> <span>40</span><span>px</span><span>;</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

  <p>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 100% 180px;
      border: 1px solid #6155a6;
      background-size: 180px 180px;
      background-image: @doodle(
        @grid: 1 / 100%;
        background-image:
          radial-gradient(#6155a6 30%, transparent 0),
          radial-gradient(#6155a6 20%, transparent 0),
          radial-gradient(#6155a6 5%, transparent 0);
        background-position:
          -110px -20px,
          -20px -75px,
          20px 40px;
      );
    </css-doodle>
  </p>

  <p>
    Using gradients to create shapes is rather limited.
    Fortunately, the <code>@doodle</code> function can be nested.
    For example, we can replace one of the circle objects created from <code>radial-gradient</code> with
    another css-doodle element, inside which is a heart shape with rotation by <code>30</code> degree.

  <h2>Do it again</h2>

  <p>
    I know it's a bit confusing at first. So let's take another example from this <a href="https://codepen.io/yuanchuan/pen/xxEXwZw">demo</a> on CodePen,
    and recreate the <i>pattern #11</i> step by step.
  </p>

  <p>
    We still start from the pattern fragment,
    add its background color, setup its width and height both to <code>200px</code>.
    Note again that putting the objects inside background image is an important step. So here's the skeleton.
  </p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>@grid</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>/</span> <span>200px</span><span>;</span>

<span>background-color</span><span>:</span> <span>#005874</span><span>;</span>
<span>background-image</span><span>:</span>
  <span>/* objects */</span><span>;</span>
<span>background-position</span><span>:</span>
  <span>/* positions */</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 200px;
      background: #005874;
    </css-doodle>
  </div>

  <h3>Add objects</h3>

  <p>
    We're going to create a new shape for the elements in this pattern.
    The <code>@shape()</code> function returns a generated string of <code>polygon()</code> used by <code>clip-path</code>.
  </p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>clip-path</span><span>:</span> <span>@shape</span><span>(</span>
  <span>split</span><span>:</span> <span>50</span><span>;</span>
  <span>scale</span><span>:</span> <span>.</span><span>3</span><span>;</span>
  <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
  <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 200px 150px;
      :after {
        content: '';
        @size: 100px;
        background: #ffbe00;
        margin-left: -20px;
        clip-path: @shape(
          split: 50;
          scale: .3;
          x: cos(t) + cos(2t) * 2;
          y: sin(2t) + sin(t) * 2;
        );
      }
    </css-doodle>
  </div>

  <p>
    Place the shape to the <code>background-image</code> with <code>@doodle</code> function.
    It's the first object we added to the pattern.
  </p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>@grid</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>/</span> <span>200px</span><span>;</span>

  <span>);</span>
<span>);</span>
<span>/* position */</span>
<span>background-position</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
    <p>
      <css-doodle seed="1608724650251">
        @grid: 1 / 200px;
        background-color: #005874;
        background-image: @doodle(
          @grid: 1 / 50px;
          background: @p(#65d6ce,#1c819e,#e6e6d4,#ffbe00);
          clip-path: @shape(

        );
        background-position: 0 0;
      </css-doodle>
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    Once we have a good understanding of how this works, add more objects and place each of them with <code>background-position</code>.
    Setting random background colors and transfomations will make them look better.

<h2>How to use it in production</h2>

<p>
  I'd suggest to to create pattern fragments with design tools like PS and AI,
  but it's still interesting to create something directly from the code.
  So here are two ways to apply it to your websites:
</p>

<ul>

<p>The strangest hobby I’ve ever had is collecting credit cards. This was back about six years ago, when I loved “gaming” the system. How would I maximize my cashback, points and benefits without paying a single cent? </p>



<p>I mastered the credit card market and all its technicalities: the best cards for discounts and premium airport lounges, hacks to avoid paying fees, and I even paid off my <a href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/how-i-paid-off-my-58k-education-loan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">student loan</a> using credit cards.</p>



<p>Additionally, the coolest thing about <a href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/optimize-your-credit-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit cards</a> like Visa Infinites and World Mastercards is they portray status — you’ve gotta reach a certain level of income to have ’em.</p>



<p>It was an insecure guy’s wet dream, and I was hooked.</p>



<p>While I started aiming for money and status, thankfully those haven’t been the only things I’ve been maximizing for. (I can imagine that would make me pretty obnoxious.) Instead, I figured out pretty early money isn’t a good measure for a great life. Money is more like a pre-requisite: necessary, but once you have <a href="https://www.sloww.co/how-much-money-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enough</a> — more isn’t gonna make a big difference.</p>



<p>So I started maximizing for other things. In fact, if there’s one big theme that connects everything in my blog, it’s this: getting the most out of life — whether it’s in the areas of money, career or relationships.</p>



<div><p>Thus far, it’s served me well. But in recent times, I’ve started to wonder if maximizing is really that great. For someone who’s spent years trying to extract maximum value from their life, is there a better way?</p></div>



<h2>Maximizers vs Satisficers</h2>



<p>In his popular book “<a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Paradox-Choice-Barry-Schwartz/9780062449924?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1601188274112&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Paradox of Choice</a>,” the psychologist Dr. Barry Schwartz broadly describes two kinds of people: maximizers (like me) and satisficers.</p>



<p>The stereotypical maximizer is someone who spends tons of time evaluating options before they make a <em>best</em> decision: like your geeky friend who draws up cost-benefit <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/downside-everything/" target="_blank">analysis</a> spreadsheets for months before buying a new phone (which annoyingly tends to be the phone you recommended him in the first place).</p>



<p>Satisficers on the other hand, tend to settle for the first thing that meets their requirements: like your elderly aunt who’s thrilled with her 2019 Xiaomi.</p>



<p>I imagine most people who’re good at personal finance or pros in fields like accounting and law are maximizers. There are proven benefits to maximizing: maximizers make better decisions. They also make more money.</p>



<p>But guess who’s happier?</p>



<p>Right, research shows satisficers tend to be <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/science-choice/201506/satisficing-vs-maximizing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">happier</a>.</p>



<p>This isn’t to say one is better than the other. Don’t worry whether you’re a maximizer or a satisficer — I don’t think people can easily switch. Just understand there’s things to learn from the other side.</p>



<div><p>As for the maximizer in me, I’ve grown to become more easily satisfied. This is what I’ve learned along the way.</p></div>



<h2>Struggling Between Growth and Satisfaction</h2>



<p>Something I’ve written about extensively is how I’ve always felt I was an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/journey-finding-satisfaction-life/" target="_blank">underdog</a>. Like I constantly needed to prove my worth. When I was a teenager, I was obsessed with becoming an all-rounder. </p>



<p>I was pretty good at exams, but wanted to prove I could do other stuff. Hence trying to be good at sports and being popular with the girls. No, I didn’t want to be a geek. I wanted to be a jock; but a smart one. I wanted to be amazing in every area. To win. And thus, my lifelong obsession with self-improvement.</p>



<p>I don’t know if feeling <a href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/how-overcome-jealousy-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insecure</a> pushed me towards becoming a maximizer. Or if maximizers tend to feel insecure (are they secretly compensating for something?). What I do know is there’s a spectrum between satisfaction and growth. And there’s an art to balancing both.</p>



<p>I say art because you don’t wanna fall into any of the extremes. Constantly keeping score and trying to win is exhausting because even if you’re #1, you lose sometimes. Besides, everyone eventually gets old. On the other hand you don’t want to be easily satisfied with everything — that just ensures you get complacent; eventually extinct. </p>



<p>Surely there’s a sweet spot. </p>



<div><p>I like to call that sweet spot “good enough.”</p></div>



<h2>What If 90% Is All You Need?</h2>



<p>We’ve been very philosophical so far, so it’s time for examples. I was reminded of what’s “good enough” in personal finance, by Morgan Housel on Twitter recently:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>– Live below your means. </p><p>– Invest, diversified, with a 10+ year horizon. </p><p>– Expect and accept volatility. </p><p>That's 90% of finance. </p><p>90%.</p></div>— Morgan Housel (@morganhousel) <a href="https://twitter.com/morganhousel/status/1285324455699337217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Sure, personal finance is a lot more complex than three sentences. But if a young person today ignored everything else and just followed that advice for the rest of their life, would they do okay? </p>



<p>I think so. I think the 90% is good enough for most people. Heck, the 90% will probably make you do <em>better</em> than most people.</p>



<div><p>What are some other examples of the “Good Enough” principle?</p></div>



<h3>“Good Enough” Examples</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Health:</strong> Eat a balanced diet to keep your weight in the healthy range. Exercise 3x a week. Get &gt;7 hours of sleep every night.</li><li><strong>Investing:</strong> Buy low-cost, passive index funds or ETFs. <a href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/how-invest-own-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Invest</a> for retirement, decades away. Don’t interrupt the compounding effect of your retirement fund (e.g. EPF) by making early withdrawals.</li><li><strong>Career:</strong> Work with good people who you respect. Never stop learning, whether it’s technical or soft skills. Be reliable and over-communicate, so your bosses and colleagues understand your work.</li><li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Treat people with respect and empathy. Set healthy boundaries, especially with negative people. When you have issues, discuss them honestly.</li><li><strong>Writing:</strong> Use the simplest words you can without losing your message. Make your point quickly and get out of the way. Edit ruthlessly — good <a href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/lessons-5-years-writing-how-start-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writing</a> is a bad first draft polished many times.</li></ul>



<p>BTW this isn’t about life hacks. Fuck hacks. This is about fundamentals. Hacks are short-term easy things, whereas fundamentals are the (usually) harder, boring principles which will bring you long-term success.</p>



<p>How much pain would we save if we could just lean back, accept good enough for most things, and trust everything will work out in the long term?</p>



<p>I say good enough for most things. Because then, you’ll still have the time and energy to focus on a <em>few</em> things that <em>really</em> matter. In a funny way, the concept of good enough can fit in with maximalization. I like to call it Aaron’s Law of Life Optimization:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>Focus your life on just a few critical things. For everything else, just get to good enough.</p></div></blockquote>



<h2>Applying “Good Enough” to My Own Life</h2>



<p>What is it that you really want in life?</p>



<p>When I was in my twenties, I wanted to have everything: money, power, career and fame. But today, my life is very different from the dream state I once imagined.</p>



<p>It’s practical. I work hard at my day job as a salaried employee, not a rich Internet solopreneur with 100,000 USD passive income. I occasionally have heated discussions with my wife over trivial matters, instead of baller living with four girlfriends who call me Master. In my middle-class condo parking lot, I have an old <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/cheap-second-hand-car/" target="_blank">second-hand MyVi</a> instead of the Ferrari I once dreamed about. </p>



<p>Maybe the insecure younger me would have looked at my life today and laughed: “Is this all there is to life? When did you give up on your dreams to conquer the world and settle?”</p>



<p>And the older, wiser me would reply: “One day you’ll realize there are just a few <a href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/only-4-things-care-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">important things</a> in life, and everything else is secondary. As long as you have those covered, nothing else really matters.”</p>



<p>It would be tough for the younger me to understand. But I hope he would listen and think about it seriously. And no matter how many months or years it’d take him to explore and eventually realize these truths, I hope he’d come back to me someday and say: </p>



<div><p>“Actually, that sounds okay. It sounds good enough.”</p></div>

<p><em>Rapid climbs to stardom are normally reserved for pop stars and, on rare occasions, for politicians. But it is virtually unheard of for scientists. On Nov. 9, 2020, though, Özlem Türeci and Uğur Şahin were catapulted onto the world stage essentially overnight. That's the day, BioNTech, the medical research company the couple founded, reported the first global breakthrough in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic: The company's vaccine candidate BNT162b2, developed in Mainz, Germany, demonstrated more than 90 percent efficacy in clinical studies. Almost every test subject who received the vaccine was protected from contracting COVID-19.</em></p>


<p><em>It was a sensation. And a glimmer of hope. In 2021, fully 1.3 billion doses of the vaccine are to be administered worldwide, making an end to the pandemic more than just a distant hope. Şahin and Türeci have been the focus of global attention since then, with press outlets around the world showing a soft spot for the German couple with Turkish roots. She, a chief physician; he, the CEO of BioNTech – married for the last 18 years. Thus far, Şahin has taken the lead in conducting interviews, but this is the first, extensive joint interview given by the couple. It was conducted via Zoom from their Mainz apartment. The two seemed so relaxed that it was easy to forget all that was going on around them.</em></p>

<div>
<p><em>The BioNTech couple has been well known in the medical community for some time, particularly among cancer experts. They are both oncologists specialized in immunotherapy. Şahin, 55, was awarded the German Cancer Prize in 2019. Türeci, 53, is head of the research cluster of the German Ministry of Education, Science and Culture.</em></p><p><em>BioNTech is the second company the couple has founded, but they primarily see themselves as scientific researchers. They view entrepreneurship as a means to an end: Because "science doesn't always reach the hospital bed," as Türeci says – because research doesn't always produce concrete treatments, or does so only slowly. As such, the record speed with which their company developed the COVID-19 vaccine is a message: Look how fast we can move if we all join forces.</em></p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Ms. Türeci, Mr. Şahin, as we speak, millions of doses of the vaccine you developed are being shipped on planes and trucks to hospitals and vaccination centers around the world. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden was inoculated live on television with the BioNTech vaccine. Your research is currently the greatest hope for billions of people. Have you been able to find a minute to reflect on all of that?</p><p><strong>Türeci:</strong> If you are speaking literally about a single minute, then yes. The entire year was more or less unrelenting. But every now and then, we have had brief moments to reflect and absorb events, such as when colleagues sent us photos from the first vaccinations. To see people finally benefitting from our work is really moving.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The vaccine achieved an efficacy of 95 percent in the clinical study. Most experts would have been happy with a result exceeding 70 percent. Were you confident from the beginning that your vaccine would be so potent?</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> We were confident that the immunological reaction would be close to perfect. We started with 20 vaccine candidates, which we tested until only the best remained. It helped that we have over two decades of experience in immune engineering, triggering immune responses in the body. But we didn't know if the virus was at all susceptible to a vaccine.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> We could have found ourselves in a situation in which no vaccine could help?</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> Yes, there are other viruses in this class against which it has not been possible to develop a vaccine. But we are able to produce an immune response to this coronavirus. That isn't just shown by the 95 percent efficacy, but also by the breadth and strength of the antibody and T-cell response. This multifaceted nature of the immunological response is vital when the virus mutates further. Think of it like this: The triggered immune response recognizes the so-called virus antigens at many different locations. Through a mutation, the virus can make some of these locations unrecognizable, but it can't change itself so fundamentally that it becomes invisible to the immune system.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> That means that you aren't worried about the much more contagious variant discovered in England?</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> Not when it comes to the efficacy of the vaccine. Even if there are several mutations, the actual structure of the virus antigen is changed by less than 1 percent. We are performing tests to determine if our vaccine can also neutralize theses variations and will soon know more. What concerns me is that the mutation apparently arose in a patient with a suppressed immune system. The virus had complete freedom and months of time to optimize. That could mean that there will always be biotopes within which the virus can improve itself. We have to consider this problem in the medium term.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Would you be able to rapidly adapt your vaccine if the virus undergoes a significant mutation?</p>
</div>

<section data-area="contentbox">

</section>
<div>
<p><strong>Türeci:</strong> From a purely technological perspective, yes. We could simply replace the genetic information for the current virus antigen with the new, mutated version. Doing so would go quite quickly, it would take perhaps six weeks. The question is what the regulatory authorities would say. Would they accept that we fundamentally proved the efficacy and safety of our vaccine initially such that we could then use it against additional virus mutations?</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> And what if they don't?</p><p><strong>Türeci:</strong> Then we would have to undertake a new clinical study with tens of thousands of test subjects. But the authorities have significant experience with such adjustments, such as with the seasonal flu vaccine, for example, which is produced each year to neutralize new virus variations.</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> We have begun discussing the issue with the authorities.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Your study with 44,000 test subjects showed that the vaccine can prevent the development of COVID-19. But when will we know if it also prevents the transmission of the virus? That would stem the pandemic much more rapidly.</p><p><strong>Türeci:</strong> We will have relevant data by around the end of January – indirect data, at least. What we are able to investigate pretty well is the prevention of asymptomatic infections.</p>
</div>
<section>

</section>
<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> In other words, whether people are infectious even if they have no symptoms.</p><p><strong>Türeci:</strong> We can determine that indirectly via antibody tests. The data we have gathered thus far is encouraging, indicating that the vaccine can be effective here too.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Just as effective as it is against the outbreak of the illness?</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> We'll see if it is 50, 60 or 70 percent. But you shouldn't forget that simply preventing an outbreak of the illness has an effect on the further development of the pandemic, because people who develop symptoms through an outbreak of the illness are contagious for longer.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> It also hasn't yet been determined for how long immunity lasts, whether after an infection or after receiving the vaccine. In a worst-case scenario, will we have to get vaccinated three times a year?</p><p><strong>Türeci:</strong> First of all, we expect the immunity from the vaccine to last at least as long as natural immunity triggered by an infection. And we know that we increase the body's immune response with the second dose. That means that an even greater effect could be achieved with a third injection, perhaps one year later. Ultimately, this is all hardcore science. The data will show us what must be done.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Thus far, the vaccine has to be kept at a temperature of minus 70 degrees Celsius during storage and transportation. It became apparent from the very beginning of the vaccination campaign that this can create problems. Will it be possible to adjust the serum in the near future such that it can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures?</p><p><strong>Türeci:</strong> The situation will remain unchanged for the next three months, but then we will likely be able to improve the specifications for transportation and storage. Our refined vaccine generation, which will be stable at much higher temperatures, could be available by late summer.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The best vaccine isn't particularly helpful if it isn't available in sufficient quantities. How many doses will you be able to deliver to Europe in the first half of the year?</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> The precise numbers aren't intended for publication. We ask for your understanding.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The U.S. appears to be much better supplied. According to President-elect Joe Biden, up to 100 million Americans are to be vaccinated by April.</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> The Americans didn't just buy our vaccine, but also those from other companies, like Moderna.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The U.S. reserved 600 million doses from BioNTech way back in July.

January 4, 2021 | https://aonemd.me/posts/ruby-how-can-something-so-beautiful-become-so-ugly/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://aonemd.me/posts/ruby-how-can-something-so-beautiful-become-so-ugly/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div lang="en">
          <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: this is a rant.</p>
<p>I’ve been using Ruby since 2013 and for most of my study and career, Ruby was
may main, go-to programming language for almost everything.</p>
<p>Ruby’s syntax decisions make so much sense than most other languages. Although,
it’s often argued against making programming languages like natural languages,
Ruby programs flow like natural English.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>..</span><span>10</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>number</span><span>|</span>
  <span>print</span> <span>number</span> <span>*</span> <span>number</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Ruby is also very well suited to be a tool for teaching programming as well as
a very good pseudo-code language. I know Python has the lead in that role,
however; I do not think Python syntax would make much sense to beginners; it
would just raise so many unnecessary questions. Ruby on the other hand, does
not have that problem. It has other kinds of problems.</p>
<p>Although I have wanted to write about this for sometime, the main motivation
behind writing this post, finally, is the latest Ruby 3.0 release which was on
the 25th December, 2020. This release is considered the most important release
of Ruby so far and it’s been looked forward to for a long time. However, to me,
it is the most disappointing.</p>
<p>Well, my biggest pet peeve with Ruby is that it is bloated and is getting even
more bloated with every release by the addition of useless functions and
operators to match Rails' ActiveSupport utilities ¯\_( ͠° ͟ʖ ͠°)_/¯.</p>
<p>The straw that broke the camel’s back was when types were introduced in the 3.0
release. This feature is the one I personally was most looking forward to.
Adding static type analysis to the language is a great step to help find and
mitigate type related errors in Ruby programs.</p>
<p>However, unlike <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.declarations.php" target="blank">PHP</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" target="blank">Python</a>
(Ruby’s most famous contenders) where types are built into the language
directly via type annotations, types in Ruby were added in the form of a new
language called <code>RBS</code>, meaning; one would have to maintain separate <code>.rbs</code>
files for type definitions. And now instead of writing the structure of a
program once, it has to be written twice!</p>
<p>Here’s a small example of how it looks like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span># messenger.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Messenger</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>medium</span><span>)</span>
    <span>@medium</span> <span>=</span> <span>medium</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>deliver</span><span>(</span><span>msg</span><span>)</span>
    <span>"You have a new message: "</span> <span>+</span> <span>msg</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span># messenger.rbs</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Messenger</span>
  <span>@medium</span><span>:</span> <span>Symbol</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>Symbol</span> <span>medium</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>void</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>deliver</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>String</span> <span>msg</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Maintaining the same structure twice is not an easy task in large software
specially that static analysis is not enforced nor required by the language;
thus, making writing types an annoying afterthought. The issue is, I don’t see
why this is the chosen solution except that maybe to avoid rewriting Rails and
instead, add new files for type definitions.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25535455" target="blank">Some
have already voiced their opinions on this matter</a>, however; I find it weird
that the Ruby community is not talking about this.</p>
<p>I know that no language is perfect and that each language has its use cases,
however; I see that Ruby is tiptoeing around Rails; thus, it is cornered in the
Rails web development area.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: here are parts of a comment I made replying to the backward
compatibility point and other points made:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I see the backward compatibility point of view and it’s valid and actually an
easy solution now. But my concern is maintaining software on the long run and
having to keep track of two points of truth.
</p><p>

And the talk about using IDEs
doesn’t make sense to me. I don’t need to use a specific tool to use the
language.
</p><p>

I write C more than Ruby nowadays and I use header files but in this case, this
is the best we’ve got, otherwise let’s use Go or Rust or whatever newer xD.
</p><p>

My point in the end is that Ruby deserves better tooling and more sane
choices.</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to end this with a quote by /u/mashatg on Reddit:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It is not only about this particular decision but disconcerted development
and language’s direction in general. Incapability to learn from past mistakes
and get inspired from more successful.
</p><p>

It is so sad to watch how an original and elegant design with lot of
progressive ideas got butchered and ended up in current diffuse mess. It does
not look like an attitude to fight back declining relevance. It looks like
towel thrown into a ring and waiting referee to notice.</p></div>

B.1.1.7 was <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4944"><span>first identified</span></a> in the UK in September and has recently accounted for more than half of new cases in the country.

Both show signs of being significantly more transmissible than non-variant Covid-19, and B.1.1.7 has already been identified in <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/02/new-covid-strain-b-117-explained/4112125001/"><span>dozens of countries</span></a> around the world, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgz4z7/what-is-new-covid-strain-colorado-california"><span>including the U.S.</span></a> While scientists are relatively certain neither is more deadly, higher transmissibility could spell big trouble.</p>

<p>This week, The Factual looked at 24 articles from 21 sources to clarify just how potentially dangerous these new Covid variants are.</p>

<h4><strong>What We Think We Know</strong></h4>
<p>The importance of clarity and consistency in messaging was made clear early on in the pandemic, and many articles about these new variants seem to be forthright about the details of these new strains without engaging in fear-mongering or clickbait headlines. Here’s what we know reasonably well.</p>
<p><strong>Transmissibility: </strong>Both strains seem to demonstrate a greater level of transmissibility, meaning they spread easier from person to person. While the science is still being checked and triple-checked, the B.1.1.7 variant seems to be as much as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/health/coronavirus-uk-variant.html"><span>70% more transmissible</span></a> than the non-variant Covid-19. Less is known about B.1.351, but it seems<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2020/12/24/heres-where-3-new-strains-of-covid-19-have-traveled-so-far/?sh=368ac3f75139"><span> at least as dangerous</span></a> as B.1.1.7.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>This increased transmissibility is a result of the routine genetic mutation that viruses (and, indeed, all lifeforms) undergo during replication or reproduction. For both strains, mutations to the spike protein — the protein that allows the virus to attach to uninfected cells — seem to make the virus <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/a-new-strain-of-coronavirus-what-you-should-know"><span>better at infecting</span></a> human cells. Additionally, early evidence also seems to suggest that the new variants result in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-covid-19-strains-what-scientists-know-about-coronavirus-variants-11609466017"><span>higher viral loads</span></a>, meaning infected individuals are carrying more of the virus.&nbsp;</p></div>

<p><strong>Deadliness: </strong>A clear further risk with new mutations of a virus is that they could become more deadly for those who are infected. Thankfully, for these new Covid-19 variants the increase in transmissibility <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/need-to-know-coronavirus-variant"><span>does not appear</span></a> to be accompanied by an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/14/how-a-new-covid-strain-may-have-spread-virus-in-south-of-england"><span>increase in the severity</span></a> of the disease.</p>
<p>However, the virus itself doesn’t need to cause more severe effects to still result in an <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/need-to-know-coronavirus-variant"><span>increase in deaths</span></a>. For example, if the virus is much more transmissible, that can result in an exponential rise in cases and an inability to provide life-saving care to the cases that are severe. With hospitals around the U.S. already reaching maximum capacity, and non-Covid patients being <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-29/l-a-county-hospitals-at-the-breaking-point-turn-away-ambulances"><span>turned away</span></a>, an exponential increase in cases could very well lead to more Covid-related and non-Covid-related deaths.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation: </strong>Scientists are very clear that the nature of the threat from the virus <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/first-us-case-of-uk-sars-cov-2-variant-detected-68312"><span>has not fundamentally changed</span></a> in terms of how the virus spreads and what we can do to stop its spread. The virus is still a respiratory illness that spreads through the air and close contact with other people. This means that the mitigation strategies already in place still apply and, if anything, are more important than ever.</p>
<p>Countries are responding by enacting more stringent applications of measures that were largely already in place. In London and the southeastern UK, where B.1.1.7 really came to the fore, a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4944"><span>stringent lockdown</span></a> has been enacted to halt the spread of the virus, reversing a decision to loosen restrictions for the holidays. South Africa has enacted <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/south-africa-coronavirus-surge/2020/12/28/b4c8e17a-492c-11eb-97b6-4eb9f72ff46b_story.html"><span>strong measures</span></a> as well, including banning public gatherings and the sale of alcohol and making mask wearing in public mandatory. Abroad, many countries have halted flights from the UK and South Africa, reflecting that the danger for contagion is just too great.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Testing: </strong>A plausible risk is that the virus might mutate in such a way that leads positive cases to avoid identification, thereby necessitating new tests. Luckily, the mutations that the virus underwent <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4944"><span>did not interfere</span></a> with our ability to identify positive cases with current testing technology. Though, for example, the virus did modify the spike protein that current tests look for—also known as the S gene—tests <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206522/coronavirus-test-variant-contagious-uk-gene"><span>look for a number of signals</span></a>, not just one. Scientists are now working to estimate the prevalence of B.1.1.7&nbsp; based on the number of positive tests without the S gene, cases known as S-gene dropouts.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p><strong>Vaccines: </strong>Perhaps the biggest question on everyone’s minds is whether the stream of newly-approved vaccines will retain effecitveness against these new variants. While testing is still underway, there is <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/02/new-covid-strain-b-117-explained/4112125001/"><span>no evidence</span></a> to suggest that the vaccines will see any significant change in efficacy. Mutations are typically subtle and are unlikely to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-covid-19-strains-what-scientists-know-about-coronavirus-variants-11609466017"><span>drastically alter</span></a> the biology of the virus in a short period of time, and the vaccines are designed to attack the virus from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/14/how-a-new-covid-strain-may-have-spread-virus-in-south-of-england"><span>several angles</span></a>, meaning that the “broad immune response…that targets several areas of the spike protein” will continue to work.&nbsp;</p></div>
<h4>The Big "Ifs"</h4>
<p>Much of what we know about the variants, beyond the likely increase in transmissibility, is none too alarming on the surface. However, there are some factors that we aren’t totally sure of just yet that could create big problems.</p>
<p><strong>Spread:</strong> These new variants show yet another way pandemic response has fallen short. Understanding the genetic variations in the virus requires routine genetic sequencing to identify new strains, but very few countries have been investing the resources to do so. While the UK invested early on to sequence cases to track the genetic variations, a CDC strain surveillance team in the U.S. was set up <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/31/with-limited-surveillance-of-covid-19-variant-its-deja-vu-all-over-again/"><span>only in November</span></a>, and the CDC had only sequenced 51,000 samples by the end of 2020, out of nearly 20 million cases. This not only means that we have no idea how widespread the B.1.1.7 variant is in the U.S., it means that we may have our own distinct variants <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160743/us-already-covid-variant-wouldnt-know?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=EB_TNR&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1608662430"><span>without even knowing</span></a>.</p>
<p>From the paltry amount of genetic sequencing that we do undertake in the U.S., we know for sure that B.1.1.7 is in California, Florida, and Colorado, but the circumstances of those cases is worrying. All three instances involve <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/02/new-covid-strain-b-117-explained/4112125001/"><span>no significant travel history</span></a>, meaning that the variant is already in the U.S. and spreading via community transmission. The optimistic interpretation of this is that there may be a few, isolated pockets of this variant in the U.S. The pessimistic view, however, is that the U.S. is on the cusp, and well past the point of return, of a fast-moving outbreak that will dwarf what we’ve seen so far, absent strong response measures. The UK saw the B.1.1.7 variant appear in September but account for more than <a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/health/new-covid-strain-in-us/"><span>60% of cases</span></a> in London just months later, accompanied by the worst outbreak yet. The same could be underway in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Susceptibility: </strong>One of the reprieves of Covid-19 has been that children are relatively less susceptible to infection. This has enabled some schooling to proceed under modified protocols, even while workplaces have been shut and public gatherings disbanded. However, the emergence of the new variants has corresponded with increases in rates of infection and severe cases among <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4944"><span>children and young adults</span></a>. While some of this can likely be explained by schools remaining open and young people being likely to disregard social distancing guidance, for example, this doesn’t seem to be the whole story. Scientific testing continues, but many worry that the B.1.1.7 variant can actually <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-mutant-children-infection-neil-ferguson-b1777211.html"><span>more easily infect</span></a> young people than non-variant Covid-19, which may mean some previously effective Covid mitigation strategies will need to be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/12/30/new-covid-strain-schools/"><span>reconsidered</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Exponential Risk:</strong> Some have pointed out that a significantly more transmissible virus is actually much <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/12/virus-mutation-catastrophe/617531/?utm_term=2020-12-31T18%3A13%3A39&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=edit-promo&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;utm_source=facebook"><span>more worrisome</span></a> than a virus that just leads to more severe cases. In the latter instance, the virus still only affects the same number of people, though it kills more of them, but with the former, many, many times more people <a href="https://reason.com/2020/12/28/the-more-transmissible-u-k-covid-19-variant-could-make-the-pandemic-a-lot-worse/"><span>may become infected</span></a>—and potentially die.</p>
<p>“Kucharski compares a 50 percent increase in virus lethality to a 50 percent increase in virus transmissibility. Take a virus reproduction rate of about 1.1 and an infection fatality risk of 0.8 percent and imagine 10,000 active infections—a plausible scenario for many European cities, as Kucharski notes. As things stand, with those numbers, we’d expect 129 deaths in a month. If the fatality rate increased by 50 percent, that would lead to 193 deaths. In contrast, a 50 percent increase in transmissibility would lead to a whopping 978 deaths in just one month—assuming, in both scenarios, a six-day infection-generation time.” - Zeynep Tufekci, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/12/virus-mutation-catastrophe/617531/?utm_term=2020-12-31T18%3A13%3A39&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=edit-promo&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;utm_source=facebook"><span>The Atlantic</span></a></p>
<p>But the risks don’t end there. The problem with an exponential increase in the number of cases, and indeed with the idea of letting the virus run its course through a population in the hopes of achieving herd immunity, is that this creates that many new opportunities for the virus to mutate further. This could lead to further changes in transmissibility, new variants that allow for reinfection, a more deadly combination of both transmissibility and severity, or even variants that, at some point, entirely undermine our vaccine efforts.</p>
<div><p>Any such change could have big positive or negative ramifications for the trajectory of the virus. Epidemics like H1N1 and various strains of Ebola proved to be too deadly to be truly disastrous on a global scale: they tended to kill their carriers at a rate that limits the ability of the virus to spread to new hosts. But those viruses may have been just a mutation away from a much more dangerous, if less lethal, form. Covid-19 may also be just a few mutations away from such a seismic shift, for better or for worse. <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160743/us-already-covid-variant-wouldnt-know?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=EB_TNR&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1608662430"><span>Such mutations</span></a> are a “once-in-a-million event,” but “but one-in-a-million events may become a lot more common when you have a million new cases every four days, as the U.S. now does.”</p></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two years ago, I did something that I’d never done in my career before- I left a job
(at <a href="https://nuro.ai/">Nuro</a>) only a few months after starting it. In this post, I want to explain
what happened and what I learned from the experience.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened</h2>

<h4 id="the-job-switch">The job switch</h4>

<p>Back in the spring of 2019, I decided to leave <a href="https://www.stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I’d
been a software engineer for about a year and a half. The full details are best left
to a separate post, but at a high level I just wasn’t very happy with my personal situation; the
work I was doing in compute infrastructure had the unfortunate combination of being both
overly stressful and underappreciated. At the same time, I felt like my career prospects
were limited because the upper rungs of Stripe’s engineering individual contributor (IC) ladder put
a lot of emphasis on cross-team coordination and other, managerial-like activities that I didn’t
enjoy and felt I wasn’t very good at.</p>

<p>Given how hot the job market was at the time and the number of other, seemingly more interesting
opportunities available, I figured that I had nothing to lose by interviewing elsewhere.</p>

<p>After a few weekends of furiously-paced <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/master-coding-interviews">Leetcoding</a>, I was ready.
Unlike my previous job searches, there wasn’t any particular company that I was aspiring
to get into; instead, I just went through my <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/six-years-of-emails">backlog of recruiting emails</a>
and wrote back to a bunch that looked interesting. Among the messages I responded to was one
about <a href="https://nuro.ai/">Nuro</a>, an autonomous vehicle startup that was attempting to do driverless
grocery delivery.</p>

<p>Over the following weeks, I went through the full recruitment slog, starting with lots of
recruiter phone calls, then following up with technical phone screens for a subset of
those, then doing onsite interviews for a subset of those. In the end, I got offers from seven
places, including Nuro.</p>

<p>During the process, I didn’t fall in love with any of the options. But, there
was something that made me feel more optimistic about Nuro than the other choices. Being a
hardware-oriented, robotics company, it was just really different from all of my previous employers,
and, after years of feeling stuck in my career, maybe different was good.</p>

<p>The company was super secretive about its technology; I wasn’t allowed to tour the office, for
instance, because they had hardware prototypes lying around that only employees were allowed to
see. I also wasn’t invited to ride along in their test cars, which would have been both fun and
informative. The external signs were good, though- they had raised a billion dollars from Softbank
and others, and the employee reviews on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/">Glassdoor</a> were gushing.</p>

<p>Aside from being in a somewhat different space than my previous employers, another potential
downside was the commute. Stripe and my three jobs before that were all within a 15 minute walk
of my apartment in San Francisco. Nuro’s office was 40 miles away in Mountain View, which was
more than an hour each way by train. But, I had done longer commutes earlier in my career and figured
that I could handle it.</p>

<p>In the end, I went with my impulses and signed the offer. I had my last day at Stripe, took a short
vacation, and then showed up at the Nuro office, brimming with optimism, for my first day two weeks
later.</p>

<h4 id="realizing-my-mistake">Realizing my mistake</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, that optimism lasted for a grand total of 2 days. By Wednesday of my first week,
as I was riding the train home, I realized that I had made a mistake. My colleagues were
friendly and smart, and the company was doing interesting things, but the job just felt like a
lifestyle downgrade to me.</p>

<p>At Stripe and each of my jobs before that, I had had a short commute to a beautiful office, and
got to experience the instant gratification associated with developing purely software-based
products. Now, I was stuck taking a crowded train to a dark office littered with hardware parts,
working on a product that would take many years to reach mass-market adoption due to pesky little
things like manufacturing and road safety.</p>

<p>I had left Stripe seeking an upgrade, but instead I got a downgrade. And, while minor improvements
were possible, it seemed unlikely that things would completely change for the better in the near
term.</p>

<h4 id="getting-back-on-track">Getting back on track</h4>

<p>At this point, I had three choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Quit immediately</li>
  <li>Start exploring new opportunities but don’t quit until something better is lined up</li>
  <li>Stick it out for at least a year</li>
</ol>

<p>My first instinct was to take option 1 and just go back to Stripe. When I reached out to my HR
contact, though, I found out that I’d have to go through team matching again and also get a new
offer; even though I’d left on good terms less than a month before, I couldn’t just revert back to
my previous position and pay. This was disappointing, but after giving it a little more thought,
I figured it was for the best because I had left Stripe for specific reasons; going back
to my old job wouldn’t fix those or make me feel better about them.</p>

<p>Another variant of option 1 would be to quit and take one of the other offers I had gotten
during my search. But, I had already rejected those for what I thought were good reasons,
so this didn’t feel like the best way out.</p>

<p>Option 3 was the one that would look the least bad from a resume perspective, and this seems to be
what a lot of people in tech do when they don’t like a job. But, life is short, I was really feeling
unhappy with the choice I had made, and I figured it wasn’t really fair to my colleagues at Nuro to
stick in a job that my heart wasn’t in.</p>

<p>So, in the end, I decided that option 2 was the best fit for me. I continued at Nuro and did my best
to get up-to-speed and to contribute to my team’s work, but at the same time jumped right back
into the job market. In addition to keeping things open with Stripe, I
<a href="https://yolken.net/blog/triplebyte-review">tried Triplebyte</a>, responded to more recruiter emails, and also
reached out to some former colleagues about the companies they were now at.</p>

<p>I then went through the whole recruitment process with a new set of companies. This time,
though, I was a lot pickier about where I interviewed (nothing in hardware or with long commutes!);
after a few weeks, I had four new choices including an updated offer from Stripe. After
a good amount of due diligence, significantly more than I had done in my previous search, I
decided to go to <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a>.</p>

<p>When I put in my notice at Nuro, people were surprised that I was leaving so soon, but ultimately
were understanding. I left, took a short vacation, and then started at Segment. Thankfully,
the new job was a much better fit for me, and I’m much happier now!</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>

<h4 id="do-your-due-diligence">Do your due diligence</h4>

<p>Switching jobs is a big deal, and it shouldn’t be done impulsively. Ideally, your due
diligence before signing a new offer should include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Meeting with the team you’ll be working with in a low-stress, non-interview setting</li>
  <li>Touring the office and understanding what your specific workspace will be like</li>
  <li>Trying out the commute for a few days (if it’s significantly different than your current one)</li>
  <li>Trying out any new languages/technologies that you’ll be using on the job</li>
  <li>Getting hands-on demos of the company’s products (if they’re not freely accessible to consumers
  already)</li>
  <li>Seeing a summary of the company’s income and expenses over time (if not public)</li>
</ol>

<p>Learning about these things doesn’t guarantee that you’ll be happy in your new job, but it
at least reduces the risk of any unexpected surprises after you start.</p>

<h4 id="its-ok-to-quit-after-a-few-weeks-just-dont-make-it-a-pattern">It’s ok to quit after a few weeks (just don’t make it a pattern)</h4>

<p>When I started my second job search, I was worried that the short
tenure in the job I was trying to leave would be a turn-off to perspective employers. In reality,
however, it wasn’t a big deal- people asked about it, but seemed satisfied with my 20 second
summary and then moved on to other things.</p>

<p>The sense I get is that you’re allowed to quit a new job once in your career without any
repercussions. If you do it multiple times, however, then recruiters and hiring managers might
have second thoughts about interviewing you without strong internal references or some other signal
that you’ll be a good employee.</p>

<h4 id="switch-teams-before-quitting">Switch teams before quitting</h4>

<p>As I noted in a <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/leaving-a-job">previous post</a>, switching teams is a lot easier than
switching jobs. I didn’t do this before I left Stripe because there weren’t any other teams that I
was super enthusiastic about at the time. But, in retrospect, I probably should have given this a
try before quitting.</p>

<p>Even if the new team hadn’t been a perfect fit, it would have at least bought some time and given
me some additional experience that could help in future work. This is what I did at Google
and Airbnb, and in both cases the “second team” was what really opened up new opportunities for me.</p>

		<p>
		My stack requires no maintenance, has perfect Lighthouse scores, will never have any security vulnerability, is based on open standards, is portable, has an instant dev loop, has no build step and… will outlive any other stack.
		</p>
		<p>
		It’s not LAMP, Wordpress, Rails, MEAN, Jamstack... I don’t do CSR (Client-side rendering), SSR (Server Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generation)...
		</p>
		<p>
		My stack is <b>HTML+CSS</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		And because my sources are in git, pushed to GitHub, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is my host.
		</p>
		<p>
		Of course, I’m being a bit provocative here. I should rather say that, for some specific use cases, I concluded that to get top performances and to guatantee long term support, HTML+CSS was the best choice, instead on relying on technologies currently more popular. Because I’m done rewriting my site every couple of years.
		</p>

		<h3>Why HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		It all started with <a href="https://labs.steren.fr/">a blog</a>, that I was hosting on Wordpress.com (which is "Wordpress-as-a-Service", because the last thing I want to do is administer a Wordpress installation on my own server). I <strong>paid</strong> Wordpress.com to do one job: host my blog. And one day I looked at its sources and Lighthouse scores:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-sources.png" alt="Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, showing a lot of inlined unreadable scripts">
			<figcaption>Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, what is all this?</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-lighthouse.png" alt="Lighthouse scores of my Wordpress.com blog, showing 19/100 for Performance">
			<figcaption>Lighthouse score of my blog hosted on Wordpress.com</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
		What have we done?
		</p>
		<p>
		Sure, these are the problems of one specific blogging platform. I’m pretty sure others are better, at least in terms of performance. But isn’t there something fundamentally wrong if displaying a short text with images takes seconds, loads countless render-blocking scripts, and has unreadable sources?
		</p>
		<p>
		My requirements were:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>performance</li>
			<li>simplicity</li>
			<li>long long term support</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		It was time to say goodbye to Wordpress. I didn’t need 99% of its features anyway. Other blogging platforms didn’t meet expectations either (I seriously have no idea why so many people publish on Medium… behind a login wall). I looked at static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, 11ty, but all of these require tooling installed, have a build step and will ultimately need some updates or be abandonned by their maintainer. What if we also get rid of these?
		</p>
		<p>
		The best tool is no tool, the best build step is no build step, the best update is no update. HTML gives us all that, and more.
		</p>

		</figure>

		<h3>What is the HTML+CSS stack good for?</h3>
		<p>
		Let’s first differentiate between what I call a web <em>page</em> and a web <em>app</em>: The goal of a web <em>page</em> is to serve content, on the other hand, the goal of a web <em>app</em> is to enable the user to perform interactive tasks. Of course, there are in-betweens, often in the form of content that might need customization depending on the logged in user and content that might allow some interactions.
		</p>
		<p>
		HTML+CSS fits the web <em>page</em> use case. Wow, what a revelation! It might seem obvious, but it seems we’ve all forgotten this these days. HTML+CSS does not fit the web <em>app </em>use case, or any in between.
		</p>
		<p>
		We said a web <em>page</em> serves content, but let’s dive into more concrete use cases:

		<h3>How to develop for HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		Authoring a pure HTML+CSS site can be done in any text editor, in any environment (any desktop OS, any smartphone, or even directly using GitHub’s single file editor) and previewed by simply opening the file in any browser.
		</p>
		<p>
		Keep the HTML of every page minimal and semantic. First, because there is no need for countless of &lt;div&gt;, but then because it makes sources more readable and easier to edit. See for example the <a href="https://github.com/steren/blog/blob/master/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/index.html">HTML sources of this page</a>: a total of 150 lines, 100 lines are for the content, the rest is metadata and page structure, nothing extra. 
		</p>
		<p>
		For consistency, all pages that need to share the same style can point to the same CSS file. This avoids  duplication when it comes to styling (but note that loading this file creates an extra HTTP request, which could be avoided if style was inlined).
		</p>
		<p>
		When not cluttered with unnecessary scripts, divs or classes, I have no issue writing HTML directly. Yes, the paragraph tags are a bit annoying and distracting, but proper indentation and syntax highlighting mitigate this.
		<br>
		Sometimes, for drafting long blog articles, I’m working in Google Docs, and when I’m happy, export the content to clean HTML using an add-on. Google Docs is awesome for collaboration, with powerful suggestions and commenting system. That’s ideal for the “draft” phase. 
		<br>
		Because all content is in git, final review and approval can be done via GitHub pull requests.
		</p>
		<p>
		When I publish a new page, I need to link to it manually from the index page. I’m OK with that. It’s done in one line. It also allows me to have more control over when I want the page to be “published”.
		</p>
		<p>
		I don't need to pay for custom themes, I have complete freedom in the style and layout of my site.
		I can embed anything I want without being restricted by the choice of the hosting platform: SVG images, 3D models, interactive JS experiences. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Creating a new page requires to clone an existing one.
		So... if I don’t use any templating system, how do I update my header, footer or nav? Well, simply by using the ”Replace in files” feature of any good text editor. They don’t need frequent updates anyway. The benefits of using a templating system is not worth the cost of introducing the tooling it requires.
		</p>
		
		<h3>In conclusion</h3>
		<p>
		You don’t need  Wordpress, or Hugo to put a blog online, or Angular, React or Next.js to put a web page online. Raw HTML and CSS do the job.
		</p>
		<p>
		That being said, you’ll need to pick up some tooling or framework if you want to build a web app or add more interactivity or customization to your web pages. And for that, I’m very glad to see that frameworks now seem to be prioritizing performance, notably by prioritizing serving the content first and leveraging caching whenever possible. The era of “download 5MB of JS first and then download content from a REST API” seems to be over for content web pages. (I personally think it’s still OK to do so for web apps, as the user’s intent and expectations are different).
		</p>
		<p>
		Is the “HTML+CSS only” approach a bit extreme? A bit, it’s basically saying “all software is terrible, how can I minimize my dependencies on software”. Web standards are a model of backward compatibility. I’m pretty confident that my web pages written in raw HTML+CSS will have no issue being accessed and authored 10 years from now, without me having to do anything.

Widely utilized services like Amazon API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, CloudFormation, Autoscaling, Athena and others were affected.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Our beloved products from Adobe, Roku, Spotify, and Flickr went down together with AWS. Our hearts go out to these companies and their users.</p>
<p>"So many services being impacted simultaneously may be indicative of a large software rollout, or potentially localized underlying hardware or network issues,” said Leon Kuperman, CTO and Co-Founder at CAST AI. “If it’s a software issue, it’s unusual that AWS would have chosen US-East as a canary region. US-East (Virginia) represents the largest AWS region and largest customer footprint, which would put it near last, if not last on the rollout schedule."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Public-clouds are a godsend for tech companies. Migration to cloud allows startups and enterprises to skip over unnecessary investments in on-premise data centers and focus on what matters the most: develop products that people love, scale fast, and always be accessible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, public cloud providers like AWS, Azure or Google Cloud Platform are eager to lock in companies to use their services exclusively. When you rely on one vendor, you go down when that vendor fails.</p>
<p>Today, AWS showed the true cost of putting all your eggs in one basket. It amplified the need for companies to have a multi-cloud disaster recovery and fail-over strategy. This strategy would still allow for a possibility of some cloud providers to go down, but it would also ensure that a cloud going down would not mean downtime for your users.</p>
<p>“A cloud failure should not become a disaster. Never again.” said Laurent Gil, CPO and Co-Founder at CAST AI. “You can rest easy knowing that your infrastructure is never down.”</p>
<div><p>Imagine that you show up to your office one day and your office building is gone. That’s what happens when cloud providers like AWS go down. All you are left with is the question “Why?“. With CAST AI you don’t need to wonder. By running your application on multi cloud, CAST AI automatically shifts your resources to Azure or Google Cloud when AWS has troubles.</p><p>Explore <a href="https://cast.ai/" rel="noopener">CAST AI here.</a></p></div></span>

And in November, China introduced regulations that halted what would have been <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-ma-offered-parts-ant-group-to-china-2020-12" rel="nofollow">a massive initial public offering for Ant Group</a>, Ma's fintech company.</p><p>
The new rules came weeks after Ma <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-ma-financial-regulations-ant-group-alibaba-2020-10" rel="nofollow">criticized China's financial regulatory system</a> at a conference in Shanghai. Ma reportedly dismissed the global financial regulations used by China as "an old people's club" and said that "we can't use yesterday's methods to regulate the future."</p><p>
Blair Silverberg, the CEO of the debt-financing startup Capital, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-happened-ant-group-ipo-jack-ma-alipay-2020-11" rel="nofollow">told Business Insider's Katie Canales in November</a> that the regulations were introduced "so the government can assert its supremacy over </p><keyword keytype="person" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Jack-Ma" actualkeyword="Jack Ma">Jack Ma</keyword><p>."
</p><p data-pos="12">In November, Ma was replaced as a judge on the African talent show he founded, "Africa's Business Heroes," <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/a91dfeae-da1e-4348-8212-bbfbe94d93bd" rel="nofollow">the Financial Times reported</a>. The talent show did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment, but an Alibaba representative said Ma could no longer be on the judging panel for the show's finale, which was filmed in November but has not yet been released," due to a scheduling conflict."</p><p>
"We do not have anything to add beyond that," the representative said in response to questions about Ma's whereabouts.</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><figure><div></div></figure><hr>
<p data-pos="16">Ma <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-jack-ma-stepping-down-successor-may-face-challenges-2019-9" rel="nofollow">stepped down as Alibaba's chairman</a> in 2019.</p>

Until recently, Ma was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-antitrust-jack-ma-ant-group-beijing-regulators-2020-12" rel="nofollow">China's richest man</a>, with a fortune of more than $60 billion. But Ma's net worth has <a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jack-ma-net-worth-rich-list-falls-china-alibaba-ant-2020-12-1029925654" rel="nofollow">taken a $12 billion hit</a> over the past two months as China has tightened the rules for the fintech industry. Ma is now worth $50.6 billion, making him the fourth-richest person in China, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/?sref=BLKWHazc" rel="nofollow">according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a>.
As speculation about Ma's whereabouts spread, a prediction about Ma from another billionaire Chinese businessman recirculated on social media.</p>
<p data-pos="24">In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cwXifDaCjE&amp;t=702s%3Futm_source%3DOrganic&amp;utm_medium=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=43718_YTEDGE_KA_SMT_RV_W1_TSNAP_RV_W1_TSNAP" rel="nofollow">a video interview in August 2019</a>, Guo Wengui, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/magazine/the-mystery-of-the-exiled-billionaire-whistleblower.html" rel="nofollow">who fled China as a fugitive in 2014</a> and has described himself as a whistleblower exposing corruption in the country, said Ma would likely end up in jail or dead in the next year because China wanted to "take back" Ma's lucrative Ant Group.</p>
<p data-pos="26">Last week, the Chinese government ordered Ant Group, which owns Alipay, China's largest digital-payment platform, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/28/china-orders-alibaba-founder-jack-ma-break-up-fintech-ant" rel="nofollow">to scale back its operations</a> after expressing concerns that its corporate governance was "not sound."</p><p>
A representative for Ant Group did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment for this story.</p>

<blockquote>Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I donâ€™t know which half.</blockquote>

<p>Knowing where your customers come from is one of (if not the most) important drivers for business strategy. To be a successful digital company it's paramount that you get the most bang for your buck when it comes to ad spending. However, even the most strategic businesses are relying entirely on platform level reporting to track the return of their marketing spend. While this is definitely convenient, it may often be inaccurate and lead to a glut of spending in the wrong places. This spending can ruin early level businesses, and even as your business grows, it can have a severe impact on large businesses as well.</p>


<h3>Case Study: Uber's Ad Spending.</h3>

<p>Uber <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nandoodles/status/1345774768746852353">disclosed</a> that they have been defrauded out of <strong>100 Million</strong> or <strong>2/3</strong> of their overall ad spend. Their Head of Acquisition discovered this fraud by de-activating roughly 10% of their total ad budget in 2019. To his surprise, pausing roughly <strong>15 million dollars</strong> of ad spend had <strong>zero</strong> impact on their ridership.</p>

<p>After digging into this phenomenon it became clear that their ad vendors were making up the numbers they had been reporting. For example, one ad network launched "battery saver" style apps in the Google Play Store, which gave them root access to your phone. Whenever you typed "Uber" into Google Play it fired a click event to the ad at the top of the screen to make it appear as though you clicked the advertisement which would give them attribution for the entirely unattributable action.</p>

<blockquote>Uber disclosed that they have been defrauded out of <strong>100 Million</strong> or <strong>2/3</strong> of their overall ad spend.</blockquote>

<p>Uber then continued to deactivate their advertising partners to measure impact. One by one they went through each advertising partner and, in the end, it became clear that <strong>2/3</strong> of their marketing budget was fraudulent. These relationships were terminated resulting in savings of over <strong>100 million dollars</strong> for the tech behemoth.</p>

<h3>So What Can You Do?</h3>

<p>Well it's pretty simple, just don't take their word for it. Not all advertisers are bad, but when you let them grade their own tests, don't be surprised when they all get A's.</p>

<h3>How To Collect Attribution Data Directly From Your Customers</h3>

<p>Ask them using a Zigpoll on-site attribution survey. Click the button below to preview a pre-built <a href="https://www.zigpoll.com/blog/attribution-survey" target="_blank">attribution survey</a> that you can add anywhere on your website and tailor specifically to your site's needs.</p>



<p>Once you have the poll ready to go, you just need to know when to ask your customers. This part of the funnel will vary from business to business, but here are some ideas for a few different types.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>eCommerce</strong>: Ask about attribution as part of your post purchase survey.</li>
  <li><strong>Blogs/Content</strong>: Ask about attribution when the user lands on your page for the first time.</li>
  <li><strong>Software</strong>: Ask about attribution right after a user creates an account on your platform.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Not all advertisers are bad, but when you let them grade their own tests, don't be surprised when they all get A's.</blockquote>

<p>Asking your customers directly at a key point in your conversion funnel will ensure that you know what marketing tools are the most effective as well as which ones are falling short of their promises. You can then use this data to be more strategic about your ad spending to convert more customers and grow your business.</p>

 <li>The "rocky, cigar-shaped object with a somewhat reddish hue," was called "1I/2017 U1 'Oumuamua" by <a target="_blank" href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/oumuamua/in-depth/" rel="nofollow">NASA</a>.</li>
 <li>"There was only one conceivable explanation: the object was a piece of advanced technology created by a distant alien civilization," according to publisher <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/Extraterrestrial/9780358274551" rel="nofollow">Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</a>.</li>

<p data-pos="4">An extraterrestrial object skimmed through <keyword keytype="Company" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="space" actualkeyword="space">space</keyword> close to Earth in 2017, wrote a Harvard University astronomer, Avi Loeb, in a book to be published this month. </p>
<p data-pos="6">It was the first sign of intelligent life outside Earth, according to Loeb. </p><p>
Scientists at a Hawaiian observatory saw "an object soaring through our inner solar system, moving so quickly that it could only have been from another star," according to the marketing summary for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/Extraterrestrial/9780358274551" rel="nofollow">Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</a> book, "Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth."</p><p>
The object wasn't a natural occurrence, but a bit of space junk ejected by another galaxy, according to Loeb, a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~loeb/" rel="nofollow">professor of science</a> with a doctorate in physics. 
</p><p data-pos="12">"There was only one conceivable explanation: the object was a piece of advanced technology created by a distant alien civilization," according to HMH. </p>

<p data-pos="18">But Loeb wasn't alone in his excitement about the object, which was called "1I/2017 U1 'Oumuamua" by Nasa.</p><p>
"The first confirmed object from another star to visit our solar system, this interstellar interloper appears to be a rocky, cigar-shaped object with a somewhat reddish hue," NASA said in its <a target="_blank" href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/oumuamua/in-depth/" rel="nofollow">description of the object.</a> 
"For decades we've theorized that such interstellar objects are out there, and now - for the first time - we have direct evidence they exist," said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/solar-system-s-first-interstellar-visitor-dazzles-scientists" rel="nofollow">when</a> it was originally discovered. </p>
<p data-pos="24">He added: "This history-making discovery is opening a new window to study formation of solar systems beyond our own." </p>
<p data-pos="26">In the book-jacket blurb, Anne Wojcicki, CEO and cofounder of 23andMe, wrote that Loeb's new book "convinces you that scientific curiosity is key to our future success."</p><p>
"An exciting and eloquent case that we might have seen a sign of intelligent life near Earth - and that we should search further," she wrote. </p>
<p data-pos="30">Fellow Harvard professor Eric Maskin, a Nobel laureate in Economics, added: "Is the hypothesis right? Who knows. But let's try to find out!"</p>

<p>I both love and <a href="https://twitter.com/internetofshit">hate</a> the idea of "smart" devices in my home. It's tough to balance the convenience of being able to turn lights on and off automatically, and adjust thermostats with my phone, with the risk that all of my devices are <a href="https://www.ckd3.com/blog/2019/6/6/attack-of-the-light-bulbs">doing</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-25780908">evil</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)">things</a> to my fellow Internet citizens. But, I think I've landed on a compromise that works.</p>
<p>I've had Internet-connected devices for a long time now. I've even <a href="https://www.uchobby.com/index.php/2007/10/08/arduino-beer-thermostat/">built devices</a> that can go online. At some point a year or two ago, I realized that I could <em>do better</em> than what I had. Here's a loose list of requirements I made up for my own "<abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr>" setup at home:</p>
<ul>
<li>works locally as a primary objective</li>
<li>works when my Internet connection is down or slow</li>
<li>avoids phoning home to the vendor's (or worse: a third party's) API or service</li>
<li>can be fully firewalled off from the actual Internet, ideally through a physical limitation</li>
<li>isn't locked up in a proprietary platform that will either become expensive, limited, or will cease to exist when it's no longer profitable</li>
</ul>
<p>My setup isn't perfect; it doesn't fully meet all of these criteria, but it's close, and it's been working well for me.</p>
<p>At the core of my home IoT network is a device called <a href="https://hubitat.com/">Hubitat Elevation</a>. It works as a bridge between the actual Internet, and my devices which are actually <em>incapable</em> (for the most part) of connecting to the Internet directly. My devices, which range from thermostats, to lights, to motion sensors, to switchable outlets, and more, use either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee">Zigbee</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Wave">Z-Wave</a> to communicate with each other (they form repeating mesh networks automatically) and with the hub. Again, they don't have a connection to my WiFi or my LAN, except through the hub, because they're physically incapable of connecting to my local network (they don't have ethernet ports, nor do they have WiFi radios). The hub brokers all of these connections and helps me control and automate these devices.</p>
<p>The hub—the Hubitat Elevation—is <a href="https://hubitat.com/products">fairly inexpensive</a>, and is not fully "open" (as I'd like), but has good integration abilities, is well-maintained, is <a href="https://docs.hubitat.com/index.php?title=List_of_Compatible_Devices">compatible with many devices</a> (many of them are devices compatible with the more-proprietary but similar <a href="https://www.smartthings.com/">SmartThings</a> hub), and has an active community of people answering questions, coming up with new ideas, and maintaining add-ons. These add-ons are written in Groovy, which I hadn't really used in earnest before working with the Hubitat, but you can write and modify them to suit your needs.</p>
<p>The hub itself is mostly controlled through a web UI, which I'll admit is <em>clunky</em>, or through a mobile app. The mobile app adds capabilities like geo-fencing, presence, and notifications. The hub can also be connected to other devices; I have mine connected to my Echo, for example, so I can say "Alexa turn off the kitchen lights."</p>
<p>The devices themselves are either mains-powered (such as my Hue lightbulbs, baseboard thermostats, and switching outlets), or are battery powered (such as motion sensors, door contact switches, and buttons). Many of these devices also passively measure things like local temperature, and relay this data, along with battery health to the hub.</p>
<p>I'm going to get into some examples of how I have things set up, here, though not a full getting-started tutorial, but first I wanted to mention a few things that were not immediately obvious to me, and will get you off on the right foot, if you choose to follow a similar path to mine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Third-party hub apps are a bit weird in their structure (there are usually parent and child apps), and keeping them up to date can be a pain. Luckily, <a href="https://github.com/dcmeglio/hubitat-packagemanager">Hubitat Package Manager</a> exists, and many add-ons can be maintained through this useful tool.</li>
<li>There's a built-in app called "Maker API" which provides a REST interface to your various devices, which technically goes against one of my loose requirements above, but I have it limited to the LAN, and authenticating, and this feels like a fair trade-off to me for when I want to use this kind of connection.</li>
<li>There's an app that will send measured data to <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a>, which is a timeseries database that I have running locally on my SAN (as a Docker container on my Synology DSM), and it works well as a data source for <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> (the graphs in this post come from Grafana). </li>
</ul>
<h3>Programmable Thermostats</h3>
<p>My house is heated primarily through a centralized heat pump (which also provides cooling in the summer), but many rooms have their own baseboard heaters + independent thermostats. Before automation, these thermostats were either completely manual, or had a hard-to-manage on-device scheduling function.</p>
<p>I replaced many of these thermostats with connected versions. My main heat pump's thermostat (low voltage) is the <a href="https://www.honeywellhome.com/us/en/products/air/thermostats/programmable-thermostats/t6-pro-z-wave-thermostat-th6320zw2003-u/">Honeywell T6 Pro Z-Wave</a>, and my baseboard heaters (line voltage) are now controlled with <a href="https://www.sinopetech.com/en/product/smart-thermostat-for-electric-heating-3000-w-zigbee/">Zigbee thermostats from Sinopé</a>.</p>
<p>Managing these through the web app is much better than the very limited UI available on programmable thermostats, directly. The Hubitat has a built-in app called "Thermostat Scheduler." Here's my office, for example (I don't like cold mornings (-: ):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://files.scoat.es/XFsUuc2l.png"></p>
<h3>Lighting</h3>
<p>An often-touted benefit of IoT is lighting automation, and I have several lights I control with my setup. Much of this is through cooperation with the Hue bridge, which I do still have on my network, but I could remove at some point, since the bulbs speak Zigbee. The connected lights that are not Hue bulbs are mostly controlled by Leviton Decora <a href="https://www.leviton.com/en/products/dz6hd-1bz">dimmers</a>, <a href="https://www.leviton.com/en/products/dz15s-1bz">switches</a>, and optional <a href="https://www.leviton.com/en/products/dd00r-dlz">dimmer remotes</a> for 3-way circuits. Most of this is boring/routine stuff such as "turn on the outdoor lighting switch at dusk and off at midnight," configured on the hub with the "Simple Automation Rules" app, but I have a couple more interesting applications.</p>
<h3>Countertop</h3>
<p>My kitchen counter is long down one side—a "galley" style. There's under-cabinet countertop lighting the whole length of the counter, but it's split into two separate switched/dimmed circuits of LED fixtures—one to the left of the sink and one to the right. I have these set to turn on in the morning and off at night. It's kind of annoying that there are two dimmers that work independently, though, and I find it aesthetically displeasing when half of the kitchen is lit up bright and the other half is dim.</p>
<p>Automation to the rescue, though. I found an app called <a href="https://github.com/joelwetzel/Hubitat-Switch-Bindings">Switch Bindings</a> that allows me to gang these two dimmers together. Now, when I adjust the one on the left, the dimmer on the right matches the new brightness, and vice versa. A mild convenience, but it sure is nice to be able to effectively rewire these circuits in software.</p>
<h3>Cellar</h3>
<p>I have an extensive beer cellar that I keep cool and dark most of the time. I found myself sometimes forgetting to turn off the lights next to the bottles, and—as someone who is highly sensitive to mercaptans/thiols (products of lightstuck beers, a "skunky" smell/fault)—I don't want my beer to see any more light than is necessary.</p>
<p>With my setup, I can have the outlet that my shelf lighting is plugged into turn on and off when the door is opened or closed. There's also a useful temperature sensor and moisture sensor on the floor so I can know quickly if the floor drain backs up, or if a bottle somehow breaks/leaks enough for the sensor to notice, via the notification system, and keep track of cellar temperature over time.</p>
<p><img alt="these lights turn on and off when the door is opened and closed, respectively" src="https://files.scoat.es/AiBX0vGS.png"></p>
<p>I also receive an alert on my phone when the door is opened/closed, which is increasingly useful as the kids get older.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://files.scoat.es/wf4WMVJk.png"></p>
<h3>Foyer</h3>
<p>Our house has an addition built onto the front, and there's an entrance room that is kind of separated off from the rest of the living space. The lighting in here has different needs from elsewhere because of this. Wouldn't it be nice if the lights in here could automatically turn on when they need to?</p>
<p>Thanks to Simple Automation Rules (the built-in app), and a combination of the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smart-home/smartthings/sensors/samsung-smartthings-motion-sensor-2018-gp-u999sjvlbaa/">SmartThings motion sensor</a> and the <a href="https://community.hubitat.com/t/release-darksky-net-weather-driver-no-pws-required/22699">DarkSky Device Driver</a> (which will need to be replaced at some point, but it still works for now), I can have the lights in there—in addition to being manually controllable from the switch panels—turn on when there's motion, but <em>only if</em> it's dark enough outside for this to be needed. The lights will turn themselves off when there's no more motion.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://files.scoat.es/yrVmcf3t.png"></p>
<h3>Ice Melting</h3>
<p>We have a fence gate that we keep closed most of the time so <a href="https://stanleydog.com/">Stanley</a> can safely hang out in our backyard. We need to use it occasionally, and during the winter this poses a problem because that side of the house has a bit of water runoff that is not normally a big deal, but in the winter, it sometimes gets dammed up by the surrounding snow/ice and freezes, making the gate impossible to open.</p>
<p>In past winters, I've used ice melting chemicals to help free the gate, but it's a pain to keep these on hand, and they corrode the fence posts where the powder coating has chipped off. Plus, it takes time for the melting to <em>work</em> and bags of this stuff are sometimes hard to find (cost aside).</p>
<p>This year, I invested in a <a href="https://kemf.ca/product-category/hotflake/">snow melting mat</a>. Electricity is relatively cheap here in Quebec, thanks to our extensive Hydro-Electric investment, but it's still wasteful to run this thing when it's not needed (arguably still less wasteful than bag after bag of ice melter). I'm still tweaking the settings on this one, but I have the mat turn on when the temperature drops and off when the ambient temperature is warmer. It's working great so far:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://files.scoat.es/Z2o6v4uM.png"></p>
<h3>Desk foot-warming mat</h3>
<p>My office is in the back corner of our house. The old part. I suspect it's poorly insulated, and the floor gets especially cold. I bought a warming mat on which to rest my feet (similar to <a href="https://www.cozyproducts.com/products/foot-warmer-2">this one</a>). It doesn't need to be on all of the time, but I do like to be able call for heat on demand, and have it turn itself off after a few minutes.</p>
<p>I have the mat plugged into a switchable outlet. In the hub, I have rules set up to turn this mat on when I press a <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smart-home/smartthings/buttons/samsung-smartthings-button-gp-u999sjvleaa/">button</a> on my desk. The mat turns itself off after 15 minutes, thanks to a second rule in the built-in app "Rule Machine". Warm toes!</p>
<p>When I first set this up, I found myself wondering if the mat was …</p></div></div></div>

<p>These days, in the covid world we live in we have multiple videoconferences every day, with colleagues, family, friends… The average number of people attending has grown, and when I was in a call some time ago, I wondered, what would be the “optimal” way of splitting the videconference application window among the people in the call? What would be the definition of “optimal”? And, in how many ways could the space be split?, as sometimes you might prefer, for instance, one where space is shared equally or one where the current speaker has predominance.</p>



<p>This intrigued me, and I started some research to try to find answers to these questions. I started with the assumption that the videoconference application owns a window on the screen, which is a rectangle (we will call it the bounding rectangle), and we want to divide it in \(N\) different rectangles, being \(N\) the number of people in the call. We can define different criteria for optimizing like, say, dividing equally the window area among the callers. However, for that we need to define mathematically the dividing rectangles, and here is where the first difficulty arises, as the mathematical description changes depending on how you split the window. For instance, two of the ways of dividing the bounding rectangle (let’s call that “rectangulation”) for \(N=3\) are as displayed:</p>



<div><div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alfonsobeato.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/N3.svg" alt="" width="755" height="355"><figcaption>Figure 1 – two possible ways of dividing a rectangle in three</figcaption></figure>




</div></div>



<p>Here we assign a width and a height to each rectangle. Note that optimizing means assigning values to these \(w_i\) and \(h_i\) to fulfill the optimizations criteria, which is like moving the “walls” between rectangles. The height \(h\) and width \(w\) of the bounding rectangle are considered fixed. In each rectangulation, it is possible to expose the implicit restrictions by equations that relate widths and heights of the different rectangles. For the first one in the image, the equations are:</p>



<p>$$\begin{array}{lcl}<br>w_1+w_2 &amp; = &amp; w \\<br>w_1 &amp; = &amp; w_3 \\<br>h_1+h_3 &amp; = &amp; h \\<br>h_1+h_3 &amp; = &amp; h_2 \\<br> \end{array}$$</p>



<p>For the second one:</p>



<p>$$\begin{array}{lcl}<br>w_1+w_2+w_3 &amp; = &amp; w \\<br>h_1 &amp; = &amp; h \\<br>h_1 &amp; = &amp; h_2 \\<br>h_2 &amp; = &amp; h_3<br>\end{array}$$</p>



<p>When we optimize we need to take into account these restrictions, which implies that for each rectangulation we have a different optimization problem with different solutions due to having different restrictions/equations in each case. The conclusion is that we need to solve the optimization problem for all possible rectangulations for a given \(N\), and then compare the different optimal values to select the best one. In summary, the steps we need to follow are</p>



<ol><li>Find all possible rectangulations for \(N\) callers</li><li>Decide an optimization criteria</li><li>Solve the optimization problem for all rectangulations, finding the best sizes for each way of splitting the bounding rectangle</li><li> Choose the best rectangulation by finding out which of them has the optimal solution that fulfills better the optimization criteria</li></ol>



<p>In the following sections we will go through each of these steps. I have developed some python code that implements the algorithms and that includes some unit tests that drive them and will be mentioned in different parts of the article. You can find it in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations" target="_blank">github</a>. If on an Ubuntu system, you can install dependencies and clone the repository from the command line with:</p>



<p><code>$ sudo apt install python3-pip</code><br><code>$ pip3 install numpy matplotlib scipy sympy</code><br><code>$ git clone https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations</code></p>



<p>N.B. In the mathematical expressions we use one-based indexes but, for practical reasons, the code uses zero-based indexes.</p>



<h2>Rectangulating a rectangle</h2>



<p>There is quite a bit of mathematical literature on the topic of rectangulations, motivated by applications like placing elements in integrated circuits. Depending on how you define them there can be more or less ways to “rectangulate” a rectangle. We want to take into account all possible rectangulations, but at the same time we need to be careful to avoid duplications. In our framework, a single rectangulation is one that can represent all rectangle sets that can fulfill a given set of equations as those shown at the beginning. Practically, that means that we can slide segments in the rectangulation (without changing the vertical or horizontal orientation) along the limiting segments, as that will not change the relationship that the equations describe. Each of these rectangulations is a class of equivalence of all possible rectangle sets described by a set of equations, and we need to find each of them and then find the optimal rectangles sizes for them, so we cover all possibilities. It turns out that each of these equivalence classes can be represented by what is called in the literature mosaic floorplans or diagonal rectangulations.</p>



<p>How to obtain these rectangulations? I will follow (mostly) the method explained in <span id="easy-footnote-1-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-558" title="S. Law, N. Reading, The Hopf algebra of diagonal rectangulations, Preprint, 2010. <a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.2118&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>arXiv:1011.2118</a>."><sup>1</sup></a></span>. First, we create a matrix of size \(N\)x\(N\), which conceptually splits the bounding rectangle in cells. We will call it the rectangulation matrix. We number the rectangles consecutively and put the numbers in the matrix diagonal. Then, we choose a permutation (any can do) for the numbers. This permutation determines how the rectangulation will look like. Finally, we follow the order in the permutation to create the rectangles, one by one. To build each rectangle, the rules are</p>



<ol><li> Start from the free cell as left and bottom as possible that can include the cell with the rectangle number</li><li>Do not include cells with numbers for other rectangles</li><li>Make it as big as possible, with the restriction that it must not surpass the right of the rectangle below it and it must not surpass the top of the rectangle to its left. The bottom and left walls of the bounding rectangle are considered bottom and left rectangles for rectangles touching them. </li></ol>



<p>This defines a map between permutations and diagonal rectangulations that we will call \(\rho\). Figure 2 illustrates this procedure for the rectangulation \(\rho(4,1,3,5,2)\).</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="425" height="656" src="https://www.alfonsobeato.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rectangulation.svg" alt=""><figcaption>Figure 2 – rectangulation for \(\rho(4,1,3,5,2)\)</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is implemented in the <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L48" target="_blank">do_diagonal_rectangulation()</a></code> function. There is a test to create random rectangulations that can be run with</p>



<p><code>$ ./rect_test.py TestRectangles.<a href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rect_test.py#L183" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rect_test.py#L183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">test_diagonal_rectangulation_random</a></code></p>



<p>Figure 3 shows an example of a run, with numbered rectangles. The sizes are as returned by <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L48" target="_blank">do_diagonal_rectangulation()</a></code>, so we can see that all rectangles have part of them in the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alfonsobeato.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/random_rect.svg" alt="" width="394" height="379"><figcaption>Figure 3 – rectangulation for N=10</figcaption></figure>



<p>It turns out that this map between permutations and diagonal rectangulations is surjective, so it would be interesting to filter out the permutations that produce duplicated rectangulations to reduce the number of calculations. Fortunately, it has been proved that it is possible to establish a bijection between a subset of permutations, called Baxter permutations, and diagonal rectangulations<span id="easy-footnote-2-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-558" title="E. Ackerman, G. Barequet, R. Pinter, A bijection between permutations and floorplans, and its applications, Discrete Appl.<br>Math. 154 (12) (2006) 1674–1684."><sup>2</sup></a></span>.</p>



<h3>Baxter permutations</h3>



<p>Baxter permutations can be defined by using the generalized pattern avoidance framework<span id="easy-footnote-3-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-558" title="E. Babson, E. Steingrímsson, Generalized permutation patterns and a classification of the Mahonian statistics, Sém. Lothar.<br>Combin. 44 (2000) Art. B44b, 18 pp. (electronic)."><sup>3</sup></a></span>. The way it works is that a sequence is Baxter if there is no subsequence of 4 elements that you can find in it that matches one of the generalized patterns 3-14-2 and 2-41-3. This is an interesting topic but I do not want to digress too much: I have based my implementation on the definition of section 2 of <span id="easy-footnote-4-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-558" title="N. Reading,Generic rectangulations.European J. Combin.33(2012) 610–623 <a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3093&quot;>arXiv:1105.3093</a>."><sup>4</sup></a></span>. The function <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L337" target="_blank">is_baxter_permutation()</a></code> checks whether a sequence is Baxter or not by generating all possible subsequences of 4 elements and checking if they avoid the mentioned patterns. An example using it can be run with</p>



<p><code>$ ./rect_test.py TestRectangles.<a href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rect_test.py#L234" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rect_test.py#L234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">test_baxter_permutation</a></code></p>



<p>Using Baxter permutations to filter out permutations can save lots of time for bigger \(N\). For instance, for \(N=10\), only around 10% of the permutations are Baxter. There is a closed form formula for the number of Baxter permutations as a function of \(N\)<span id="easy-footnote-5-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-558" title="F.R.K. Chung, R.L. Graham, V.E. Hoggatt Jr., M. Kleiman, The number of Baxter permutations, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 24<br>(3) (1978) 382–394."><sup>5</sup></a></span>, so we can compare easily with the total number of permutations, \(N!\).</p>



<h3>Rectangle equations</h3>



<p>Once we have a rectangulation, we need to extract the equations that define the relations between widths and heights across the rectangles. To do this, we can loop through the rectangulation matrix and detect the limits between rectangles, which define horizontal and vertical segments. When found, we will create an equation that defines that the sum of the widths/heights of the rectangles at each side of the segment must be equal. There will be also two equations for the  bounding rectangle that make the sum of width/height of rectangles at the side be equal to the total width/height. Note that these are 2 and not 4 equations, as 2 of the 4 we can extract would be linearly dependent on the full set of equations (this can be seen because if we take the equation on one side and follow the parallel segments equations while moving to the opposite side we can deduce the rectangles that touch the bounding rectangle at the opposite limit). Example of the equation sets that would be extracted are those we have already seen for the rectangulations in figure 1. In the slightly more complex case of figure 2, the equations would be</p>



<p>$$\begin{array}{lcl}<br>w_1+w_2 &amp; = &amp; w \\<br>w_2 &amp; = &amp; w_3+w_5 \\<br>w_1+w_3 &amp; = &amp; w_4 \\<br>h_1+h_4 &amp; = &amp; h \\<br>h_1 &amp; = &amp; h_2+h_3 \\<br>h_3+h_4 &amp; = &amp; h_5<br>\end{array}$$</p>



<p>The function that implements this algorithm is <code><a href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L93" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L93" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">build_rectangulation_equations()</a></code>. It returns a matrix with the equation coefficients that will be used when optimizing the rectangulations.</p>



<p>The final number of linearly independent equations we will get will be always \(N+1\). This is a corollary of Lemma 2.3 from <span id="easy-footnote-6-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-558" title="E. Ackerman, G. Barequet, R. Pinter, On the number of rectangulations of a planar point set, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 113 (6) (2006) 1072–1091."><sup>6</sup></a></span>. This lemma defines two operations, “Flip” and “Rotate”, that allow transforming any rectangulation on another one by a finite number of these operations. These operations do not modify the number of segments in the rectangulation. Therefore, we could transform any rectangulation in one having only, say, vertical segments. This rectangulation …</p></div></article></div>

                    <p>I recently installed a rocket.chat server which I covered here</p><figure><a href="https://tech.davidfield.co.uk/rocket-chat/"><div><p>Rocket Chat, yes it’s better than Teams.</p><p>There are a fair few Rocket Chat blogs published over the last few weeks. Sothis post is going to show you how to install it and some cool things you can dowith it.

While it works really well, its also very expensive (at time of writing) from the free tier to the next one up.</p><p>Turns out the free tier is really just for dev work, as soon as you start using it, it depletes very quickly.</p><p>I understand this, its a business model, and one many businesses use. However as I look to take the entire project self hosted I was interested to see what was available for performing the Zapier/IFTTT type functionality.</p><h3 id="n8n">n8n</h3><p>After a look around I setup n8n</p><figure><a href="https://n8n.io/"><div><p>n8n</p><p>n8n is an extendable workflow automation tool which enables you to connect anything to everything via its open, fair-code model.</p><p><img src="https://n8n.io/favicon.ico"><span>Blog Twitter Github LinkedIn Facebook YouTube</span></p></div><p><img src="https://n8n.io/og-image.jpg"></p></a></figure><p>The business has only been "public" since Oct 2019 and describes itself as </p><blockquote><a href="http://n8n.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">n8n</a>, a Berlin-based company that has built a “fair code” workflow automation platform to let developers quickly integrate any of the apps that they use to work together automatically — from standard third-party APIs to internal tools created by developers themselves</blockquote><p>From my perspective its a a web gui interface backed by code which takes items from X and passes them through gates to Y and displays them.</p><p>Off the bat its not as intuative as the aforementioned Zapier and IFTTT and you will need to get your hands dirty with some code. There is however good comunity support (considering this has only been around for a short time) which is google aware as well.</p><p>I was able to setup a quick and simple n8n workflow for Rocket chat with a bit of googling without reading the documentation.</p><h3 id="installation">Installation</h3><p>n8n is an npm app, and the site does show examples of both running and installing it as an npm app. However I found the quickets method of getting something up and running to see what it looked like was to use the docker container</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code># Spin up a basic container
docker run -it --rm \
--name n8n \
-p 5678:5678 \
-v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
n8nio/n8n:latest</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>This will get you what can only be classed as a dev environment, it has no credntials to login with, the webhook stuff only listens on localhost etc. The idea here is to quickly get a test environment to see if n8n is for you.</p><h3 id="proper-installation">Proper Installation</h3><p>If you'd like something a lot more stable and secure setup then head over to the n8n Docker Hub page</p><figure><a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/n8nio/n8n"><div><p>Docker Hub</p></div></a></figure><p>Where there ware plenty of options for getting n8n setup in different types of production environment.</p><p>I chose to go a little hybrid in my docker compose as at current i'm using this at home.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>nano docker-compose.yaml</code></pre>

  This is an excuse to have a blog post on the economics of Bitcoin to refer people to. <br> <b>Intended Audience:</b> Laypersons interested or confused about Bitcoin. <br> <b>Reading Time:</b> 15min
</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroStrategy">MicroStrategy</a> (MSTR) had a spare $400M of cash which it decided to shift to Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
<p>When a company has a pile of spare money it doesn’t know what to do with, it’ll normally do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase">buybacks</a> or start paying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend">dividends</a>. That gives the money back to the shareholders, and from an economic perspective the money can get better invested in other more promising companies<a href="#footnote-1-1230" id="note-1-1230" rel="footnote">1</a>. If you have a huge pile of of cash, you probably should be doing other things than leave it in a bank account to gather dust<a href="#footnote-2-1230" id="note-2-1230" rel="footnote">2</a>.</p>
<p>However, this statement from MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor exists to make it clear he’s buying into BTC for all the wrong reasons<a href="#footnote-3-1230" id="note-3-1230" rel="footnote">3</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is not a speculation, nor is it a hedge. This was a deliberate corporate strategy to adopt a bitcoin standard.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s unpack it and jump into the economics Bitcoin:</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>Or rather BTC doesn’t act as money and there’s no serious future path for BTC to become a form of money. Let’s go back to basics. There are 3 main economic problems money solves:</p>
<p><strong>1. Medium of Exchange.</strong> Before money we had to barter, which led to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_of_wants">double coincidence of wants</a> problem. When everyone accepts the same money you can buy something from someone even if they don’t like the stuff you own.</p>
<p>As a medium of exchange, BTC is not good. There are significant transaction fees and transaction waiting times built-in to BTC and these worsen the more popular BTC get.</p>
<p>You can test BTC’s usefulness as a medium of exchange for yourself right now: try to order a pizza or to buy a random item with BTC. How many additional hurdles do you have to go through? How many fewer options do you have than if you used a regular currency? How much overhead (time, fees) is there?</p>
<p><strong>2. Unit of Account.</strong> A unit of account is what you compare the value of objects against. We denominate BTC in terms of how many USD they’re worth, so BTC is not a unit of account presently. We can say it’s because of lack of adoption, but really it’s also because the market value of BTC is so volatile.</p>
<p>If I buy a $1000 table today or in 2017, it’s roughly a $1000 table. We can’t say that a 0.4BTC table was a 0.4BTC table in 2017. We’ll expand on this in the next point:</p>
<p><strong>3. Store of Value.</strong> When you create economic value, you don’t want to be forced to use up the value you created right away.</p>
<p>For instance, if I fix your washing machine and you pay me in avocados, I’d be annoyed. I’d have to consume my payment before it becomes brown, squishy and disgusting<a href="#footnote-4-1230" id="note-4-1230" rel="footnote">4</a>. Avocado fruit is not good money because avocados loses value very fast.</p>
<p>On the other hand, well-run currencies like the USD, GBP, CAD, EUR, etc. all lose their value at a <strong>low</strong> and most importantly <strong>fairly predictible</strong> rate<a href="#footnote-5-1230" id="note-5-1230" rel="footnote">5</a>. Let’s look at the chart of the USD against BTC:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?resize=660%2C173&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="173" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?w=3058&amp;ssl=1 3058w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?resize=300%2C79&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?resize=1024%2C269&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?resize=768%2C201&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?resize=1536%2C403&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?resize=2048%2C537&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?w=1320&amp;ssl=1 1320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?w=1980&amp;ssl=1 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>While the dollar loses value at a predictible rate, BTC is all over the place, which is bad.</p>
<p>One important use money is to write loan contracts. Loans are great. They let people spend now against their future potential earnings, so they can buy houses or start businesses without first saving up for a decade. Loans are good for the economy.</p>
<p>If you want to sign something that says <em>“I owe you this much for that much time”</em> then you need to be able to roughly predict the value of the debt in at the point in time where it’s due.</p>
<p>Otherwise you’ll have a hard time pricing the risk of the loan effectively. This means that you need to charge higher interests. The risk of making a loan in BTC needs to be priced into the interest of a BTC-denominated loan, which means much higher interest rates. High interests on loans are bad, because buying houses and starting businesses are good things.</p>

<p>Some people think that going back to a standard where our money was denominated by a stock of gold (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard">Gold Standard</a>) would solve economic problems. This is nonsense.</p>
<p>Having control over supply of your currency is a good thing, as long as it’s well run.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?resize=660%2C480&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="480" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?w=1056&amp;ssl=1 1056w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?resize=300%2C218&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?resize=1024%2C745&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?resize=768%2C559&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Remember that what is desirable is low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance">variance</a> in the value, not the value itself. When there are wild fluctuations in value, it’s hard for money to do its job well.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, the USD has been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money">fiat money</a> with no intrinsic value. This means we control the supply of money.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a classic poorly drawn econ101 graph:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Supply-Demand.png?resize=660%2C495&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="495" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Supply-Demand.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Supply-Demand.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Supply-Demand.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>The market price for USD is where supply meets demand. The problem with a currency based on an item whose supply is fixed is that the price will necessarily fluctuate in response to changes in demand.</p>
<p>Imagine, if you will, that a pandemic strikes and that the demand for currency takes a sharp drop. The US imports less, people don’t buy anything anymore, etc. If you can’t print money, you get deflation, which is worsens everything <a href="#footnote-6-1230" id="note-6-1230" rel="footnote">6</a>. On the other hand, if you can make the <a href="https://brrr.money/">money printers go brrrr</a> you can stabilize the price:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brrrrrr-1.png?resize=660%2C242&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="242" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brrrrrr-1.png?w=928&amp;ssl=1 928w, https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brrrrrr-1.png?resize=300%2C110&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brrrrrr-1.png?resize=768%2C281&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Having your currency be based on a fixed supply isn’t just bad because in/deflation is hard to control <a href="#footnote-7-1230" id="note-7-1230" rel="footnote">7</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also a national security risk…</p>
<p><strong>The story of the guy who crashed gold prices in North Africa</strong></p>
<p>In the 1200s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansa_Musa">Mansa Munsa</a>, the emperor of the Mali, was rich and a devout Muslim and wanted everyone to know it. So he embarked on a pilgrimage to make it rain all the way to Mecca.</p>
<p>He in fact made it rain so hard he increased the overall supply of gold and unintentionally <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Mansa_Musa_I/">crashed gold prices in Cairo by 20%</a>, wreaking an economic havoc in North Africa that lasted a decade.</p>
<p>This story is fun, the larger point that having your inflation be at the mercy of foreign nations is an undesirable attribute in any currency. The US likes to call some countries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_manipulator">currency manipulators</a>, but this problem would be serious under a gold standard.</p>

<p>Since the USD is based on nothing except the US government’s word<a href="#footnote-8-1230" id="note-8-1230" rel="footnote">8</a>, how can we trust USD not to be mismanaged?</p>
<p>The answer is that you can probably trust the fed until political stooges get put in place. Currently, the US’s central bank managing the USD, the Federal Reserve (the Fed for friends &amp; family), has administrative authority. The fed can say <strong>“no”</strong> to dumb requests from the president.</p>
<p>People who have no idea what the fed does like to chant “audit the fed”, but the fed is already one of the best audited US federal entities. The transcripts of <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">all their meetings</a> are out in the open. As is their <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedsbalancesheet.htm">balance sheet</a>, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases.htm">what they plan to do and why</a>. If the US should audit anything it’s the Department of Defense which operates without <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/11/accounting-fraud-and-waste-routine-pentagon/355233/"><em>any accounting at all</em>.</a></p>
<p>It’s easy to see when a central bank will go rogue: it’s when political yes-men are elected to the board.</p>
<p>For example, before printing themselves into hyperinflation, the Venezuelan president appointed a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy-idUSKBN0UL27820160107">sociologist who publicly stated “Inflation does not exist in real life”</a> and instead is a made up capitalist lie. Note what happened mere months after his gaining control over the Venezuelan currency:</p>

<p>This is a key policy. One paper I really like, <a href="https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sargent1984.pdf">Sargent (1984) “The end of 4 big inflations”</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The essential measures that ended hyperinflation in each of Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Poland were, first, the creation of an independent central bank that was legally committed to refuse the government’s demand or additional unsecured credit and, second, a simultaneous alteration in the fiscal policy regime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In english: <em>hyperinflation stops when the central bank can say “no” to the government.”</em></p>
<p>The US Fed, like other well good central banks, is run by a <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm">bunch of nerds</a><a href="#footnote-9-1230" id="note-9-1230" rel="footnote">9</a>. When it prints money, even as aggressively as it has it does so for good reasons. You can see why they started printing on March 15th as the COVID lockdowns started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In english: <em>We’re going to keep printing and lowering rates until jobs are back and inflation is under control. If we print until the sun is blotted out, we’ll print in the shade.</em></p>

<p>Gold is a good asset for doomsday-preppers. If society crashes, gold will still have value.</p>
<p>How do we know that?</p>
<p>Gold has held value throughout multiple historic catastrophes over thousands of years. It had value before and after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse">Bronze Age Collapse</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire">Fall of the Western Roman Empire</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasions_and_conquests">Gengis Khan being Gengis Khan</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you erased humanity and started over, the new humans would still find gold to be economically valuable. When Europeans d̶i̶s̶c̶o̶v̶e̶r̶e̶d̶ c̶o̶n̶q̶u̶e̶r̶e̶d̶ g̶e̶n̶o̶c̶i̶d̶e̶d̶ went to America, they found gold to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muisca_mythology">an important item over there too</a>. This is about equivalent to finding humans on Alpha-Centauri and learning that they think gold is a good store of value as well.</p>
<p>Some people are puzzled at this: we don’t even use gold for much! But it has great properties:</p>
<p>First, gold is hard to fake and impossible to manufacture. This makes it good to ascertain payment.</p>
<p>Second, gold doesnt react to oxygen, so it doesn’t rust or tarnish. So it keeps value over time unlike most other materials.</p>
<p>Last, gold is <strong>pretty</strong>. This might sound frivolous, and you may not like it, but jewelry has actual value to humans.</p>
<p>It’s no coincidence if you look at a list of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wealthiest_families">wealthiest families</a>, a large number of them trade in luxury goods.</p>
<p>To paraphrase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_the_Leisure_Class">Veblen</a> humans have a profound desire to signal social status, for the same reason peacocks have unwieldy tails. Gold is a great way to achieve that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, BTC lacks all these attributes. Its value is largely based on common perception of value. There are a few fundamental drivers of demand:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Means of Exchange:</strong> if people seriously start using BTC to buy pizzas, then this creates a real demand for the currency to accomplish the short-term exchanges. As we saw previously, I’m not personally sold on this one and it’s currently a negligible fraction of overall demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Criminal uses:</strong> Probably the largest inbuilt …</p></li></ul></div></article></div>

		<p><b>TL;DR:</b> GNNs can provide wins over simpler embedding methods, but we’re at a point where other research directions matter more
</p>
<p>I’m only lukewarm on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). There, I said it.</p>
<p>It might sound crazy GNNs are one of the hottest fields in machine learning right now. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00982.pdf">There</a> were at least <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11867.pdf">four</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08434.pdf">review</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00687.pdf">papers</a> just in the last few months. I think some progress can come of this research, but we’re also focusing on some incorrect places.</p>
<p>But first, let’s take a step back and go over the basics.</p>

<p>We say graphs are a “non-euclidean” data type, but that’s not really true. A regular graph <a href="#footnote-1-1311" id="note-1-1311" rel="footnote">1</a> is just another way to think about a particular flavor of square matrix called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix">adjacency matrix</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AdjacencyMatrices_1002.gif?resize=412%2C271&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="412" height="271" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>It’s weird, we look at run-of-the-mill matrix full of real numbers and decide to call it “non-euclidean”.</p>
<p>This is for practical reasons. Most graphs are fairly sparse, so the matrix is full of zeros. At this point, <em>where the non-zero numbers are</em> matters most, which makes the problem closer to (computationally hard) discrete math rather than (easy) continuous, gradient-friendly math.</p>
<p><strong>If you had the full matrix, life would be easy</strong></p>
<p>If we step out of the pesky realm of physics for a minute, and assume carrying the full adjacency matrix around isn’t a problem, we solve a bunch of problems.</p>
<p>First, network node embeddings <a href="#footnote-2-1311" id="note-2-1311" rel="footnote">2</a> aren’t a thing anymore. A node is a just row in the matrix, so it’s already a vector of numbers.</p>
<p>Second, all network prediction problems are solved. A powerful enough and well-tuned model <a href="#footnote-3-1311" id="note-3-1311" rel="footnote">3</a> will simply extract all information between the network and whichever target variable we’re attaching to nodes.</p>
<p><strong>NLP is also just fancy matrix compression</strong></p>
<p>Let’s take a tangent away from graphs to NLP. Most NLP we do can be <a href="https://thegradient.pub/transformers-are-graph-neural-networks/">thought of in terms of graphs</a> as we’ll see, so it’s not a big digression.</p>
<p>First, note that Ye Olde word embedding models like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec">Word2Vec</a> and <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf">GloVe</a> are <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2014/file/feab05aa91085b7a8012516bc3533958-Paper.pdf">just matrix factorization</a>.</p>
<p>The GloVe algorithm works on a variation of the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model">bag of words</a> matrix. It goes through the sentences and creates a (implicit) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-occurrence">co-occurence</a> graph where nodes are words and the edges are weighed by how often the words appear together in a sentence.</p>
<p>Glove then does matrix factorization <a href="#footnote-4-1311" id="note-4-1311" rel="footnote">4</a> on the matrix representation of that co-occurence graph, Word2Vec is mathematically equivalent<a href="#footnote-5-1311" id="note-5-1311" rel="footnote">5</a>.</p>
<p>You can read more on this in my <a href="https://www.singlelunch.com/2020/02/16/embeddings-from-the-ground-up/">post on embeddings</a> and the one (with code) on <a href="https://www.singlelunch.com/2019/01/27/word-embeddings-from-the-ground-up/">word embeddings</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Even language models are also just matrix compression</strong></p>
<p>Language models are all the rage. They dominate most of the <a href="https://nlpprogress.com/">state of the art</a> in NLP.</p>
<p>Let’s take BERT as our main example<a href="#footnote-6-1311" id="note-6-1311" rel="footnote">6</a>. BERT predicts a word given the context of the rest of the sentence:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png?resize=660%2C208&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="208" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png?resize=300%2C94&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png?resize=768%2C242&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>This grows the matrix we’re factoring from flat co-occurences on pairs of words to co-occurences conditional on the sentence’s context<a href="#footnote-7-1311" id="note-7-1311" rel="footnote">7</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png?resize=660%2C291&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="291" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png?w=999&amp;ssl=1 999w, https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png?resize=300%2C132&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png?resize=768%2C339&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>We’re growing the “ideal matrix” we’re factoring combinatorially <a href="#footnote-8-1311" id="note-8-1311" rel="footnote">8</a>. As noted by <a href="http://socsci.uci.edu/~rfutrell/papers/hahn2019estimating.pdf">Hanh &amp; Futrell</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] human language—and language modelling—has infinite statistical complexity but that it can be approximated well at lower levels. This observation has two implications: 1) We can obtain good results with comparatively small models; and 2) there is a lot of potential for scaling up our models. Language models tackle such a large problem space that they probably approximate a compression of the entire language in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">Kolmogorov Complexity</a> sense. It’s also possible that huge language models just <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2020/12/20/lmmem/">memorize a lot of it</a> rather than compress the information, for what it’s worth.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Can we upsample any graph like language models do?</h3>
<p>We’re already doing it.</p>
<p>Let’s call a <strong>first-order</strong> embedding of a graph a method that works by directly factoring the graph’s adjacency matrix or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix">Laplacian matrix</a>. If you embed a graph using <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=1F03130B02DC485C78BF364266B6F0CA?doi=10.1.1.19.8100&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Laplacian Eigenmaps</a> or by taking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">principal components</a> of the Laplacian, that’s first order. Similarly, GloVe is a first-order method on the graph of word co-occurences. One of my favorites first order methods for graphs is <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2019/0594.pdf">ProNE</a>, which works as well as most methods while being two orders of magnitude faster.</p>
<p>A <strong>higher-order</strong> method embeds the original matrix plus connections of neighbours-of-neighbours (2nd degree) and deeper k-step connections. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2806416.2806512">GraRep</a>, shows you can always generate higher-order representations from first order methods by augmenting the graph matrix <a href="#footnote-9-1311" id="note-9-1311" rel="footnote">9</a>.</p>
<p>Higher order method are the “upsampling” we do on graphs. GNNs that sample on large neighborhoods and random-walk based methods like node2vec are doing higher-order embeddings.</p>

<p>Most GNN papers in the last 5 years present empirical numbers that are useless for practitioners to decide on what to use.</p>
<p>As noted in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00687.pdf">OpenGraphsBenchmark</a> (OGB) paper, GNN papers do their empirical section on a handful of tiny graphs (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed) with 2000-20,000 nodes. These datasets can’t seriously differentiate between methods.</p>
<p>Recent efforts are directly fixing this, but the reasons why researchers focused on tiny, useless datasets for so long are worth discussing.</p>
<p><strong>Performance matters by task</strong></p>
<p>One fact that surprises a lot of people is that even though language models have the best performance in a lot of NLP tasks, if all you’re doing is cram sentence embeddings into a downstream model, there <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyK00v5xx">isn’t much gained</a> from language models embeddings over simple methods like summing the individual Word2Vec word embeddings <a href="#footnote-10-1311" id="note-10-1311" rel="footnote">10</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors/blob/master/examples/link%20prediction.ipynb">I find</a> that for many graphs <strong>simple first-order methods perform just as well on graph clustering and node label prediction tasks than higher-order embedding methods</strong>. In fact higher-order methods are massively computationally wasteful for these usecases <a href="#footnote-11-1311" id="note-11-1311" rel="footnote">11</a></p>
<p>Recommended first order embedding methods are ProNE and my <a href="https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors">GGVec with order=1</a> <a href="#footnote-12-1311" id="note-12-1311" rel="footnote">12</a>.</p>
<p>Higher order methods normally perform better on the link prediction tasks<a href="#footnote-13-1311" id="note-13-1311" rel="footnote">13</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the gap in link prediction performance is inexistant for artificially created graphs. This suggests higher order methods do learn some of the structure intrinsic to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.2636.pdf">real world graphs</a>.</p>
<p>For visualization, first order methods are better. Visualizations of higher order methods tend to have artifacts of their sampling. For instance, Node2Vec visualizations tend to have elongated/filament-like structures which come from the embeddings coming from long single strand random walks. See the following visualizations by <a href="http://byowen.com/">Owen Cornec</a> <a href="#footnote-14-1311" id="note-14-1311" rel="footnote">14</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png?resize=660%2C253&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="253" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png?w=994&amp;ssl=1 994w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png?resize=300%2C115&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png?resize=768%2C294&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Lastly, sometimes simple methods soundly beat higher order methods (there’s an instance of it in the OGB paper).</p>
<p>The problem here is that <strong>we don’t know when any method is better than another</strong> and <strong>we definitely don’t know the reason</strong>.</p>
<p>There’s definitely a reason different graph types respond better/worse to being represented by various methods. This is currently an open question.</p>
<p>A big part of why is that the research space is inundated under useless new algorithms because…</p>

<p>Here’s the cynic’s view of how machine learning papers are made:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take an existing algorithm</li>
<li>Add some new layer/hyperparameter, make a cute mathematical story for why it matters</li>
<li>Gridsearch your hyperparameters until you beat baselines from the original paper you aped</li>
<li>Absolutely don’t gridsearch stuff you’re comparing against in your results section</li>
<li>Make a cute ACRONYM for your new method, put impossible to use python 2 code on github <a href="#footnote-15-1311" id="note-15-1311" rel="footnote">15</a> and bask in the citations</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03341.pdf">not</a> the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kee4ch3miVA">only one</a> with these views on the state reproducible research. At least it’s gotten slightly better in the last 2 years.</p>
<h3>Sidebar: I hate Node2Vec</h3>
<p>A side project of mine is a <a href="https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors">node embedding library</a> and the most popular method in it is by far Node2Vec. Don’t use Node2Vec.</p>
<p><a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/pubs/node2vec-kdd16.pdf">Node2Vec</a> with <code>p=1; q=1</code> is the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6652.pdf">Deepwalk</a> algorithm. Deepwalk is an actual innovation.</p>
<p>The Node2Vec authors closely followed the steps 1-5 including bonus points on step 5 by getting word2vec name recognition.</p>
<p>This is not academic fraud — the hyperparameters <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11726.pdf">do help a tiny bit</a> if you gridsearch really hard. But it’s the presentable-to-your-parents sister of where you make the ML community worse off to progress your academic career. And certainly Node2Vec doesn’t deserve 7500 citations.</p>

<p>We’ve known how to train neural networks for well over 40 years. Yet they only exploded in popularity with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet">AlexNet</a> in 2012. This is because implementations and hardware came to a point where deep learning was <strong>practical</strong>.</p>
<p>Similarly, we’ve known about factoring word co-occurence matrices into Word embeddings for at least 20 years.</p>
<p>But word embeddings only exploded in 2013 with Word2Vec. The breakthrough here was that the minibatch-based methods let you train a Wikipedia-scale embedding model on commodity hardware<a href="#footnote-16-1311" id="note-16-1311" rel="footnote">16</a>.</p>
<p>It’s hard for methods in a field to make progress if training on a small amount of data takes days or weeks. You’re disincentivized to explore new methods. If you want progress, your stuff has to run in reasonable time on commodity hardware. Even Google’s original search algorithm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_data_centers#Original_hardware">initially ran on commodity hardware</a> <a href="#footnote-17-1311" id="note-17-1311" rel="footnote">17</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency is paramount to progress</strong></p>
<p>The reason deep learning research took off the way it did is because of improvements in <a href="https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-efficiency/">efficiency</a> as well as much better libraries and hardware support<a href="#footnote-18-1311" id="note-18-1311" rel="footnote">18</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Academic code is terrible</strong></p>
<p>Any amount of time you spend gridsearching Node2Vec on <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> is all put to better use gridsearching Deepwalk itself <a href="#footnote-19-1311" id="note-19-1311" rel="footnote">19</a>. The problem is that people don’t gridsearch over deepwalk because implementations are all terrible.</p>
<p>I wrote the <a href="https://www.singlelunch.com/2019/08/01/700x-faster-node2vec-models-fastest-random-walks-on-a-graph/">Nodevectors library</a> to have a fast deepwalk implementation because it took <strong>32 hours</strong> to embed a graph with a measly 150,000 nodes using the reference Node2Vec implementation (the same takes 3min with Nodevectors). It’s no wonder people don’t gridsearch on Deepwalk a gridsearch would take weeks with the terrible reference implementations.</p>
<p>To give an example, in the original paper of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02216.pdf">GraphSAGE</a> they their algorithm to DeepWalk with walk lengths of 5 <a href="#footnote-20-1311" id="note-20-1311" rel="footnote">20</a>. From their paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We did observe DeepWalk’s performance could improve with further training, and in some cases it could become competitive with the unsupervised GraphSAGE approaches (but not the supervised approaches) if we let it run for &gt;1000× …</p></blockquote></div></article></div>

<p>The <strong>real</strong> repository is located <a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
<p>The GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/unfrl/dug" rel="nofollow">here</a> is used for issues and stars <span aria-label="glowing star">🌟</span></p>
<p>A powerful global DNS progagation checker that can output in a variety of formats.</p>
<p>The goal of dug is to make it easy to check the propagation of DNS records. It is also capable of providing templated output that can be used in scripts for things like monitoring.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Until theres a wiki for this, the easiest way to explore dug is through the help.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dug help</code> -&gt; Get top level help explaining the different verbs</li>
<li><code>dug help run</code> or <code>dug run --help</code> -&gt; Get details about a specific verb (run, which is the default)</li>
<li><code>dug help update</code> or <code>dug update --help</code> -&gt; Get details about the update verb</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest way to get started is to just run a query against the domain whose DNS records you’re updating.
For example: <code>dug git.kaijucode.com</code>:
<a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif1.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif1.gif" alt=""></a></p>
<p>You can also do complicated things like ask for specific record types, get the output as json, and pipe it into other applications: <code>dug git.kaijucode.com -q A --output-format JSON --output-template Ipaddress,city,value,responsetime | jq</code>:
<a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif2.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif2.gif" alt=""></a></p>

<p>At the time of this post, I have lived in Alexandria City for 22 years, but I was not born here. </p>



<p>Many of the posts I’ve written here are to do with places and events related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Roads">Hampton Roads</a> area, where I grew up. <a href="https://nostalgicvirginian.com/2015/07/remembering-coliseum-mall/">One such post</a> shares my memories and experiences connected to Coliseum Mall that once was, in the City of Hampton in southern Virginia. (I spent a quite a bit of time there, as a youth.) </p>



<p>My wife, on the other hand, <em>was</em> born here. Well, not here in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia">Alexandria</a> where we currently reside, but just a couple of miles west in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annandale,_Virginia">Annandale</a>. The Strathmeade neighborhood in which she lived as a youth is located in the northwest portion of Annandale, putting it close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tysons,_Virginia">Tysons Corner area</a> in McLean / Vienna, which is home to not one but two of the most famous malls in America, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tysons_Corner_Center">Tysons Corner Center</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tysons_Galleria">Tysons Galleria</a>. In her youth, she and her crew of friends would walk a few blocks, jump on a bus (for only a quarter), and hang out at Tysons on many of those wide-open summer days. But, for any real structured shopping missions, it was another nearby mall she and her family patronized: Landmark Shopping Center.</p>

<p>Landmark Shopping Center, originally an outdoor mall located at the far western edge of Alexandria City at 5801 Duke Street, immediately off of Interstate 395 at exit 3, officially opened it doors in October of 1965 with 32 stores including anchors The Hecht Co., Sears and Roebuck, and Woodward and Lothrop. As originally opened, Landmark was a 675,000-square-foot center with a 4,000-space parking lot, the largest in the city.</p>



<p>In 1990, Landmark underwent a massive re-development during which it was converted from a single-story outdoor complex to a fully-enclosed three-story mall. </p>



<p>During the process of buying the house in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Historic_District">Old Town Alexandria</a> that my then-fiancée and I would move into in the summer of 1998, I made several trips up to the area from Charlottesville to meet with our realtor. Northern Virginia was still quite alien to me at that time, and the first notable part of Alexandria that I spotted on every trip as I exited the Interstate was Landmark Mall. </p>



<p>My wife and I did much of our shopping at Landmark for the next 15 years. (We didn’t even log into Amazon at all until 2000/01.) I remember frequenting their nicely varied food court on the third floor, Barnie’s coffee shop just inside the front entrance, a video game store where I bought more than a few titles over the years, the arcade, Waldenbooks, FYE, Sears, Macy’s, and a variety of other shops over the years. I even got my hair cut their regularly, at Bubbles. A list of all stores within the mall as it existed in October 2004 is shown below, taken from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041023162139/http://www.landmarkmall.com/html/storedirectory.asp">an archive</a> of the Landmark website.</p>

<p>When our daughter was a toddler we started taking her to <a href="https://nostalgicvirginian.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/carousel2.jpg">the open play area</a> in the center of the bottom floor. For a while there was  a train for kids that ran the perimeter of the lower floors. I recall squeezing myself on board a few times to take the ride with my daughter. There was even a traveling carnival that would take up camp in the front parking lot for a while, most summers. Those were good times and they formed very pleasant memories. </p>

<p>As the years wore on, though, the place started to dry up. Shops started closing one by one and with 2010 a few years behind us it was becoming a rather desolate space. At the time, the Howard Hughes Corporation had <a href="http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2013/jun/27/winds-change-landmark/">plans to revitalize the mall into a booming urban town</a>, but these never came to fruition. (An archived Howard Hugues <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317220321/http://thenewlandmark.com/">development page</a> gives a glimpse of what “The New Landmark” might have been.) More and more shops closed, with Macy’s shuttering on January 4, 2017 (it was later turned into a homeless shelter). Tenants were told to vacate the space by January 31 of that same year, and that was basically the end of Landmark Mall. </p>



<p>I consider the ’80s to be the golden time of my youth. I am a <em>massive</em> fan of all-things-’80s — to the extreme — as my daughter could painfully tell you. This being the case, I was quite intrigued to hear that the derelict mall was being made up as a set for a portion of the in-development movie <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman_1984">Wonder Woman 1984</a></em> (which, as a film I must say, is not exactly my cup of tea). To facilitate this, all three floors of the central core of the mall were made into a visage of what the fully-enclosed mall may have looked like in the mid-’80s, had it then existed as such (as opposed to the outdoor center designed in the ’60s that it was). I was anxious to see the result, and a few months ago a teaser trailer for the movie was released that showed just that (and the movie has since been released). It <em>is</em> pretty glorious, in that glowing, neon ’80s way. </p>

<p>A desire to share a few glimpses of Landmark Mall “from the ’80s” is what prompted me to put this post together, sharing my own memories of this place, in the doing. Landmark making its way to the silver screen, even though “in costume,” seems a nice last hoorah for this now-dead mall.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The final chapter in this story is <a href="https://alexandrialivingmagazine.com/news/the-leftover-acres-inova-alexandria-development-landmark-mall-retail-housing/">the news that landed in just the past few weeks</a>. The Landmark Mall complex will be converted to an Inova medical campus and community area. (Inova is a leading hospital network in the region.) The land will be put to good use, but after all these years, the mall is no more.</p>

      <p>Growing a newsletter is the hardest part about running a successful newsletter. No matter if you're just starting out or if your newsletter has 10k+ subscribers. It doesn't get easier, but there are many ways to that can facilitate growth.</p><p>Growth by organic ways like word of mouth is possible but only works if you already people talking about your newsletter. It isn't the most viable solution in the beginning.</p><p>To reach a wider audience you'll have to go where your audience dwells, you can start with Twitter, Reddit, Quora, &nbsp;IndieHackers, or communties on Slack and Discord. These channels have a diversified audience but is only one of the many tools a newsletter creator has in their tool chest of growth. One of the best solutions is to list your newsletter in newsletter directories. It's very similar to the classifieds we see on newspapers but focused towards newsletters.</p><h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2><p>Submitting your newsletter to directories have multi-fold benefits. Below are all of the benefits you'll receive when you submit your newsletter to a directory.</p><h3 id="seo">SEO</h3><p>SEO is one of the most sought after growth avenues for newsletters. When you submit your newsletter to a directory you'll receive SEO in the form of a backlink to your newsletter.</p><p>What does that mean? When someone searches for anything on Google or any search engine, they usually place sites with the most backlinks at the top. It takes months and years to build up sufficient backlinks to rank for popular search phrases that your newsletter wants to compete for.</p><p>SEO is the long game and submitting your newsletter to all 21+ newsletter directories gives your newsletter a backlink boost.</p><p>The main goal of a newsletter directory is to help others discover amazing newsletters to read. This usually means that they want to spread the word as far as possible. Most newsletter directories have multiple social media accounts and will usually share to their audience any new newsletter that's submitted. It's nothing crazy in terms of growth, but it does give a little boost.</p><p>Most newsletter directories provide ways for visitors to share your newsletter to their audience as well, adding to the compounding effect.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure>

Capitalize on the interest of those visitors by submitting your newsletter. The more eyes your newsletter is in front of the more you'll grow.</p><h3 id="passive-growth">Passive Growth</h3><p>One of the most interesting benefits of submitting your newsletter to a directory is the passive growth you'll receive. Do the work of submitting your newsletter once, get passive subscribe growth forever. Every weekly you'll slowly grow from this channel without needing to think twice.</p><p>Nick Frost from <a href="https://www.newsletters.co/">Newsletters.co</a> and <a href="https://inboxstash.com/">InboxStash</a> says to expect about 10-20 new subscribers the first week you submit to a newsletter directory.

<p>Before starting to form the content of this page, I decided to check how the events related to Covid-19 – lockdowns, no commutes, no travels – impacted our reading habits.</p>



<p>What I found wasn’t that surprising. Some news sites reported that <a aria-label="reading books has surged (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/15/research-reading-books-surged-lockdown-thrillers-crime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reading books has surged</a> during lockdowns others pointed out <a aria-label="completely the opposite (opens in a new tab)" href="https://theconversation.com/how-reading-habits-have-changed-during-the-covid-19-lockdown-146894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">completely the opposite</a> – that a lot of folks were unable to concentrate and their progress with books was snail-like slow.</p>



<p>Why some people were able to read more while others struggled? Well, based on my findings, I can say that people who had difficulties concentrating all had one thing in common – kids.</p>



<p>Personally, I can familiarize myself more with the second group and categorize my reading habits as spectacularly fragmented. Yes, I’m a victim of domestic dysfunction. My son learned to walk around May of 2020 and what was previously a well-arranged apartment now looks like a little arena full of scattered toys and torn apart children’s books. I’m not saying this to complain, simply to give you perspective.</p>



<p>Fortunately, somehow, I was able to read the number of books I had set as a goal at the beginning of the year – 41 books. And to be honest, I’m quite thrilled about the titles I found in 2020. If you check my <a aria-label="book summaries page (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book summaries page</a> chronologically, you’ll see that I focused more on philosophy and psychology books. And also, you’ll probably see more unfamiliar titles. Yes, I no longer romanticize popular books.</p>



<p>Let me explain…</p>



<p>My initial intention when I started this site was to pick famous books that are categorized as best-sellers. The more I consumed those “celebrities” books, though, the more I realized that they don’t deserve the attention they get. Most of the books sitting on top of the charts are usually there because the marketing around the book is pretty decent. But best-seller books doesn’t mean best-content books. The truly eye-opening books are such that aren’t widely known to the public – I learned this the hard way. That’s why I focused more on finding books that are not that famous but on the other hand, are far superior in terms of quality.</p>



<p>So, without further ado, let me show you the best books I read in 2020. Hopefully, this reading list will help you find your next addition to your library.</p>

<h4 id="3-why-the-book-is-good">Why the book is good?</h4>



<p>I was quite hesitant to start this book. After all, why would you want to read a whole book – more than 400 pages – on how to read a book? But let me tell you, I’m glad I got the book and read it. This book gives you a unique perspective on how to approach reading and learning in general. If you consider yourself a lifelong learner, if you are interested in making positive improvements in your life, you absolutely need to read this book.</p>



<h4 id="4-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>You improve as a reader when you begin to ask better questions before and while you read. Consuming content printed on paper shouldn’t be considered a one-way type of communication where the author is doing all the talking. You should ask questions all the time and find the answers inside the text by yourself.</p>

<h4 id="8-why-the-book-is-good">Why the book is good?</h4>



<p>The ability to concentrate in a world full of distractions is an important skill. Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi explains what needs to happen in your mind, and life, so you can focus better and get more done. Interestingly, the first thing someone needs to do is not related to blocking distractions. Csikszentmihalyi explains that reaching the <a href="https://durmonski.com/productivity/the-flow-state/" target="_blank" aria-label="flow state (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">flow state</a> happens when what you’re doing, the actual task, is something you truly love doing.</p>



<h4 id="9-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>Deep, wickedly intense concentration is closely related to happiness. When you love what you do, you’ll naturally enter the state of optimal experience. Therefore, your lack of focus comes from a busy life. A life where nothing is prioritized, everything is important. To focus better, and to actually feel better, find one task that is important for you.</p>

<h4 id="13-why-the-book-is-good">Why the book is good?</h4>



<p>The writing style of Ryan Holiday reminds me of Robert Greene. And I love Greene’s books. Every chapter starts with a history-related story and based on the mentioned facts, a certain conclusion is formed. The Obstacle Is the Way is worth checking if you are currently in a pit. If you feel stuck and nothing seems to matter. The proposed ideas by Holiday inside will give you a new perspective on how to deal with hardship.</p>



<h4 id="14-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>“It’s supposed to be hard.” These simple words are still stuck in my head. I remind myself of this paragraph from the book every time I encounter difficulties and my progress stalls. Life can be portrayed as a <a href="https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/overcoming-obstacles/" target="_blank" aria-label="series of obstacles (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">series of obstacles</a> where things don’t get easier, it’s quite the opposite. Things get harder as you move. But this shouldn’t feel discouraging, it should motivate us to keep moving.</p>

<p>This is not a light read. In fact, you’ll most probably walk around with a couple of dictionaries while advancing through the text. Believe me, though, every minute spent on digesting the text is worth it. Kegan presents a profound evolutionary theory that aims to explain through what stages we go as human beings. Meaning that if you’re feeling currently stuck, thanks to the text, you can spot where you are and what you need to do in order to advance in life.</p>



<h4 id="19-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>You’re constantly changing. Not only physically, but also psychologically. Robert Kegan points out that you can better understand others, and yourself, by understanding where they are (and you are) in the human evolutionary stages. Initially, we’re extremely attached to physical things – <a href="https://durmonski.com/psychology/subject-object-relationship/" target="_blank" aria-label="called subject-object relationship (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">called subject-object relationship</a>.

<p>Susan Cain takes us on a journey to “introvert land.” In Quiet, the author explains the main differences between extroverts and introverts. Why the majority is keen on listening to the loudest person in the room and what you can do, if you’re sworn loner, to express your ideas better. Essentially, this book is something like a how-to-survive-in-a-alpha-dominated-world guide for quiet people.</p>



<h4 id="24-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>People are predisposed to believe people who loudly and clearly express their ideas. What they share can be terribly wrong but the enthusiasm in their voice is a lot of times convincing enough for the general audience.</p>

<p>Talent is not god-given and your abilities are not fixed. The main goal of Carol S. Dweck in the book is to convince us that we’re all capable of success. We only need to realize that the skills you want, but don’t currently possess, are within reach if you’re willing to work for them. Mindset is full of stories of famous people who were able to become popular through hard work, not with their natural talent.</p>



<h4 id="29-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>Success is not a one-time thing. It’s a continuous process. You don’t sweat in the gym to win one gold medal. You exercise daily to become great and <em>stay </em>great. If you want to advance in a field, any field, you first need to change your perspective about what success means. It’s always a process, not a one-off thing.</p>

<p>The text is a dissertation of the famous mimetic theory by René Girard. The author, Wolfgang Palaver, explains how the theory was formed, why it’s true, and what we can do to prepare ourselves for the resulting bad consequences. Or in other words, how to mitigate the negative influence of the outside world and create our own genuine worldview.</p>



<h4 id="34-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>Our desires and ambitions are projections of the desires and the ambitions of the people that are closest to us. This is both good and bad. It’s good if what our friends and family strive for is noble. It’s bad because, usually, what others want is not what we want – and also a lot of times vain and superficial. Therefore, if we choose to follow the outside “wants”, we …</p></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><span>We’ve had an idea for years since we first had to deal with the problem everyone who works with cloud services encountered. We ended up locked into public cloud providers and moving was just too complicated. Our developers were spending a lot of time on managing the cloud infrastructure they could instead dedicate to the innovations they wanted to build.&nbsp;</span></p>
<!--more-->
<p><span><br></span><span>Then it struck us. What if you could just migrate between cloud providers in seconds while achieving the best cost and performance combination? Can you deploy your application to the cloud in one day or maybe even in a few hours? Is it even possible? In theory, yes. But will it work?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It took us some time to answer all these questions, but today we are happy to announce the first multi-cloud platform called CAST AI.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br></span><span>We built CAST AI with a few ideas in mind:&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Developers should have a tool to take advantage of everything that AWS, Azure, and other public cloud vendors offer.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Moving between cloud services should be easy so that developers can always benefit from the best combination of cost and performance.</span></li>
<li><span>Companies should never end up wasting the cloud resources they pay for again.</span></li>
<li><span>We want to save thousands of developer lifetimes and billions of company expenses on cloud computing.&nbsp;<br></span><span></span></li>

<p><span>CAST AI connects AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud into one multi-cloud platform, allowing its users to deploy, manage, and cost-optimize applications in multiple clouds simultaneously. On a single cluster.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After months of hard work, we’re finally ready to show it to you. </span><span><p><img src="https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=1200&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg" alt="cast_launch_blog.png-1" width="1200" srcset="https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=600&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg 600w, https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=1200&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg 1200w, https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=1800&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg 1800w, https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=2400&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg 2400w, https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=3000&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg 3000w, https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=3600&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg 3600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p></span></p>
<h2><span>What can you expect from CAST AI?</span></h2>
<p><strong><span>Multi-cloud capabilities</span></strong></p>
<p><span>We connect the clouds via a secure network mesh so that any cloud services of one provider are available on any other cloud. No more vendor lock-in, no more cloud waste. You can finally take advantage of everything that AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud have to offer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Autoscaling</span></strong></p>
<p><span>An autoscaler that follows policies you set for it adjusts compute resources in real time - adding workload replicas when the application needs it. You get an infrastructure that is constantly resized to fit your application’s needs.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Opinionated and production-ready</span></strong></p>
<p><span>When creating a Kubernetes cluster in CAST AI, you get a few predetermined configuration choices that take you a step closer to production. We made some choices about logging, metrics, and health checks using our many years of Kubernetes expertise. The networking configuration allows for maximum observability while maintaining excellent performance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Auto-healing&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If anything goes wrong or a component is accidentally deleted, you don’t need to worry. CAST AI will bring your cluster back to a healthy state.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Built-in observability</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Your cluster will automatically come with Prometheus for Metrics collection, ElasticSearch and Filebeat for log collection and indexing, and a single sign-on to observability frontends (Kibana for logs and Grafana for metrics).</span></p>
<p><strong><span>You can leave anytime</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Want to stop using CAST AI? No problem, you can leave anytime. Your cluster will stay operational even if you’ve been using our multi-cloud features.</span></p>
<h2><span>Early birds: everyone is welcome to join for Free&nbsp;</span></h2>

        <div>
            <p>In this series we’ll create a simulation of <strong>evolution</strong> using <strong>neural network</strong> &amp; <strong>genetic algorithm</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m going to introduce you to how a basic neural network and genetic algorithm works, then we’ll implement both in
<strong>Rust</strong> and compile our application to <strong>WebAssembly</strong> to ultimately end up with:</p>

<p>This series is intended for <strong>Rust beginners</strong> - I’m assuming you know a thing or two about Rust and I’ll introduce you
to rest of the concepts (such as neural networks) as we go.</p>
<p>No fancy mathematics or IT background is required.</p>
</td>

</div>
<p>This series will be divided into a few posts, roughly:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Introduction to the domain (what are we going to simulate, how does a neural network &amp; genetic algorithm work),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementing a neural network,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementing a genetic algorithm,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementing eyes, brain, and the simulation itself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Due diligence: I’ll do my best to explain all the concepts, but if at any point you feel lost, feel free to take a look
at this article’s last section - it contains links to external (mostly popular science) sources that might prove to be
helpful in understanding the domain.</p>
<p>Curious? Hop on the bus, Gus, and onto the first chapter: <a href="#design">Design</a>.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="design"><a href="#design">Design</a></h2>
<div>
<p>Let’s start by clearly defining our objective: what are we going to simulate, actually?</p>
<p>The overall idea is that we have a two-dimensional board representing a <strong>world</strong>:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/design-1.png" alt="design 1">
</p>
</div>
<p>This world consists of <strong>birds</strong> (hence the project’s original code name - <em>Shorelark</em>):</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/design-2.png" alt="design 2">
</p>
</div>
<p>... and <strong>foods</strong> (of an abstract kind, rich in protein &amp; fiber):</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/design-3.png" alt="design 3">
</p>
</div>
<p>Each bird has their own <strong>vision</strong>, allowing them to locate the food:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/design-4.png" alt="design 4">
</p>
</div>
<p>... and a <strong>brain</strong> that controls bird’s body (i.e. speed and rotation).</p>
<p>Our magic touch will lay in the fact that instead of <em>hard-coding</em> our birds to some specific behavior (e.g. "go to the
nearest food in your eyesight"), we’ll take a more intriguing route:</p>
<p>We’ll make our birds able to <strong>learn</strong> and <strong>evolve</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="brain"><a href="#brain">Brain</a></h2>
<div>
<p>If you squint your eyes hard enough, you’ll see that a brain is nothing but a <strong>function</strong> of some inputs to some outputs,
e.g.:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/brain-1.png" alt="brain 1">
</p>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>You’re a precious mathematical formula, remember that.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Since our birds will have only one sensory input, their brains can be then approximated as:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/brain-2.png" alt="brain 2">
</p>
</div>
<p>Mathematically, we can represent this function’s input (i.e. biological <em>eye</em>) as a list of numbers, with each number
(i.e. biological <em>photoreceptor</em>) describing <em>how close</em> the nearest object (i.e. food) is:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/brain-3.png" alt="brain 3">
</p>
</div>
<p><em>(<code>0.0</code> - no object in sight, <code>1.0</code> - object right in front of us.)</em></p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Our birds won’t see color, but that’s just for simplicity - you could use e.g.
<a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">raytracing</a> to make the eyes more realistic.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>As for the output, we’ll make our function return a tuple of <code>(Δspeed, Δrotation)</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, a brain telling us <code>(0.1, 45)</code> will mean "body, please increase our speed by <code>0.1</code> units and rotate us
<code>45</code> degrees clockwise", while <code>(0.0, 0)</code> will mean "body, please keep our course steady".</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>It’s important that we use <em>relative</em> values (so <code>delta speed</code> and <code>delta rotation</code>), as our brain won’t be aware of its
own location &amp; rotation respective to the world - passing that information would increase our brain’s complexity for no
real benefit.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Finally, let’s address the elephant in the room: so a brain is basically <code>f(eyes)</code>, right? But how do we find out what
actually <em>follows</em> the equals sign?</p>
<p><code>f(eyes) = what?</code></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="nn-intro"><a href="#nn-intro">Neural network: Introduction</a></h2>
<div>
<p>As a fellow human, you are might be aware that brains are made of neurons connected via synapses:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-1.png" alt="nn 1">
</p>
<p>Figure 2. My attempt at drawing neurons; not to scale</p>
</div>
<p>Synapses carry electric and chemical signals between neurons, while neurons "decide" whether given signal should be
propagated further or stopped; eventually this allows for people to recognize letters, eat brussels sprouts, and write
mean comments on Twitter.</p>
<p>Due to their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neuron_model">inherent complexity</a>, biological neural networks are
not among the easiest to simulate (one could argue that neurons are thus not
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs">Web Scale</a>), which made some smart people invent a class of mathematical
structures called <strong>artificial neural networks</strong>, which allow to approximate - with a pinch of salt - brain-like behavior
using math.</p>
<p>Artificial neural networks (which I’m going to call just neural networks) are prominent at <strong>generalizing</strong> over datasets
(e.g. learning how a cat looks like), so they found their use in face recognition (e.g. for cameras), language
translation (e.g. for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Neural_Machine_Translation">GNMT</a>), and - in our case - to
steer colorful pixels for a handful of reddit karma.</p>
<p>The particular kind of network we’ll be focusing on is called <code>feedforward neural network</code> (FFNN)…​</p>

<p>... and it looks like this:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-2.png" alt="nn 2">
</p>
<p>Figure 3. Example of a multilayer perceptron (MLP), also called FFNN</p>
</div>
<p>This is a layout of an FFNN with <strong>five synapses</strong> and <strong>three neurons</strong>, all organized in <strong>two layers</strong>: the <strong>input layer</strong>
(on the left side) and the <strong>output layer</strong> (on the right side).</p>
<p>There may also exist layers in-between, in which case they are called <strong>hidden layers</strong> - they improve the network’s
ability to understand the input data (think: the bigger the brain, the "more abstraction" it might understand, to a
certain degree).</p>

<p>Contrary to biological neural networks (which piggyback on electric signals), FFNNs work by accepting some <strong>numbers</strong> at
their input and propagating (<em>feedforwarding</em>) those numbers layer-by-layer across the entire network; numbers that
appear at the last layer determine network’s answer.</p>
<p>For instance, if you fed your network with raw pixels of a picture, you might’ve got a response saying:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>0.0</code> - this picture <em>does not</em> contain an orange cat eating lasagna,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0.5</code> - this picture <em>might</em> contain an orange cat eating lasagna,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>1.0</code> - this picture <em>certainly</em> contains an orange cat eating lasagna.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>It’s also possible for a network to return <em>many</em> values (the number of output values is equal to the number of neurons
in the output layer):</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>(0.0, 0.5)</code> - this picture <em>does not</em> contain an orange cat, but <em>might</em> contain a lasagna,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>(0.5, 0.0)</code> - this picture <em>might</em> contain an orange cat, but <em>does not</em> contain a lasagna.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The meaning of input and output numbers is up to you - in this case we’ve simply imagined that there exists <em>some</em>
neural network behaving this way, but in reality it’s on you to prepare so-called <strong>training dataset</strong> ("given this
picture, you should return 1.0", "given that picture, you should return 0.0").</p>

<p>Having the general overview of FFNNs in mind, let’s now take the next major step and learn about the magic allowing for
all of this to happen.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="nn-deep-dive"><a href="#nn-deep-dive">Neural network: Deep dive</a></h2>
<div>
<p>FFNNs lean on two building blocks: <strong>neurons</strong> and <strong>synapses</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>neuron</strong> (usually represented with a circle) accepts some input values, processes them, and returns some output value;
each neuron has <em>at least</em> one input and <em>at most</em> one output:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-3.png" alt="nn 3">
</p>
<p>Figure 4. A single neuron with three synapses</p>
</div>
<p>Additionally, each neuron has a <strong>bias</strong>:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-4.png" alt="nn 4">
</p>
<p>Figure 5. A single neuron with three synapses and annotated bias value</p>
</div>
<p>Bias is like a neuron’s <code>if</code> statement - it allows for a neuron to stay inactive (return an output of zero) <em>unless</em> the
input is strong (high) enough. Formally we’d say that bias allows to regulate neuron’s <strong>activation threshold</strong>.</p>
<p>Imagine you’ve got a neuron with three inputs, with each input determining whether it sees a lasagna (<code>1.0</code>) or not
(<code>0.0</code>) - now, if you wanted to create a neuron that’s activated when it sees <em>at least two</em> lasagnas, you’d simply
create a neuron with a bias of <code>-1.0</code>; this way your neuron’s "natural" state would be <code>-1.0</code> (inactive), with one
lasagna - <code>0.0</code> (still inactive), and with two - <code>1.0</code> (active, voilà).</p>

<p>Apart from neurons, we’ve got <strong>synapses</strong> - a synapse is like a wire that connects one neuron’s output to another
neuron’s input; each synapse is of certain <strong>weight</strong>:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-5.png" alt="nn 5">
</p>
<p>Figure 6. A single neuron with three synapses with annotated weights</p>
</div>
<p>A weight is a <em>factor</em> (hence the <code>x</code> before each number, to emphasize its multiplicative nature), so a weight of:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>0.0</code> means that a synapse is effectively <em>dead</em> (it doesn’t pass any information from one neuron into the another),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0.3</code> means that if neuron A returns <code>0.7</code>, neuron B will receive <code>0.7 * 0.3 ~= 0.2</code>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>1.0</code> means that a synapse is effectively <em>passthrough</em> - if neuron A returns <code>0.7</code>, neuron B will receive
<code>0.7 * 1.0 = 0.7</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Having all this knowledge in mind, let’s go back to our network and fill-in missing weights &amp; biases with some random
numbers:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-6.png" alt="nn 6">
</p>
</div>
<p>What a beauty, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Let’s see what it thinks of, say, <code>(0.5, 0.8)</code>:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-7.png" alt="nn 7">
</p>
</div>
<p>To reiterate, we’re interested in the output value of the rightmost neuron (that’s our output layer) - since it depends
on two previous neurons (the ones from the input layer), we’re going to start with them.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on the top-left neuron first - to calculate its output, we start by computing a <strong>weighted sum</strong> of all its
inputs:</p>

<p>... then, we add the bias:</p>

<p>... and <strong>clamp</strong> this value through so-called <strong>activation function</strong>; activation function limits neuron’s output to a
predefined range, simulating the <code>if</code>-like behavior.</p>
<p>The simplest activation function is <strong>rectified linear unit</strong> (<code>ReLU</code>), which is basically
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.f32.html#method.max"><code>f32::max</code></a>:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-8.png" alt="nn 8">
</p>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Another popular activation function is <code>tanh</code> - its graph looks slightly different (like an <code>s</code>) and it’s got
<a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/rectified-linear-activation-function-for-deep-learning-neural-networks">different
properties</a>.</p>
<p>Activation function affects network’s input and output - e.g. <code>tanh</code> forces a network to work on numbers from range
<code>&lt;-1.0, 1.0&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;0.0, +inf&gt;</code>, as compared to <code>ReLU</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>As you can see, when our weighted-sum-with-a-bias is lower than zero, the neuron’s output will be <code>0.0</code> - and that’s
exactly what happens to our current output:</p>

<p>Nice; now let’s do the bottom-left one:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="text"><span></span># Weighted sum:
0.8 * 1.0 = 0.8

# Bias:
0.8 + 0.0 = 0.8

# Activation function:
max(0.8, 0.0) = 0.8</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>At this point we’ve got the input layer completed:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-9.png" alt="nn 9">
</p>
</div>
<p>... which heads us towards the last neuron:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="text"><span></span># Weighted sum:
(0.0 * 0.6) + (0.8 * 0.5) = 0.4

# Bias:
0.4 + 0.2 = 0.6

# Activation function:
max(0.6, 0.0) = 0.6</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>... and the network’s output itself:</p>

<p>Voilà - for the input of <code>(0.5, 0.8)</code>, our network responded <code>0.6</code>.</p>

January 4, 2021 | https://supernotes.app/blog/posts/embed-your-knowledge/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://supernotes.app/blog/posts/embed-your-knowledge/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><h2>Updates</h2><h3>Tuesday, 22nd December 2020</h3></p><div><div><p>Today we are releasing <a href="https://supernotes.app/changelog">Supernotes 1.7</a>, which introduces embeddable note-cards to Supernotes. Like tweets, our note-cards can be embedded anywhere on the web, from Notion documents to your personal blog. But unlike tweets, our note-cards have extended markdown support and no character limit (although we recommend keeping below 1200), giving you a lot greater flexibility. </p>
<p>It's super easy to create an embeddable note-card, just create a share code and copy the embed from within the share dropdown. Here's a quick walkthrough below:</p>
<p><img alt="How to create an embeddable share code on Supenrotes" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e0375139aef29ba1fbb28cc7b584b3958be6f2e3/c9b64/faf17916af9b689168b6a5392b6241e1/embedcodetutorial.gif"></p><h5>Open the share dropdown and then click "Create new code". Make sure 'Publicly Viewable' is turned on and then 'Generate Code'. Finally hit the 'Embed' button to copy the embed code.</h5>
<p>Here are our favourite use cases for embeddable note-cards:</p>
<h2>Reusable Checklists</h2>
<p>Embed interactive checklists; for example read the card below and check the list as you go along. You can refresh the page to return to the card to it's original state. Or if you are the author of the card, log in to Supernotes to make permanent changes!</p>

<h2>Highlight Code Snippets</h2>
<p>Make use of Supernotes' code syntax highlighting feature, and quickly share blocks of code with friends. Like this introduction to <code>if</code> statements on Python below:</p>

<h2>Interactive Study Cards</h2>
<p>Create interactive elements such as using spoilers to hide important information –&nbsp;a great revision technique. Here's a brief card on one of our favourite thinkers from the 20th century. Let's see if you can guess the hidden elements correctly!</p>

<p>Overall 2020 been a great year for us, and Connor and I are very proud of how far Supernotes has come - especially with our awesome community. Keep up to date with our development journey over on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/acnebs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@acnebs</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tobiaswhetton" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@tobiaswhetton</a>). And please share your favourite uses of embeddable note-cards with us –&nbsp;we'd love to see them! </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><p>While I had some time off over Christmas I decided it would be useful to read up on product validation. Especially after the launch of my first startup, Readercatch, which although launching quite successfully on ProductHunt failed to generate any meaningful conversion.</p><p>I created a site called validationguide.com (using <a href="http://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>) to host all this research. Upon researching the topic, I realized something, Almost all product validation methods for successful bootstrapped companies are the same.</p><p>There's the odd sneaky company that uses Ads or just launches a product without validation. But for the most part almost all validated companies do these things:</p><h3>1) Listen To People</h3><p>Whether it's selling <a href="http://justinmares.com/how-i-validated-my-idea-for-kettle-fire/">Bone Broth</a> or <a href="https://tim.blog/2011/09/24/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas/">launching the next platform for App deals</a>. <strong>Validating products requires listening to people's problems first</strong>.</p><p>In other words for your product to be validated you need to start talking to people and asking them about their problems, what's taking up their time at work, etc.</p><p>For Kettle &amp; Fire it was Justin's friends talking about how great Bone Broth was and Justin finding out that no business sold Bone Broth online. For App Sumo it was Kagan's last startup, Gambit, where he learned that startups wanted more users over more revenue.</p><h3>2) Sell Sell Sell</h3><p>Nowadays when a startup is launching you see the plain old email signup landing page. That's great if you're the next X in tech and everyone's hyping about you, but for validating your customer's needs an email sign up box sucks.</p><p>Instead try creating a fake (or real) checkout flow for the product that doesn't exist yet. Justin validated Kettle &amp; Fire by creating an Unbounce landing page with a PayPal checkout and knew he was onto something when he received $500 in orders. App Sumo validated it's business model by running Reddit Ads and selling pro Imgur accounts. Drip validated it's problem by emailing a bunch of founders asking about email marketing.</p><p>Being lean doesn't mean building the full product. In fact if you can get someone to pay you based off an idea then you're onto a real winner of a business.</p><h3>3) Find A Way To Easily Reach Customers</h3><p>So you've found a group of customers who have a problem and you want to see if your solution will solve it for them. Here's a few quick ways:</p><ol><li>Cold email/message/call your target customer (How Drip got started)</li><li>Run FB/Google/Bing/Etc Ads (How Kettle &amp; Fire got started)</li><li>Write blog content and share it online about how your product solves X and Y (How Basecamp got started)</li></ol><p><strong>Your target customer should be so relieved that your product exists that they should be willing to pay for it.</strong> Don't make the mistake of building something nice to have.</p></article></div></div></div>]]>

<p>
<b>On inventions, improvements and stagnation in the software world.</b>
</p>

<p><i>Early 2021</i></p>

<blockquote>
But 1983 - and the whole decade - came and went without the "new thing".
<br>
<i>-- Alan C. Kay in The Early History of Smalltalk</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
I freely admit it: I'm likely to be the first person to triumphantly 
yell "Exactly!" at any statement claiming that computers were
<a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/ltmag">better before</a>, and that everything is pretty much
<a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/decusab">crap today</a>. Frankly, I'm kind 
of a backwards person: at some point I started enjoying computers more 
because of their rich and interesting history, rather than the magical 
air of futuristic high-tech that first drew me to them.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, I thought I'd agree with a blog post titled 
<a href="https://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=1475">"The Great Software Stagnation"</a> - written by Jonathan Edwards, 
a former research fellow at MIT, no less!
</p>

<p>
Alas, I did not.
</p>

<p>
For those too lazy to click on links, Edwards roughly states that before 
1996, lots of amazing "software technology" appeared, such as C++, 
Windows, Unix and WWW. Then the Internet boom happened and "programmers 
could get rich quick", which effectively stopped "progress" in the field 
and replaced it with "incremental improvements" that aren't 
"fundamentally new".
</p>

<p>
The problem with this reasoning, in my opinion, is twofold: Firstly, 
1996 is far too late a date to use as a cutoff. Secondly, almost 
anything in any field at any time can, upon close examination, be 
described as derivative of something that appeared earlier. (The 
wonderfully lifelike, masterfully stylistic and cleverly shaded 
paintings in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauvet_Cave">Chauvet Cave</a> comes to mind as an example 
within art.) This historical backtracking is especially 
applicable to sufficiently complex technology - <i>but that doesn't
necessarily mean something isn't inventive in its own right</i>.
</p>

<h3>Inventions and improvements</h3>

<p>
Who invented the automobile, for example? Without doubt it's a truly 
revolutionary creation, yet it's also mostly a joining together of 
already existing concepts. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot constructed his steam 
powered "Fardier à vapeur" in 1769, but Ferdinand Verbiest is credited 
with thinking up the concept a hundred years earlier. Of course, Cugnot 
couldn't have built his vehicle without the invention and gradual 
refinement of steam power, with which experiments are recorded as early 
as during biblical times. And, besides - isn't a car really just an 
incremental improvement on the horse and carriage?
</p>

<p>
It wouldn't be controversial to say that the iPhone is a post-1996 
invention with considerable impact on a number of industries. On the 
software side of things, it introduced a new operating system with a new 
paradigm for interacting with a computational device. Of course, neither 
smartphones nor capacitive touchscreens were new in 2007 and Apple 
wasn't even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Prada">first with combining the two</a>. Thus, arguably, the iPhone was simply 
an incremental improvement on decades-old mobile phones -
and yet it was, of course, something  completely new. Anyone not
classifying it as a "radical  breakthrough" is surely rather alone in
that assessment.
</p>

<p>
Truly atomic and easily identifiable inventions are few, far between and 
often date back a very long time. They're also often discoveries as much 
as they are inventions. Some breakthroughs are old ideas that finally 
become reality thanks to other inventions. I'm pretty sure 
self-driving cars have been a childhood dream for many since at the very least 
Knight Rider in 1982 - and da Vinci's (non-working) concepts for flying 
machines from the late 1400:s have become iconic.
</p>

<h3>It's probably been done before</h3>

<p>
Edwards lists a number of pre-1996 technologies that, in the context of 
his text, can only be interpreted as what he considers to be major 
inventions or breakthroughs. On this point, I agree. I'm not writing 
this to discredit these inventions, or to belittle their inventors - I 
spend almost every day standing on the shoulders of these giants.
</p>

<p>
Most of what's mentioned in the list can however still be traced back to 
something similar that predates it. Lisp, for example, is a curiously 
elegant high level language considering it was invented in the 1950:s. 
The truth is of course that Lisp, despite featuring a lot of novel 
concepts, didn't appear in a vacuum. Its elegance derives heavily from 
mathematical notation and, later, lambda calculus. Other key concepts 
can be found in an earlier language called IPL (Garbage collection however,
is as far as I know, all Lisp).
</p>

<p>
The same can be said about Unix, which builds heavily on concepts in 
Multics, which in turn builds on earlier timesharing systems. Windows 
1.0 was pretty much crap compared to its chronological predecessor, 
Apple's Lisa OS. The story of the Lisa itself is no secret, either: 
Steve Jobs went to Xerox PARC in 1979, took a good look at the Alto and 
Smalltalk, and liked what he saw.
</p>

<p>
Xerox are often blamed for not understanding what they had and giving 
away their killer concept to Jobs, but that's not entirely true. They 
launched the Star in 1981, two years before the Lisa. It was the first 
commercial machine with a desktop metaphor. This was derived from the Smalltalk 
GUI, which was inspired by Douglas Engelbart's NLS (as featured in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">The Mother of All Demos</a>),
which was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad">Sketchpad</a>. Smalltalk as a language 
builds in part on Simula, which introduced a lot of the concepts of 
modern object oriented programming. C++ is heavily influenced by Simula and,
of course, C.
</p>

<h3>Actual origins</h3>

<p>
This is where we can start identifying some kind of chronological 
tipping point. Simula, Lisp, Sketchpad and Engelbart's NLS - together 
with Algol, Fortran, Basic, artificial intelligence, 
multitasking/timesharing, networking, full screen text editors, 
relational databases and hypertext - all appear in a seemingly golden 
era between roughly 1955 and 1969.
</p>

<p>
This was the infancy of the digital general purpose computer. The ENIAC, 
being the first (although - of course - drawing heavily on earlier 
machines and research), was constructed in 1945. A decade later, the use 
of such machines had spread to comparably wider circles, which not only 
tickled the imaginations of some very fine visionary minds but also in a 
more hands-on sense called for simpler and quicker software development 
practices.
</p>

<h3>Post-1996 examples</h3>

<p>
The Internet boom irrefutably happened some time during the middle of 
the 1990s, so I agree that its effects began to clearly 
materialize in 1996. It's true that most of the makings of current 
software technology were already in place by then, but they too build on 
earlier inventions and improvements.
</p>

<p>
From his list of "new" things, Edwards omits CSS, 
XML (both from 1996), XMLHttpRequest (introduced in 2000) and JSON 
(conceived sometime shortly thereafter). This quartet forms the basis of 
the modern web and enabled things like single page applications. Of 
course one could quite correctly argue that these are simply incremental 
improvements upon earlier concepts, but that's also true of the web 
itself: Engelbart demonstrated clickable links in 1968, laying the foundation
for several following hypertext systems.
</p>

<p>
JavaScript hardly 
appeared out of thin air, either. It was influenced by a plethora of 
other languages and the concept of embedded scripting was already widely 
spread. Microsoft's VBA, for example, appeared two years earlier.
</p>

<p>
The combination of HTML, JavaScript and the DOM can be seen as a continuation
of PostScript, a Turing complete document formatting and presentation language.
</p>

<h3>Cashing in</h3>

<p>
The notion of programming as a get rich quick scheme was surely helped by 
the dotcom bubble, but seemingly unlikely 
overnight success in computing predates the Internet boom by more than a 
decade. I suggest that it's linked to the home computer revolution rather than 
the Eternal September. Bill Gates (no introduction needed), Ken Williams 
(Sierra On-Line), John Carmack (Doom) and Gary Kildall (CP/M) are all
examples of this, but there are many more success stories from this time.
The computer game Lemmings, for example, was released in 1991 and has since
sold a whopping 20 million copies.
</p>

<p>
I also think Edwards inadvertently stumbles into the trap of survivor 
bias. Just like with early home computer programmers, most web developers 
didn't - and still don't - get rich. For every success story there's also
a massive amount of failures - some of them so spectacular they've become
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boo.com">legends in 
their own right</a>.
</p>

<h3>Trickle down inventions</h3>

<p>
Claiming that we're still using a 50 year old OS with 30 year old text 
editors to write code in 25 year old languages can be tempting - but as 
I hope I've demonstrated above, the roots of almost all of those can be 
traced even further back and Edwards' choice of baseline technologies
can just as easily be dismissed as mere incremental improvements.
</p>

<p>
The fact that a contemporary programmer can get work done on a 30 or 
even 50 year old system doesn't mean they necessarily want to: there has 
been significant progress since then, albeit in - yes - increments.
</p>

<p>
Editor-wise, a programmer of today sent back to the early 1990:s would 
probably miss things like multi-language support and integration with
version control and linters. Even simple things like columnar marking, syntax 
highlighting and multiple document interfaces weren't standard editor 
features in 1990 - though the concepts were surely invented earlier. 
Python was released in 1991, but our time travelling coder is likely to 
be rather disappointed: list comprehension, while itself nothing new, 
wasn't introduced in the language until nine years later, in 2000.
</p>

<p>
In fact, most programmers probably didn't even use a multitasking 
operating system in 1990: Some improvements trickle down slower than 
others, in part because of hardware limitations, in part because of the 
curious whims of the software market. From a vantage point at MIT, it might 
seem as if little has changed during the …</p></div></div>

<p><small><em>page updated on December 31, 2020</em></small></p>

<p>The early days of the (public) Internet felt like living in the science
fiction world of a Bruce Sterling or William Gibson, whether finally being able
to download a web browser with image support (Slipknot?) or realizing that you
were logged into a machine in Australia from the middle of farm country USA and
it was responding to your FTP commands.</p>
<p>To everyone who'd learned how to type on an old PS/1 computer running
WordPerfect for DOS—with the little plastic overlay giving you the
keyboard shortcuts for formatting hints—and for whom Alt-F3 "Reveal
Codes" made word processing make sense, HTML was the easiest thing in the world
to learn (even if the best design you could do was center things with
tables).</p>
<p>Your author remembers the first time he came across a web page which
<em>changed</em> when you reloaded it. Some university student had set up the
official homepage for a band and every new page view displayed a different
snippet of lyrics. These web pages weren't simple documents. They were
<em>programs</em>. This was science fiction. This was living in the future.</p>
<p>Then came forms and server side processing and your author graduated from
college and learned Java and scrounged together spare parts at work to build
his own Linux machine and learned that the Internet wasn't magic science
fiction. It was all programs and protocols, and the greatest magic protocol of
them all at that time was HTTP, especially when combined with the new HTML
extensions for form submissions and the Common Gateway Interface that let a web
server launch programs to process form parameters and produce a fresh batch of
HTML.</p>
<p>CGI programs could be anything. You could write them in a shell script on an
HP-UX or Irix box. You could write them in C. Netscape tried to make money
selling server software where you could write them in JavaScript (and oh how
everyone laughed).</p>
<p>Like almost everyone in the late '90s during the Internet boom, your author
learned Perl.</p>
<h2>Why Perl Won</h2>
<p>Perl was already everywhere, at least on the serious machines you wanted
connected to the Internet. (Microsoft was still struggling to understand why
you'd want to connect to the Internet. Then again, in the 2010s, Microsoft
started to wonder why you would want a computer which <em>didn't</em> behave
exactly like a tablet. Legions of gamers cringe as they consider a Halo 5 where
you must tap your TV screen to fight off the Covenant and Prometheans.) Perl
was everywhere because it was a good language for system administration,
bridging the gap between C and shell. Shell was a terrible language, mostly
because it didn't run the same way everywhere and it didn't handle things like
variables or functions very well.</p>
<p>Perl was everywhere, at least in the Unix world. It was good at manipulating
strings. Back in those days, HTTP and HTML were all stringy protocols. You get
a string, you parse it, and you emit a string. It was a mess, but it was a
simple mess and it was a small mess, so you could get away with it—more
importantly, you could get your work done before you figured out where you'd
gone wrong with string handling in C.</p>
<p>Perl was on version 5 of the language, as exemplified by the second edition
of a book called <em>Programming Perl</em>. You could walk into a room full of
techie cubicles and find that book on at least one desk, all dog-eared and full
of Post-its, because in any group of a couple of dozen
engineers/programmers/techies in those days, one of them was running a little
webserver on a Linux box under his or her desk and odds are he or she was using
Perl.</p>
<p>The code wasn't great. A lot of it was copied and pasted and modified and
downloaded and modified again from the kind of technical support forms that
StackOverflow has mostly thankfully (and almost entirely humorlessly)
supplanted.</p>
<p>But it worked.</p>
<p>Perl <em>did</em> have the advantage of momentum and ubiquity and efficacy
in those days. Then it lost. It seems competitive languages have eaten its
lunch. Why?</p>
<h2>Perl Wasn't and Isn't Perfect</h2>

<p>You can make the argument (and you're correct to do so) that people didn't
learn Perl for the sake of learning Perl. You can also make the argument that
people didn't really learn Perl at all—they learned enough to modify
programs that almost worked right to work a little bit righter. You can argue
that, but you're missing the important point: that's what people
<em>always</em> do. It looks different on the web now these days with bigger
frameworks and more choices and Google and StackOverflow replacing internet
relay chat and random web forums, but it's not materially different now than it
was then.</p>
<p>Goodness knows, Perl's core documentation is an updated version of the
venerable Camel book: thousands of pages of instruction on how the language
works and how to use it, at the fingertips of everyone who used it. If you want
a book, you can get one, but it ships with one.</p>
<p>Some people argue that learning Perl is easy, with the right training, such
as O'Reilly's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491954329/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1491954329&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=trendshare0c-20">Learning
Perl</a> or <a href="https://modernperlbooks.com/books/modern_perl_2016/">Modern Perl 4e</a>,
but that argument relies on improvements made in the 2010s, after Perl had
started to stop winning.</p>
<p>Perl as a language had its quirks and flaws. It still has some of those
flaws and it definitely has those quirks. Perl's ease of using external
binaries within programs made it great for gluing things together, but there
were multiple documented cases of security holes and unintentional bugs from
people using backticks in <a href="http://modernperlbooks.com/books/modern_perl_2014/01-perl-philosophy.html#Y29udGV4dF9waGlsb3NvcGh5">scalar
or list context</a> and not knowing the difference and exposing sensitive
information.</p>
<p>People writing code by copy and paste and modify didn't learn the nuance of
the Perl philosophy which makes context important in part because people
writing code in that fashion don't learn the philosophy of <em>any</em>
language and in part because no Perl tutorial really explained the philosophy
of the language in an accessible fashion until 2010's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0985451947?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=outspeaking-20" rel="nofollow">Modern Perl</a>.</p>
<p>Is learning Perl hard? No. Not learning it is the hard way to learn it, but
Perl is dead easy to learn just enough to be useful.</p>
<h2>Ease of Beginning is Better than Eventual Perfection</h2>
<p>The execution model of CGI programs was simple and awful in its simplicity:
the web server would launch a new separate program and provide all of the data
received by the web browser to that program. It would listen for data produced
by that program and send it to the web browser. That doesn't sound awful, but
if you're reading this, you've probably replaced a couple of smartphones with
many times more memory and processor power than the web servers back in those
days had.</p>
<p>Launching a new program for every page requested was a little bit expensive
once your site became a little bit popular.</p>
<p>Even though that model of operation is conceptually straightforward to
understand (just launch a program), configuring your web server to execute
these programs (written in any language by any user) wasn't as easy as it
sounds. If you had a good system administrator, he or she would have set up the
web server to give every user a specific directory in which to put these CGI
programs where they'd run but not expose the world to security holes. If you
had a Linux box under your desk and you were your own system administrator, you
had to learn about directory structures and permissions and paths and the
details of how your web server was compiled and configured. Again, it was
relatively straightforward, but there was a lot to learn and there were a lot
of ways things could go wrong.</p>
<p>None of this was Perl's fault. It was a consequence of the Unix model
meeting the Internet and a lot of intelligent people figuring out the simplest
way to get something working quickly without necessarily thinking about the
<em>best</em> way to build something which would have to last for 20 years and
counting. (See also DNS, SMTP, FTP, NNTP, IMAP, IMAPS, SSL, TLS, et
cetera.)</p>
<p>Web programs were easier to write in Perl than they were in C because Perl,
as a language, made them easier, but the dominant execution model of Perl
programs was slow and expensive and difficult to configure.</p>
<p>A web server is just a program, however. If you modified the program, you
could make it do anything—including connecting it with a different
programming language. In fact, you could put Perl in the web server so that you
could simplify the configuration of these programs <em>and</em> not pay the
price of loading every program anew for every request.</p>
<p>This is what mod_perl did. Of course, mod_perl was part of making the Apache
httpd web server more configurable by giving it a plugin architecture where you
could write extensions to the web server to customize every part of the web
server request and response cycle, so mod_perl became less a way to make
writing and deploying Perl programs simpler and faster and cheaper and more a
way to write your own extensions to Apache httpd in Perl instead of C (because,
again, Perl was a better language for web programming than C).</p>
<p>This was great, until it wasn't. It addressed part of the problem but it
didn't address other parts of the problem. Installing and configuring mod_perl
wasn't trivially easy. It was downright difficult in some cases. You
<em>could</em> get a speed boost from using it, by trading some memory up front
for less memory used later, but every program attached to mod_perl could
potentially access the memory space of every other program attached to
mod_perl, even if both programs belonged to <em>different</em> users.</p>
<p>mod_php solved this problem. PHP was a terrible language back then, good
mostly for making very simple templates which represented web pages. PHP's
memory model fit mod_php better, though. PHP's deployment model was a lot
simpler, too. No one wanted to write Apache httpd extensions in PHP because it
was a template language, so there was no pressure to make mod_php anything
other than a very simple template processor which happened to be easy to
deploy.</p>
<p>In fact, it was so easy to deploy that people <em>used</em> it. System
administrators set it up because it was so easy to do they couldn't
<em>not</em> do it. People …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remote work is on the rise, the economy is on a decline and businesses are re-structuring themselves around what many consider the new normal. Increasingly more organisations are opening themselves up to the possibility of working remotely beyond just the temporary measure in the fight against COVID-19. Many begin to see remote work as not only a necessary consequence, but rather as a new opportunity to diversify their workforce, increase employee productivity and cut some cost. The biggest cost saving obviously comes from office space, and not just in terms of raw square footage but also in location. When previously companies had to boast huge HQs in expensive areas, now they can spread themselves thinner across more affordable cities. Another big cost saving can come from employee salaries. A more distributed workforce and more work from home opportunities will inevitably mean a bigger talent pool competing for the same open positions, effectively giving employers a bigger choice.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to existing employees' salaries the direction taken by big tech companies couldn't be of starker contrast. Companies like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/zuckerberg-50percent-of-facebook-employees-could-be-working-remotely.html">Facebook or Twitter</a> have made it clear that employees who choose to relocate to more affordable cities can expect big cuts to their existing salary whereas companies like <a href="https://redditblog.com/2020/10/27/evolving-reddits-workforce/">Reddit announced that they won't reduce the salary of any of their 600 US workers</a> regardless of where they live.</p>
<p>These recent announcements have revived a <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/remote-employee-compensation/">long standing debate</a> around the topic of <a href="https://www.nityesh.com/equal-pay-for-equal-work-at-a-remote-company/">equal pay for equal work</a>. Before COVID-19 <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/02/28/why-we-pay-local-rates/">GitLab has already sparked a lot of controversy</a> around the concept of "cost of living" adjusted salaries. At GitLab two engineers who perform the exact same work could get vastly differently compensated based on where they live. It doesn't require a lot of imagination to understand that such policies can alienate a lot of good people and further contribute to the perception of an ever growing inequality gap. Personally I find cost of living adjusted salaries very problematic as they deflect from the real market forces which come into play. Those should be a decent minimum living wage and the forces of demand &amp; supply. If someone is a professional in a niche market, a rare specialist in a scientific field or an exceptionally sought after engineer then cost of living should have no say in determining their pay. Those so called knowledge workers are often higher in demand than there is supply. A good indicator for the scarcity of one's profession is when their employer recruits talent from all across the world and advertises unique perks such as relocation bonuses, dental care or exceptional holiday packages. These benefits would not exist if there wasn't a fierce competition for a particular skill.</p>
<p>Regardless of the real economics at play, it still comes down to a good old negotiation where each person has to stand up for their own beliefs and reach an agreement on their pay. If you find yourself in a situation where your current salary might be at risk due to recent relocation then hopefully the following write-up can help you to negotiate equal pay for equal work. It is a curated list of relevant points to formulate a strong argument why one should receive the same or perhaps an even better pay for the same work carried out from a remote position.</p>
<h2 id="same-duties-same-pay">Same duties, same pay</h2>
<p>If you're reading this blog post then you're most likely not being paid for your time or place of work. You are being paid for your knowledge, your skills, your duties, the challenges which come with your work and most importantly the responsibilities of your role. Your professionalism and your personal commitment which you bring to your every day job will not diminish when you move into a new place. Whether you work remotely or not, you will still contemplate over that tough work problem in your spare time. You will still lose sleep over that big presentation the next day. You will still stay up late to meet an important deadline by the end of the month. You do it because you take pride in your work. You do it because of a sense of personal accountability to your team. It is those qualities which have earned you the trust of your manager over the years. It is those qualities which earned you a pay rise long ago. Changing postcodes doesn't take away your accomplishments from the past. Changing postcodes shouldn't take away the things which you have already earned before.</p>
<h2 id="same-value-same-pay">Same value, same pay</h2>
<p>The value of your contributions hasn't been compromised by moving house. Customers still pay the same price for the products which you have helped to build. Sales figures didn't drop when you went remote. Why should your employer reduce your pay when they are not passing that cost saving onto their customers by cutting their own price? Based on the same principle why your employer won't reduce their prices when downsizing office, you also shouldn't accept a lower salary after moving place. The concept is the same and you shouldn't accept one principle for them, but another for yourself. As you continue to deliver the same value and quality as before, you equally deserve the same compensation in return.</p>
<h2 id="your-savings-their-savings">Your savings, their savings</h2>
<p>Let's be clear, when you transitioned from office to home it's not like you're the only one who benefited from a lower cost of living as a result. Whatever savings you might have made on your rent, your employer does now too. Every person in an office requires an extra desk. Every additional person requires a fraction more of bathroom space. More people mean bigger kitchens, bigger break out areas, more meeting rooms, larger hallways, bigger stairways and more facilities to comply with fire safety regulations. There is more pressure on lifts to avoid bottle necks during peak times. There is more building maintenance work to be done and more frequent cleaning intervals required. A bigger workforce automatically means more individual needs. Extra bicycle storage rooms, canteens, car parks, private offices, outdoor spaces, a bigger selection of refreshments and a larger variety of office perks are just a few to name. Unless your employer is prepared to share their own operational saving directly with you, why should you share your personal operational saving with them? Fundamentally their savings are theirs, and your savings are yours.</p>
<h2 id="their-profit-your-profit">Their profit, your profit</h2>
<p>Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer re-structured themselves to benefit from lower tax? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer opened up a new factory in a less regulated place? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer outsourced a call centre into a country without minimum wage? Probably not, because it was your employer and not you who took the risk. Guess what, when you are courageous enough to relocate to a different country, city or state, then any financial gains from your move are also only yours to claim. This shouldn't be a huge surprise as nothing comes without its own significant risk. Economic security, social safety nets, unemployment benefits, retirement support, access to public health services, cost of qualitative education or medical treatment are often some of the compromises which have to be taken into account. Simple things such as free playgrounds for children, access to public recreational grounds, well maintained parks, a good public transport system funded by tax or basic luxuries such as political stability or the ability to safely park a new car on a public road are many other cost calculations not to be dismissed. Of course this is not always the case, but those considerations are for you to make. Nobody else, particularly not your employer, who has a financial interest of dismissing or downplaying those issues should be making those calculations on your behalf. This is such a basic principle that it's almost offensive to suggest the opposite. Your employer should not decide what sort of lifestyle you deserve.</p>
<h2 id="higher-cost-higher-pay">Higher cost, higher pay</h2>
<p>Contrary to common belief, working from home is not cheap. First of all, working permanently from home requires an entire additional room. If your family lived in a three bedroom house before, now you need four.
Thanks to COVID-19 most will agree that working from a sofa is neither practical, nor sustainable or realistic by any means. A proper office desk and a good ergonomic chair are a necessity at the least. Those requirements alone make a legitimate home office significantly more expensive than many would like to admit. Throw in a couple of monitors, a qualitative web cam, microphone, printer, shredder, peripheral devices, a whiteboard, noise cancelling headphones, a mesh router and a backup laptop (assuming you'll get a work laptop provided) then the true cost of a home office begins to reach eye watering levels.</p>
<p>Some employers will try to provide you those supplies, but any seasoned remote worker will tell you to decline such an offer. After all you're still equipping your own personal home. You shouldn't have to pick from a selection of office desks which don't match your walls. You shouldn't have to settle on a chair which doesn't appeal to your eye. You shouldn't have to accept a black bezelled screen when all your other equipment is in space grey. Most importantly though, you want to treat those things as your own. You don't want to change your monitors when you change your job. You don't want to have to go through your employer to make a warranty claim. You don't want to ask for permission to replace a worn out chair. Instead you want to get a pay rise which allows you to set up your home office in the most productive way. If your employer is smart enough then they will not want to manage all of that inventory (which they never get to see) either.</p>
<p>Speaking of inventory, the true cost of working from home does not stop there yet. When working remotely nothing disrupts productivity more than a low bandwidth internet connection. One cannot …</p></div></div>

      <h2>The first two hours of Kakoune in two minutes</h2>

<p>Learning a new editor can be a daunting task, especially when
coming over from a non-modal editor. I personally started with
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, and it took me weeks to be
productive when I started using <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. The modal paradigm
is a powerful tool, but picking it up is generally not a painless experience.</p>

<p>When I discovered <a href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a> a few years ago, it felt
like the jump from Vim to it was even bigger than the one I’d made when
transitioning over from Emacs to Vim. Despite the two being fairly close on
paper, one still needs to unlearn all the muscle memory patiently cultivated
over the years and grow it back up from scratch. If we ignore the fact that
in those days the only (comparatively sparse) documentation was centralised
in the README file of the project, which might have contributed to why the
jump made itself felt so strongly, new comers still have to primarily
focus their efforts towards learning the “modal language”, or flavour,
of Kakoune.</p>

<p>In order to save them some time, whether they’re disembarking off the Emacs
(non-modal) or Vim (modal) boats, I’ve documented in the following article
some common configuration options. They won’t fit anyone’s workflow exactly
right, I trust the user to tweak the settings how they see fit. They will
however allow turning the two hours it would have taken me to figure out
what lines to write down in my user configuration to get a boilerplate setup

<h2 id="explanations">Explanations</h2>

<p>These explanations expand on the purpose of the lines in the above file,
the salient parts in them, and hopefully give you a bird-eye view of the
various configuration instructions you might recognise in the
<a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=kakrc"><code>kakrc</code></a>
configurations of more advanced users.</p>

<p>The details are intentionally glossed over and might seem fuzzy, feel free
to refer to the list of recommended further readings at the end of this
article if you’re curious.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Set the colour scheme
colorscheme kaleidoscope-dark
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Kaleidoscope colour scheme (also known as theme) is a high-contrast,
colour blind friendly palette of colours that should suit the largest subset
of users, at first. You can go for the dark variant (<code>kaleidoscope-dark</code>)
or the light one (<code>kaleidoscope-light</code>).</p>

<p>If you don’t care either way, comment this line and the default theme will
do just fine.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Width of a tab
set-option global tabstop 4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Options are scoped, which means that they can hold different values depending
on the context in which they’re being used. For general configuration
purposes, use the <code>global</code> scope.</p>

<p>The <code>tabstop</code> option holds the amount of space characters that tabulation
characters (stored in a file opened with Kakoune) will be rendered as.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Indent with 4 spaces
set-option global indentwidth 4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This option impacts the behaviour of a couple of primitives (a primitive
is a “key”, more details about keys/primitives below) that indent or
de-indent a line, in normal mode.</p>

<p>In non-modal editors, hitting keys results in the letter associated with them
being inserted into the buffer (the “file”) as-is. In modal editors,
this behaviour applies only to the “insert mode”, which can be entered
by hitting <code>i</code> in normal mode — which is the default mode when starting
Kakoune.</p>

<p>The <code>indentwidth</code> option dictates how many space characters are inserted
or removed when using (respectively) the normal mode primitive <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code>.</p>

<p>Note that when editing a file that is recognised by the editor, manual
indentation of lines should not be necessary, as that side-effect will be
handled automatically upon hitting the return key.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Always keep one line and three columns displayed around the cursor
set-option global scrolloff 1,3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When scrolling around a large file, the cursor tends to stick to the borders
of the window if more content needs to be displayed. You can have the window
show more context (i.e. lines and characters) when that happens with the
<code>scrolloff</code> option.</p>

<p>The first integer (<code>1</code> above) in the comma separated pair is the amount of
lines to show above/below the cursor when it hits the top/bottom of the
window, and more lines remain to be displayed in the file.</p>

<p>Similarly, the second integer (<code>3</code> above) is the amount of characters
displayed on the left/right when the cursor hits the left/right hand
window border.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Display the status bar on top
set-option global ui_options ncurses_status_on_top=true
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Kakoune follows a server/client architecture, and the behaviour of the user
interface (run by the client) can be tweaked via <code>ui_options</code>. It accepts
a list of equal-sign separated key/value pairs, and the above instructs
the NCurses client (default) to display the status bar on top.</p>

<p>Feel free to comment this line if the default behaviour (status bar on the
bottom) suits you.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Display line numbers
add-highlighter global/ number-lines -hlcursor
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Highlighters are decorators for the window or the text it contains. Similarly
to options (c.f. above), they are scoped, but we only care about their
<code>global</code> value. You might have noticed however that the above line uses
<code>global/</code>, and you might be tempted to remove it on account of it being
redundant — don’t, the character is significant.</p>

<p>The <code>number-lines</code> highlighter displays a file’s line numbers on the left
hand side of the screen. The <code>-hlcursor</code> flag allows highlighting the number
of the line that the cursor lies on.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Highlight trailing whitespace
add-highlighter global/ regex \h+$ 0:Error
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This line adds a <code>regex</code> highlighter which decorates trailing whitespace
with the built-in <code>Error</code> face. The number refers to the index of the match
within the regex. For instance, <code>0</code> refers to the text matched by the regex
(but not to the entire line).</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Softwrap long lines
add-highlighter global/ wrap -word -indent
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>wrap</code> highlighter applies “soft wrapping” (e.g. the lines appear
broken up, but no newline characters are inserted into the file itself)
to lines that cannot be fully displayed within the window. The flags passed
to it keep words whole, and the indentation of the lines newly created will
have the same indentation level as their stem.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Clipboard management mappings
map -docstring "yank the selection into the clipboard" global user y "&lt;a-|&gt; xsel -i&lt;ret&gt;"
map -docstring "paste the clipboard" global user p "&lt;a-!&gt; xsel&lt;ret&gt;"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Mappings (also known as “key bindings”, or more simply “bindings”)
allow customising the side effect upon hitting a key. Here is a breakdown
of the two lines above:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>map</code>: declare a new mapping</li>
  <li><code>-docstring "…"</code>: document what the side effect of the mapping is —
this is optional, but is quite helpful when the mapping is set in the
<code>user</code> mode (c.f. below)</li>
  <li><code>global</code>: mappings are scoped, just like options and highlighters</li>
  <li><code>user</code>: similar to the insert mode, the user mode is entered by hitting
a key (for instance, <code>,</code>) from normal mode (c.f. below for more information)</li>
  <li><code>&lt;key&gt; "…"</code>: upon hitting <code>key</code>, execute the given list of primitives</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, quite a few concepts have been packed into merely two
instructions.</p>

<p>In terms of functionality, these two mappings copy the current selection
to the clipboard and paste whatever is in it. They’re triggered by hitting
the comma <code>,</code> key followed by respectively <code>y</code> and <code>p</code>.</p>

<p>Read on if you’re not familiar with modal edition, or want to compare
the declaration of mappings in Kakoune with other modal editors.</p>

<p><strong>The user mode</strong><br>
Mappings allow overriding the behaviour of a given key, but since they all
have a specific purpose (c.f. primitives below) by default, one would have
to forego whatever functionality the key being overridden provided with,
in order to instantiate a custom mapping.</p>

<p>The user mode is entered from normal mode upon hitting the comma <code>,</code> key,
and allows “user mappings” to be declared within it. It’s a way to address
the above problem: you don’t have to override default keys/primitives,
you can just place them one keystroke away (“behind” the comma <code>,</code> key)
and be free to pick any key you see fit.</p>

<p><strong>Primitives</strong><br>
The difference between “key” and “primitive” is one of semantic, and both can
commonly be used interchangeably.</p>

<p>Keys are referred to as the letter (or symbol, for example the return key)
that is printed on them, on a QWERTY keyboard.</p>

<p>Primitives are triggered by single keys or a combination of them, and can
be invoked from a prompt (interactively) or script (programmatically). They
are referred to using a custom notation that allows combining letters and
modifiers (c.f. below).</p>

<p>When placing those cryptic definitions back into the context of the clipboard
management mappings above, we get:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>&lt;a-|&gt;</code>: holding the alt and pipe <code>|</code> keys together to invoke the <code>&lt;a-|&gt;</code>
primitive, which pipes the current selection into a given shell command</li>
  <li><code>&lt;a-!&gt;</code>: holding the alt and <code>!</code> keys together to invoke the <code>&lt;a-!&gt;</code>
primitive, which inserts the output of a given shell command into the file</li>
  <li><code>&lt;ret&gt;</code>: the return key, to …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article>
  
  <div><p>In iOS 14.3, Apple added their new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/">app privacy details</a> to App Store listings. App privacy details, which are sometimes compared to the nutritional labels on foodstuff, are details about the data an app collects and the purposes and use of such data. What can we learn by analysing this data?</p>

<p>From the 14<sup>th</sup> of December 2020, all new apps and app updates have to provide information on the data the app collects. This is used to power the app privacy details labelling. On Twitter, videos scrolling through the privacy listing for Facebook circulated immediately after the 14.3 release.</p>

<p>This system is somewhat flawed, because app developers can, at least in theory, lie about the data they collect. Some apps that profess to collect no data, actually turn out to collect a bunch if you read their privacy policy. However, the punishment for being caught lying, removal from the App Store, is a strong deterrent and it’s safe to assume most developers will have been truthful in their accounts.</p>

<p>An interesting side-effect of this, is that Apple has now made available the same data that can be found in terse and hard to parse privacy policies as simple and structured data that can be parsed and analysed. In this post I will do just that i.e. collect and analyse the privacy details for thousands of the most popular apps on the App Store.</p>

<h2 id="collecting-the-data">Collecting the Data</h2>

<p>If you just want to read the juicy details feel free to skip to the <a href="#analysis">analysis</a>.</p>

<p>Apple makes the privacy labelling data available for each app on the App Store via an API used by the App Store apps. By reverse engineering the App Store apps I’ve figured out how to make the API divulge this data on a per app basis.</p>

<p>This only gets me the privacy data for a single app, but I want to analyse popular apps. A good source of popular apps are the charts the App Store provides on a per app category basis. An example of this is “Top Free” apps in “Education”. These listings contain up to 200 apps per category and price point(i.e. free or paid).</p>

<p>On the UK store, which is the store I’ve used for all this analysis, there are 24 categories. Each of which have top charts with up to 200 paid and 200 free apps. This means the theoretical total number of apps is 9600. However, because some apps occupy chart positions in multiple categories and because the charts also contain app bundles the actual number is lower.</p>

<p>The full list of categories is:</p>

<h2 id="structure-of-the-data">Structure of the Data</h2>

<p>If you don’t care about the exact details and structure of the data feel free to skip to the <a href="#analysis">analysis</a>.</p>

<p>The structure of the data returned by the App Store API is</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>

<p>The <code>&lt;privacy-details&gt;</code> section of this document is the important bit. It’s an array where each item has the following structure.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>

<p><code>DATA_NOT_COLLECTED</code> is used as a marker in which case <code>dataCategories</code> and <code>purposes</code> are both empty and this is the only element in the <code>privacyDetails</code> array.</p>

<p><code>DATA_USED_TO_TRACK_YOU</code> contains details on data used to track you across websites and apps owned by other companies, Apple’s description is <em>The following data may be used to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies:</em>. For this entry <code>purposes</code> will be empty and <code>dataCategories</code> contain the different data types that are tracked across apps and websites owned by other companies.</p>

<p><code>DATA_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> and <code>DATA_NOT_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> both contain data types with purposes specific granularity. This means that <code>dataCategories</code> will be empty and the different data types are in <code>purposes</code>. Apple’s description for <code>DATA_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> and <code>DATA_NOT_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> are <em>The following data, which may be collected and linked to your identity, may be used for the following purposes:</em> and <em>The following data, which may be collected but is not linked to your identity, may be used for the following purposes:</em> respectively.</p>

<p><code>&lt;data-purposes&gt;</code> is an array of purposes with the following structure:</p>

<p>Let’s do some analysis of this data</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<p>The data set I’ve collected contains 9082 combinations of apps and a position in a given category chart. In total there are 9040 unique apps in this data set.</p>

<p>Most charts contain 200 or nearly 200 apps, however <strong>Graphics &amp; Design(Paid)</strong>, <strong>Developer Tools(Paid)</strong>, and <strong>Magazines &amp; Newspapers(Paid)</strong> all have fewer than 90 apps so I’m dropping them from further analysis.</p>

<p>Because the privacy details have only been required for new apps and updates since mid December, not all apps contain information about privacy details. After removing those apps 3164 apps remain in the data set. Breaking this down by chart, several charts have less than 25 apps so I am dropping them from further analysis too. This leaves 3027 apps in the data set.</p>

<p>In total the following charts have been dropped:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Education(Paid)</li>
  <li>Navigation(Paid)</li>
  <li>Sports(Paid)</li>
  <li>Business(Paid)</li>
  <li>Food &amp; Drink(Paid)</li>
  <li>Shopping(Paid)</li>
  <li>Medical(Paid)</li>
  <li>Magazines &amp; Newspapers(Paid)</li>
</ul>

<p>For the analysis there are a few different data points that are interesting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apps that collect data this is linked to the user and how many such data types they collect.<sup>*</sup></li>
  <li>Apps that collect no data.</li>
  <li>Third Party tracking, i.e. tracking users across apps and websites owned by other companies and the how many(max 32) such data types they collect.</li>
</ul>

<p>* Data that is linked to the user for the purpose of supporting app functionality, that is the <code>APP_FUNCTIONALITY</code> purpose, is legitimate and will be exclude from the following analysis. This leaves 160 data types spread across 5 purposes.</p>

<p>I am excluding data that is collected but not linked to the user, in part to keep down the length of the analysis and in part because it’s the least interesting. I’ll probably do a follow up post on it later.</p>

<p>The questions I’ll be looking at for this analysis are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#free-vs-paid">Do free apps collect more data?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#worst-charts">Which are the worst charts?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#worst-apps">Which apps in the whole data set are the worst?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#oxymorons">Which apps lie subtly about the nature of data they collect?</a></li>
</ol>

<p>But first let’s have a quick look at the data set.</p>

<p><em>Note: The images in this post can be clicked to show larger versions</em></p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-plot.svg?1609805186" alt="Histogram plot of data types collected. The apps that collect zero such data types dominate"></a></p>

<p>As we can see here, most apps collect no data outside of that which supports the app’s functionality. To get a better view of the apps that do collect data, let’s remove the majority of apps that don’t.</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-non-zero-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-non-zero-plot.svg?1609805186" alt="Histogram plot of data types collected with zero values removed."></a></p>

<p>Still the amount of data collected is fairly low, but there’s a curious set of outliers somewhere around 120 data types collected. All of those outliers have something in common, see if you can figure it out before I reveal the answer later in the post.</p>

<p>How about third party tracking?</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/ttp-histogram-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/ttp-histogram-plot.svg?1609805186" alt="Histogram plot of third party tracking data types collected. The apps that collect zero such data types dominate"></a></p>

<p>Again most apps don’t collect any data types for third party tracking. Let’s repeat the process from above by removing those that do no tracking.</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/ttp-histogram-non-zero-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/ttp-histogram-non-zero-plot.svg?1609805186" alt="Histogram plot of third party tracking data types collected with zero values removed."></a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div ?="">
        <p>China Miéville’s novel <em>Embassytown</em> describes a world in which an alien species, the Ariekei, becomes enthralled by a human’s ability to speak their language. What starts out as novelty gives way to obsession, and they become addicted to his voice, their lives falling to pieces, wandering the streets like zombies, tearing the world apart in search of more “god-drug”. Their obsession has nothing to do with the person behind it, but rather the thing he can provide.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve amused myself by operating through the lens that the world is run by ideas, rather than people. We tend to discuss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics">mimetic effects</a> in relation to mass <em>consumption</em> – its distributive effects – but less-frequently discussed is how mimetics affect creators themselves.</p>

<p>I like thinking of people as vessels, which provides a refreshing counterbalance to the well-trodden <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory">“great man theory”</a>. Rather than viewing people as agents of change, I think of them as intermediaries, voice boxes for some persistent idea-virus that’s seized upon them and is speaking through their corporeal form. You might think of this as <em>“great prophet theory”</em>.</p>

<p>Ideas ride us into battle like warhorses. We can witness, participate in, and even lead these battles, but their true meaning eludes us. We don’t really know where ideas come from, nor how to control them.</p>

<h2 id="birthing-new-ideas">Birthing new ideas</h2>

<p>Consider the obsessiveness with which creators birth new ideas into the world, which we’ve clinically termed <em>“intrinsic motivation”</em>, but don’t really seem to understand beyond that. We can observe that it is happening, but we don’t know what actually <em>causes</em> someone to drive themselves nearly to death just so they can give an idea a beating heart and a chance at survival in the world. <em>“Because I had to”</em> or <em>“Because I couldn’t stop thinking about it”</em> are symptoms, not causes.</p>

<p><img src="https://nadiaeghbal.com/assets/img/ideas/goodyear.png" alt="goodyear">
<em>One of my favorite recent examples. <a href="https://twitter.com/rivatez/status/1115627936411815937">Via Twitter</a></em></p>

<p>Once ideas find an audience, they’re hard to eradicate. Many a surprised creator has found that they’ve lost control over an idea, watching helplessly as it’s shaped and reinterpreted in ways they didn’t intend.</p>

<p>It is enormously difficult for a successful creator to escape their own idea, because ideas need hosts to survive. Their audience owns them now: creators become like the god-drug to the Ariekei, delivering their goods to a babbling crowd that frantically demands more, more.  The creator must battle their own idea in order to survive, taming it back into submission, or risk being subsumed by its demands.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, I often think about Lil Wayne’s rock album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebirth_(Lil_Wayne_album)"><em>Rebirth</em></a> here, perhaps because the title is so wistfully aspirational. Lil Wayne tried in vain to “rebirth” himself, but he was widely panned by an audience that wanted him to produce rap, not rock. Because of his prior success, Lil Wayne became a vessel for a certain type of sound that we craved more of. He became “that person” for “that idea”.</p>

<h2 id="the-constraints-of-reputation">The constraints of reputation</h2>

<p>Even after an idea becomes sufficiently popular to survive in the world without a host, it’s still difficult for creators to escape them, because ideas bond to their hosts in the form of <em>reputation</em>, like a virus that lives in one’s body forever. Reputation is the aggregation of ideas that have swarmed your body. Reputation is a list of your chronic afflictions.</p>

<p>It’s strange to think that personal reputation is becoming simultaneously more and less valuable today. Reputation is the currency that powers our social systems – a symbol of your unique value – but at the same time, it’s easier than ever to find substitutes for a particular sound, style, aesthetic, or way of thinking. I think it’s a sign that ideas are winning over people, or perhaps just making their tyranny better known to us, an ominous signal flare shot into the sky.</p>

<p>The way in which we listen to music, for example, has changed. We don’t listen to entire albums as much as we used to. We don’t know as much about artists as we used to. Instead, we combine and recombine until we find precisely the sound we’re looking for, pumping god-drug into our veins, without really caring who’s behind it. Like an artist on an autogenerated Spotify playlist, my “thing” is interchangeable with a lot of other people’s “things” that would give my audience the same fix.</p>

<p>Returning to the Lil Wayne example, if Lil Wayne ever put his foot down and decided to stop making rap, we’d find another artist just like him, someone else who satisfies our desires. Lil Wayne commands an audience when it comes to rap. But his reputation is a devil’s contract: continue to make the same thing, and you’ll be rewarded, but don’t stray too far from the original concept.</p>

<p>Similarly, when an exceptional artist meets an untimely death, we don’t necessarily mourn them because of who they are. After all, we only really know their identity through the lens of the thing they produced for us. We mourn them because their product is scarce, and we can no longer get our fix. When someone says, e.g. <em>“Nobody ever played guitar like Jimi Hendrix”</em>, they’re saying that they crave a sound that feels hard to find elsewhere, not that they miss Jimi Hendrix himself.</p>

<p>Reputation has local value – it’s what distinguishes you within your world – but global demand for most people’s output is fairly elastic. In order to give people what they want, reputation is commoditized, bundled and traded on a global market. Spotify Discover Weekly satisfies the consumer by commodifying the creator. Today, internet creators can build up large audiences without ever becoming truly famous; they may command substantial local power, but their global value is very narrow.</p>

<h2 id="regaining-control">Regaining control</h2>

<p>How do creators preserve optionality? How do they maintain separation between themselves and their ideas, and avoid being consumed by demand?</p>

<p>One approach is to resist definition entirely, which seems like the obvious answer, but is hard to actually pull off well, because it requires engaging in constant battle against the many ideas that will inevitably swarm you. Still, some people find this to be a fun challenge in itself, requiring quite a bit of stealth to swim among the dark ocean depths without being detected.</p>

<p>The more I’ve kept an eye out for this approach, the more examples I’ve noticed among public figures. They’re the ones who always seem to keep coming up with interesting ideas, the generative thinkers that everyone likes to marvel at, but who manage to say a lot and a little at the same time. Kanye West is the canonical example that comes to mind: it’s hard to pin down what exactly he does, or what he thinks about, and yet the things he does seem uniquely “Kanyesque”.</p>

<p>The second approach is to compartmentalize, which is more tedious to manage, but probably easier for most to pull off. We tend to assume that people use pseudonyms or alts for privacy reasons. But alts aren’t always about hiding who you are, but rather keeping your ideas separate from some root identity (ex. one’s legal name), so that you can still remember who you are when the ideas aren’t riding you. [1]</p>

<p>Sex worker Stoya <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/opinion/sunday/can-we-learn-about-privacy-from-porn-stars.html">once likened her choice</a> of an alt to “deciding on a user name for any Internet service or website”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My stage name is less about withholding parts of myself or maintaining privacy than it is a symbol of the idea that I am more than just my job or any other isolated slice of my identity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My favorite example of this: a friend, who’s a mother of two, recently reflected that her daughter started calling her by her first name, because she wanted to know who she was beyond being her mom. The terms “mom” and “dad” are alts that protect the self, who exists <em>a priori</em> to being a parent.</p>

<p><img src="https://nadiaeghbal.com/assets/img/ideas/multiple-bios.png" alt="multiple bios">
<em>Compartmentalizing: multiple bios for multiple selves. <a href="https://lee94josh.com/About-Me">Via Josh’s website</a></em></p>

<p>Finally, to some extent, I find something sort of satisfying about accepting that ideas have a life of their own. Wielded carefully, they can shield, rather than drain, the creator. For example, actors and directors sometimes talk about making a big box-office hit, so they can do their artsy side project without feeling pressure to pander to an audience. If everyone manages a portfolio of ideas, some will be cash cows, some are risky bets, and others will be just for fun.</p>

<p>Ideas are fascinators that sparkle and dangle in front of the creator, distracting an eager audience from the person behind the curtain. Submitting to the tyranny of ideas gives us the freedom to explore who we are apart from our public reputations. If ideas are living entities that exist separately from our selves, what remains of us?</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<p>[1] I am skeptical that alts don’t creep into your root identity anyway, but at least you can switch between modes in a more explicit way.</p>

</div>
<p>Emilua is an execution engine for Lua. It fills a role similar to NodeJS for
Javascript. Apart from being an execution engine, the two have leaps and leaps
of differences.</p>
<p>I believe a good first post for this blog would be to clarify the differences
between NodeJS and Emilua. NodeJS is very popular and people try to port its API
to different
languages<sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_1" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup><sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_2" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup><sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_3" href="#_footnote_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup>. Even
non-users of Javascript know NodeJS. By describing Emilua in terms of
differences against NodeJS I hope to offer a turbo heads-up. Comparisons also
offer me the opportunity to touch on many other topics that I enjoy.</p>
<p>I’ll also try to make it brief. If needed be, links to some lengthy posts from
other authors that already covered the topic in detail will be included.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="_one_color">One color</h2>
<div>
<p>The first difference is Emilua’s commitment to avoid
<a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">Bob
Nystrom' two colors problem</a>. The problem has been extensively covered
elsewhere:</p>

<div>
<p>NodeJS redundant interfaces</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript">tls = require('tls');
fs = require('fs');

options = {
    // sync interfaces
    key: fs.readFileSync('server-key.pem'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('server-cert.pem')
};

// async interfaces
server = tls.createServer(options, function(socket) {
    // ...
});</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In a nutshell, every function in Emilua has the ability to suspend the caller
function. The runtime will schedule every fiber behind the scenes, and you don’t
need to wrap the function operator call based on the resources the callee will
make use of.</p>
<p>Whereas manuals from some frameworks will instruct you to annotate every call
that might block with <code>await</code>…​</p>
<div>
<p>Pseudocode example on <code>await</code></p>
<div>
<pre><code>n = await read(sock, buf);
await write(sock, buf[:n]);
// ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Emilua won’t force you to do the same. IO scheduling is a transparent
resource. IO scheduling is not part of the function type signature. You don’t
need to break the API just because your function implementation just now
requires IO activity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_is_it_a_coroutine_or_is_it_a_fiber">Is it a coroutine…​ or is it a fiber?</h2>
<div>
<p>The previous point may have been extensively debated, and it was in this debate
that comparisons among the following styles was appropriate:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Events and polling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Callbacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signals &amp; slots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Functional patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coroutines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>But Emilua is built around fibers and it is inappropriate to compare fibers and
the previous choices. I’ll now compare fibers and coroutines to make this subtle
point.</p>
<p>Coroutines may be an old concept that suggest language constructs capable to
suspend and resume a function
context<sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_4" href="#_footnote_4" title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup>, but fibers come from attempts to
provide user-space threads, and, as such, will adhere to threads vocabulary. The
presence of threads vocabulary imply a scheduler (i.e. if you call
<code>mutex.lock()</code>, your code doesn’t need to know which fiber to awake next as this
will be taken care of by the scheduler). This difference is noted by authors of
fiber libraries, but rarely stated explicitly, so it’s worth to link one of the
few texts that make explicit the difference:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference between a fibers facility and just coroutines is that with
fibers, you have a scheduler as well.</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<p>The difference is important because if you have threads vocabulary, you have not
only vocabulary to express concurrent tasks, but also vocabulary to tame this
very concurrency with mutexes, condition variables, and the like. None of the
previous options of this list — callbacks, promises, coroutines, etc — had such
sync primitives.</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Ruby 3.0 also has support for fiber-based concurrency. The collective result of
what they offer is a form of fiber-based concurrency.</p>
<p>However the single abstraction <code>Fiber</code> from their docs is really just a
coroutine, not a fiber. The difference between fibers and coroutines is not the
lack of a stack. Schedulers are the real defining trait.</p>
<p>The situation got even more confusing as they added “non-blocking fibers”
[sic]. If a scheduler for the thread is set, their “non-blocking fibers”
[sic] will finally act as fibers and only then the terminology will be correct
(except for the “non-blocking” part which is a meaningless adjective).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>

<p>Here’s a small example, an implementation for the very simple socket-pair
algorithm. First in NodeJS:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript">var net = require('net');

function socket_pair(callback) {
    var result = {}

    var server = net.createServer(function(sock) {
        server.close()
        if (result.err) {
            return
        }
        if (result.sock) {
            callback(null, [ sock, result.sock ])
        } else {
            result.sock = sock
        }
    })

    server.on('error', function(err) {
        if (result.err) {
            return
        }
        result.err = err
        callback(err)
    })

    server.listen(0, '127.0.0.1', function() {
        var sock = new net.Socket()
        sock.connect(server.address().port, '127.0.0.1', function() {
            if (result.err) {
                return
            }
            if (result.sock) {
                callback(null, [ sock, result.sock ])
            } else {
                result.sock = sock
            }
        })
        sock.on('error', function(err) {
            if (result.err) {
                return
            }
            server.close()
            result.err = err
            callback(err)
        })
    });
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Do notice how NodeJS’s lack of sync primitives forces you to write your own
synchronization (the <code>result</code> rendezvous point in the example). Now take a look
at how Emilua will make the task much simpler by enabling you to use the
<code>fiber.join()</code> sync vocabulary:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="lua">local ip = require 'ip'

function socket_pair()
    local acceptor = ip.tcp.acceptor.new()
    local addr = ip.address.loopback_v4()
    acceptor:open(addr)
    acceptor:bind(addr, 0)
    acceptor:listen()

    local f = spawn(function()
        local sock = ip.tcp.socket.new()
        sock:connect(addr, acceptor.local_port)
        return sock
    end)

    local sock = acceptor:accept()
    acceptor:close()
    return sock, f:join()
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>And there is a little something else. Preemptiveness isn’t a property exclusive
to OS-provided threads. Runtimes from some languages will manage to deliver just
this property to fibers as well. Emilua will stay out of preemptiveness
(i.e. you’re guaranteed to have a safer environment) just like many others. But
if you’re restricted to cooperative multitasking, you managed to migrate some
scheduling decisions from runtime to compile-time. Most frameworks will stop
here, but Emilua will go just one mile further.</p>
<p>If you moved some scheduling decisions to compile-time, it makes sense to also
move sync primitives to compile-time…​ or, rather…​ <em>scheduling
constraints</em>. Ideally, your code wouldn’t compile when these constraints aren’t
respected. I’m not there yet and there are static analysers waiting to be
written, but the vocabulary to encode the user expectation in Lua is here. The
vocabulary works like C’s <code>assert()</code>. One alternative would be to just rely on
<code>mutex</code>es as usual, but there are these little abusers — like me — of
deterministic suspension points that you’ll never tame, so I’m adding this
little tool anyway to prevent further damage.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_opinionated_concurrency_style">Opinionated concurrency style</h2>
<div>
<p>Bob Nystrom’s warning about two colors wasn’t enough.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Choose your async model; we don’t mind; we encourage experimentation.</p>
<p>If you don’t like callbacks and event emitters, use coroutines and write
blocking style code without actually blocking your event loop!</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<p>From experience with Boost.Asio, I noticed that you can’t just defer the choice
to the user and get rid of making one. What happened to Boost.Asio is that you
cannot appropriately support any one model.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Limitations from one model infect other models (e.g. orientation towards IO
objects and not threads). This point by itself could give a lengthy article,
but nowadays I’m less concerned with convincing people and more concerned with
respecting my own precious time, so you’ll only have my word here.</p>

<p>You cannot rely on the strengths that are exclusive to one model (e.g. disable
interruption at critical blocks). It may seem redundant with the previous
point because it’s just another face of the same coin.</p>

<p>You just created a new model. <em>Your “unopinionated” model is a meta-model</em>
that forces every library provider to write convoluted code. Again, another
lengthy article that will not receive a share of my time. If you’re curious,
try looking for libraries built around Boost.Asio that work with the
completion token protocol.</p>

<p>Emilua cares about serving one concurrency style and serving it well: fibers.</p>

<p>Boost.Fiber doesn’t need fibers::future::then - just suspend the fiber. If
you need more concurrency than that, launch another fiber. then() is
redundant with coroutine and fiber concurrency.</p>

<div>
<p>A friend of mine teached me this principle early on that affected all my future
projects: <em>design your abstractions where the user is an active party on
scheduling decisions</em>. I’ve been calling it the active style and people usually
don’t get it what it is about, but consequences of this design are better
understood (e.g. <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2020/1/1/async-pressure/">dealing with
back-pressure</a>).</p>
<p>Ryan Dahl’s successor for NodeJS also got this point covered:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Node’s counterpart to promises was the EventEmitter, which important APIs are
based around, namely sockets and HTTP. Setting aside the ergonomic benefits of
async/await, the EventEmitter pattern has an issue with back-pressure. Take a
TCP socket, for example. The socket would emit "data" events when it received
incoming packets. These "data" callbacks would be emitted in an unconstrained
manner, flooding the process with events. Because Node continues to receive new
data events, the underlying TCP socket does not have proper back-pressure, the
remote sender has no idea the server is overloaded and continues to send
data. To mitigate this problem, a pause() method was added. This could solve the
problem, but it required extra code; and since the flooding issue only presents
itself …</p></blockquote></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>On January 19, 2020, Washington state reported the first US case of coronavirus.

</div>


<p>Unemployment, hunger, institutional breakdown, and the destruction of social bonds are not symptoms of a virus. They are the indirect violence of class warfare. The pandemic is a convenient scapegoat for the largest upward wealth transfer in modern human history. Under the pretext of a public health policy, elites have successfully waged a counterrevolution that will result in the erosion of working conditions and quality of life for generations to come.&nbsp;</p>



<h5><strong>A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</strong></h5>



<p>Death, disease, and pandemics have always been part of human life and they always will be. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2.8 million</a> Americans die every year and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">56 million</a> people die worldwide. Each year <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/tuberculosis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.3 million</a> people die of tuberculosis, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/ten-things-you-didnt-know-about-malaria#:~:text=Almost%20half%20the%20world's%20population,global%20malaria%20control%20is%20slipping." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">445,000</a> die of malaria, and <a href="https://www.health.com/condition/cold-flu-sinus/how-many-people-die-of-the-flu-every-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">290,000-650,000</a> die of influenza. In 1968 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/1968-flu-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1-4 million</a> people died in the H2N3 influenza pandemic, during which businesses and schools <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/16/why-life-went-on-as-normal-during-the-killer-pandemic-of-1969/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stayed open</a> and large events were held.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indefinite closures have never before been used as a disease control method on a global scale. These experimental restrictions were shaped by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-exposes-the-problems-and-pitfalls-of-modelling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discredited</a> <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/196234/covid-19-imperial-researchers-model-likely-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Imperial College Model</a> which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/world/europe/coronavirus-imperial-college-johnson.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predicted</a> 2.2 million US deaths. Many <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-the-coronavirus-as-deadly-as-they-say-11585088464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">epidemiologists</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doctors</a> questioned these doomsday projections and pointed out that there was <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not sufficient data</a> to justify lockdowns. The virus has a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low</a> mortality rate, especially for people <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120307854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under 65</a>, and <a href="https://www.kark.com/news/new-cdc-report-shows-94-of-covid-19-deaths-in-us-had-underlying-medical-conditions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">94%</a> of US covid deaths have occurred with comorbidities. Most <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-failed-experiment-of-covid-lockdowns-11599000890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statistical analysis</a> does <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.604339/full#SM6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not show</a> lockdown measures to be an effective strategy for <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(20)30208-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reducing mortality</a>.</p>



<p>In March unprecedented policies were rationalized through shocking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/italian-doctor-an-experience-i-would-compare-to-a-world-war" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stories</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J60fQr0GWo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">videos</a> from northern Italy. The region’s crowded ICUs were presented as a warning for the rest of Europe and the US. Unknown to many was the fact that Lombardy had been severely impacted by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/business/lombardy-italy-coronavirus-doctors.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing privatization efforts</a> and a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/557042/hospitals-in-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shrinking hospital system</a> regularly overwhelmed by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219303285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influenza</a>. This omission by mainstream media played a key role in developing the mythology that economic shutdown could magically eradicate a virus. In reality lockdowns have accelerated a cycle of austerity and created a self-fulfilling prophecy of perpetual crisis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chronic <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nursing-home-deaths-coronavirus-understaffing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">understaffing</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/nyregion/nursing-home-workers-pandemic-jobs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lockdown-induced layoffs</a> in nursing homes severely exacerbated covid’s death toll. 40% of US covid deaths are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2020/06/16/nursing-homes-account-for-over-40-of-us-coronavirus-deaths/?sh=54afb581300b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">linked to nursing homes</a>. 1 in 6 covid deaths in Vermont were <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/12/02/vermont-nursing-home-covid-genesis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from a single facility</a>. In New York (the state with the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109011/coronavirus-covid19-death-rates-us-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second highest</a> covid deaths per million) hospitals sent over 6,300 elderly covid patients <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/new-york-hospitals-sent-6300-recovering-covid-patients-to-nursing-homes/2502812/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back into nursing homes</a>. Unprotected, underserved, and alone, the elderly are also afflicted by the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/us/nursing-homes-isolation-virus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slow killer</a>” of loneliness. Isolation increases risk of <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/loneliness-and-isolation-raise-risk-for-stroke-and-heart-disease-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease, stroke</a>, and <a href="https://www.alzinfo.org/articles/feeling-lonely-increases-alzheimers-risk-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer’s</a>. It is <a href="https://www.webmd.com/balance/news/20180504/loneliness-rivals-obesity-smoking-as-health-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as deadly</a> as obesity or smoking 15 cigarettes a day.</p>



<p>Financial insecurity will exacerbate these health risks for the elderly. Economic shutdown has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d1fce3e7-428b-4b8a-ab6a-119a38fa1e7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weakened</a> global pension funds and they may not recover.

		“Income is the main determinant of covid mortality.”    </p>
</div>


<p>Outcomes of lockdown are equally grim for children. Even if K-12 schools reopen in January 2021, the average student will have lost <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/students-falling-behind/2020/12/06/88d7157a-3665-11eb-8d38-6aea1adb3839_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 months of instruction</a>. Because literacy and education levels are a main <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2713445/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predictor of longevity</a>, these learning losses represent years of life stolen from students. Moreover, cases of severe abuse and mental-health related ER visits <a href="https://apnews.com/article/anxiety-mental-health-boston-coronavirus-pandemic-massachusetts-004adb5ee0ef17ff4b5e2e294e36ff3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are surging for children</a>. They will also experience <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/opinion/sunday/covid-quarantine-children-immune-systems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weakened immune systems</a> due to lack of exposure to seasonal viruses and natural pathogens.</p>



<p>For people with chronic health conditions or those in need of urgent medical treatment, the short- and long-term consequences of lockdown are disastrous. In the United States, cancer screenings fell by <a href="https://www.radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-economics/cancer-screenings-epic-ehr-covid-19-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">86-94%</a> in the spring. Many hospitals <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/47-hospitals-closed-filed-for-bankruptcy-this-year.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to close</a> due to lack of revenue from routine surgeries and procedures. Hospitals are expected to lose a total of <a href="https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2020-06-30-aha-report-hospital-financial-losses-covid-19-expected-top-323-billion#:~:text=An%20AHA%20report%20released%20today,least%20%24323%20billion%20in%202020." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$323 billion</a> this year. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/10/853524764/amid-pandemic-hospitals-lay-off-1-4m-workers-in-april" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.4 million hospital staff</a> were laid off in April while private health insurance companies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/health/covid-insurance-profits.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubled their earnings</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the absence of meaningful investments in healthcare infrastructure, the covid mitigation strategies being pushed by federal, state, and local governments are neither credible nor effective. Elected officials routinely amplify raw case numbers in order to stoke fear and blame individuals for viral spread. As a result, we are currently “saving lives” by killing people. This is not an unforced error or a good policy idea implemented poorly. It is an economic agenda disguised as a health protocol.</p>



<h5>The New Caste System&nbsp;</h5>



<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom sends his children to <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/10/30/newsom-sends-his-children-back-to-school-classrooms-in-california-1332811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-person private school</a> while mandating virtual education for California public schools. He announced a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/06/california-covid-lockdown-us-new-cases-hospitalisations-deaths-stay-at-home-order" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second statewide lockdown</a> just a few weeks after attending an indoor, unmasked <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/18/newsom-lobbyist-dinner-party-437892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dinner with lobbyists</a> at a Michelin three star restaurant where meals can cost up to <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2020/9/3/21421335/french-laundry-yountville-thomas-keller-indoor-dining-rich-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$850 per person</a>. Newsom is just one of many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/nyregion/cuomo-thanksgiving-mother.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politicians</a>, elites, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mask-mischief-11595625179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bureaucrats</a> who break the rules. A static social order is being solidified. In our new caste system the wealthy have political and social <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/u-k-to-exempt-high-value-business-travelers-from-quarantine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privileges</a> because they are considered clean and disease-free, while the more low-income someone is, the more they are treated as contaminated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of lockdown enthusiasts in the “work from home” caste is to shift risk away from themselves and onto essential workers and the poor. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20201023-coronavirus-how-will-the-pandemic-change-the-way-we-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Only 40%</a> of the workforce can afford to stay home. <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/aug/looming-crisis-health-coverage-2020-biennial#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20half%20of%202020%2C%2043.4%20percent%20of%20U.S.,uninsured%20rate%20was%2012.5%20percent." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">43% of US adults</a> do not have adequate health insurance, and only 31% of low-paid workers have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/12/as-coronavirus-spreads-which-u-s-workers-have-paid-sick-leave-and-which-dont/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid sick leave</a> compared to 92% of high-paid workers. “Stay home” is the self-congratulatory mantra of professionals who believe that their virtuous behavior prevents them from contracting covid. In fact, income is the <a href="https://prospect.org/coronavirus/covid-19-class-war-death-rates-income/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">main determinant</a> of covid mortality.</p>



<p>Lockdown fanatics have helped manufacture consent for a brutal reorganization of labor that will plunge millions of people into serfdom. The work-from-home lifestyle is only possible through the labor of logistics workers who transport, sort, and deliver goods. Currently about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/04/business/us-economy-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million jobs</a> that existed in February have not been replaced. Many workers have been forced to take on part-time, no-contract work, a labor model that is <a href="https://qz.com/1556194/the-gig-economy-is-quietly-undermining-a-century-of-worker-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolling back</a> decades of hard-fought protections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the Obama/Biden administration, 94% of new jobs created were gig work, and in 2017 <a href="https://www.ilo.org/washington/WCMS_642303/lang--en/index.htm#:~:text=The%20Bureau%20of%20Labor%20Statistics,to%2043%20percent%20in%202020." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">34% of the workforce</a> was employed through the gig economy.

<p>At the start of the covid crisis, vocal segments of the American left argued that economic shutdown was a way to resist <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/donald-trump-wall-street-coronavirus-profits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billionaires</a> and <a href="https://www.dsausa.org/democratic-left/we-need-a-global-democratic-socialist-response-to-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">capitalism</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><div><div><div><div><div><h2>Hanlon's Razor</h2><p>Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Hanlon's razor asks for reflection in situations where we perceive behavior  to be intentionally malicious. A useful exercise is to rethink the scenario  by replacing the malicious intent with reasons such as stupidity, stress or  just plain old misunderstanding.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Your five-year old probably isn't making a mess to make your life miserable  but rather because they're a toddler.</p></li><li><p>A social networking website probably didn't flag your content out of malice  but rather due to a faulty algorithm.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Occam's Razor</h2><p>When comparing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Occam's razor originally stated that entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily. In other words, don't complicate things when you don't need to. By shaving off unnecessary additions, the resulting explanation tends  to be less ambiguous, easier to verify, and just plain simpler. Occam's  Razor is often mentioned when selecting a simple solution over a complex  one. Note that this is a slightly stronger form than the principle  intended--reality can be complex and there are cases where the simple  solution is not correct.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>A sore throat during during the winter is probably the result of a cold even though the symptoms match a rare terminal disease on WebMD.</p></li><li><p>The pyramids being built by humans has far less assumptions than the pyramids being built by aliens.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>First Principles Reasoning</h2><p>Break complex problems into foundational elements and use these elements to build your reasoning.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>A first principle is a foundational assumption or proposition that cannot be derived from other assumption or propositions. By attempting to break down problems into first principles and re-constructing solutions using these building blocks, you're less likely to be biased by prior assumptions. This in turn can lead to more innovative solutions.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>A child repeatedly asking "why?" to answers for an initial question is intuitively thinking in first principles.</p></li><li><p>A company building a cheaper product than competitors by investigating ways of using the raw materials firsthand instead of just following existing conventions.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Proximate and Root Causes</h2><p>Discovering the root cause of an event involves looking deeper than the immediate causes for that event.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>A proximate cause is the event most closely associated with or immediately responsible for an observed result. This may differ from the root cause. Getting to a root cause often requires a deep dive into the situation using approaches like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_questioning">Socratic questioning</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys">5 Whys</a></p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Post-mortem reports for critical failures generally outline proximate causes and how they stem from the root cause. For instance a website was down due servers running out of disk space which was in turn a result of a bug which in turn was a result of poor testing and so on.</p></li><li><p>A child repeatedly asking "why?" to answers for an initial question is trying to get to the root cause.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Social Proof</h2><p>We tend to copy the behavior of others, especially during times of uncertainty.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Social proof is a term used to describe our tendency to follow the behavior of others. This tendency is amplified if we are uncertain about the situation. Social proof generally guides us into making fewer mistakesâ€”if many folks are doing something, itâ€™s usually the correct thing to do. However, this â€œauto-pilotâ€� behavior can be easily exploited to manipulate our decision making process. For instance, to lead us towards a decision that serves someone else's interests or is incorrect.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Laugh tracks in TV shows and hired clappers in a theater performance can trick us into perceiving the content to be funnier or higher quality than it actually is.</p></li><li><p>Testimonials increase our likelihood of buying a product, especially when they indicate popularity. Terms like â€œbest sellingâ€� or â€œrecommended by 9 out of 10 professionalsâ€� are marketing applications of social proof.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Survivorship Bias</h2><p>We tend to focus on things that survived and overlook things that didn't. This can lead to overly optimistic beliefs.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Survivorship bias occurs when we develop a skewed view of a situation by concentrating on the people or things that survived. Things that didn't survive lack visibility and are overlooked. A common result of survivorship bias is overly optimistic beliefs. By focusing primarily on the success stories, we fail to fully understand why the "failures" did not survive, often just assuming that it's due to a lack of qualities found in the survivors. Looking for counter examples when deriving patterns from success stories can be a useful exercise in combating survivorship bias.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>sWe often attribute the success of famous entrepreneurs solely to their behavior and overlook things like luck and timing. By ignoring the failed companies that followed similar approaches, we might be overly optimistic about the likelihood of our own entrepreneurial success.</p></li><li><p>It's easy to perceive music from the past as being higher quality than contemporary works. Music from the past, however, has gone through a selection process where higher quality works have survived. With contemporary music, we hear the mediocre along with the good.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Reciprocity</h2><p>We tend to feel obligated to repay positive actions towards us (e.g. favors, gifts) even if they are unwanted.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Reciprocity refers to a social norm in which we feel a sense of obligation when receiving positive actions towards us. For instance, receiving a favor or gift can trigger feelings of indebtedness to repay the act in someway. While reciprocity allows one to build relationships and exchanges, it can be exploited to gain someone's compliance to a request. This is because feelings of obligation can be felt even when receiving a positive action we do not want.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Before attempting to sell something, a salesperson may give you a small gift (e.g. a pen or a free sample). Even if this gift is unwanted, receiving it can still trigger a need to repay the gift, usually in the form of purchasing whatever is being sold.</p></li><li><p>A common compliance technique is to start by making a large request that's likely to be rejected followed by a second, smaller request. The second request, which is the intended request, is more likely to be accepted as it's seen as a favor.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Hindsight Bias</h2><p>The feeling that we could have predicted an event after it occurs (i.e. we "knew it all along").</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Hindsight bias is the feeling we get when we perceive an event as being predictable, even though there's little evidence to suggest we could have predicted it. Once the event has occurred, it's easy to work backwards and find explanations. While hindsight bias can result in increased confidence and performance, too much can lead to overconfidence and an inability to learn from experience. For instance, by assuming that we could have done better than others after knowing the results of their actions, we lost an opportunity to understand why those actions were made.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>In court, judgement of a defendant can be clouded by hindsight bias. The jury, knowing the outcome of the defendant's actions, might feel as if they could have predicted the outcome.</p></li><li><p>We may feel that people in the past were less intelligent or innovative than those of the present without acknowledging that they did not access to present day information. Related: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian%27s_fallacy">Historian's fallacy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronological_snobbery">chronological snobbery</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Confirmation Bias</h2><p>We have a tendency to perceive things in a way that re-enforces or aligns with our preexisting beliefs.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Confirmation bias is a cognitive bias that causes us to see things in a way that confirms our preexisting beliefs. Because it involves selectively collecting and recalling information, the end result is a biased view point. In addition, confirmation bias may also cause us to ignore information that doesn't support our views. Closely related is the feeling of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a> which refers to the discomfort we feel when holding contradictory beliefs.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>In social media, we're often shown content that we're more likely to agree with. This amplifies confirmation bias--we only see things consistent with our beliefs resulting a sort of "echo chamber". For more on this, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">filter bubbles</a>.</p></li><li><p>Belief in farfetched conspiracy theories can often be a result of confirmation bias. If one tries hard enough, they can find things that seem to support the theory while ignoring the evidence that refutes it.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Scarcity</h2><p>We tend to place higher value on things that are rare and lower value on things that are abundant.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Scarcity refers to our tendency to place value on things according to how rare they are. It's often used as a mental shortcut to assess the value of something based on how easy or difficult is it to acquire. Scarcity doesn't just apply to objects--it can also be applied to things like time and information. For instance, we might place high value on spending some time with a busy individual or getting access to confidential information. Since scarcity can increase our desire for something, it's often artificially created to sell something. A good strategy to combat this desire is to remember that scarcity only increases our desire to obtain something and doesn't affect the actual value we'll extract from it.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Sales techniques likes setting deadlines on promotions or indicating that limited quantities are available are designed to drive up scarcity driven desire for the item being sold.</p></li><li><p>When information is censored, we not only feel a stronger desire to know about it and but also tend to be more favorable to it.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Pareto Principle</h2><p>For many scenarios, 80% of the effects stem from 20% of the causes. This is often referred to as the 80/20 rule.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>In 1896, economist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto">Vilfredo Pareto</a> found that 20% of the population in Italy owned 80% of the land. This ratio is commonly cited in wealth distribution (the richest 20% …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two years ago, I did something that I’d never done in my career before- I left a job
(at <a href="https://nuro.ai/">Nuro</a>) only a few months after starting it. In this post, I want to explain
what happened and what I learned from the experience.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened</h2>

<h4 id="the-job-switch">The job switch</h4>

<p>Back in the spring of 2019, I decided to leave <a href="https://www.stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I’d
been a software engineer for about a year and a half. The full details are best left
to a separate post, but at a high level I just wasn’t very happy with my personal situation; the
work I was doing in compute infrastructure had the unfortunate combination of being both
overly stressful and underappreciated. At the same time, I felt like my career prospects
were limited because the upper rungs of Stripe’s engineering individual contributor (IC) ladder put
a lot of emphasis on cross-team coordination and other, managerial-like activities that I didn’t
enjoy and felt I wasn’t very good at.</p>

<p>Given how hot the job market was at the time and the number of other, seemingly more interesting
opportunities available, I figured that I had nothing to lose by interviewing elsewhere.</p>

<p>After a few weekends of furiously-paced <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/master-coding-interviews">Leetcoding</a>, I was ready.
Unlike my previous job searches, there wasn’t any particular company that I was aspiring
to get into; instead, I just went through my <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/six-years-of-emails">backlog of recruiting emails</a>
and wrote back to a bunch that looked interesting. Among the messages I responded to was one
about <a href="https://nuro.ai/">Nuro</a>, an autonomous vehicle startup that was attempting to do driverless
grocery delivery.</p>

<p>Over the following weeks, I went through the full recruitment slog, starting with lots of
recruiter phone calls, then following up with technical phone screens for a subset of
those, then doing onsite interviews for a subset of those. In the end, I got offers from seven
places, including Nuro.</p>

<p>During the process, I didn’t fall in love with any of the options. But, there
was something that made me feel more optimistic about Nuro than the other choices. Being a
hardware-oriented, robotics company, it was just really different from all of my previous employers,
and, after years of feeling stuck in my career, maybe different was good.</p>

<p>The company was super secretive about its technology; I wasn’t allowed to tour the office, for
instance, because they had hardware prototypes lying around that only employees were allowed to
see. I also wasn’t invited to ride along in their test cars, which would have been both fun and
informative. The external signs were good, though- they had raised a billion dollars from Softbank
and others, and the employee reviews on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/">Glassdoor</a> were gushing.</p>

<p>Aside from being in a somewhat different space than my previous employers, another potential
downside was the commute. Stripe and my three jobs before that were all within a 15 minute walk
of my apartment in San Francisco. Nuro’s office was 40 miles away in Mountain View, which was
more than an hour each way by train. But, I had done longer commutes earlier in my career and figured
that I could handle it.</p>

<p>In the end, I went with my impulses and signed the offer. I had my last day at Stripe, took a short
vacation, and then showed up at the Nuro office, brimming with optimism, for my first day two weeks
later.</p>

<h4 id="realizing-my-mistake">Realizing my mistake</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, that optimism lasted for a grand total of 2 days. By Wednesday of my first week,
as I was riding the train home, I realized that I had made a mistake. My colleagues were
friendly and smart, and the company was doing interesting things, but the job just felt like a
lifestyle downgrade to me.</p>

<p>At Stripe and each of my jobs before that, I had had a short commute to a beautiful office, and
got to experience the instant gratification associated with developing purely software-based
products. Now, I was stuck taking a crowded train to a dark office littered with hardware parts,
working on a product that would take many years to reach mass-market adoption due to pesky little
things like manufacturing and road safety.</p>

<p>I had left Stripe seeking an upgrade, but instead I got a downgrade. And, while minor improvements
were possible, it seemed unlikely that things would completely change for the better in the near
term.</p>

<h4 id="getting-back-on-track">Getting back on track</h4>

<p>At this point, I had three choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Quit immediately</li>
  <li>Start exploring new opportunities but don’t quit until something better is lined up</li>
  <li>Stick it out for at least a year</li>
</ol>

<p>My first instinct was to take option 1 and just go back to Stripe. When I reached out to my HR
contact, though, I found out that I’d have to go through team matching again and also get a new
offer; even though I’d left on good terms less than a month before, I couldn’t just revert back to
my previous position and pay. This was disappointing, but after giving it a little more thought,
I figured it was for the best because I had left Stripe for specific reasons; going back
to my old job wouldn’t fix those or make me feel better about them.</p>

<p>Another variant of option 1 would be to quit and take one of the other offers I had gotten
during my search. But, I had already rejected those for what I thought were good reasons,
so this didn’t feel like the best way out.</p>

<p>Option 3 was the one that would look the least bad from a resume perspective, and this seems to be
what a lot of people in tech do when they don’t like a job. But, life is short, I was really feeling
unhappy with the choice I had made, and I figured it wasn’t really fair to my colleagues at Nuro to
stick in a job that my heart wasn’t in.</p>

<p>So, in the end, I decided that option 2 was the best fit for me. I continued at Nuro and did my best
to get up-to-speed and to contribute to my team’s work, but at the same time jumped right back
into the job market. In addition to keeping things open with Stripe, I
<a href="https://yolken.net/blog/triplebyte-review">tried Triplebyte</a>, responded to more recruiter emails, and also
reached out to some former colleagues about the companies they were now at.</p>

<p>I then went through the whole recruitment process with a new set of companies. This time,
though, I was a lot pickier about where I interviewed (nothing in hardware or with long commutes!);
after a few weeks, I had four new choices including an updated offer from Stripe. After
a good amount of due diligence, significantly more than I had done in my previous search, I
decided to go to <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a>.</p>

<p>When I put in my notice at Nuro, people were surprised that I was leaving so soon, but ultimately
were understanding. I left, took a short vacation, and then started at Segment. Thankfully,
the new job was a much better fit for me, and I’m much happier now!</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>

<h4 id="do-your-due-diligence">Do your due diligence</h4>

<p>Switching jobs is a big deal, and it shouldn’t be done impulsively. Ideally, your due
diligence before signing a new offer should include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Meeting with the team you’ll be working with in a low-stress, non-interview setting</li>
  <li>Touring the office and understanding what your specific workspace will be like</li>
  <li>Trying out the commute for a few days (if it’s significantly different than your current one)</li>
  <li>Trying out any new languages/technologies that you’ll be using on the job</li>
  <li>Getting hands-on demos of the company’s products (if they’re not freely accessible to consumers
  already)</li>
  <li>Seeing a summary of the company’s income and expenses over time (if not public)</li>
</ol>

<p>Learning about these things doesn’t guarantee that you’ll be happy in your new job, but it
at least reduces the risk of any unexpected surprises after you start.</p>

<h4 id="its-ok-to-quit-after-a-few-weeks-just-dont-make-it-a-pattern">It’s ok to quit after a few weeks (just don’t make it a pattern)</h4>

<p>When I started my second job search, I was worried that the short
tenure in the job I was trying to leave would be a turn-off to perspective employers. In reality,
however, it wasn’t a big deal- people asked about it, but seemed satisfied with my 20 second
summary and then moved on to other things.</p>

<p>The sense I get is that you’re allowed to quit a new job once in your career without any
repercussions. If you do it multiple times, however, then recruiters and hiring managers might
have second thoughts about interviewing you without strong internal references or some other signal
that you’ll be a good employee.</p>

<h4 id="switch-teams-before-quitting">Switch teams before quitting</h4>

<p>As I noted in a <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/leaving-a-job">previous post</a>, switching teams is a lot easier than
switching jobs. I didn’t do this before I left Stripe because there weren’t any other teams that I
was super enthusiastic about at the time. But, in retrospect, I probably should have given this a
try before quitting.</p>

<p>Even if the new team hadn’t been a perfect fit, it would have at least bought some time and given
me some additional experience that could help in future work. This is what I did at Google
and Airbnb, and in both cases the “second team” was what really opened up new opportunities for me.</p>

January 3, 2021 | https://adalytics.io/blog/journalists-with-the-most-unsafe-content | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://adalytics.io/blog/journalists-with-the-most-unsafe-content">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>A previous <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/tens-of-thousands-of-news-articles-are-labeled-as-unsafe-for-advertisers">Adalytics</a> post discussed how tens of thousands of articles on the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>Forbes</em>, and <em>CNBC</em> websites appear to be marked as ‘unsafe’ by brand safety ad tech vendors. The post documented that those brand safety values appear to be utilized in ad auctions and ad server requests, meaning they could potentially be affecting news publishers’ ad revenues.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, journalists at a hedge-fund owned California newspaper <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2020/10/19/mcclatchy-tie-pay-to-clicks.html">declared</a> they were fighting an effort to tie performance reviews based on the “the popularity of their stories as measured by clicks.” Most major news publishers retain a long-standing separation between the revenue and editorial departments of their organizations. However, the mere possibility that ad revenue could in some rare instances bias managerial decisions warrants a further investigation into the factors that may influence the monetary value of a journalist’s content.

This analysis focuses on how content from individual journalists and contributors at The <em>New York Times</em> (NYT), <em>Wall Street Journal</em> (WSJ), <em>CNBC</em>, and <em>Forbes</em> are categorized as safe or unsafe by ad tech vendors. Notably, a number of war correspondents and Pulitzer Prize winners have more than two thirds of their news articles marked as ‘unsafe’ for certain digital ads to display on. Nicholas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Kristof">Kristof</a>, a double Pulitzer Prize winner who frequently advocates for human rights, has over 300 of his NYT articles (60.5%) labeled as brand unsafe. </p><p>A <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/tens-of-thousands-of-news-articles-are-labeled-as-unsafe-for-advertisers">previous</a> exploratory analysis of 22,722 recent New York Times articles revealed that 30.3% appeared to be labeled as unsafe by Οracle Grapeshοt. In this analysis, a more comprehensive dataset of 332,710 nytimes.com articles from 2015 to 2020 was assembled. For each of these articles that used Javascript code from Grapeshοt, a given page was considered to be ‘safe’ if it contained the term ‘gv_safe’ (based on information released in Grapeshοt’s documentation), and ‘unsafe’ if it included any labels such as ‘gv_crime’, ‘gv_adult’ or other unsafe categories. A large number (but not all) articles contained clearly labeled ‘author’ meta tags and ‘section’ meta tags that could be used to group articles.</p><p>The table below indicates which New York Times journalists and contributors had the largest proportion of their content labeled as ‘unsafe’. </p><p>Ali <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ali-winston">Winston</a>, an investigative reporter who  “covers the New York City Police Department” and covered issues of criminal justice and surveillance across the United States, had more than 96% of his articles labeled as unsafe. Numerous foreign correspondents who cover warzones, such as Thomas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-gibbons-neff">Gibbons-Neff</a> and Rukmini <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/rukmini-callimachi">Callimachi</a> (four time Pulitzer Prize finalist), had more than 90% of their articles labeled as ‘unsafe’. Double Pulitzer Prize winner and human rights activist Nicholas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Kristof">Kristof</a> had 305 out of his 504 (60.5%) articles labeled as ‘unsafe’.</p><p><i>Table of observed Οracle Grapeshοt brand safety values from <a href="https://nytimes.com/">nytimes.com</a>, grouped by journalist or author.</i></p><p>Additionally, it’s clear that certain sections of the New York Times are disproportionately likely to be labeled as ‘unsafe’. For example, 79.3% articles in the "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/obituaries">Obituaries</a>" section and 53.2% articles in the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/world">World</a>” section are labeled as unsafe. This is likely due to the fact that journalists often have to use keywords related to "death" when covering such topics, which may automatically trigger a negative classification.</p><p><i>Table of observed Οracle Grapeshοt brand safety values from <a href="https://nytimes.com/">nytimes.com</a>, grouped by section.</i></p><p>As discussed in the previous <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/tens-of-thousands-of-news-articles-are-labeled-as-unsafe-for-advertisers">analysis</a>, the Wall Street Journal (as well as other News Corp owned web properties) appear to be using brand safety technology provided by Οracle’s Mοat division and Cοmscοre. The two vendors provide labels which appear to be incorporated into network requests to ad auctions and header bidding services.</p><p>Based on an analysis of 30,033 wsj.com pages, it appears that a number of journalists have more than 90% of their work labeled as ‘unsafe’ by either Mοat or Cοmscοre. Zusha <a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/zusha-elinson">Elison</a>, who covers various gun and police related topics, had 92% of his articles labeled as “moat_unsafe” often due to “gv_arms” or “gv_death_injury”. Ben <a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/ben-chapman">Chapman</a>, who “covers criminal justice for The Wall Street Journal in New York”, had at least 104 of his articles marked as "moat_unsafe".</p><p>Katherine <a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/katherine-clarke">Clarke</a>, who covers residential real estate, appears to have 74 out of 132 articles (56%) labeled as “brandsafe: unsafe” by Comscore.</p><p><i>Table illustrating how many articles by each WSJ journalist were labeled as "unsafe" by either Mοat or Cοmscοre</i></p><p>There are a number of notable journalists, columnists, and writers who focus primarily on covering various advertising or digital marketing related topics. It appears that these writers are not exempt from having their content classified as “unsafe” by various vendors.</p><p>Megan <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/megan-graham/">Graham</a>, a reporter who covers advertising and marketing for CNBC and previously worked at Ad Age, had 23 out of her cnbc.com 219 articles (11%) marked as “moat_unsafe”. 15 were unsafe due to “gv_death_injury”, 7 were marked as unsafe due to “gv_arms”, and 3 were marked as unsafe due to “gv_tobacco”. The cnbc.com website also appears to use semantic <a href="https://adtechdaily.com/2018/06/21/admantx-launches-its-new-hyper-granular-contextual-taxonomy-for-more-precise-contextual-targeting-in-the-gdpr-era/">contextual intelligence</a> technology from Admantx, a company that was <a href="https://integralads.com/news/integral-ad-science-acquires-admantx/">acquired</a> by Integral Ad Sciences (IAS) in 2019. The Admantx technology does not appear to have binary classifications for “safe” or “unsafe”, but rather, seems to allow individual advertisers to avoid showing their ads on webpages that contain individual keywords. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of what appear to be individual brands’ keyword lists in various Javascript network calls. </p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/81MYYg9VNJb3Dn0IgzFKip0n_Klq2cgY1uOaLrpTRilIF-jJehcKjDJ5Rj3qVl_mKdU1BZVlXY6yFJ_hR4EhjHWloojQSNqi8_eObPXERggchiZgg0hLhnUV4yvFtLEalnJoI4zx" alt="Screenshot of Chrome Developer Tools showing IAS Admantx response values for an article on cnbc.com by Megan Graham"></p><p>The presence of a string ending in “_Neg” or “_Negative” may indicate that a given brand is blocking their digital ads from rendering on a given webpage due to the presence of certain keywords in that context (i.e. “Fidelity_Negative” may indicate that Fidelity wants to avoid having their ads show on that specific webpage). In Megan Graham’s case, 132 of her 219 cnbc.com articles contain the label "Barclays_Negative2" in the admantx.com network response. For example, 202 out 219 of her cnbc.com articles contain the Admantx label 'ErnstYoung_Neg', which may indicate that the British professional services firm Ernst &amp; Young want to avoid placing their ads on 92% of Graham’s articles because they consider them to be brand “unsafe”. Some of the keyword lists include interesting names, such as “IBM_JeffreyEpstein”, which appeared on 154 of Graham’s articles, or “FlexShares_Coronavirus” which appeared on 130 of her webpages.</p><p><i>Table illustrating which IAS Admantx category and keyword labels appear most frequently across CNBC reporter Megan Graham’s 219 articles. Some of these labels may correspond to brand specific keyword blocklists, which prevent a given brand’s digital ads from rendering on a given webpage. For example, the presence of “ErnstYoung_Neg” may indicate that the professional services firm Ernst &amp; Young is blocking their ads from showing on 202 of Megan Graham’s CNBC articles due to presence of certain keywords on those pages.</i></p><p>Sheila <a href="https://www.reuters.com/journalists/sheila-dang">Dang</a>, an advertising-focused Reuters reporter, had 7 out of 193 of her articles labeled as "moat_unsafe". Her February <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-football-nfl-superbowl-advertising-idUSKBN1ZX2JO">article</a> about how "<em>Doritos take top spot in Super Bowl Ads</em>" was categorized as "gv_arms" - this likely corresponds to a Oracle Data Cloud "avoidance category" <a href="https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/corporate/acquisitions/grapeshot-methodology.pdf">which</a> "avoids webpage textual content
around guns and weapons". Another <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cbs-results/cbs-beats-wall-street-estimates-for-quarterly-revenue-idUSKBN1KN2SQ">article</a> from August, 2018 about how "<em>CBS beats Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue</em>", was labeled as "moat_unsafe" due "gv_crime". This is likely a reference to an avoidance category <a href="https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/corporate/acquisitions/grapeshot-methodology.pdf">about</a> "sex and violent" crime segments.</p><p>Similarly to Megan Graham, many of Dang's articles also contain Admantx labels which may correspond to brand specific keyword exclusion lists. It appears that a large French luxury goods conglomerate may be blocking their ads from 75.1% of Dang's <em>reuters.com</em> articles. Several large software and banking corporations also appear to take issue with some keywords that appear on 60% of Dang's news pieces.</p><p><i id="reuters-shiela-dang-brandsafety-airtable">Table of IAS Admantx and Oracle Moat brand safety labels for 193 <a href="https://reuters.com/">reuters.com</a> articles by Shiela <a href="https://www.reuters.com/journalists/sheila-dang">Dang</a>. The table has three tabs. The first tab shows each individual article, and IAS Admantx labels were observed for that given article. Some of these may potentially correspond to client specific keyword exclusion lists. The second tab contains an aggregate summary of how many of Dang's articles contained a given label. The third tab includes data about which of Dang's Reuters articles were labeled as "moat_unsafe" and the associated <a href="https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/corporate/acquisitions/grapeshot-methodology.pdf">avoidance</a> categories.</i></p><p>Dr. Augustine <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou">Fou</a>, a cybersecurity and anti-ad fraud consultant who previously taught digital marketing strategy at NYU, had posted 123 articles on Forbes’ CMO <a href="https://www.forbes.com/cmo-network/">network</a> section. Of these, 59 articles (48% of total) were marked as “moat_unsafe”, with 58 labeled as “gv_crime”, while <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2020/06/03/its-4am-do-you-know-where-your-ads-ran/">one</a> was labeled as unsafe due to “gv_adult”.</p><p>Tiffany <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tiffany-hsu">Hsu</a>, a New York Times media reporter focusing on advertising and marketing, had 121 out of 358 of her articles (33.8%) between 2015 and 2020 marked as “unsafe” by Οracle Grapeshοt.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TKqPLZgegyHSMeuA0Jt4IWwQRykvl2oI1GK5h0PbewzwvaLzCcICCQMUdpQ9A725WHckDGNmEqFocHayq0E7MJJXeXcNpennBljYshws-I8VXdUJ9lC85ysQAS-wLYdRAYOXXQof" alt="null"><i>Screenshot of Chrome Developer Tools illustrating that a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/business/media/holiday-commercials-coronavirus-pandemic.html">article</a> by New York Times journalist Tiffany Hsu was marked as “unsafe” due to “gv_death_injury”</i></p><p>It appears that a large number of Hsu’s nytimes.com articles are labeled as containing hate speech (“gv_hatespeech”), or depicting or promoting crime, terrorism, or adult content (“gv_crime”, “gv_terrorism”, “gv_adult”, respectively).
