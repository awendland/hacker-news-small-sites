<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>Some people are not satisfied with a webcam from their notebook or an old webcam
they bought many years ago.</p>
<p>My brother decided he wants to try streaming. Some people can just do a thing
and other people want to research all the bits and pieces beforehand. Our chat
history is comparable in length to all my other chats combined, so I learned a
lot of it as well. The craft is full with small details and inconveniences.</p>
<p>He found that there are basically no good webcams. A lot of the time an image
quality is meh, and the rare presence of 4k is usually not better than 1080p,
because resolution is not quality. Some camera apparently does upscaling from
1080p to 4k in its driver, indicated by poor quality and high CPU load. He also
has a really good camera, Fujifilm X-T1. It can't be used as a webcam when
connected to a USB port. Usually it's possible to buy an HDMI-to-USB converter,
but his camera can't output a live stream into HDMI, only a recorded video.</p>
<p>So we had an idea — maybe it is possible to create a good webcam
ourselves. Would anybody care? Well, it’s almost 2021 now, streaming is still on
the rise, pandemic is going strong and video meetings are everywhere. People are
willing to spend some money, as indicated by countless videos on YouTube
regarding the problem.</p>
<p>Let’s start with defining what is a good webcam.</p>
<p>A good webcam, in my opinion, is a device that provides a decent sound quality,
at least on par with recent MacBooks, and an image quality on par with top
smartphones, such as iPhone 11/12, Huawei P40 Pro, etc. As smartphones have a
good image quality, then we could probably manufacture a webcam from smartphone
parts that are cheap and easily available. How hard can it be?</p>
<p>If you’ve read at least a couple of articles on the topic of video production,
you will know that to make quality content from the technical standpoint you
need three things, in that particular order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sound</li>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Video quality</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's discuss these properties and later how to manufacture it.</p>
<h3 id="sound">Sound<a href="#sound" aria-label="Anchor link for: sound">🔗</a></h3>
<p>If you have a recent MacBook, it provides a decent sound quality with its
three-mic array. I haven't researched it and don’t know much about other
notebooks' audio quality. If you have a desktop PC, you have to have some
external mic anyway.</p>
<p>If the web camera has shitty audio quality, you’ll have to buy additional
gear. When I researched the topic, one of the recently released webcams
(available from October 2020) with RRP of $180 was producing a sound as if a
person sits in a big plastic barrel with a closed lid. Their voice was very
muffled with lots of resonant rattles. That level of quality wasn’t acceptable
10 years ago, how this piece of gear could have been produced in 2020 escapes my
understanding.</p>
<p>There are many good enough USB mics for $50+, you also can buy a great XLR
microphone for $100, but then you’ll need an external sound card with phantom
power supply. A decent one can easily cost you $200.</p>
<p>With almost any of these options you’ll have to install and configure some
software that will provide sound level compression, noise suppression (because
your notebook fans are spinning like hell) and won’t produce clicks in the
process.</p>
<p>I would like my webcam to do this by itself, no rattling, minimized echo, etc.</p>
<h3 id="light">Light<a href="#light" aria-label="Anchor link for: light">🔗</a></h3>
<p>A lot of what makes a picture great comes from lighting the scene in a correct way.</p>
<p>The simplest thing is to sit in a room so the window is in front of you and the
Sun isn’t shining into a lens from behind your shoulder.</p>
<p>Webcam cannot provide decent lighting capabilities by itself, so I won’t spend
much time here. There is a <a href="https://www.razer.com/streaming-cameras/razer-kiyo/RZ19-02320100-R3M1">webcam by
Razer</a>
with a built-in LED circle, but it’s necessarily small, always shines from a
webcam direction and is mostly a gimmick.</p>
<p>We can rely somewhat on the good sensor here. If it provides good dynamic range,
HDR capabilities and good low-light performance, then a patch of sunlight on the
wall won't turn everything else black, or a poorly lit room won't turn into a
gray noisy picture with a bleak silhouette.</p>
<h3 id="image-quality">Image quality<a href="#image-quality" aria-label="Anchor link for: image-quality">🔗</a></h3>
<p>It’s impossible to get a good lens and image sensor into a notebook lid, because
lids are very thin. They’re often something like 4 mm thick all together, and
there is no escaping physics. Of course, it's possible to put a webcam into a
thick part below the lid, but then it'll be useful for expressing anger at our
colleagues with wide-open nostrils and not much else.</p>
<p>Maybe some crazy engineer in the future will develop an array of small sensors
with an array of tiny lenses and somehow combine all that into a good image
quality, but we don't have this tech yet. Any smartphone with a good camera has
that camera with an ugly protruding lens as a thickest part of the phone.</p>
<p>So, if you want something better than a notebook's webcam, you can get some
Logitech webcam with an image quality going back to 2012. It’s still better than
a laptop, but nowhere close to current smartphones.</p>
<p>What if you want better still? The next option is to install an app on the phone
and use it as a webcam. This gives a very good image quality, but it’s very
inconvenient and in some applications doesn’t work at all. For some reason it
isn’t always presented in applications as an option when choosing a video
source.</p>
<p>I don’t want to constantly attach, detach, charge my phone and tune the position of
a small tripod. What’s the next option?</p>
<p>The next option is to just buy a mirrorless photo-camera with a big fat 4/3” or
even APS-C sensor. It will cost $500+ for a new one (you can buy used for
cheaper). You will also need some gear to hold the camera in place, as it won’t
just rest on the top of the screen like a regular webcam. You also need an
HDMI-to-USB video grabber, and you need to be sure that the camera you buy can
output full resolution live onto that HDMI. Also make sure that it's possible to
turn off all on-screen info like <code>1/100s F3.5 ISO 800</code>, which is useful when
you're shooting photos and videos through viewfinder, but not so much when
you're in a video meeting. This feature is called "Clean HDMI".</p>
<p>Of course, you will have a lot of control over the whole stuff — set a
diaphragm, get good bokeh, set ISO, set white balance, etc. Do you actually need
it? Well, some of you do, and a lot of you do not. I learned all that stuff when
I was 16, but now I’m pretty happy with how my phone chooses everything for me
and just does great photos.</p>
<p>All that sounds pretty involved, isn’t it? It is a lot of time to research what
you need, how to set it all up, and a lot of money too.</p>
<h3 id="manufacturing-it">Manufacturing it<a href="#manufacturing-it" aria-label="Anchor link for: manufacturing-it">🔗</a></h3>
<p>So there is a market gap between so-so webcams for $100-200 and a full-blown
setup with a mirrorless camera, an external mic and lighting panels that will
cost almost a grand or two, if you're so inclined.</p>
<p>I thought that it is a good idea to create an "upmarket" webcam for $250-300
that will provide good audio and video quality, on par with current smartphones,
actually using the same parts. As smartphones are made in tens of millions, all
relevant parts should be cheap and easily obtainable.</p>
<p>I quickly contacted some people who could help me do the project — firmware
engineer, electric engineer and a company that does mechanical design.</p>
<p>What features are needed for a good webcam for streamers and video meetings?
Audio: good parts (mics and ADC), good mechanical design and assembly (so
nothing would rattle), and some post-processing. We certainly want some
beam-forming capabilities to be able to focus on the person in front of the
webcam, so we will need more than one microphone, maybe up to 4. These parts are
easy to obtain, there are many in stock, it's not a problem.</p>
<p>Even if I think that 4k is not needed, I’m pretty sure it’s really a requirement
to have in an upmarket webcam, as it will be really hard to sell a pricey webcam
that can only do 1080p.</p>
<p>Also would be very nice to have some neural network inference on the chip, so we
can run some AI stuff directly on the webcam without bothering a user’s computer
that can be busy with other things.</p>
<p>I easily found a three-piece assembly for the iPhone 11 Pro for fifty bucks,
two-piece from a Huawei P40 Pro for twenty five and a one-piece from P40 Lite for
ten dollars. That’s with a lens, and bought in retail. Does it mean it costs
peanuts (less than $5 for a sensor) to buy in bulk to produce my own webcam?
Well... Maybe. I can’t just go and buy a couple thousands of these sensors. I’m
pretty sure I can buy a couple thousands of replacement parts for phones, but
sensors themselves are not sold freely. It's easy to buy some "random" sensor
that was around for years and most certainly has "meh" quality by today's
standards, but we need a good one, with good dynamic range, HDR capabilities and
low-light performance.</p>
<p>I wrote to several vendors asking them what are the prices and conditions, and
basically their answer is either silence or “we’ll sell it if you will buy
hundreds of thousands per year”.</p>
<p>I've found suitable System-on-Chips, and it's the same — if we want to have
hardware 4k encoder, it's either "sorry, it was a demo part and we don't do it",
or "we have limited support capabilities, so we can only sell if you will buy
hundreds of thousands, maybe you want some SoMs from our partners?". It is
actually possible to buy System-on-Modules even in very small quantities, but
it's going to be pretty expensive and will be good for a prototype, but for
production it will blow past our budget. System-on-Module will cost almost the
same as the web camera itself.</p>
<p>Oh, and a lead time (from order to shipment) is systematically 16+ weeks. It
means they have no stock and will place an order at semiconductor foundry, have
it produced, packaged and sent to customer. Swiftly.</p>
<p>It means I cannot just build five hundred webcams, see how good are they selling
and build a couple thousand, and so on.</p>
<p>There is also a plastic injection step that requires upfront investment to
manufacture molds, and of course design and engineering costs. All combined it
was tens of thousands …</p></section></div>

            <!-- content --><p>In our Ampere Altra powered Wiwynn Mt. Jade server review, we are going to see why we feel this is the most significant new server of 2020.&nbsp;Wiwynn is far from a household name but it should not be unfamiliar to STH readers. STH got an exclusive tour in Q4 2018 of the company’s headquarters. You can read about that in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/where-cloud-servers-come-from-visiting-wiwynn-in-taipei/">Where Cloud Servers Come From Visiting Wiwynn in Taipei</a>. Although Wiwynn may not be called out in press releases such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/idc-3q20-server-tracker-dell-and-hpe-with-big-share-gain-lenovo-inspur-huawei/">IDC 3Q20 Server Tracker</a> it counts large cloud providers such as Facebook and Microsoft among its customers and has revenue of almost $6B USD per year the last time we checked. Compared to the traditional vendors IDC puts in their press releases, that would put them above Lenovo on hardware sales revenue, but with far fewer employees. Having the Wiwynn Mt. Jade server platform with the Arm-based Ampere Altra is a big deal. Wiwynn’s business model is not to sell low numbers of servers to customers.<span id="more-49470"></span></p>
<p>In this review, we are going to look at the platform, and discuss some of the great features and nuances. We are also going to discuss performance, and then we are going to discuss why this is one of the most important platforms to be released in 2020. Even if you are not interested in Arm servers, this review is going to have some insights that go well beyond just the Altra processor and the server itself.</p>
<h2>Video Version</h2>
<p>As with many of our new pieces, we are going to have a video version of this article as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Most Significant Server of 2020 Wiwynn Mt Jade Ampere Altra Arm Server" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jESiMLQVNf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a longer video, and has a lot of commentary around the server, and the market impact. As always, we suggest opening a new browser/ tab to watch it as it is a better experience than the embedded player. Also, likes and channel subscriptions are always welcome.</p>
<h2>Ampere Altra Wiwynn Mt. Jade Server Hardware Overview</h2>
<p>With our server reviews going into more detail, we now split our hardware overview into two primary sections. The first is that we look at the exterior of the server to get the basic bits that one servicing the server in a rack would most likely notice. We then get into the internal overview to look at some of the configurability and key features of the server.</p>
<h3>Ampere Altra Wiwynn Mt. Jade Server External Hardware Overview</h3>
<p>Taking a look at the Mt. Jade platform, we can see a fairly typical 2U server layout. This has a single USB port on the left, and a VGA port along with standard power button/ LEDs on the right. The main feature, by far, is storage. There are 24x 2.5″ bays and Wiwynn is leveraging the Ampere Altra platform to deliver one of the most forward-looking designs we have seen to date.</p>
<figure id="attachment_49484" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49484"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-wiwynn-mt-jade-server-review-the-most-significant-arm-server/wiwynn-mt-jade-ampere-altra-front-bays/" rel="attachment wp-att-49484"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-Front-Bays.jpg" alt="Wiwynn Mt Jade Ampere Altra Front Bays" width="800" height="462" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-Front-Bays.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-Front-Bays-400x231.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-Front-Bays-696x402.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-Front-Bays-727x420.jpg 727w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49484">Wiwynn Mt Jade Ampere Altra Front Bays</figcaption></figure>
<p>Wiwynn is connecting these 24x drive bays using 6x Amphenol PCIe Gen4 x16 cables. This is not a server designed for SAS/ SATA, instead, the company is leveraging the unique capabilities of the Ampere Altra platform to deliver something decidedly ahead of what many traditional vendors such as Dell, HPE, and Lenovo offer. Here the backplane does not have features such as a SAS expander. Instead, this is a NVMe backplane. One can see the backplanes are held in by thumbscrews, but the impact of Ampere Altra is felt immediately here, this is an all-NVMe design. This design provides Wiwynn the flexibility to swap to a SAS/SATA backplane setup if a customer wishes, but we really like this hardline stance to simplify on a next-generation architecture.</p>
<figure id="attachment_49479" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49479"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-wiwynn-mt-jade-server-review-the-most-significant-arm-server/wiwynn-mt-jade-ampere-altra-backplane/" rel="attachment wp-att-49479"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-Backplane.jpg" alt="Wiwynn Mt Jade Ampere Altra Backplane" width="800" height="534" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-Backplane.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-Backplane-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-Backplane-696x465.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-Backplane-629x420.jpg 629w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49479">Wiwynn Mt Jade Ampere Altra Backplane</figcaption></figure>
<p>The chassis itself has four of those drive bays (one cable’s worth) that are optionally connected. Although the cable is connected via the backplane here, the other end can be used in a PCIe Gen4 x16 header that can instead provide PCIe connectivity to rear risers. Ampere Altra has many PCIe lanes, but there are limits. Still, Wiwynn’s forward-looking design is moving beyond the limitations of PCB and has configurability on where PCIe lanes are directed. We will see more of this type of design in the PCIe Gen4 era but it will become increasingly commonplace as we move to PCIe Gen5 and beyond. Effectively, with Ampere Altra is providing Wiwynn with a platform that is already incorporating these design principles.</p>
<p>On the rear of the server, we see a fairly standard layout. The rear I/O consists of a VGA port, a management LAN port, a serial port, and two USB 3 ports. There are three blocks for I/O risers, two are full-height and one is low-profile. One can also see an OCP NIC 3.0 slot in the middle of the platform.</p>
<figure id="attachment_49490" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49490"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-wiwynn-mt-jade-server-review-the-most-significant-arm-server/wiwynn-mt-jade-ampere-altra-rear/" rel="attachment wp-att-49490"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-Rear.jpg" alt="Wiwynn Mt Jade Ampere Altra Rear" width="800" height="479" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-Rear.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-Rear-400x240.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-Rear-696x417.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-Rear-701x420.jpg 701w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49490">Wiwynn Mt Jade Ampere Altra Rear</figcaption></figure>
<p>The 2kW power supplies seem a bit large for the relatively lower power consumption of the Ampere Arm server chips. The 80Plus Platinum units are likely larger than a normal server of this class simply as this is also a development platform. As a result, people tend to plug a multitude of devices into this type of server. That can include many high-power NVMe SSDs up front, or even accelerators in the rear. We tried the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-tesla-t4-ai-inferencing-gpu-review/">NVIDIA T4</a> and it worked in this platform.</p>
<figure id="attachment_49489" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49489"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-wiwynn-mt-jade-server-review-the-most-significant-arm-server/wiwynn-mt-jade-ampere-altra-psu/" rel="attachment wp-att-49489"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-PSU.jpg" alt="Wiwynn Mt Jade Ampere Altra PSU" width="800" height="534" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-PSU.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-PSU-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-PSU-696x465.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Wiwynn-Mt-Jade-Ampere-Altra-PSU-629x420.jpg 629w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49489">Wiwynn Mt Jade Ampere Altra PSU</figcaption></figure>
<p>Part of the purpose of this piece is to show how similar the server is to a modern x86 server since that is a big question when organizations are looking to add Arm into their data centers.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to look at the internals of the server before proceeding with the remainder of our review.</p>

<p>Yesterday’s <a href="https://ruky.me/2020/12/21/a-to-do-app-that-fits-in-a-single-tweet/">post</a> was an awesome one, I learned a lot in JavaScript and and I was happy to see people doing what I thought impossible. Writing a simple todo app within 280 chars, in plain js.</p>
<p>After I finished writing the post, I wanted to share it on Reddit JavaScript community, r/javascript at the same time I shared it on HackerNews.</p>
<p>I have seen lot of comments on HackerNews criticizing the new Reddit design, using JavaScript and breaking in their mobile website, and constant nags pushing the users to their mobile app.</p>
<p>I was one of those few who liked their new design on desktop, no page loads between posting something, lot of white spaces, I feel most of the average users would be feeling the same, except for the tech community. But as a service Reddit should be looking at the common denominator, not the outliers.</p>
<p>I’m annoyed with the mobile app nag, when I visit the mobile website, Reddit is always asking me to download the mobile app. But I just cancel it and move along in the mobile browser.</p>
<p>But what happened yesterday just took me off the ledge. When I visited the r/javascript community on my iPad, I was greeted with this screen.</p>

<p>Why do you block me from from visiting the community from my mobile device?</p>
<p>Will the whole mobile website is scrapped and you end up with a landing page to download the mobile app?</p>
<p><strong>If you want to visit a popular subreddit</strong>, <strong>install our up and use it, or else login. </strong></p>
<p>I’ve managed to see the subreddit by requesting the desktop website, but I’m sure they will figure out a way, by checking the screen size to block this as well.</p>
<p>I understand that, as a company, you need to push to gain as much users as possible on their mobile devices, that’s the best way to track, to send notifications and keep you hooked and keep coming back. If I had a company like Reddit I might have done the same.</p>
<p>But for blocking users from their mobile devices, a service they once offered is a very dark pattern, instead what they should do is introduce some awesome features that will make the users download the app by themselves so they can enjoy those features. Not forcing the app though their throats.</p>
<p>Anyone else experienced a similar experience on Reddit mobile?</p>
<p><em>Only after writing the and checking the screenshot again made me see that they allow you to see the subreddit by logging in. But that is obscured and they intend to push users to download the app.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607775961422/elXIChWIZ.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to <!-- -->my<!-- --> newsletter and never miss <!-- -->my<!-- --> upcoming articles</p></div></div></div><div itemprop="text"><p>Before we get into Horcruxing, here's a quick prologue on online security hygiene. You can skip to the  <a href="#double-blind-passwords-aka-horcruxing">Horcruxing section</a>  if it seems redundant.</p>
<h3 id="rules-for-strong-online-security">Rules for Strong Online Security</h3>
<p>1.
<strong>Longer passwords (atleast 16 characters) are better than shorter ones</strong></p>
<pre><code>=&gt; cutesamantha15101995 &gt; cutesamantha
</code></pre><p>2.
<strong>Randomized passwords are better than personally identifiable passwords</strong></p>
<pre><code>=&gt; process-cancel-stingy-garnet &gt; cutesamantha15101995
</code></pre><p><strong>NOTE: </strong> <code>process-cancel-stingy-garnet</code> is technically a passphrase - basically an easy-to-remember password in comparison to randomized strings like <code>B6fSpxMj&amp;f6DU@5^k</code></p>
<p>3.
<strong>Have a <em>significantly</em> different password for each account</strong></p>
<p>Having the same password for different accounts is like using the same key for different locks. It beats the whole point of having multiple locks! Also, having different passwords but with only one easily guessable word different (like the ones below) still poses the same risk. The passwords should be <strong><em>significantly</em></strong> different.</p>
<pre><code>bounce-unfold-stunning-chute        process-cancel-stingy-facebook
symptom-untouched-unpaid-arena  &gt;   process-cancel-stingy-twitter
sediment-tweak-annually-koala       process-cancel-stingy-gmail
</code></pre><p>4.
<strong>Use 2FA/MFA wherever possible</strong></p>
<p>Both Google and Facebook offer a 2FA feature where you need the second factor only when you login from a new device or a new location, instead of needing 2FA every time. That's a rare combination of convenience &amp; security right there! 
Most other sites also offer some variation of 2FA.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Use the  <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp">andOTP</a>  (or any other) app's TOTP as the second factor since it cannot be spoofed or spied on lock-screen like the SMS OTP and does not require a mobile network or internet connection. You can also use Biometrics (finger print or face recognition)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Woah! How do I create a long password for each of the bazillion websites out there, <em>and</em> have them significantly different <em>and</em> remember them? Security seems like such a pain in the ass!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="enter-password-manager">[enter] <strong>PASSWORD MANAGER</strong></h3>
<p>A password manager helps you manage all your passwords in one place, either in the form of a browser extension, mobile app, or website. Good password managers will offer a browser extension and a mobile app with one-click auto-fill-login-page feature by removing the hassle of copy pasting or typing your login details. A few smart ones even detect phishing pages and warn you indirectly, by not showing the login details for such web pages.</p>
<p>They enable all the above measures for strong online security with ease. While I agree it takes some effort to set it up for the very first time. But, after that, it just flows like butter. </p>
<p><br>
For example, password generator in <a target="_blank" href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden</a> lets you custom design your random password in different flavours.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607770748804/m93T3kqUH.png?auto=compress" alt="BitWarden's password generator"></p>
<h3 id="yay-im-secure">YAY! I'm Secure!</h3>
<p>You meticulously move all your passwords and secrets to a trusted password manager. Finally, you can rest easy knowing that your digital life is truly secure. Or, is it?  <br></p>
<p><strong>What if </strong></p><ul>
<li>your master password (the password to your password manager) is compromised due to a security breach or you left it in plaintext on a post-it/ email/ notes app</li>
<li>someone gained temporary access to your unlocked system (computer or phone) when you stepped away to get that last coffee for the day and your password manager is still logged in for everyone to see</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer: you're <strong><em>screwed</em></strong>. The cost of putting all your eggs in one basket is that it could all go into oblivion in one fell swoop. How do you overcome this challenge now? </p>
<h3 id="double-blind-passwords-aka-horcruxing">Double Blind Passwords (aka Horcruxing)</h3>
<p>For all his faults, Voldemort did one good thing for us muggles. He gave us the concept of a horcrux. For the uninitiated, a horcrux is any object in which you store a piece of your soul, putting the proverbial eggs of your soul into different baskets, to gain quasi-immortality. </p>
<p><strong>The basic idea</strong>: You split your password into 2 parts - one which is stored in the password manager, and the other which is stored in your head (aka horcrux).</p>
<p>Basically, at any given point in time, you and your password manager know only a piece of the password. It's double-blind. In effect, just like You-Know-Who, you're splitting your password (soul) into pieces and storing them in different places.</p>
<h4 id="before">BEFORE</h4>
<pre><code>
<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: rollthepeople1732</span>


<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: rollthepeople1732</span>
</code></pre><h4 id="after">AFTER</h4>
<pre><code>
<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: roll-the-people-venus</span>


<span>horcrux: papel</span>


<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: roll-the-people-venuspapel</span>
</code></pre><p>The horcrux adds an additional layer of security that only you can unlock. It's a kind of 2FA. Again, the longer the horcrux the better. But, a simple word should also be fine as long as only you know the horcrux.</p>
<p>If it feels like too much effort, use a horcrux only for the most important logins - your social media, bank accounts etc. </p>
<h3 id="one-last-thing">One Last Thing</h3>
<p>Security is never absolute. One can try to secure a system as tightly as possible, but never really say that it is fully secure (if you see someone claiming otherwise, it's mostly marketing bullshit). If we cannot make systems completely secure, the next best thing to do is to make them as secure as possible and a good way to do it is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing">Defense In Depth</a> - basically make sure that even if one layer of security is breached, there exist other layers to mitigate further damage - which is what we've tried to achieve all along.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>1.
Use a good password manager </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use BitWarden (since it is open source and costs just $10 a year for the PRO features)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.
Use TOTP/ biometrics instead of SMS-based OTP</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use andOTP (since it is open source)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.
Use a horcrux (a double-blind password) for the most important logins</p>

<p>P.S. Keep in mind that horcruxing only works fine until you connect your brain to NeuraLink and accidentally upload your thoughts online for everyone to see. :P</p>

The GAFES<em> </em>were formed in 1986 as an elite quick reaction force specializing in counterinsurgency and unconventional warfare. When the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect in 1994, the GAFES received combat experience in the brutal fight with the leftist <em>EjÃ©rcito Zapatista de LiberaciÃ³n Nacional</em> (EZLN) in Chiapas. According to <a href="http://historic.edualter.org/material/ddhh/proc1.htm">reporting by Carlos Marin</a>, the army sent the GAFES to Chiapas to <strong>create paramilitary forces and displace the population</strong> in order to break the support of the people for the EZLN, an approach which would be used against organized crime years later. In Ioan Grillo's book <em>El Narco</em>, he describes how the mutilated bodies of rebels captured by the GAFES were dumped along a riverbank in the Las Margaritas municipality with their ears and noses sliced off, the sort of spectacular violence that <em>Los Zetas</em> would later standardize in the Drug War.</p><figure><img src="https://publish.narco.news/content/images/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-26-at-5.09.07-PM-1.png"><figcaption>2005 FBI memo about <em>Los Zetas</em></figcaption></figure><p>Some of the original members of <em>Los Zetas</em> are said to have been <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB499/DOCUMENT01-20050422.PDF">trained by the U.S.</a> at the notorious School of the Americas, although accounts vary about exactly who, where and when.

According to Lt. Col. Craig Deare (retired), the former Academic Dean of the Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies and a former Special Forces Commander, it's likely that more than 500 Mexican GAFES received training from U.S. special operations forces (SOF).</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2010/11/03/us-trained-cartel-terrorises-mexico/">reporting</a> in Al Jazeera:</p><p><em>Some of the cartelâ€™s initial members were elite Mexican troops, trained in the early 1990s by Americaâ€™s 7th Special Forces Group or â€œsnake eatersâ€� at Ft.

Created as an elite counterinsurgency force during the Cold War, the U.S. Army's 7th SFG has trained an unknown number of Kaibiles. Between 1999 and 2010, <a href="http://www.ghrc-usa.org/Publications/factsheet_kaibiles.pdf">3,555 Guatemalan soldiers</a>, many of them Kaibiles, were trained by the US through the School of the Americas (later renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, or WHINSEC), and other U.S. training programs. </p><p>The methods of the Kaibiles are notoriously barbaric. In training, they're given a puppy to look after and bond with for several weeks. At the end of training, the recruits are required to kill the animal using their bare hands, drink the blood and eat the flesh, a method which <a href="https://www.voltairenet.org/Los-Kaibiles-mexicanos">reportedly</a> has diffused to the Mexican GAFES and other security forces throughout the world who train with the Kaibiles. They are taught to kill without mercy or thought. Their motto is: "<em>Si avanzo, sÃ­gueme. Si me detengo, aprÃ©miame. Si retrocedo, mÃ¡tame!</em> / <em>If I advance, follow me. If I stop, urge me on. If I retreat, kill me!"</em></p><p>In 1982, the Kaibiles massacred 226 people in the Dos Erres village in Guatemala. According to the <a href="https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/s3fs-public/mos_en.pdf">United Nations Truth Commission Clarification</a>, the Kaibiles arrived in the middle of the night and accused the residents of being guerrilla sympathizers. The smallest children were killed by smashing their heads against various hard surfaces, while older children were killed with hammers. Adults were interrogated and tortured, one by one, and the women were raped. Fetuses were cut out of pregnant women.

<p>The Apple M1 available in the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 13”, and Mac Mini has
been the focus of a ton of benchmarking writeups and blog posts about
the new chip. The performance overall, and especially performance/watt,
that Apple has achieved with the chip is very impressive.
As a ray tracing person, what caught my eye the most was the
performance AnandTech reported in their
<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested/2">CineBench benchmarks</a>.
These scores were 1.6x higher than I got on my old Haswell desktop and 2x
higher than my new Tiger Lake laptop!
I had also been interested in trying out the new
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10012/">ray tracing API for Metal</a>
that was announced at WWDC this year,
which bears some resemblance to the DirectX, Vulkan, and OptiX GPU ray tracing APIs.
So, I decided to pick up a Mac Mini to do some testing
on my own interactive path tracing project,
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT">ChameleonRT</a>,
and to get it running on the new Metal ray tracing API.
In this post, we’ll take a look at the new Metal ray tracing
API to see how it lines up with DirectX, Vulkan, OptiX and Embree,
then we’ll make some fair (and some extremely unfair) ray tracing
performance comparisons against the M1.</p>

<!--more-->



<p><a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT">ChameleonRT</a> is an open source
interactive path tracer that I’ve been working on to learn the different ray tracing APIs,
and to provide an example or starting point for myself and others working with them
in other projects.
ChameleonRT provides backends for the GPU ray tracing APIs:
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/dxr">DirectX Ray Tracing</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/vulkan">Vulkan KHR Ray Tracing</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/optix">OptiX 7</a>.
Through the work discussed in this post, it also has a new
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/metal">Metal</a> GPU backend.
ChameleonRT also has an <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/embree">Embree backend</a>
for fast multi-threaded and SIMD accelerated ray tracing on CPUs through
<a href="https://www.embree.org/">Embree</a>, <a href="https://ispc.github.io/">ISPC</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB">TBB</a>.
The rendering code in each backend is nearly identical and they produce almost pixel exact outputs,
with some possible small differences due to subtle differences in the ray tracing
libraries or shader languages.</p>

<p>ChameleonRT is different from popular ray tracing benchmark applications like
<a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/cinebench">CineBench</a>, <a href="http://www.luxmark.info/">LuxMark</a>,
and <a href="https://opendata.blender.org/">Blender Benchmark</a>, in that ChameleonRT is
a minimal interactive path tracer. CineBench, LuxMark, and Blender Benchmark are excellent
for getting a full picture of what performance to expect from a production film
renderer, as they are production renderers. However, there’s a lot more going
on in a production renderer than just ray tracing to support the kind of complex
geometries, materials, and effects used in film; and the large code
bases can be challenging to quickly port to a new architecture or API.
ChameleonRT is the exact opposite, supporting just one geometry type,
triangle meshes, and one material type, the Disney BRDF.
The rest of the code is similarly written to achieve interactive path tracing performance,
though I have tried to balance this with how complex the code is to read.
For example, the renderers use iterative ray tracing instead of recursion,
support only a simple sampling strategy, and don’t support alpha cut-out effects.
The use of iterative ray tracing is valuable on both the CPU and GPU, but is
especially important on the GPU, as the
overhead of recursive ray tracing calls in the pipeline can have a significant performance impact.
Similarly, ignoring alpha cut-out effects allows the GPU renderers
to skip using an any hit shader (and the Embree on to skip needing an intersection
filter). The any hit shader (or intersection filter) would be called during
BVH traversal after a candidate intersection with a triangle is found.
In the case that the BVH traversal is hardware accelerated, this ends up
producing a lot amount of back and
forth between the fixed function traversal hardware and the shader cores to run the any hit
shader during traversal, limiting the hardware’s performance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s a path tracer? Path tracing is a technique in computer graphics for
rendering photo-realistic images by simulating the light transport in
the scene. It is a Monte Carlo technique, meaning that it randomly samples
light paths emitted from lights in the scene that reach the camera
by bouncing off objects in the scene. This is done by tracing the paths in reverse,
starting from the camera and tracing the path back through the scene.
A large number of light paths need to be sampled to produce a noise-free
image. Path tracing is not restricted to photo-realism, and is the
core rendering algorithm used in major film renderers, such as: Pixar’s Renderman,
Disney’s Hyperion, Autodesk’s Arnold, and Weta’s Manuka.
See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing">Wikipedia</a> for more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The new ray tracing API in Metal will be familiar to those who’ve used inline ray
tracing in DirectX or Vulkan. For a good introduction to Metal’s API, check out the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10012/">Discover ray tracing
with Metal</a> video from WWDC 2020,
and the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/accelerating_ray_tracing_using_metal?language=objc">accompanying sample</a>.
Inline ray tracing allows applications to make ray tracing calls in any shader stage,
e.g., fragment/pixel shaders, vertex shaders, compute shaders, etc.
Inline ray tracing allows ray tracing effects, for example accurate reflections and shadows,
to be integrated into the regular rasterization pipeline.
Inline ray tracing can also be used from a compute shader to implement a standalone
path tracing based renderer. ChameleonRT is a standalone path tracer, and takes
the compute shader approach for Metal.</p>

<p>At a high-level, ray tracing in Metal proceeds as follows: you upload your
geometry data, build bottom-level primitive acceleration structures over them, then create instances
referencing those acceleration structures and build a top-level acceleration structure over
the instances.
To render the scene you dispatch a compute shader and trace rays against the top-level
acceleration structure to get back intersection results. The intersection results provide
you with the intersected primitive and geometry IDs, and if using instancing, the instance ID.
Your shader can then look up the geometry data for the object that was hit and shade it,
after which it can continue tracing the path.</p>

<p>At this time Metal only supports inline ray tracing, in contrast to DirectX and Vulkan, which
also provide support for ray tracing pipelines. Ray tracing pipelines are used
to implement standalone ray tracing renderers, and is the approach ChameleonRT
uses in its DirectX and Vulkan backends.
OptiX only supports ray tracing pipelines.
Ray tracing pipelines require the creation of a Shader Binding Table to
provide the API with a table of functions to call when specific objects
in the scene are intersected. The SBT can be difficult to setup and debug,
and is a common point of difficulty for developers learning these APIs.
For more information about the SBT, check out my post
<a href="https://www.willusher.io/graphics/2019/11/20/the-sbt-three-ways">“The RTX Shader Binding Table Three Ways”</a>.
However, the potential benefit of the SBT is that the GPU can reorder or group function
calls to reduce thread divergence. With inline ray tracing, the developer
must do this themselves, or do without
(check out another video from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10013/">WWDC20</a>
for information here).
Right now, ChameleonRT does not do any reordering to reduce divergence.</p>

<p>Those familiar with Metal may know of the previous
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders/metal_for_accelerating_ray_tracing?language=objc">Metal Performance Shaders ray intersector</a>.
The new support for inline ray tracing improves on this by allowing the renderer
to move entirely to the GPU. The previous ray intersector worked by taking
batches of rays, finding intersections in the scene, and writing these results
back out to memory. Multiple compute shaders would need to be dispatched to
trace the primary rays and create shadow and secondary rays, then trace the shadow rays
and continue the secondary rays while filtering out paths that terminated.
This requires significantly more memory traffic and compute dispatches, introducing overhead
to the renderer. Such an approach is also not well suited to augmenting traditional
rasterization pipelines with ray tracing effects.
Approaches based on tracing and sorting rays and intersection information to extract
coherence are valuable for complex film renderers, and can be implemented efficiently using inline
ray tracing as well.
For example, <a href="https://www.yiningkarlli.com/projects/hyperiondesign.html">Disney’s Hyperion renderer</a>
uses sorting and batching extensively to
extract coherent workloads from an otherwise incoherent and divergent distribution of rays.
There’s also an excellent higher-level <a href="https://youtu.be/frLwRLS_ZR0">video</a> explaining how this
works.</p>

<p>The Metal ray tracing API is quite nice to work with.
It bears a lot of similarity to the other ray tracing APIs, but has been streamlined
to be easier to use.
For example, compare the code required to build and compact a BVH in
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/dxr/dxr_utils.cpp#L877-L977">DirectX</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/vulkan/vulkanrt_utils.cpp#L46-L214">Vulkan</a>
with <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/metal/metalrt_utils.mm#L318-L396">Metal</a>.
OptiX’s API provides a similar simplification, here’s the
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/optix/optix_utils.cpp#L183-L244">BVH build in OptiX</a>
for reference.
It’s also nice to have templates and C++ style functionality in the shader language,
a feature Metal shares with OptiX, which uses CUDA for the device side code.</p>

<p>This simplicity also has some drawbacks. For example, while in DirectX, Vulkan, and OptiX
you have control over where the acceleration structure memory is allocated,
Metal makes this allocation for you. As a result, you cannot allocate the acceleration
structures on a <code>MTLHeap</code>, and so to make sure they’re available for your rendering
pipeline, you must individually mark them as used in a loop instead of a single <code>useHeap</code> call.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span></span><span>// Use our top level acceleration structure</span>
<span>[</span><span>command_encoder</span> <span>setAccelerationStructure</span><span>:</span><span>bvh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bvh</span> <span>atBufferIndex</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>
<span>// Also mark all mesh acceleration structures used, as they're indirectly</span>
<span>// referenced by the top level one</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>auto</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mesh</span> <span>:</span> <span>bvh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>meshes</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>command_encoder</span> <span>useResource</span><span>:</span><span>mesh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bvh</span> <span>usage</span><span>:</span><span>MTLResourceUsageRead</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This can add some overhead if you have a lot of bottom level BVHs, as can be the
case in scenes with many instances.
It’d be nice to be able to allocate the acceleration structures on a heap, and replace this loop
with a single <code>[command_encoder useHeap:data_heap-&gt;heap];</code></p>

<p>The API is also simplified significantly by not including ray tracing pipelines and
only requiring a Shader Binding Table-esque
structure when implementing custom geometries or other operations that need
to happen …</p></div></div></div>

      <em>BASIC Computer Games</em></a>,
      published by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Computing">Creative Computing</a>,
      inspired a generation of programmers.  The games were written by many people, and compiled by
      <a href="http://www.swapmeetdave.com/Ahl/DHAbio.htm">David H. Ahl</a>. The fabulous illustrations
      accompanying each game were done by

      I've included all the games here for your tinkering pleasure.
      I've tested and tweaked each one of them to make sure they'll run with Vintage BASIC, though you may see
      a few oddities. That's part of the fun of playing with BASIC: it never works quite the same on two machines.
      The games will play better if you keep CAPS LOCK on, as they were designed to be used with capital-letter
      input.

      <a href="http://www.classicbasicgames.org/">classicbasicgames.org</a>, with the exception
      of Civil War and Super Star Trek, which I entered myself.  The descriptions mainly come

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><img src="https://www.softinio.com/img/unicomp_new_model_m.png"><p>Unicomp new Model M keyboard is the latest version of the classic and fabulous IBM Model M keyboard that came out earlier this year. This blog post is my unboxing and review of this timeless keyboard.</p><p>My favorite keyboard of all time was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard">IBM Model M keyboard</a>. Through out the 1980s and the 1990s I would exclusively use this keyboard. In fact as I type this blog post I can confirm I still have 3 of them in my garage back in London, England.</p><p>Ever since I moved to the USA, both at work and at home I have been using various keyboards by Apple. Though I have nothing bad to say about the Apple keyboards, after all they are cosmetically pleasing, of high build quality and work really well with all things Apple, I started really missing my IBM Model M. This is when I found out Unicomp have released a new Model M and I decided to buy one.</p><h2 id="who-are-unicomp">Who are Unicomp?</h2><p>When IBM decided to stop manufacturing keyboards, a company called Lexmark bought their equipment and all rights to their keyboards and continued making them. In turn Lexmark stopped manufacturing keyboards too and at that point some ex-IBM and ex-Lexmark staff got together, purchased all the manufacturing equipment and rights to continue manufacturing the keyboards (but of course without the IBM and Lexmark branding) and setup a new company called <code>Unicomp</code>. <a href="https://www.pckeyboard.com/">Unicomp</a> has since continued producing these keyboards for like the last 25 years.</p><h2 id="unboxing">Unboxing</h2><p>This is how it was delivered:</p><p><img src="https://www.softinio.com/img/unicomp_model_m_box.png" alt="Unicomp New Model M box"></p><p>When the package arrived I could feel the keyboard moving inside the box, but when I opened the box I saw how well it was packed:</p><p><img src="https://www.softinio.com/img/unicomp_model_m_open_box.png" alt="Unicomp New Model M opened box"></p><p>I took it out of its box and removed all packaging material it was wrapped in:</p><p><img src="https://www.softinio.com/img/unicomp_model_m_out_of_box.png" alt="Unicomp New Model M Keyboard"></p><h2 id="review">Review</h2><p>As I looked at the keyboard, before taking it out of the box, I could immediately tell it was a Model M and its evolution. Super excited and impatient I took it out of the box. My first observation was that it comes with a USB (standard not USB-C) cable that is not removable. It felt lighter in weight than the original IBM Model M I had. Next I looked at its build quality and was overall impressed. The original IBM Model M does feel more robust but I could not fault this new Model M. All this was to be expected though, as I didn’t have my expectation set to receiving a keyboard that is made by 100% the same materials as the original Model M I had.</p><p>Having one of the newer macbooks with only USB-C ports, I set my new keyboard on my desk and plugged it in via a USB adapter and off I went looking for excuses to type so I can use my new keyboard.</p><p>I am thoroughly enjoying using this keyboard. Its typing feel and size are on par with the original Model M I had. I had forgotten how much more comfortable it is to type on Model M than an Apple keyboard. Comparing now, I can see that my hands are too big for the Apple keyboards so I would try to type in a cramped space to fit my hands in, as opposed to this Model M which is perfect for my hand size. This alone has resulted in me being able type faster, be more comfortable and make virtually no typing mistakes. As always I find the higher actuation point feel and the audible feedback the sound provided by the buckling springs with each keystroke incredibly pleasing. Comparing the sound of the buckling springs with the original IBM Model M, I would say the new Unicomp Model M is slightly quieter.</p><h3 id="how-well-does-it-work-with-macos">How well does it work with macOS</h3><p>When I went to place my order on Unicomp website they only had a windows version of the new Model M listed. Whilst that will work fine with macOS, it does have some features missing compared to a keyboard that has dedicated support for macOS, such as volume control, music play/stop/previous track /next track keys. Good news is I called Unicomp and spoke to Troy about this and he was kind enought to tell me I can place an order and request a custom configuration at a small fee to have the extra macOS features added. I did that and my keyboard has all the extra macOS keys functioning as expected. It even has the window key replaced with the macOS command key.</p><p><img src="https://www.softinio.com/img/unicomp_model_m_mac_keys.png" alt="Unicomp New Model M with macOS layout"></p><h3 id="unicomp-quality-of-service">Unicomp quality of service</h3><p>When you first visit Unicomp website, you get the sense that you just visited a website from 20 years ago with not the best user experience browsing or ordering. When you research Unicomp on the internet you won’t find much activity on social media or any form of marketing.</p><p>Please do not be put off by this and don’t judge them because of their dated look. The quality of service I received is one of the best I have ever received. When I called to find out more about the New Model M not only was the help I received exemplarity, but once I placed my order, even though it had the custom configuration of macOS support added was shipped within 24 hours of placing the order and the item received is fantastic in every possible way.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I am back again reunited with my old friend a Model M. I am enjoying using it so much after a gap of not having one that I am looking for excuses to use it more and more. So expect more <a href="https://www.softinio.com/">blogs</a> and <a href="https://softinio.substack.com/">newsletters</a> from me going forward, as this keyboard is a joy to use.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.pckeyboard.com/page/product/NEW_M">Link to Unicomp Model M that I ordered</a></li></ul></article></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Should web maps be centralized services?</p>

<p>
How many web applications or mobile apps do you use that have a map component? Rideshare apps display the location of drivers and passengers; ratings sites show the locations of restaurants; Craigslist and Wikipedia show contextual location for classifieds or encyclopedia articles. High quality, interactive maps are pervasive and simply fade into the background for end users.
</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has created a surge of new mapping applications. Beyond websites that <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">visualize the case count in different regions</a>, maps have become <b>critical computing infrastructure</b> for delivering health services.
</p>

<div>
    <div>
        <h5>Maps as Infrastructure</h5>
        <p>The New York City government uses Google Maps to help residents find a COVID-19 testing location near them.</p>
        
    </div>
    <p><img src="https://bdon.org/blog/web-map-services/NYCCovidSites.png">
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <div>
        <h5>Maps and Citizen Tech</h5>
        <p>The Taiwan government rationed face masks at pharmacies and published inventories via a public API; this enabled citizen developers, in combination with geocoding services and third-party basemaps, to create a variety of web and smartphone applications.</p>
        
    </div>
    <p><img src="https://bdon.org/blog/web-map-services/Pharmacies.jpg">
    </p>
</div>

<p>
For a developer who wants to integrate a map into their application, the choices are almost always to use a <b>hosted, centralized map service</b>; developer map mindshare is dominated by multinational companies. Some hosted map examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The embeddable native maps on Google's Android or Apple's iOS/iPadOS/macOS/watchOS operating systems</li>
    <li>Google's commercial web map offering (Google Maps JavaScript API)</li>
    <li>Microsoft's recent release of Azure Maps and Amazon's AWS Location Service</li>
    <li>Commercial map GIS companies such as ESRI, MapQuest, CloudMade, HERE and Mapbox; free hosted maps like <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap Carto</a> or <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/">maps by Stamen Design</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>What is a basemap?</h4>

<p>Typical parts of a map application include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Translation from search tokens or addresses to locations (geocoding)</li>
    <li>Determining the place name or administrative division of a location (reverse geocoding)</li>
    <li>Finding directions between two locations (routing)</li>
    <li>Overlaying of domain-specific geographic features, such as COVID-19 testing sites</li>
    <li><b>Showing physical and cultural context</b> on maps, such as city names, nearby points of interest, and roads</li> 
</ul>

<p>It's this last component that we usually call a <b>basemap</b> - especially if it <b>displays map labels</b>, and is zoomable or <b>multi-resolution, implying the application of <i>cartographic generalization</i></b>.


</p><div>
    <div>
        <h5>Map Labels</h5>
        <p>A basemap is most useful for context if it displays map labels. Labels may be in a single language, but might display more than one language, alternate names, or transcriptions: for example, Romaji labels on maps of Japan.</p>
         
    </div>
    <p><img src="https://bdon.org/blog/web-map-services/LabelScript.jpg">
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <h5>Generalization - More Art than Science</h5>
        <p>When the map scale is decreased - in this case by a factor of 2 - less relevant geographic features can be removed from the map. The ideal generalization <b>keeps the visual density of the map constant as scale is decreased</b>, even though the number of geographic features existing within those bounds increases exponentially.</p>

<p>
Single-scale wayfinding maps you see in the real world are labeled and generalized by cartographers; multi-scale basemap services accomplish this in an <b>automated way</b>. The sophistication of computer programs to do this - especially at whole earth scale - can be grossly underestimated, even by experienced programmers. Good labeling and generalization are taken for granted, like good font rendering and typesetting - invisible when successful, glaringly flawed when unsuccessful. 
</p>
<p>This also illustrates the key difference between a basemap and a dataset of geographic features, such as <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>. <b>OSM is not a cartographic product; it does not attempt any generalization or ranking of features. </b> <a href="http://naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a> is an example of a cartographic product - it include fields such as <code>scalerank</code> to assist in generalization, curated by human editors.
</p>
<p>
<b>In theory, basemaps are fungible</b> - the cartographic context required is similar among diverse applications. So why do developers - and as a consequence, the World Wide Web - gravitate towards a small handful of hosted map platforms?
</p>

<h4>Mapmakers: Victims of Lofty Expectations</h4>

<p>
    The basemap status quo is defined by the cutting edge commercial product, and right now that's Google Maps. <b>Users are accustomed to, and will demand, a seamless abstraction of the physical world.</b> Map panning and zooming should be instantaneous, so designers of a high performance cartographic system must take into account:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The completeness and quantity of the underlying geodata</li>
    <li>The arrangement and indexing of geodata to achieve low latency</li>
    <li>Tile schemes and partitioning for generalized data</li>
    <li>Protocols for fetching and caching those tiles over the network</li>
    <li>Choice of a rasterization API like Cairo or OpenGL and the flow of vertex data to them</li> 
</ul>
<p>
The desired end product is a videogame-like, sixty-frames-per-second experience, and map systems often make the same technical compromises as games: for example, a map system that smoothly resizes labels in real time may choose to precompute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_distance_function#Applications">signed distance fields</a> for text glyphs on the server and fetch them by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)#Basic_Multilingual_Plane">codepoint ranges</a>. This works beautifully for languages that use at most a few hundred Latin characters, but navigating to places that use Han characters such as China or Japan will degrade performance. Thus a cartographic system demands holistic design around tradeoffs such as latency or localization capabilities.
</p>

        <h5>Not Good Enough Anymore</h5>
        <p>Mapquest in the early 2000s required the user to click arrow buttons to pan and zoom; maps in 2020 are expected to respond instantly to mouse wheel scroll and finger pinch gestures.</p>

<h4 id="cartography-commodity">Serving Maps: best left to BigCorps?</h4>
<p>
    Given the demanding technical requirements above, it's easy to be led into thinking <b>maps are too hard for individual developers to solve and should be outsourced to a third-party hosted service.</b> A cartographic system is very "full-stack" in nature, but the commoditization of some potential components, like PostGIS or HTTP accelerators, makes the overall task less daunting. Bigness isn't really a constraint; the OpenStreetMap dataset as XML is <a href="https://planet.openstreetmap.org/">about 100 gigabytes</a>. Let's estimate 10x expansion to make a cartographic product; that's still only a terabyte of data to put on a disk somewhere.
</p>
<p>
<b>Developers believe something is too hard, until it isn't.</b> Issuing of SSL Certs was in practice limited to a few Certificate Authorities until Let's Encrypt; Hosting of seekable video content was only done by big sites in concert with CDNs, but now we have the standardized, hardware-accelerated HTML <code>video</code> element and ubiquitous broadband. Email is a notable counterexample; you've been able to run your own Mail Transfer Agent since the beginning, but the Hobbesian underworld of spam and phishing drives users into the oligopoly of a few providers.
</p>

<p>Serving maps is hard but not insurmountable; I'll suggest a factor limiting the landscape of web maps is not data bigness or the speed of slinging geodata down tubes, but licensing and realities of the market.</p>

<h4 id="cartography-commodity">Intellectual Property, Fine Print</h4>
<p>Firstly, mapmaking businesses rightly assert copyright over their cartography. This far predates webmaps: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_street">Trap Streets</a> are a longstanding practice on print maps. This is often true even if the map is built from open data such as OSM - the derivation of a cartographic product, and quality of output, is "secret sauce" to achieve product differentiation.
</p>
<p><b>Secondly, map serving easily admits a Software-As-A-Service (SaaS) business model.</b> Shrink-wrapped software, or creating a piece of software and "selling it in a box", has been out of vogue for decades, possibly over piracy concerns, or because it has less extractive potential on enterprise budgets. 
In addition to copyright, <b>Terms of Service for hosted maps often prohibit combination with other geographic services, exclude specific use cases, or forbid caching.</b> These contracts work against developers by inventing scarcity: even if you need a small subset of map tiles, they must be fetched and billed; don't scrape the data and put it in version control.</p>
<p>
<b>The freemium, ToS-constrained nature of hosted map services disincentivizes innovation.</b> Inability to swap out the Google Maps frontend means interesting problems like labeling and generalization can't be attacked with piecemeal incrementalism. This tips developer's scales toward <i>Buy</i> rather than <i>Build</i>, especially when the hosted pay-per-hit product starts out free, often as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader">loss leader</a> for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling">bundle</a> of geospatial services. These market realities leave some mapping use cases underserved by existing technology.
</p>

<h4>Map applications ought to outlive the SaaS business lifecycle</h4>

<p>Accessing a web map over the network isn't always practical. Maps may need to be displayed on air-gapped internal applications, or work offline without cell tower reception.</p>

<p>Also, websites and mobile applications are often built by organizations separate from their long-term maintainers (e.g. universities, museums, cultural institutions); ambitious visualization projects may be deterred by clients not wanting to foot a pay-per-hit subscription. An application depending on a hosted map service may be permanently disabled if the provider deprecates their API. <b>Hard dependencies on hosted services make software worse</b> - if your data visualization uses Google Maps, don't count on it still working in a couple years.</p>
<div>
    <div>
        <h5>Small-Scale Map Apps</h5>
        <p><a href="https://bdon.org/blog/web-map-services/80s.nyc">80s.nyc</a> is a streetview-like application for navigating historical images of New York City. It can be useful for <a href="https://medium.com/@dougbarclay/nana-at-the-doorway-4cf91888233b">discovering lost pictures of your great-grandmother</a>. Depending on a hosted basemap API would expose non-commercial projects to the whims and business models of SaaS providers.</p>

            <h3>My Engineering Axioms</h3>

            <p>A few months back I gave a talk in which I shared a list of my personal engineering axioms – things that, over the years, I've come to think of as generally true and useful to have in mind when writing code, building things, and working with others.</p>

            <p>Axiom is a fancy word, but popping a few layers off the etymology stack we arrive neatly at the ancient Greek word <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%80%CE%BE%CE%AF%CF%89%CE%BC%CE%B1">ἀξίωμα</a>, or "that which is thought fit or worthy". I like that, and consider each item on the list at least worthy of consideration.</p>

            <p>Of course they're <b>my</b> engineering axioms – things I believe to be useful based on my own experience. Your experience may well differ. Maybe you already knew about <a href="https://martinrue.com/zzuy-a-lesson-in-perseverance/">zero termination</a>, or have better tools than <a href="https://martinrue.com/give-yourself-more-playtime/">scissors to remove bugs</a> from your programs.</p>

            <p>In any case, I thought it would be fun to share the list here, with a few brief clarifications. Some things are pretty unsurprising, but hopefully others will generate some provocative thoughts and/or interesting disagreements.</p>

            <h4>1. Change is constant.</h4>

            <p>This one shouldn't be too controversial. Almost everything is always changing, including the rate of change itself. We need to acknowledge not only that our ability to respond to change is crucial, but that how well we do it (time, cost, quality, reliability) is often a dimension of our competitiveness.</p>

            <h4>2. Your product is an asset, but code is a liability.</h4>

            <p>Your product solves your customer's problem(s), and therefore is your asset. The code itself is the cost of creating the asset. The more code you have, the more it needs to be read, tested, changed, and understood. This is especially relevant when you consider axiom 1. Accept new code (and dependency on external code) conservatively. The best code is code you don't have to write.</p>

            <h4>3. Duplication is less costly than premature abstraction.</h4>

            <p>Until you have a high degree of confidence that your abstraction is going to pay for itself because it solves a real, abstract problem you really do have, don't do it. Wait and learn more. Until then, repeating code can help avoid dependency, which itself makes the code easier to change independently or delete. A premature abstraction creates complexity through dependency and indirection, and can become a bottleneck to your ability to respond to change.</p>

            <h4>4. Code should be easy to delete.</h4>

            <p>Write code to be removable, which in large part is the same as saying "decoupled". For sure not all code needs to be similarly removable, but minimising dependencies, having clear boundaries via well-defined interfaces, and having a thoughtful overall system design allows parts to be removed/changed more easily. I once heard someone use the expression "code spent", as an alternative to "code written" and I love that. I like the implication that removing code is reducing future cost.</p>

            <h4>5. Existing code exerts a powerful influence.</h4>

            <p>The very fact it's there suggests it's correct and necessary. Hopefully it is, but not always. We need to maintain both the confidence to change it, and the ability to reason about whether we should. Don't let the existence of code itself create doubt that it can't be removed. As per axiom 4, it should be easy to remove, and the system design should be good enough to enable us to understand whether we still need it.</p>

            <h4>6. Accidental complexity is one of the biggest risks.</h4>

            <p>Accidental complexity is complexity that can be avoided, and occurs due to things like poor design, bad decisions, and not prioritising an appropriate level of simplicity within a system. If simplicity is not a goal, accidental complexity is more likely to occur as a system grows, and will gradually negatively affect almost everything from changing the system to even being able to understand it. The 2006 paper <a href="http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf">Out of the Tar Pit</a> is a worthwhile read on this subject.</p>

            <h4>7. Technical excellence can be shadowed by bad personal skills.</h4>

            <p>Unless you're working completely alone, it's not just your ability to solve technical problems, to write good code, etc, that matters. To the contrary, they matter even less if you make the people around you unhappy and less productive. Just like learning to write good code, you have to learn "to people" good as well. Empathy is a big part of this, as is recognising that people are different – be caring, be understanding, help others and ask for help yourself, be nice. Be an engineer others want to work with.</p>

            <h4>8. You are not your code. Be kind to the coder, not to the code.</h4>

            <p>Code is merely a moment in time that captured what we thought we knew about something. It's not you. You may have wrote it, but since that moment (even if it was 3 minutes ago) you've grown, but the code has not. A conversation about code, good or bad, should never be personal. Keep it professional. Talk about the code, or about the problem, but don't make it about the person who wrote it. Use "we" instead of "you". Sometimes I try to pretend I wrote the code someone else wrote, which helps me avoid accidentally sounding personal.</p>

            <h4>9. Treat people who know less than you with respect and patience.</h4>

            <p>We all start somewhere, and the journey is a lot more joyful when you're surrounded by patient people who want you to succeed, rather than those who make you feel like you don't belong. If you struggle with this, it may be helpful to remember that the newbie programmer almost certainly does something better than you do – perhaps they're fluent in another language, or cook amazingly, or play a sport. Just imagine yourself in the reverse role. How would you like them to treat you, the total newbie? Again: be an engineer others want to work with.</p>

            <h4>10. The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position.</h4>

            <p>Knowledge and understanding of the problem, the domain, the customer, are all far more important than whatever the first 3 letters on your business card are. <a href="https://youtu.be/cISYzA36-ZY?t=85">Even if it does have a watermark</a>. Understand how something works from first principles, build a solid understanding, and authority will follow.</p>

            <h4>11. Teaching is a form of learning in disguise.</h4>

            <p>If you think you know something, try teaching it. Often the very act of trying to explain what you know to someone else forces you to formalise your own thoughts much more clearly. Writing things down seems to have a similar effect. I've lost count of the number of times I've begun explaining something only to find I don't quite understand it as well as I thought.</p>

            <h4>12. Lift the skills of people around you, not just yourself.</h4>

            <p>A great team is never a great because of one amazing person. It's a great team because everyone challenges each other and everybody grows together. When you learn something cool, share it – help the people around you get better. As they do the same, everybody benefits and nobody gets left behind. It's also far more fun. Secondary benefit: axiom 11.</p>

            <h4>13. The longer you wait the more you'll know.</h4>

            <p>I'm still learning this and trying hard to avoid my almost default desire to decide quickly. The truth is, the longer you delay non-essential decisions the more information you'll have to lean on when the time comes to make it. Of course you can't always procrastinate a decision, but often you can, and as a minimum you should at least consider whether not knowing the answer right now is actually OK.</p>

            <h4>14. A good type system is worth its weight plus some.</h4>

            <p>Having gone backwards and forwards through various static and dynamic languages over my career, I'm currently of the opinion that a good type system is worth its overhead. A good type system shouldn't carry all that much overhead. If the type system is designed well, it can almost feel like a dynamic language (via features like inference and flow analysis) while removing a whole class of issues that the compiler can handle far better and quicker than you can. Developments like ownership in Rust are a nice example of how this has gone even further than people would have imagined years back.</p>

            <h4>15. The right team of people trumps everything else.</h4>

            <p>Having a team of people who just want to work together and build great things makes a lot of other problems easier to deal with. The word "right" here is highly subjective and contextual, but at least anecdotally, empathy, respect, and friendship have been recurring elements of great teams I've been part of.</p>

            <h4>16. Stick to boring technology, unless there's a good reason not to.</h4>

            <p>Boring tech is often older and better understood. There's battle-hardened experience of how to use it effectively, better understanding of its failure modes, and it's easier to find people and resources on how to best apply it. I really like Dan McKinley's idea of <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">innovation tokens</a>. You only get 3. Use them to adopt or build brand new stuff – ideally stuff that will make you better at your core competency – but any more than 3 and the risk of never reaching stability/maturity starts to grow.</p>

            <h4>17. Have the smallest team possible, but no smaller. Grow it carefully.</h4>

            <p>A play on a well-known quote, and your mileage may vary on this one. In my career so far, I've reliably seen smaller teams be more effective than larger ones. There's a balance to be found, for sure, which depends on the magnitude and complexity of the problem you're solving. That said, smaller teams benefit from less communication overhead, less room for miscommunication, and more space for everyone's voice to be heard. In a smaller team, it also feels more personal, and I feel more responsible, and I like that.</p>

            <h4>18. Rest.</h4>

            <p>I'm happy to see the gradual de-sexification of …</p></article></div>

      <p>There's a well-known quote by author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pollan">Michael Pollan</a>:
        "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." I like it because it doesn't
        attempt to be dogmatic: it encapsulates some basic guiding principles that get
        you 90% of the way there 90% of the time. Wikipedia describes the book the quote
        is from (emphasis mine):</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>He explains...the notion that nutritionism and, therefore, the whole Western
          framework through which we intellectualize the value of food <strong>is more a religious
and faddish devotion to the mythology of simple solutions than a convincing and
reliable conclusion of incontrovertible scientific research</strong>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That...sounds familiar.</p>
      <h2 id="write-code">Write code </h2>
      <p>Code, like food, has value. I think those of us who write it can (hopefully)
        agree on that. Some, though, are so afraid of writing/eating
        <em>too much</em> that they avoid writing/eating what they should.</p>
      <p>In the context of programming, I think this translates to an unhealthy fear
        (again, for some) of duplication. A little bit of duplication - writing
        something in a way that doesn't completely maximize conciseness - isn't the end
        of the world. Sometimes it's the best path forward. Sometimes it's okay to
        copy-and-modify here and there, especially when you're still figuring out what
        your application will end up being.</p>
      <h2 id="not-too-much">Not too much </h2>
      <p>Of course too much code, like too much food, can also be a bad thing. This is
        a well-trodden topic so I don't feel the need to go too far into it here.</p>
      <p>Just be aware of your project's "appetite": write what needs to be written,
        and then try not to over-indulge.</p>
      <h2 id="mostly-functions">Mostly functions </h2>
      <p>By "functions" here I mean "pure functions". You could make a case that pure
        functions aren't the "plants" of code, though I feel
        that they are. In my experience most codebases have a pure functional
        subset, and I believe writing that subset in a pure-functional style is nearly
        always a win for the long-term health of the project.</p>
      <p>Of course the qualifier is "mostly": this isn't a dogma. Writing a 100%
        functional system ("going vegan", if you will) often requires you to jump
        through a bunch of extra hoops to get all the functionality you need. Looking
        at it solely from the perspective of health, those extra complications may not
        be worth it.</p>
      <p>And then different projects have different needs: just as an athlete may need
        a larger percentage of protein, or individuals may have certain nutrient
        deficiencies, a project may only have a very small functional subset, or may not
        be able to afford to return new values each time due to data size or
        performance-sensitivity. There's nothing wrong with that.</p>
      <h2 id="%22real-code%22">"Real code" </h2>
      <p>Pollan later qualifies his snappy statement a bit further:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>He contends that most of what Americans now buy in supermarkets, fast food
          stores, and restaurants is not in fact food, and that a practical tip is to eat
          only those things that people of his grandmother's generation would have
          recognized as food.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>At the risk of stretching the analogy, maybe the equivalent is
        "code only those things that people at a junior level would recognize for what
        they do". Code in simple, straightforward terms. Don't get too clever,
        "manufacturing artificial ingredients". Use the primitives that are there, when
        possible. Write what is simple, and natural, and human.</p>

This could make it easier for healthcare providers to estimate the expected clinical picture.</p><p>This study, conducted in eleven hospitals, has now been published in the scientific journal <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Felifesciences.org%2Farticles%2F63195&amp;t=OWQ0Y2I4YjY2MjA5OTI5ODZhMDMyNWIyN2YyMmE4MDJlNjgyZjU1MixPdnJTNlR3WA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638153014113370112%2Ffull-blood-count-covid19-prediction&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1608755865"><i>eLife</i></a>.</p><p>In patients presenting to hospitals with a COVID-19 infection, full blood count analysis (hemocytometry) are commonly performed at the emergency department and during hospitalization. COVID-19 is accompanied by specific changes in the circulating blood cells that are analyzed by a full blood count. These changes in the blood cells, especially those that can be identified using new techniques, are used to create an algorithm with a predictive value. The developed algorithm appears to predict the course of COVID-19 better than the value of the individual blood cells, as used so far. The reliability increases to 93% after six days.</p><h2><b>Predicting disease progression</b></h2><p>Using data generated by full blood count measurements, the researchers wanted to know whether it is possible to predict whether a hospitalized COVID-19 patient will become seriously ill and needs treatment at the Intensive Care. For this purpose, they examined the data of 982 adult patients in eleven different hospitals across Europe. And this turned out to be possible: specific changes in the circulating blood cells of COVID-19 patients proved to be of use as indicators whether a serious course of events was expected. New laboratory techniques make it possible to detect whether immune cells in the blood are activated and it turned out that especially these activated cells were more present of COVID-19 patients with a severe course, including during the early course of the disease. In a second study population the researchers were able to confirm the value of the prognostic score.</p><h2><b>Cheap and available</b></h2><p>Internist-infectiologist and principal investigator André van der Ven of Radboud university medical center explains: “A full blood count is a fully automated, inexpensive, immediately available measurement and one of the most requested laboratory determinations in the world. Full blood count measurements are also routinely requested from COVID-19 patients who present to the hospital. By using certain techniques, the character of certain blood cells can be better determined and by using these new techniques, we have been able to develop a reliable prognostic score. This score gives a good insight into whether a serious course of events can be expected and can help healthcare professionals to make treatment decisions”.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.radboudumc.nl%2Fen%2Fnews-items%2F2020%2Ffull-blood-count-covid-19-patients-predict-disease-severity&amp;t=MWE0MWNlNjU0M2U2ZDg1ZWM3NzU1ODBkOGI4YTUzOTlkNTgyZmQwZixPdnJTNlR3WA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638153014113370112%2Ffull-blood-count-covid19-prediction&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1608755865">Radboud University Medical Center</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“A novel haemocytometric COVID-19 prognostic score developed and validated in an observational multicentre European hospital-based study”, <i>eLife</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.7554%2FeLife.63195&amp;t=MTMwYzQyMWYxMGEzMGNjYjJjYzRiZDg2NGM2OGE0ODdiODZkNTExZSxPdnJTNlR3WA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638153014113370112%2Ffull-blood-count-covid19-prediction&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1608755865">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.63195</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/632175500576653312/blood-test-covid19-infection-prediction">Novel blood test predicts which COVID-19 patients will develop severe infection</a></p>

				<p>Soy is the main ingredient in our cheese. Surprisingly often, we get asked some version of this question: "Isn't soy bad for the environment?"</p><p>The short answer is: No, quite the contrary.</p><p>The rest of this post is devoted to the long answer.</p><p>Since we started working on <a href="https://yeticheese.com/">Yeti Cheese</a>, we realized that there's a lot of misinformation around soybean. Over and over, we read and hear stuff about soy that is just plain wrong from people that otherwise seem smart. I wonder who might be behind this? <em>*cough* meat and dairy lobbies *cough*</em></p><p>A lot of this misinformation is around environmental concerns. This belief originates from the fact that soy is a major driver of deforestation, especially in the Amazon and neighboring regions in South America. Which is true. But that's not the end of the story. What is often left out is that the vast majority of soy is grown to be used as animal feed. There are different estimates to what this number exactly is, but most are upwards of 90%.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/2020/12/EoDe4BMWMAAMl_c.jpg" alt="" width="993" height="1121" srcset="https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/EoDe4BMWMAAMl_c.jpg 600w, https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/2020/12/EoDe4BMWMAAMl_c.jpg 993w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Break-down of soybean usage based on USDA data.</figcaption></figure><p>As the above diagram shows, the USDA reports that only 6% of soy are used as food for humans (e.g. as tofu or Yeti Cheese 😝). The rest is used either directly as animal feed, or processed to soy cake (also called soy meal) and then given to cows, pigs and chickens.</p><h3 id="but-what-about-soy-oil">But what about soy oil?</h3><p>The astute reader will now raise a remark about soy oil. After all, 19% of the processed soybean is made into oil which is consumed mostly by humans. Soy oil is one of the most used oils globally, but only because it is cheaply available as a by-product of soy cake production. Soy cake has great nutritional values and almost no fat (which has been separated into the soy oil) and is therefore sought after as livestock feed. Hence, soy cake is the main driver of soy demand, and not soy oil. There's nothing unique about soy oil, and it can easily be substituted with other plant-based oils.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/2020/12/soy-meal-vs-soy-oil.jpg" alt="" width="853" height="636" srcset="https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/soy-meal-vs-soy-oil.jpg 600w, https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/2020/12/soy-meal-vs-soy-oil.jpg 853w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Soy oil vs soy meal. Pretty clear why soy oil is separated from soy before feeding it to animals. Source: <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/">nutritionalvalue.org</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="soy-is-one-of-the-best-food-sources">Soy is one of the best food sources</h3><p>In summary, people think that soy is bad for the environment because it is grown in insane quantities for the livestock agriculture industry. It's clear that shifting the population to a plant-based diet will reduce the demand for soy dramatically. This shift will also make free a lot of land where wild vegetation and biodiversity can be restored, capturing loads of carbon in the process.</p><p>So no, soy is not bad for the environment. Quite the contrary: It's one of the best food sources we have available on this little blue planet of ours.</p><h3 id="further-reading">Further reading</h3><p><a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(09)00966-2/fulltext">Clinical studies show no effects of soy protein or isoflavones on reproductive hormones in men: results of a meta-analysis</a></p><p><a href="https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/land-use/soy">Soy Agriculture in the Amazon Basin</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p id="fd6c">As part of the DataOps team at RealScout, I recently worked on a project to tackle infrastructure issues that plagued us for some time. We struggled with ongoing maintenance in keeping our Amazon ECS clusters up to date on the latest AMIs. Our instances, in particular, use the ECS-optimized AMIs. These AMIs include ECS container agents that are responsible for keeping instances registered and managing tasks within the cluster.</p><p id="3ab4">New AMIs are regularly released and include updated ECS container agents along with any other OS or security updates. However, the steps to upgrade instances to the latest AMI while avoiding disruptions to running tasks were extremely manual and tedious. The lack of automation hindered timely AMI updates to our EC2 instances. We observed that the more out of date agents became, the more likely they were to get disconnected. Instances would enter a zombie-like state, no longer picking up tasks.</p><p id="efc0">This resulted in major disruptions to our infrastructure that impacted our entire data ingestion pipeline. This article describes our solution to automate the AMI upgrades to our cluster without any downtime. Challenges that we encountered along the way are also addressed here.</p><p id="4416"><strong>Our Infrastructure</strong></p><p id="345f">At a high-level, our infrastructure consists of EC2 instances in an ECS cluster. The EC2 instances are part of an Auto Scaling group to maintain our required capacity. We use CloudFormation to manage and provision our AWS resources consistently across our stacks.</p><p id="8d05"><strong>Our Old Process</strong></p><p id="2672">Our old process involved a series of steps performed within the AWS console. We first created a CloudFormation change set with the new AMI and executed it. This would update the template for our stack.</p><p id="c32a">Before applying the new AMI updates to the instances themselves, we needed to ensure running tasks did not get disrupted. To do so, each ECS instance is set to a state of “DRAINING.” This prevents the instance from picking up new tasks while allowing running tasks to complete. Once the instances are completely drained, we terminate the instances. We then let the Auto Scaling Group bring up new, updated instances with the latest AMI version defined in the CloudFormation template.</p><p id="3587"><strong>Our Goal</strong></p><p id="107a">We wanted to automate, as much as possible, the task of upgrading the AMI on our cluster instances with no downtime. The system needed to replicate our manual steps to terminate and bring up new instances. All running tasks should run to completion without interruption.</p><p id="47a9">We also wanted to incorporate metrics and monitoring of the ECS cluster. We know that the latest AMI versions would also include the latest agent as well. In the past, we occasionally encountered agents getting disconnected and remaining disconnected, preventing task placements on instances. We wanted peace of mind that should this scenario creep up, it would be resolved in a timely manner.</p><p id="2b37"><strong>Our Implementation</strong></p><p id="4821">We wrote a Lambda, using the boto3 SDK with the appropriate APIs for each AWS resource. Aside from the Lambda, several other AWS resources were used:</p><ul><li id="5997">SNS — the Lambda subscribes to two SNS topics: one is an AWS defined topic where AMI updates are published. The other is an SNS topic we set up to publish our own series of events.</li><li id="abfe">CloudFormation — used to define all resources within our stack. It also defines IAM roles and permissions for each resource.</li><li id="a688">CloudWatch Event — essentially, a scheduler used to trigger our Lambda every 15 minutes, where we then perform some basic health monitoring. This includes checking whether an instance is running the latest AMI and initiates a termination if not.</li><li id="1bb7">CloudWatch Alarm — we set up an alarm to monitor CPU usage across our instances. It publishes to our SNS topic anytime CPU usage drops below 10%. We use this to determine when our instance is idle and therefore, no longer running any tasks.</li><li id="fe86">Auto Scaling Group — our EC2 instances are part of an auto scaling group. The auto scaling group is responsible for maintaining our required capacity. It automatically provisions new instances as needed to meet capacity.</li><li id="0448">LifeCycle Hooks — as its name implies, these allow us to hook into the lifecycle of an EC2 instance. It lets us pause a termination event and run some custom actions before resume termination.</li></ul><p id="fbef">High-level descriptions along with some code snippets are provided below to describe the three main functions of the Lambda.</p><p id="d81f">1) When a new AMI is available, we update our CloudFormation template to include the new version. We subscribe to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS-AMI-SubscribeTopic.html" rel="noopener">Amazon ECS-optimized AMI</a> topic to receive update notifications. Once our Lambda receives an event that a new AMI is published, it creates and executes a change set for our CloudFormation template. We notify our team of the new AMI and when the change set gets executed via DataDog and Slack integrations. At this point, the only actual change is only to our CloudFormation template. We do not apply the change to the instances yet.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3108/1*F0wPMc_1Ijtb5FMU05A0bw.png" width="1554" height="422" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*F0wPMc_1Ijtb5FMU05A0bw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*F0wPMc_1Ijtb5FMU05A0bw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*F0wPMc_1Ijtb5FMU05A0bw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*F0wPMc_1Ijtb5FMU05A0bw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*F0wPMc_1Ijtb5FMU05A0bw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Updating CloudFormation template with new AMI</figcaption></figure><p id="1b15">2) Our next step performs a couple of health checks. We configure a CloudWatch event that runs every 15 minutes to check for any EC2 instances with disconnected agents. Since it is possible for agents to periodically get disconnected for various reasons and reconnect on their own, we implemented a check to detect agents disconnected for longer than 30 minutes. Instances disconnected for longer than our grace period are terminated. The auto scaling group then brings up a new, healthy instance. This does rely on some higher-level architecture to reschedule any ECS tasks that are killed as a result of this, so consider that for your own setup.</p><p id="ccfd">The second health check verifies if all instances are running on the latest AMI as specified in our CloudFormation template. Since we immediately update our template when a new AMI is published, our scheduled health check detects any instances not on the AMI within a 15 minute interval at most. To kick off this chain of events, we simply terminate the out-of-date instances, and again, rely on the auto scaling group to bring up new instances containing the latest AMI.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1682/1*VbksgDN871WDKXTWIAl0_g.png" width="841" height="240" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*VbksgDN871WDKXTWIAl0_g.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*VbksgDN871WDKXTWIAl0_g.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*VbksgDN871WDKXTWIAl0_g.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*VbksgDN871WDKXTWIAl0_g.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*VbksgDN871WDKXTWIAl0_g.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Check for outdated instance AMIs and agent health</figcaption></figure><p id="3088">3) The final step is where the bulk of the work is in our Lambda. The importance here, however, is that we ensure instances are gracefully terminated. A lifecycle hook plays a major part in doing so. We set up a life cycle hook that subscribes to an SNS event when an instance is terminating. The hook allows us to pause the termination and perform a series of actions before completing the instance terminations.</p><p id="31bb">Once a termination is detected, we set the status of each instance to DRAINING. We then re-publish an event to request termination again for the instance. This new termination request event will trigger our Lambda again. This time, we check for any running tasks on instances marked as DRAINING.</p><p id="3220">For any instances that are still draining, we set a CloudWatch alarm to check when the instance becomes idle, indicating it is no longer running any tasks. This is slightly different than similar implementations where an event is re-published (i.e, continues to loop) to check for running tasks. This introduces an additional AWS resource to the layer. Since we occasionally have some very long running tasks (e.g, 12 hours), we decided to go with using an alarm to detect CPU usage to determine when the instance was likely drained. If the CPU usage on an instance drops to less than 10%, the CloudWatch alarm triggers an event, where we then check again if all tasks are complete. This approach cut out wasteful, continuous looping for very long running tasks.</p><pre><span id="869f">cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(<br> AlarmName=f"Check_Idle_{instance['ec2InstanceId']}",<br> AlarmDescription='Instance pending termination appears idle (&lt;= 10%)',<br> AlarmActions=[topic_arn],<br> MetricName='CPUUtilization',<br> Namespace='AWS/EC2',<br> Statistic='Average',<br> Dimensions=[{'Name': 'InstanceId', 'Value': instance['ec2InstanceId']}],<br> Period=60, # seconds<br> EvaluationPeriods=1,<br> Threshold=10,<br> ComparisonOperator='LessThanOrEqualToThreshold',<br> TreatMissingData='breaching'<br>)</span></pre><p id="0bfe">Once instances no longer have running tasks, we allow the termination to complete:</p><pre><span id="ba48">asg.complete_lifecycle_action(<br> LifecycleHookName=msg['LifecycleHookName'],<br> AutoScalingGroupName=msg['AutoScalingGroupName'],<br> LifecycleActionResult='CONTINUE',<br> InstanceId=instance['ec2InstanceId'])</span></pre><p id="dc64">Our implementation was influenced by AWS’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/automatically-update-instances-in-an-amazon-ecs-cluster-using-the-ami-id-parameter" rel="noopener">example</a> implementation.

For us, it is a great feeling each time to see a Slack notification alerting our team of a new AMI quickly followed by a notification of the AMI update to our CloudFormation template. The template update itself occurs within 2 minutes of a newly published AMI. And from there, the rolling upgrade gets initiated in less than 15 minutes, making us very happy campers! On top of that, the additional scheduled monitoring gives us confidence that our container agents are healthy and connected as expected. Needless to say, our efforts were rewarded with a much more resilient system and time saved cumulatively each month!</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

		<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>13</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>It’s not a clickbait title, but I understand why it looks that way.</p>



<p>I’ve made my thoughts about the 10x developer trope <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2019/12/06/listening-7-deliberate-appreciation/">extremely clear</a>. I think that someone who produces 10x as much code as someone else has left a wake of destruction that will slow down other developers. I don’t think 10x counts if you achieve it by slowing down everyone else. I think 10x has to take into account how you impact other people.</p>



<p>And <em>that,</em> paradoxically, suggests a path for how to become a 10x developer: empower and enable other people such that nine additional developers’ worth of work gets done. You can do that by making nine other developers’ workflows 2x smoother. You can also do that by making 18 other developers’ workflows 50% smoother, or 90 other developers’ workflows 10% smoother.</p>

<p>At some point, your biggest gains in your X are gonna be in improving the ecosystem for other developers. On occasions when I have succeeded at that, from <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2018/02/25/how-to-socialize-big-changes-at-work-part-1-start-at-the-grassroots-level/">driving workplace changes</a> to <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/category/teaching/">teaching computer science classes</a>, I have noticed that I’m using one or more of three techniques. So I thought I’d list them here.</p>



<h3>First, establish the motivation.</h3>



<p>Learning is work. Sometimes, it’s boring or difficult work. Folks don’t undertake that kind of work unless they understand why they should. That’s not as simple as <em>telling</em> them why. Understanding comes from engaging with the material.</p>



<p>Suppose you want to make a major code change that affects your team’s workflow. If you blaze forward and do that without buy-in, the team will resent it (<a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2018/02/25/how-to-socialize-big-changes-at-work-part-1-start-at-the-grassroots-level/">as we’ve discussed in more detail here</a>). So I recommend starting with individual conversations about the reasons for the change:</p>



<blockquote><p><span>What is bothering you about your team’s current workflow that motivates you to push your solution? Are you annoyed at having to write the same code over and over in different places? Are you tired of trying to poke your way around an opaque tool? Are you losing track of things that cost you time and money? Before you&nbsp;</span><em>push</em><span>&nbsp;your solution,&nbsp;</span><em>pull</em><span>&nbsp;your coworkers to it by making sure they feel the pain that you feel.</span></p><p>Before I do a major refactor, I’ll deliberately pair program with key people on my team on the kind of problems that my refactor would solve. I want them to experience the pain firsthand; I want to hear them say ‘oh my&nbsp;<em>god&nbsp;</em>this is annoying.’ After I have that admission of pain from a critical mass of people on my team, I’ll propose my solution, and I’ll offer to spearhead the refactor. I will craft a concise explanation of how our workflow changes after the refactor, and I’ll point out why I think the new way is nicer for us than the way we’re doing it now.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have ‘negative testimonials’ about the old way, which I can whip out to capture the attention and agreement of others on my team. This approach allows me to muster support for my refactor and then, in spearheading the refactor, look like I’m taking one for the team.</p><p>Imagine the same scenario, same refactor, but instead of socializing my solution, I go off on my own, do the refactor, and push. My team didn’t understand the pain that the refactor solved, so all they’re seeing is the pain of learning the&nbsp;<em>new</em>&nbsp;way to do things. To them, it looks like I made a unilateral decision that screwed them over—the&nbsp;<em>opposite</em>&nbsp;of what a team player would do. Keep in mind, in both circumstances, I wrote the&nbsp;<em>same code</em>. The only difference is how I introduced it.</p></blockquote>



<p>In effect, even the right code changes need to be <em>sold</em>. </p>



<p>How do we know what the right code changes are? This one is tricky, but one guiding principle has helped me out a lot:</p>



<h3>Look for bonehead solutions to convoluted technical issues.</h3>



<p>Michael Feathers talks a great deal about technical simplification options in his various discussions on edge-free programming (<a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2020/05/28/lessons-from-space-edge-free-programming/">here’s a more detailed look at some of those principles)</a>. But for exemplary purposes, here are a few simple solutions to complex problems that I’m especially proud of:</p>



<ul><li>I solved a thorny issue with a sometimes camouflaged, sometimes unreliable delete button by ripping it out (<a href="https://github.com/zooniverse/mobile/pull/345">Here’s the PR if you want more details</a>)</li><li>I resolved the issue of a laggy metronome in React-Native, where computationally expensive operations can result in delays for scheduled tasks. The app happened to also need to play back tracks at various multiples of their original speed. So I recorded a sound file of a metronome at 120 BPM, calculated what speed to play it by dividing the BPM the musician requested by 120, and wrote one method that shelled out to <code>expo-av</code> to play accurate-to-tempo sound files for both the metronome and the backtracks.</li><li>I resolved an issue of regulating how often a person should be allowed to log their mood by realizing the issue was fake (assumed foil to “let’s make sure they log it at least this often”) and letting them log as often as they want (<a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2020/05/28/lessons-from-space-edge-free-programming/">more details here</a>).</li></ul>



<p>Each of these solutions made the code cleaner and eliminated<em> </em>multiple problems with the product. But they were not genius solutions. In fact, they were easy to miss precisely because complex problems don’t scream “I have a bonehead solution.”</p>


	
	


<p><strong>One drawback: </strong>the tech industry generally rewards churning out tons of code <em>over</em> elegant solutions. Chen Lin recently <a href="https://twitter.com/votecapgood/status/1337920511095918592">tweeted about</a> his experience with this at Uber. Chen is responding to <a href="https://twitter.com/mountain_ghosts/status/1337552024821510144">this commentary</a>, which starts out salty but goes on to articulate a rarely-discussed element of how the tech industry functions: tech executives <em>have</em> to make their work appear innovative in order to secure VC funding. So they’re forced to artificially “make it innovative” by filing patents or hopping on the latest trends. In the case of Uber and iOS development, that imperative <a href="https://twitter.com/StanTwinB/status/1336890442768547845">burned them badly</a>.</p>



<p>Academia is similar: <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/affiliated/watt-jeremy.html">Dr. Jeremy Watt</a>, author of <em><a href="https://github.com/jermwatt/machine_learning_refined">Machine Learning Refined</a></em>, articulates how academics <em>have</em> to make their work appear novel in order to get published, and they have to get published to keep their jobs, so they’re forced to artificially differentiate similar concepts—to convolute rather than simplify.</p>



<p>There’s a great <a href="https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1027552576454021120">explanation from Mekka Okereke</a> about how to counteract some of this as an engineer. It shares a lot with our “first establish the motivation” approach—namely, by starting from the <em>problem</em>, not the solution.</p>



<p><strong>Also, a giant caveat: </strong>This solution is not always there. Sometimes the solution just has to be clever, or complicated, or messy. Sadly I can’t give you an ironclad heuristic for how to find them or how to confirm their existence. I can tell you this: in most cases where I have found them, I have found them by popping <em>up</em> a level from the implementation level to the design level. </p>



<p>Also, this recommendation applies specifically to technical solutions: it does not apply, for example, to racism or fascism. The problems we’re talking about here are de facto circumscribed by the scope of an application. When we’re talking about a generational cultural, political, and structural phenomenon, “just rip out X” doesn’t work.</p>


	<div>

										<figcaption>Nor does one simply solve [insert insidious social issue here].</figcaption>
					</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>White supremacy culture in tech alone is so insidious and multifaceted that I’ve got <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2020/02/07/the-price-of-whiteness-in-tech/">an ongoing series</a> about reimagining different parts of tech through a not-white-supremacist lens. But also, listen to <a href="https://twitter.com/polotek/status/1249908489826099201">Marco Rogers about this caveat</a>. He knows more things than I do.</p>



<p>ANYWAY, anyway, anyway. </p>



<p>So we’ve talked about selling our changes, and we’ve talked about making changes that reduce the scope of complexity. Naturally, the third thing I find myself doing, is selling new knowledge <em>by</em> reducing the scope of complexity. Here we go:</p>



<h3>Try to spread intuition with as few prerequisites as possible.</h3>



<p>One of my Mobile Software Development students asked me what frameworks he should consider for testing a Python app he’s working on. Here’s what I said:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>In Python there are two leading options: unittest and pytest. Both work fine. When I’m working on teams, I tend to go with pytest because the output is a little nicer.&nbsp;</p><p>But…when I’m&nbsp;<em>teaching</em>&nbsp;Python, I don’t use a testing framework at all. I write methods that call the method I’m testing, and then I use Python’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_assert.asp" target="_blank">built in assert keyword</a>&nbsp;to check the state of the modified objects or return values. Reason being, I don’t want to jump into the complexity of all the different stuff you can use to test until students understand&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;we test. I try to use the minimum toolset that gets the point across.</p></div></blockquote>



<p><br>One of the big things that educational approaches manage to screw up, in my view, is to introduce prerequisites that make the topic in question <em>harder</em> instead of <em>easier</em>. Fluent Forever founder Gabriel Wyner <a href="https://youtu.be/bPVeIHcgfTs?t=74">articulates how language learning often depends on translation</a>—which is a whole, separate, <em>difficult</em> skill. So when I’m trying to help someone build intuition, I’ll try to eliminate as many dependencies as possible. </p>



<p>I’ll show you an example for teaching testing in Python. I pulled this example out of a notebook that I share with my <a href="https://www.emergentworks.org/">Emergent Works</a> and <a href="https://centerforjustice.columbia.edu/justicethroughcode">Justice Through Code</a> mentee. She was working on writing a Sudoku solver. Of course, to solve a Sudoku, it helps to know when a Sudoku is solved. </p>



<p>Suppose we start with a similar but simpler puzzle; each row and each column must each possess one copy of each number, like this:</p>



<pre><code>puzzle = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [2, 1, 4, 3],
    [3, 4, 1, 2],
    [4, 3, 2, 1],
]</code></pre>



<p>This is a valid puzzle, albeit smaller than your typical 9 x 9. </p>



<p>It shows a way of <em>representing</em> our problem space—a list of lists. We could make a <code>Puzzle </code>class for this, with all kinds of methods on it. I’m not doing that yet. I’m doing the <em>minimum thing</em> that gets the point across: we need a way to represent our data. Here is a way to represent our data with minimal dependencies and indirection. </p>



<p>We’re gonna do the same thing for the test, no test framework involved (yet!):</p>



<pre><code>def valid_puzzle(puzzle):
    try: 
        # Python is duck-typed, so …</code></pre></div></div>

    <code>jq</code> Basics</h2><p>The most basic use is just tidying &amp; pretty-printing your JSON:</p>
<pre><code>$ USERX=<span>'{"name":"duchess","city":"Toronto","orders":[{"id":"x","qty":10},{"id":"y","qty":15}]}'</span>
$ <span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>outputs</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"name"</span>: <span>"duchess"</span>,
  <span>"city"</span>: <span>"Toronto"</span>,
  <span>"orders"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"id"</span>: <span>"x"</span>,
      <span>"qty"</span>: <span>10</span>
    },
    {
      <span>"id"</span>: <span>"y"</span>,
      <span>"qty"</span>: <span>15</span>
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>I like this pretty-printing/formatting capability so much, I have an alias that formats JSON I've copied (in my OS "clipboard") &amp; puts it back in my clipboard:</p>
<pre><code><span>alias</span> jsontidy=<span>"pbpaste | jq '.' | pbcopy"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>'.'</code> in the <code>jq '.'</code> command above is the simplest jq "filter." The dot takes the input JSON and outputs it as is. You can read more about filters <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Basicfilters">here</a>, but the bare minimum to know is that <code>.keyname</code> will filter the result to a property matching that key, and <code>[index]</code> will match an array value at that index:</p>
<pre><code>$ <span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.name'</span>
<span>"duchess"</span>
$ <span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.orders[0]'</span>
{
  <span>"id"</span>: <span>"x"</span>,
  <span>"qty"</span>: 10
}
</code></pre>
<p>And <code>[]</code> will match <em>each</em> item in an array:</p>
<pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.orders[].id'</span>
<span>"x"</span>
<span>"y"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Filtering output by value is also handy! Here we use <code>|</code> to output the result of one filter into the input of another filter and <code>select(.qty&gt;10)</code> to select only orders with <code>qty</code> value greater than 10:</p>
<pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.orders[]|select(.qty&gt;10)'</span>
{
  <span>"id"</span>: <span>"y"</span>,
  <span>"qty"</span>: 15
}
</code></pre>
<p>One more trick: filtering by <strong>key</strong> name rather than value:</p>
<pre><code>$ ORDER=<span>'{"user_id":123,"user_name":"duchess","order_id":456,"order_status":"sent","vendor_id":789,"vendor_name":"Abe Books"}'</span>
$ <span>echo</span> <span>$ORDER</span> | jq <span>'.'</span>
{
  <span>"user_id"</span>: 123,
  <span>"user_name"</span>: <span>"duchess"</span>,
  <span>"order_id"</span>: 456,
  <span>"order_status"</span>: <span>"sent"</span>,
  <span>"vendor_id"</span>: 789,
  <span>"vendor_name"</span>: <span>"Abe Books"</span>
}
$ <span>echo</span> <span>$ORDER</span> | jq <span>'with_entries(select(.key|match("order_")))'</span>
{
  <span>"order_id"</span>: 456,
  <span>"order_status"</span>: <span>"sent"</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>(cheat sheet version: <code>with_entries(select(.key|match("KEY FILTER VALUE")))</code>)</p>

    A Usecase: Debugging Some Prometheus Metrics</h2><p>I have a prometheus metric showing up locally that doesn't look quite right:</p>
<pre><code>async_task_total{task_name="/Users/duchess/charmoffensive/toodle-app/pkg/web/page/globals.go(189):(*GlobalsPopulator).Populate"} 6
</code></pre>
<p>The fact that the <code>task_name</code> value is a <em>filename</em> is a red flag–<a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/#labels">it's bad to have labels with high cardinality</a> and I'm not sure how many of these there are. I want to find out:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do these <code>task_name</code> labels look like in production?</li>
<li>How many unique values are there for these labels?</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-getting-the-label-values-in-production">
    <a href="#1-getting-the-label-values-in-production">
      
    </a>
    1. Getting the label values in production</h3><p>At my company there is a <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> tool we'll call <code>pquery</code> that allows prometheus metrics to be queried from the command line, and it outputs JSON–how conventient! I use this tool in the following examples. You don't have this tool, but fear not: <a href="https://learndevops.substack.com/p/hitting-prometheus-api-with-curl">this wonderful post</a> explains how to query prometheus using <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a> which is essentially what <code>pquery</code> does.</p>
<p>Using <code>pquery</code> we can view prometheus metrics from our various clusters. But even if we filter for this exact metric name, it's more data than we can easily look at. We'll use <code>wc -l</code> (wordcount: count lines) to get a rough idea of how much data we're working with:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total'</span> | wc <span>-l</span>
316117
</code></pre>
<p>316,117 lines of JSON! Oof! We want to iterate over the metrics. But what jq filter do we need to access the array of metrics? I find <code>head</code> useful for figuring out what the top level keys are for a large json structure:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total'</span> | head -n 20
{
    <span>"data"</span>: {
        <span>"result"</span>: [
            {
                <span>"metric"</span>: {
                    <span>"__name__"</span>: <span>"async_task_total"</span>,
                    <span>"app"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-alpha"</span>,
                    <span>"instance"</span>: <span>"10.55.55.55:9393"</span>,
                    <span>"job"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-alpha"</span>,
                    <span>"kubernetes_pod_name"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-b446b7ccd-6mls6"</span>,
                    <span>"namespace"</span>: <span>"noweb"</span>,
                    <span>"netpol"</span>: <span>"toodle-app"</span>,
                    <span>"node_name"</span>: <span>"gke-production-04-3455c6df-j526"</span>,
                    <span>"release"</span>: <span>"toodle-app"</span>,
                    <span>"task_name"</span>: <span>"/charmoffensive/toodle-app/pkg/core/user/user.go(67):GetAccountDetails"</span>
                },
                <span>"value"</span>: [
                    1600981630.344,
                    <span>"2"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use <code>jq 'keys'</code> if you just want the key names:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total'</span> | jq <span>'keys'</span>
[
  <span>"data"</span>,
  <span>"status"</span>
]
</code></pre>
<p>Anyway we can see from above that <code>.data.result</code> is the "filter" path for the metrics themselves. Let's get the <strong>first result</strong> (<code>[0]</code>) of this array so we can see what one metric looks like:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total'</span> | jq <span>'.data.result[0]'</span>
{
  <span>"metric"</span>: {
    <span>"__name__"</span>: <span>"async_task_total"</span>,
    <span>"app"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-alpha"</span>,
    <span>"instance"</span>: <span>"10.55.55.55:9393"</span>,
    <span>"job"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-alpha"</span>,
    <span>"kubernetes_pod_name"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-b446b7ccd-6mls6"</span>,
    <span>"namespace"</span>: <span>"noweb"</span>,
    <span>"netpol"</span>: <span>"toodle-app"</span>,
    <span>"node_name"</span>: <span>"gke-production-04-3455c6df-j526"</span>,
    <span>"release"</span>: <span>"toodle-app"</span>,
    <span>"task_name"</span>: <span>"/charmoffensive/toodle-app/pkg/core/user/user.go(67):GetAccountDetails"</span>
  },
  <span>"value"</span>: [
    1600981906.069,
    <span>"2"</span>
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Oops! That <code>app</code> value (<code>toodle-app-alpha</code>) indicates a mistake: I'm only interested in results from the <code>toodle-app</code> app, <em>not</em> from other apps that may also emit this metric (such as the <code>alpha</code> deployment we see here). We could <code>select</code> for this using jq, but <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/"><code>promql</code> already lets us filter by metric names</a> so we'll do that instead: <code>pquery 'async_task_total{app="toodle-app"}'</code>.</p>
<p>We're interested in the <code>task_name</code> value in the <code>metric</code> object, so let's pluck that from <strong>each</strong> item in the array above:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total{app="toodle-app"}'</span> \
| jq <span>'.data.result[].metric.task_name'</span>

<p>📝 Update: It was pointed out to me that as this is a post about <code>jq</code>, not about <code>promql</code>, a <code>jq</code> solution is more appropriate here. I'd originally used promql because it's more efficient to filter on the server when possible.

          <p>
We're pretty deep into the whole COVID thing. Where I am in the world, we've been in some variation of lockdown for nine months now. It has meant a lot of changes to my working life, but one of the larger changes to my workflow is that there's no longer a giant whiteboard mounted directly behind me. "Diagrams as code" tools such as <a href="https://plantuml.com/">PlantUML</a> and <a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/">Mermaid</a> have gone some way towards filling the void, and I'll examine how far they go in helping me communicate software architecture.
<span id="continue-reading"></span></p>
<h2 id="why-did-i-like-the-whiteboard-so-much">Why did I like the whiteboard so much?&nbsp;<a href="#why-did-i-like-the-whiteboard-so-much" aria-label="Anchor Link For: why-did-i-like-the-whiteboard-so-much">
    
</a></h2>
<p>I think the main thing here is the speed of iteration. When scribbling out an architectural idea, there's usually a bit of back and forth. As long as the diagram is on the whiteboard still, it's easy to erase a few lines here and there and add a few elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the drag and drop functionalities of tools such as <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/">LucidChart</a> or <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/">Draw.io</a> can work for this. With that said, I've suffered the indignity of a stray arrow magnetising itself to the wrong box. It's not the worst thing to happen, nor the hardest thing to fix, but I felt I could go faster. </p>
<h2 id="heaping-praise-on-diagrams-as-code">Heaping praise on diagrams as code<a href="#heaping-praise-on-diagrams-as-code" aria-label="Anchor Link For: heaping-praise-on-diagrams-as-code">
    
</a></h2>
<p>Being able to delegate how the diagram looks to something else is a boon for my productivity. I know that I can smash out a diagram in Mermaid syntax and the diagram will look pretty good. Don't get me wrong - no graphics design awards are coming my way, but by and large, the diagram is correct and looks clean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a simple example that I wrote with Mermaid. Take the following scenario. Service A schedules a task to run at some point with an external service - think of some kind of process that can't be immediately actioned, such as a scheduled task. We're immediately told whether task scheduling worked. If all goes well, the job is eventually delegated to a worker, which carries out it's assigned task. Once that's done, the worker dispatches a webhook notification to service B, allowing us to do whatever further processing logic we need to. Now, I want to describe that using Mermaid syntax. This is what that looks like:</p>
<pre><code><span>sequenceDiagram  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participant Service A  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participant External Service  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participant External Service Worker  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participant Service B  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service A -&gt;&gt;+ External Service: createJob(notifyEndpoint, jobParameters)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External Service -&gt;&gt;+ Service A: jobScheduleStatus(id, status)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External Service --&gt;&gt;+ External Service Worker: startProcessingJob(id)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External Service Worker -&gt;&gt;+ External Service Worker: processJob(id)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External Service Worker -&gt;&gt;+ Service B: dispatchWebhookToNotifyEndpoint(notification)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service B -&gt;&gt;+ Service B: handleWebhook(notification)
</span></code></pre>
<p>And that produces a diagram that looks something like this<sup><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> :</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.tawhidhannan.co.uk/practices/fill-void-physical-whiteboard/mermaid-diagram-20201218194918.png" alt="Visual Diagram for the above Mermaid Sequence Diagram code"></p>
<p>The sequence diagram allows me to express this chain of events tersely in code, but richly in the diagram. I'm able to quick and easily represent operational quirks. For instance, the initialisation of job processing is asynchronous. It doesn't occur immediately, but at some unspecified time in the future. In the diagram, I can express that with a dashed line, and in the code for the diagram, that's as easy as <code>--&gt;&gt;+</code>. Sequence numbers make it easy for me to discuss the diagram with other people, as we can refer to steps by their number. And to add them in was as easy as including a parameter when generating the diagram:&nbsp;</p>
<pre><code><span>{
&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>"theme"</span><span>: </span><span>"default"</span><span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>"sequence"</span><span>: {&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>"showSequenceNumbers"</span><span>: </span><span>true&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>}
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now all the example is perhaps not the most powerful use case. It's a little simple, and it's not tricky to put together a diagram that looks like this with a GUI. In reality these diagrams have a fair bit more going on.</p>
<p>But putting it together in code feels a lot faster for me. The diagram is unsullied by my clumsiness at getting arrows to magnetise to the right box in a WSYWIG web GUI. And this whole thing took me two or three minutes to write - I spent more time coming up with the scenario. I can take the generated image and put it in a ticket, or a slack message, and use it as a visual aid for communicating my thought processes.&nbsp;Even though architectures are more complex in reality, I don't feel like a sense of not being able to express them using these tools.</p>
<p>What's interesting is that I'm more likely to be able to evolve this diagram over time. It doesn't rely on me preserving a whiteboard for all eternity. I can come back later, and make a quick tweak or edit, based on feedback or what have you. I write code every day, so as a method of building something - I'm used to it. Should I make a mistake, or if I want to make some tweak somewhere, I can do that without much fuss. I could even commit these into source control if I wanted to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability to construct diagrams whilst sustaining speed, correctness and clarity are pretty much all I need. If I want to make a particularly pretty diagram (maybe it's for external eyes) I'd use the drag and drop tools. The more complex autogenerated diagrams tend to have a few visual quirks. But where I want the diagram to be evolvable, these tools fill the niche well. The hosted services that provide diagramming as a service see the value in these tools. For example, LucidChart supports its own flavour of syntax, and Draw.IO supports PlantUML and Mermaid syntax.</p>
<h2 id="but-does-it-replace-a-whiteboard">But does it replace a whiteboard?<a href="#but-does-it-replace-a-whiteboard" aria-label="Anchor Link For: but-does-it-replace-a-whiteboard">
    
</a></h2>
<p>Ish. Scribbling on a whiteboard feels faster still - at least for initial construction. And the back and forth with people when etching on a board feels easier.</p>
<p>But, I've gotten faster generating diagrams from code. The syntax for mermaid and PlantUML is pretty simple and easy to remember after a spot of practice. And in a way, it feels accessible in a different way to a whiteboard. We don't have to be in the same room to collaborate. The escape hatch here is that we can always switch to using the WSYWIG to construct the diagram instead. It's slower, but if someone's not up to speed with the syntax and it's not worth them getting up to speed, it's an option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And beyond that, it lets me get a head start on any artefacts we need for documentation. Producing a quick diagram in the planning phases of a ticket that I can evolve later into something more formal is a big win for sure.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="calling-it">Calling It<a href="#calling-it" aria-label="Anchor Link For: calling-it">
    
</a></h2>
<p>Constructing diagrams as code does not replace everything a whiteboard does for me. But it's fast enough, it's easy to get started, and it makes it easy to involve remote people. If everyone knows the syntax, remote collaboration is easy, and you've still got the escape hatch of WSYWIG tools, though they feel slower to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found that a quick sequence diagram, to help communicate a mental model of a solution can grease the wheels of progress a great deal.</p>

In the computer vision landscape today there are many custom object detectors that recognize objects from farm animals to phone defects. </p><h3 id="the-coco-dataset">The COCO Dataset</h3><p><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/coco-dataset/">The COCO dataset</a> is the gold standard benchmark for evaluating object detection models. The COCO (<a href="https://roboflow.com/formats/coco-json">Common Objects in COntext</a>) dataset contains over 120,000 images for training and testing, with 80 object class labels that are commonly observed in everyday life. Generally, if a model does well on the COCO dataset, it is believed that the model will generalize well to new custom domains - in the spirit of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242">YOLO9000</a>, for 9000 objects.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png 617w"><figcaption>Detecting the many objects in the world in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242.pdf">the original YOLO9000 model</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="efficientdet-models-model-scaling">EfficientDet Models - Model Scaling</h3><p>The <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/breaking-down-efficientdet/">EfficientDet</a> family of models has been the preferred object detection models since it was published by the Google Research/Brain team in recent months. The most novel contribution in the EfficientDet paper was to think strategically about how to scale object detection models up and down. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/model_scaling.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/model_scaling.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/model_scaling.png 688w"><figcaption>Model scaling in EfficientDet (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09070.pdf">cite</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Object detection models can be scaled by using a large image input resolution, scaling the width of the convolutional network layer, scaling the depth of convolutional layers, and scaling all of these things together. The EfficientDet authors use search to find an optimal scaling threshold from EfficientDet-D0 to EfficientDet-D1, and use this setting to linearly scale up to the famed EfficientDet-D7.</p><h3 id="yolo-models">YOLO Models</h3><p>The YOLO family of models, written in the Darknet framework, has a <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/a-thorough-breakdown-of-yolov4/">rich history</a> starting with Joseph Redmon (Github moniker <a href="https://pjreddie.com/">pjreddie</a>). Recently, the YOLO name and architecture have been picked up recently by a number of computer vision researchers.</p><p><strong>YOLOv4 - </strong>Early this spring, <a href="https://github.com/AlexeyAB">AlexyAB</a> formalized his fork of the Darknet repo, publishing the state-of-the-art <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/a-thorough-breakdown-of-yolov4/">YOLOv4 model</a>. YOLOv4 was considered one of the best models for speed and accuracy performance, but did not top EfficientDet's largest model for overall accuracy on the COCO dataset.</p><p><strong>YOLOv5 - </strong>Shortly after the release of YOLOv4, Glenn Jocher (Github moniker <a href="https://github.com/glenn-jocher">glenn-jocher</a>) published his version of the YOLO model in PyTorch as <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov5-improvements-and-evaluation/">YOLOv5</a>. Comparing how YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 models stacked up against each other was nuanced – we wrote a bunch on the <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov4-versus-yolov5/"></a><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov4-versus-yolov5/">YOLOv4 vs</a>.<a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov4-versus-yolov5/"> YOLOv5 </a>debate here.</p><p>The YOLOv5 PyTorch training and architecture conversion was the most notable contribution, making YOLO easier than ever to train, <em>speeding up training time 10x relative to Darknet</em>. </p><p>One of the main reasons Scaled-YOLOv4 is implemented in the YOLOv5 PyTorch framework is, no doubt, the training routines. Glenn Jocher notably gets a shoutout in the Acknowledgments of Scaled-YOLOv4.</p><p><strong>PP-YOLO - </strong>This summer, researchers at <a href="https://www.baidu.com/">Baidu</a> released their version of the YOLO architecture, <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/pp-yolo-beats-yolov4-object-detection/">PP-YOLO, surpassing YOLOv4 and YOLOv5</a>. The network, written in <a href="https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/">the Paddle-Paddle framework</a>, performed well but has yet to gain much traction among practitioners.</p><p><strong>But all of that's old news:</strong> Scaled-YOLOv4 is here and YOLOv4 has been fully <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11929.pdf">CSP-ized</a>!</p><h2 id="scaled-yolov4-techniques">Scaled-YOLOv4 Techniques</h2><p>To scale the YOLOv4 model, the Scaled-YOLOv4 authors explore the following strategies.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-3.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-3.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png 1376w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A visualization of the YOLO network, courtesy of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12099.pdf">PP-YOLO</a>.

They consider a few CSP-ized CNN backbones in their network, ResNet, ResNeXt, and the traditional Darknet backbone.</p><h3 id="csp-izing">"CSP-izing"</h3><p>In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08036">Scaled-YOLOv4</a> paper the authors often write that they "CSP-ized" a given portion of the network. To CSP-ize means to apply the concepts laid out in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11929">Cross-Stage Partial Networks</a> paper, written by <a href="https://github.com/WongKinYiu">WongKinYiu</a>. The CSP is a new way to architect convolutional neural networks that saves on computation for various CNN networks - up to 50% (for the Darknet backbone in FLOPs).</p><h3 id="scaling-the-yolov4-tiny-model">Scaling the YOLOv4-tiny model</h3><p>The YOLOv4-tiny model had different considerations than the Scaled-YOLOv4 model because, on the edge, different constraints come into play, like memory bandwidth and memory access. For the YOLOv4-tiny's shallow CNN, the authors look to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08036.pdf">OSANet</a> for its favorable computational complexity at little depth.</p><h3 id="scaling-the-yolov4-csp-models">Scaling the YOLOv4-CSP models </h3><p>To detect large objects in large images, the authors find that it is important to increase the depth and number of stages in in the CNN backbone and neck. (Increasing the width reportedly has little effect.) This allows them to first scale up input size and number of stages, and dynamically adjust width and depth according to realtime inference speed requirements. In addition to these scaling factors, the authors also adjust the configuration of their model's architecture in the paper.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-2.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-2.png 695w"><figcaption>YOLOv4-P5/P6/P7 architectures (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08036.pdf">cite</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="data-augmentations">Data Augmentations</h3><p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/data-augmentation-in-yolov4-c16bd22b2617">Data augmentation in YOLOv4</a> was one of the key contributions to YOLOv4's impressive performance. In Scaled-YOLOv4, the authors train on a less augmented dataset first, then turn up the augmentations for fine-tuning at the end of training. They also use "Test Time Augmentations," where a number of augmentations are made on the test set. Predictions are then averaged across those test augmentations to further boost their non-real time results. &nbsp;</p><h2 id="scaled-yolov4-results">Scaled-YOLOv4 Results</h2><p>Evaluations show that the Scaled-YOLOv4 models set the standard for both large and small object detection models.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image.png 650w"><figcaption>Scaled-YOLOv4 results, inference speed on the X-axis and COCO average precision on the Y-axis (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08036.pdf">cite</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The language in the Scaled-YOLOv4 paper speaks for itself:</p><blockquote>We can see that all scaled YOLOv4 models, including YOLOv4-CSP, YOLOv4-P5, YOLOv4-P6, YOLOv4- P7, are Pareto optimal on all indicators. When we compare YOLOv4-CSP with the same accuracy of EfficientDetD3 (47.5% vs 47.5%), the inference speed is 1.9 times [that of EfficientDetD3]. When YOLOv4-P5 is compared with EfficientDet-D5 with the same accuracy (51.4% vs 51.5%), the inference speed is 2.9 times [that of EfficientDet-D5]. The situation is similar to the comparisons between YOLOv4-P6 vs EfficientDet-D7 (54.3% vs 53.7%) and YOLOv4-P7 vs EfficientDet-D7x (55.4% vs 55.1%). In both cases, YOLOv4-P6 and YOLOv4-P7 are, respectively, 3.7 times and 2.3 times faster in terms of inference speed. </blockquote><p>And notably for YOLOv4-tiny:</p><blockquote>In addition, if one uses TensorRT FP16 to run YOLOv4-tiny on general GPU RTX 2080ti, when the batch size respectively equals to 1 and 4, the respective frame rate can reach 773fps and 1774fps, which is extremely fast.</blockquote><p><strong>If you want to push the ceiling for performance or speed for your object detection task, Scaled-YOLOv4 is the new place to look.</strong></p><p>The authors provide myriad ablation studies and many more research insights than we have written here.

<p>2020-12-20</p>


<p>About two years ago, I wrote a quite complicated diff tool in Clojure.<br>
It was complicated enough that I struggled to fit the algorithm in my head and the inputs were large enough that I had to make some efforts to improve performance.</p>
<p>About half a year later, I started learning Rust, ported the current state of the Clojure program into Rust, was very happy with the change<sup><a href="#hooked-on-rust">1</a></sup> and continued exclusively with Rust.<br>
While working on that project, I've developed some opinions about the two languages, especially about error handling and performance:</p>
<p>I think that these are areas where Rust excels, while they are among the weaker spots of Clojure<sup><a href="#not-hating-on-clojure">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To put my experience in context:
I had a bit more than one year of experience in Clojure when I moved to Rust.
The diff tool was by far the largest Clojure program I've ever written, and it was only about 3000 lines.<br>
When I started writing Rust, reimplementing the existing Clojure code was among my first Rust code.
I've continued learning Rust since then and have mostly stopped writing Clojure.<br>
If things have changed in Clojure recently, please let me know and I'll update the article.</p>
<h2 id="error-handling"><a href="#error-handling" aria-label="Anchor link for: error-handling">🔗</a>Error Handling</h2>
<p>The error handling requirements in this project were not very complicated.
All errors just needed to be logged and returned to the user.<br>
The only slightly unusual requirement was that parsing and validation logic should show all errors for each row in both uploaded excel files
(instead of just the first error) so I had to accumulate errors.</p>
<h3 id="error-handling-in-clojure"><a href="#error-handling-in-clojure" aria-label="Anchor link for: error-handling-in-clojure">🔗</a>Error Handling in Clojure</h3>
<p>Error handling in Clojure is not opinionated.<br>
<a href="https://lispcast.com/clojure-error-messages-accidental/">Similar to error messages</a>
, what error handling idioms exist in Clojure seem to me to be largely accidental or inherited from Java.</p>
<p>The standard library mostly supports <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/ex-info">exceptions</a>.<br>
There are some libraries that support returning error values instead of throwing exceptions like the error handling library <a href="https://github.com/adambard/failjure"><code>failjure</code></a>.<br>
Others, like the parsing library <a href="https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse"><code>instaparse</code></a>, return their own custom error values<sup><a href="#insta-result">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I used failjure to help accumulate errors in a nicer way (and because it appealed to my Haskell-influenced taste).</p>
<p>Let's look at a Clojure function from my diff tool that uses <a href="https://github.com/adambard/failjure#attempt-all">attempt-all</a> to parse and validate the input data.
If any errors occur, all errors are aggregated into a string:</p>
<pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn </span><span>parse
  </span><span>[country-mapping data]

                                  parse-result)]
   #_"</span><span>👇 if everything was successful, this is returned</span><span>"
   spec-result
   #_"</span><span>👇 if any failure occurred, this is returned</span><span>"
   (</span><span>fail/when-failed </span><span>[failure]
                       (</span><span>do
                         </span><span>(</span><span>log/warn
                           </span><span>(</span><span>str </span><span>"</span><span>Failed to parse data </span><span>"

                         failure))))
</span></code></pre>
<p>Nice things about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The identifier-expression pairs in the square brackets use the same syntax as Clojure's <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/let"><code>let</code>-form</a>
which makes it look familiar.</li>
<li>I can optionally add an error handling function to the very end, which is helpful to, e.g., log the argument of the function, as I did here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not so nice things about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can't see which functions can actually fail. I have to read them to find out.</li>
<li>Since the Clojure ecosystem doesn't have a uniform error handling style, I have to manually convert exceptions or other errors like <code>instaparse</code> error values to <code>failjure</code> errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>My verdict is:<br>
Since Clojure is a Lisp, it's possible to use most kinds of error handling and make it look fine, if you really want to.
The most pragmatic solution in most cases will be to use exceptions.</p>
<p>I found that readability could suffer when using less explicit error handling, especially in a dynamic language.</p>
<p>Due to the freedom of choice in error handling approacher, I was tempted to experiment more than with a more opinionated language.</p>
<h3 id="error-handling-in-rust"><a href="#error-handling-in-rust" aria-label="Anchor link for: error-handling-in-rust">🔗</a>Error handling in Rust</h3>
<p>Rust is quite opinionated about error handling.
The Rust community has worked on developing and improving common idioms, some of which were incorporated into the standard library, thereby improving the baseline error handling.</p>
<p>There's no improvement without change though, and the frequent changes have been a source of complaints.
While backwards compatibility was never broken, people that wanted their code to be idiomatic had to update it anyway.
Old tutorials and guides have therefore also become outdated.</p>
<p>There are lots of good, up-to-date articles about error handling in Rust<sup><a href="#rust-error-handling-links">4</a></sup>, which help learn the current idioms.</p>
<p>In Rust, functions that can error return the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/index.html"><code>Result</code></a> type<sup><a href="#panic-ref">5</a></sup>.<br>
There are several libraries that make creating your own errors or handling errors from libraries easier, but they (mostly) just use the types from the standard library instead of introducing new stuff that's incompatible with the rest of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Let's look at the same function as before, but this time in Rust:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub fn </span><span>parse</span><span>(
    </span><span>workbook</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Workbook,
    </span><span>country_mapping</span><span>: CountryMapping,
) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;Rule&gt;&gt; {
    </span><span>let</span><span> range = workbook
        .</span><span>worksheet_range</span><span>("</span><span>Rules</span><span>")
        </span><span>// this question mark triggers an early exit
        // there are two because we have an Option
        // containing a Result                    👇
        </span><span>.</span><span>ok_or</span><span>(format_err!("</span><span>Missing Rules sheet</span><span>"))??;
        </span><span>//                               👇
    </span><span>let</span><span> range = </span><span>skip_to_header_row</span><span>(range)?;
    </span><span>let</span><span> parsed = RangeDeserializerBuilder::new()
        .</span><span>has_headers</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)
        .</span><span>from_range</span><span>(&amp;range)
        </span><span>//                                    👇
        </span><span>.</span><span>context</span><span>("</span><span>Failed to read Rules sheet</span><span>")?;
    </span><span>let</span><span> rules = </span><span>collect_errs</span><span>(parsed.</span><span>map</span><span>(|</span><span>parse_result</span><span>| {
        parse_result
            </span><span>// 👇 mapping a lambda over the error value
            </span><span>.</span><span>map_err</span><span>(|</span><span>e</span><span>| e.</span><span>into</span><span>())
            </span><span>// 👇 this would be called flatMap in some other languages
            </span><span>.</span><span>and_then</span><span>(|</span><span>row</span><span>| row.</span><span>parse</span><span>(&amp;country_mapping))
    }))
    </span><span>// 👇 this converts a list of errors into a single error
    //    containing a string
    </span><span>.</span><span>map_err</span><span>(|</span><span>es</span><span>| {
        format_err!(
            "</span><span>Failed to parse {} rules:</span><span>\n</span><span>{}</span><span>",
            es.</span><span>len</span><span>(),
            </span><span>// 👇 very elegant...
            //    this would just be one .joinToString call in Kotlin
</span><span>            es.</span><span>into_iter</span><span>()
                .</span><span>map</span><span>(|</span><span>e</span><span>| e.</span><span>to_string</span><span>())
                .collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;()
                .</span><span>join</span><span>("</span><span>\n</span><span>")
        )
   </span><span>// 👇
    </span><span>})?;
    Ok(rules)
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Nice things about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The standard library, every Rust library I've ever seen and my own application code is always using the same <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html"><code>Result</code></a> type, which keeps things pretty compatible.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/error-handling-and-panics/the-question-mark-operator-for-easier-error-handling.html">The <code>?</code> operator</a> makes fallible functions visible but keeps it succinct.<br>
It also automatically converts error types where possible, which reduces the need for manual type conversion.</li>
<li>The error type I'm using here from the library <a href="https://docs.rs/anyhow/*/anyhow/index.html"><code>anyhow</code></a> supports a <a href="https://docs.rs/anyhow/*/anyhow/trait.Context.html"><code>.context</code></a> method, which gives otherwise unhelpful low-level errors the necessary context.<br>
This is usually done in exception-based languages by catching, wrapping and rethrowing, but this looks a lot more pleasant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not so nice things about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have to keep the error types compatible, which I accomplish in this case by not distinguishing between different error types at all<sup><a href="#anyhow-usecase">6</a></sup>.<br>
I still have to return a single error value, which means I have to manually and verbosely convert the list of errors into a single one - in this case a newline-delimited string.</li>
<li>If I want to log something when this entire function returns an error or add some <code>.context</code> to it, I would like to have the equivalent of a <code>try/catch</code>-block around the entire function body.<br>
This doesn't exist yet<sup><a href="#try-blocks">7</a></sup>, the current best practice seems to be do move the entire body into an inner function or lambda.</li>
</ul>
<p>My verdict is:<br>
In Rust, you will use the <code>Result</code> type and you will like it<sup><a href="#and-you'll-like-it">8</a></sup>.<br>
The main design decisions are whether you use some of the helper libraries and how you design your error types.</p>
<p>Designing the error types can be a challenge though, especially because it's a bit different than designing e.g. Java exception hierarchies.<br>
I was lucky that keeping up to date with the evolving error handling idioms wasn't too hard for me as I was not under time pressure and often worked in my spare time with learning as my primary objective.
It might have been painful for teams maintaining bigger production systems.<br>
The large number of error handling tutorials and articles should hopefully make it easier to learn now than it was a few years ago.</p>
<p>The learning curve aside:
To me, Rust's error handling feels like part of the secret sauce that makes it the most promising language for correctness that I know of.</p>
<h2 id="performance"><a href="#performance" aria-label="Anchor link for: performance">🔗</a>Performance</h2>
<p>The part of the program that caused performance issues was the diff algorithm and, to a slightly lesser extent, a data normalization step before that.<br>
The type of performance problems I had were mostly being CPU bound, having to generate and compare a lot of temporary data.
The large amount of data also often caused memory issues in both languages.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h4>From training to deployment with Metaflow and Cortex</h4></p><div content-type="article"><p>If we were to design an optimal machine learning pipeline, it would be:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Scalable</strong>. As workloads increased, it would scale up without issue.</li><li><strong>Reproducible</strong>. We would be able to draw a line from any model to its data.</li><li><strong>Configurable</strong>. It wouldn’t lock us into particular frameworks or tools.</li></ul><p>Typically, pipelines will tradeoff in at least one of these areas. A pipeline might be scalable, but will rely on a platform that puts limits on data scientists. Or, a pipeline will be completely configurable, but will also be glued together by a mess of ad hoc code and will be impossible to reproduce.</p><p>In this piece, I want to introduce a way to build this kind of ideal pipeline without any tradeoffs. To do this, we’ll be using <a href="https://metaflow.org/" target="_blank">Metaflow, the open source data science framework from Netflix</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex" target="_blank">Cortex, our open source deployment platform for machine learning</a>. </p><p>Let’s start by defining our pipeline.</p><h3>Defining a pipeline in Metaflow</h3><p>Metaflow is a data science framework that provides a single API for managing different pieces of the infrastructure stack. It places an emphasis on scalability, reproducibility, and usability.</p><div><p>
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XV5VGddmP24" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></div><p>At a high level, Metaflow allows us to define pipelines as DAGs, called “flows,” in which data undergoes a sequence of transformations called ”steps.” These steps persist transformed data as “data artifacts,” which are accessible by subsequent steps throughout the flow. </p><p>For example, say we had a training flow that loaded data (probably produced by another flow), trained multiple models with different strategies, evaluated the different models, and saved the top performer:</p><p>This is just a snapshot of our full pipeline, which I’ll be adding to in the next section, but even with just this snippet we have a repeatable training pipeline that can scale to run on many machines. We also have, thanks to Metaflow’s Client API, a way to version, audit, and reproduce these training runs.</p><p>For example, to instantiate a given step from a previous flow, we can simply pass in the flow name, run id, and step name to the Metaflow Client:</p><p>To access an artifact from a particular run, the logic is very similar:</p><p>This means that every time a flow is executed, Metaflow automatically versions and records it using a standard taxonomy. As a result, we can trace any given model’s lineage from raw data to final export. </p><p>There is much more to Metaflow, and I’d encourage you to check out their <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/" target="_blank">documentation</a> to learn more, but as an introduction, this should serve to get us started. </p><p>Now, let’s talk a bit about triggering deployments in Metaflow.</p><h3>Deploying models with Cortex</h3><p>In this section, I’m going to take our training flow from before and add a step for deploying our model as a production API on AWS. To do this, we’re going to use Cortex.</p><p>Cortex is a deployment platform for machine learning. On the surface, it provides simple interfaces for building prediction services, deploying them to production, and managing an inference cluster. </p><p>Under the hood, Cortex automates all of the cloud infrastructure needed for inference—autoscaling, GPU/ASIC support, load balancing, prediction tracking, etc—and implements a automated deployment process in which model serving code is packaged, versioned, and deployed to the cluster.</p><p>We can trigger a deployment using Cortex’s Python client within our training flow like this:</p><p>You’ll notice the client includes a deploy() method, which takes a configuration object for defining our API. This configuration works with the Metaflow client to extract the location of the model, and the metadata of the flow for logging purposes. Now, when we audit our deployments, we can connect it all the way back to the run that produced it, extending our lineage from data to deployment.</p><p>The configuration object also references a predict.py script, which is where the actual prediction service is defined. A Cortex predictor looks like this:</p><p>The structure is very simple. We initialize our model in the init() function, which runs on initial deployment, and we generate predictions in the predict() function. Similar to steps in Metaflow, these Python methods can contain whatever logic you want to implement.</p><p>Now, when we run the flow, the model will be trained, evaluated, and deployed to production with zero downtime or extra configuration needed. </p><p>Because Cortex provides native support for A/B testing and traffic splitting, we can even run complex deployment strategies without breaking Metaflow’s lineage.</p><p>For example, if after selecting a best model, we wanted to test how the model performed in different formats—say ONNX vs TensorFlow—we could export two versions of the model, deploy them both in an A/B test, and log their performance. Because our training flow is connected to our deployment, we can then pass this information back and forth between Cortex and Metaflow without issue.</p><h3>An easier path to production machine learning</h3><p>Over the years, a number of end-to-end data science platforms have been released, and most of them fall into the same traps:</p><ul role="list"><li>Providing a smooth interface, with zero transparency into what’s happening under the hood, killing reproducibility and auditing.</li><li>Solving one part of the stack well, like training, but “bolting on” under-developed solutions for other parts, like deployment.</li><li>Locking data scientists and machine learning engineers into a narrow stack by only supporting specific frameworks and integrations.</li></ul><p>The result is a platform that makes production machine learning easy—if you stay strictly within the confines of the system. When you have a diverse set of problems to solve, however, this is difficult to do.</p><p>Metaflow and Cortex represent a fundamentally different, human-centric approach. The emphasis is not on providing a magic solution to a narrow set of problems, but on providing an easy interface for building solutions to any problem.</p><p>If you’re interested in digging into either platform, check out the links below:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Metaflow documentation: </strong> <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/" target="_blank">https://docs.metaflow.org/</a></li><li><strong>Metaflow GitHub: </strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow" target="_blank">https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow</a></li><li><strong>Cortex documentation: </strong><a href="https://docs.cortex.dev/" target="_blank">https://docs.cortex.dev/</a></li><li><strong>Cortex GitHub: </strong><a href="https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex" target="_blank">https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex</a></li></ul><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<pre>Hi,

I saw your recent discussion on running Project Oberon on RISC-V. I've been
working on a RISC-V port for the last few months, which might be
interesting to you. A port of Project Oberon to RISC-V (i.e. a RV32IM
compiler and a port of the rest of the system), as well as an emulator that
can run it, can be found in these repositories:

<a href="https://github.com/solbjorg/oberon-riscv">https://github.com/solbjorg/oberon-riscv</a>
<a href="https://github.com/solbjorg/oberon-riscv-emu">https://github.com/solbjorg/oberon-riscv-emu</a>

If you just want to try it, there's a disk image included with the emulator.

To my knowledge, this RISC-V port is more complete than others that I have
found: the compiler can compile the Oberon system as well as itself, and
the system runs well in the emulator. It lacks support for REALs and
interrupts at the moment, but most programs are able to run without them.

The port is built on top of several other Oberon-related projects, which
I've credited in oberon-riscv's readme.

I'm planning to make it run on an FPGA in the future too, although that
will have to come after the holidays.

Kind regards,
Rikke

December 21, 2020 | https://blog.volta.sh/2020/12/21/announcing-volta-100/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.volta.sh/2020/12/21/announcing-volta-100/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>The Volta team is thrilled to announce that Volta 1.0.0 is now available! Volta is a fast, reliable utility for declaring your JavaScript <a href="http://calculist.org/blog/2020/12/21/tac/">Toolchains as Code</a>. In much the same way that Infrastructure as Code frees teams from manually managing their server infrastructure, <strong>Volta takes the hassle out of installing and coordinating JavaScript tools</strong>—such as Node, package managers, and package binaries—so that you can focus on creating awesome software.
<!--more--></p>



<p>The 1.0.0 release means that Volta is ready for general use in projects of all sizes. The new features included in version 1.0.0 are the last pieces in a string of work—begun with Volta 0.9.0—to make the most common tools work seamlessly with the benefits that Volta provides.</p>

<p>At the same time, 1.0.0 means more than, “we implemented some high-impact functionality and finally closed some long-standing issues.” From the beginning, Volta was built to empower engineers and engineering teams to build amazing JS applications without having to worry about their environment or tooling. For individual engineers, Volta unobtrusively makes sure your tooling is aligned with the needs of your project, allowing you to stay focused on your work. For engineering teams, Volta allows you to manage your infrastructure decision-making centrally without slowing down individual team members. When the team decides to change versions of Node, for example, that doesn’t require explicit effort on the part of each developer. With version 1.0.0, we believe Volta delivers on the promise of making tool management disappear.</p>

<p>Last, version 1.0.0 represents a commitment to stability. As we continue to add new features and support for more tools, we are committed to doing so in a backwards-compatible way. You can be confident that new releases won’t break your workflows or scripts.</p>



<h2 id="support-for-npm-link">Support for <code>npm link</code></h2>

<p>With the <a href="https://blog.volta.sh/2020/10/22/announcing-volta-090/">release of Volta 0.9.0</a>, we added support for installing tools directly with your package manager while still taking advantage of the benefits that Volta provides. We have extended that support to include linking your local packages with <code>npm link</code>, even across different npm versions. Additionally, if you try to link two projects that are using different Node versions, Volta will alert you that there might be incompatibilities that cause unexpected behavior.</p>

<h2 id="support-for-upgrading-global-packages">Support for upgrading global packages</h2>

<p>You can now upgrade your installed global packages directly with your package manager, using <code>npm update -g</code> or <code>yarn global upgrade</code>. Volta will make sure that the package manager can locate all of the packages so that they can be upgraded to their latest versions.</p>



<p>While we believe that Volta 1.0.0 achieves the goals for the project, that doesn’t mean that we are done! Active development will continue on Volta: adding new features, support for new tools, and fixing any bugs that crop up. A few items on our near-term roadmap include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Native builds for Apple M1 devices</li>
  <li>Support for using <a href="https://pnpm.js.org/"><code>pnpm</code></a> as your package manager</li>
  <li>Improvements to <code>volta list</code>, making it easier to visualize the state of your tools</li>
</ul>

December 21, 2020 | https://healeycodes.com/building-my-own-chess-engine/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://healeycodes.com/building-my-own-chess-engine/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>December 20, 2020<!-- --> in<!-- --> <span><a href="https://healeycodes.com/tags/python">Python</a></span></p></header><section><p>I have been learning chess (again) and how to program a chess engine (for the first time) over the last month. After skimming some introductory texts, I was convinced that building a simple chess engine — one that would put up a fair fight against a casual player — would take no more than a few days.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>But I made it there in the end and created a toy chess engine (<a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/andoma">healeycodes/andoma</a>) that I am proud of. It can play a game of chess and solve simple chess puzzles like mate-in-two or mate-in-three. It has a slim UCI interface which means it can be hooked up to lichess.org via <a href="https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lichess-bot">lichess-bot</a> — a bridge between the lichess API and chess bots.</p>
<p>The first speed bump in its development was grasping the computational the complexity of chess — how fast, and wide, the search tree grows. When a chess game starts, white can open in twenty different ways and black can respond in twenty different ways also. After the first full turn, there are 400 variations possible. After the third full turn, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number#Shannon's_calculation">over 119 million</a>.</p>
<p>Claude Shannon calculated that there are around <code>10^120</code> possible games of chess in his seminal paper <em>Programming a Computer for Playing Chess</em> in 1950. In <em>Rage Against the Machines</em>, Nate Silver <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rage-against-the-machines/">quotes</a> Diego Rasskin-Gutman, who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are more possible chess games than the number of atoms in the universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given unlimited resources, it actually doesn’t take many lines of code to calculate every legal variation of chess. Here, the Python package <a href="https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">python-chess</a> is used for board representation and legal move generation.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> chess <span>import</span> Board<span>,</span> Move<span>,</span> STARTING_FEN


positions <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span>

        positions<span>[</span>fen<span>]</span> <span>+=</span> legal_moves
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        positions<span>[</span>fen<span>]</span> <span>=</span> legal_moves

    <span>for</span> move <span>in</span> legal_moves<span>:</span>
        board<span>.</span>push<span>(</span>move<span>)</span>
        next_fen <span>=</span> board<span>.</span>fen<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        board<span>.</span>pop<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        
        generate_tree<span>(</span>next_fen<span>)</span>

<span>try</span><span>:</span>
    generate_tree<span>(</span>STARTING_FEN<span>)</span>
<span>except</span> RecursionError<span>:</span> 
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span>positions<span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span>p<span>)</span> <span>for</span> p <span>in</span> positions<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This program throws a <code>RecursionError</code> and prints <code>59691</code> — the number of different positions the search tree contained when it crashed. All we need to fix this, is another universe to run the program in.</p>
<p>Given that there are computational limits to abide by, as well as the time control rules of chess, improvements over a naive brute force search must be made.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation"><a href="#evaluation" aria-label="evaluation permalink"></a>Evaluation</h2>
<p>In order to search for good positions, it is necessary to understand what makes a good position <em>good</em>. The most simplistic way of describing a position’s strength is to compare the total value material of each side.</p>
<p>Tomasz Michniewski, author of the <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Simplified_Evaluation_Function">Simplified Evaluation Function</a>, defined some values that are “designed specifically to compensate for the lack of any other chess knowledge”. This is perfect for me — a beginner chess player.</p>
<p>This snippet sums the material on the initial board using Michniewski’s piece values.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>import</span> chess

piece_values <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    chess<span>.</span>PAWN<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span>

    chess<span>.</span>KING<span>:</span> <span>20000</span>
<span>}</span>

board <span>=</span> chess<span>.</span>Board<span>(</span>chess<span>.</span>STARTING_FEN<span>)</span>
white_material <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
black_material <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

<span>for</span> square <span>in</span> chess<span>.</span>SQUARES<span>:</span>
    piece <span>=</span> board<span>.</span>piece_at<span>(</span>square<span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> piece<span>:</span>
        <span>continue</span>
    <span>if</span> piece<span>.</span>color <span>==</span> chess<span>.</span>WHITE<span>:</span>
        white_material <span>+=</span> piece_values<span>[</span>piece<span>.</span>piece_type<span>]</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        black_material <span>+=</span> piece_values<span>[</span>piece<span>.</span>piece_type<span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Michniewski also provides <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Piece-Square_Tables">piece-square tables</a>, which alter the value of a piece depending on which square it sits on. For example, it’s better for pawns to progress up the board and it’s better for knights to be near the center of the board.</p>
<p>The bonus of a square may be positive, neutral, or negative. The piece-square tables are presented from White’s POV and must be mirrored for Black.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code># a knight's bonuses depending on square
-50,-40,-30,-30,-30,-30,-40,-50,
-40,-20,  0,  0,  0,  0,-20,-40,
-30,  0, 10, 15, 15, 10,  0,-30,
-30,  5, 15, 20, 20, 15,  5,-30,
-30,  0, 15, 20, 20, 15,  0,-30,
-30,  5, 10, 15, 15, 10,  5,-30,
-40,-20,  0,  5,  5,  0,-20,-40,
-50,-40,-30,-30,-30,-30,-40,-50,</code></pre></div>
<p>For the king, Michniewski provides two tables — one for the middle game and one for the end game. He defines the end game as being either if:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both sides have no queens or</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every side which has a queen has additionally no other pieces or one minorpiece maximum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The evaluation of a chess board is one of the things that’s kept me interested in chess engines. Evaluation rules are easy to add and take away. I refactored the code from Go to Python to be able to prototype different rules faster.</p>
<p>After piece-square tables, one might look at pawn structure, mobility, center control, connectivity, trapped pieces, king safety, space, tempo, and other patterns (this list is taken from the Chess Programming Wiki’s <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Evaluation">Evaluation</a> page).</p>
<h2 id="searching-with-minimax"><a href="#searching-with-minimax" aria-label="searching with minimax permalink"></a>Searching With Minimax</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">Minimax</a> is a search algorithm that finds the next optimal move by minimizing the potential loss in a worst case scenario. Chess is a game of perfect information — by looking at the board it’s possible to know exactly what an opponent is capable of. However, this search for moves is limited by the evaluation function and the depth that computing resources are able to reach.</p>
<p>The search space is a tree of legal moves which grows exponentially at every level (the average branching factor is around 35). By the time the tree is explored, the path to many future boards is known as well as which path restricts the opponent’s possible gains the most.</p>
<p>The leaf nodes of the tree return the evaluation of their current state. Non-leaf nodes inherit their value from a descendant node. Eventually, the recursive function reduces down to a value for the given board.</p>
<p>This function can be used to pick the next best move by calling it on every legal move available in the current turn. A great visual resource for this algorithm is Sebastian Lague’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI">Algorithms Explained – minimax and alpha-beta pruning</a>.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>minimax</span><span>(</span>board<span>,</span> depth<span>,</span> maximizing_player<span>)</span><span>:</span>

<h2 id="alpha-beta-pruning"><a href="#alpha-beta-pruning" aria-label="alpha beta pruning permalink"></a>Alpha-beta pruning</h2>
<p>My chess engine uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning">alpha-beta pruning</a> as an improvement over the naive minimax algorithm — which does not fare well against the exponential nature of chess. Branches of the search tree can be eliminated when it is clear that another branch shows more promise. This significantly reduces the number of moves required to be generated.</p>
<p><span>

    </span></p>
<p>By reducing the depth of branches that will not bear fruit we can search deeper down the better parts of the tree.</p>
<p>The speed of alpha-beta pruning can be increased by applying <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Move_Ordering">move ordering</a>. This is where the more promising branches of the search tree are searched first — which means less time is spent in the worst branches as they will be cut off early.</p>
<p>Move ordering cannot be 100% accurate but it’s a powerful optimization.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/andoma">my engine</a>, a cheap (but not perfect) <code>move_value</code> function is used to sort the initial legal move nodes from best to worst. The logic of this function is capture in its docstring:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>'''
How good is a move?
A promotion is great.
A weaker piece taking a stronger piece is good.
A stronger piece taking a weaker piece is bad.
Also consider the position change via piece-square table.
'''</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="communication-and-the-uci-protocol"><a href="#communication-and-the-uci-protocol" aria-label="communication and the uci protocol permalink"></a>Communication and the UCI Protocol</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/andoma/blob/main/uci-interface.md">Universal Chess Interface</a> (UCI) is a open protocol to hook up chess engines to user interfaces. The communication is done through standard input and standard output and messages end with <code>\n</code>. The move format is long algebraic notation — like <code>e2e4</code>, or <code>e1g1</code> for white short castling, and an example of a promotion to queen is <code>a7a8q</code>.</p>
<p>There are many configuration commands in the specification and it initially seemed overwhelming. After debugging, I found that not many were required to get a chess engine to the <em>Hello World</em> stage.</p>
<p>In order to hook my chess engine up to lichess via <a href="https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lichess-bot">lichess-bot</a>, I implemented the following. These commands are send to the engine from lichess-bot:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uci</code> - the engine reports its name, authors, and <code>uciok</code></li>
<li><code>isready</code> - the engine reports that it’s ready: <code>readyok</code></li>
<li><code>position startpos moves e2e4</code> - the engine sets it’s internal state to match the list of moves</li>
<li><code>go</code> - the engine should now calculate and respond with the next best move, like <code>g8f6</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-promise"><a href="#a-promise" aria-label="a promise permalink"></a>A Promise</h2>
<p>I have found a great joy interacting with the chess community over the last month. Lichess is a fantastic resource and endlessly fun to play on. The UI is slick and light — and the post-match analysis is revealing and simple to use. It’s <a href="https://github.com/ornicar/lila">open source</a> and relies on donations and sponsorships.</p>
<p>I took breaks from writing this article to play chess against Dad on a real board. We’re missing a white rook and use a pencil sharpener as a replacement piece. He has been telling me stories about playing chess decades ago — before IBM’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)">Deep Blue</a> emerged and beat Garry Kasparov, the reigning world champion, on its second attempt in 1997.</p>
<p>If you are within my social circle, you will have experienced me evangelizing chess and chess engines over the last month — now that I have published this, I promise to chill out a little bit ♟️</p>

<p>So, this <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/europol-and-european-commission-inaugurate-new-decryption-platform-to-tackle-challenge-of-encrypted-material-for-law-enforcement">press release</a> just dropped:</p>



<hr>



<blockquote><p>This week Europol launched an innovative decryption platform, developed in close cooperation with the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/joint-research-centre_en" target="_blank">European Commission’s Joint Research Centre</a>. It will significantly increase Europol’s capability to decrypt information lawfully obtained in criminal investigations.</p><p>The launch of the new decryption platform marks a milestone in the fight against organised crime and terrorism in Europe. In full respect of fundamental rights and without limiting or weakening encryption, this initiative will be available to national law enforcement authorities of all Member States to help keep societies and citizens safe and secure. A virtual inauguration ceremony brought together senior representatives from Europol, the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en" target="_blank">European Parliament</a>, the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/" target="_blank">Council of the EU</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/index_en" target="_blank">Commission</a>.</p><cite><a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/europol-and-european-commission-inaugurate-new-decryption-platform-to-tackle-challenge-of-encrypted-material-for-law-enforcement">https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/europol-and-european-commission-inaugurate-new-decryption-platform-to-tackle-challenge-of-encrypted-material-for-law-enforcement</a></cite></blockquote>



<hr>



<p>Now my gut reaction when anyone refers to “the launch of a new platform” with glowing descriptions and prescriptive outlook, is to remember Geoffrey James’ “Tao of Programming” – but this is more important than mere nerd flippancy, and so worthy of some deeper consideration. </p>



<p>The announcement continues:</p>



<hr>



<blockquote><p>Europol’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3">European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)</a>&nbsp;will operate the platform and leverage its in-house expertise in providing the most effective support to national Member State investigations.</p><cite>q.v.</cite></blockquote>



<hr>

And … “TWINS”? Ick.</figcaption></figure>



<hr>



<p>So, basically, this sounds something along the lines of <em>“we bought a whole pile of GPUs and/or rented them from somewhere, and we’re announcing it before Christmas so that people know that we are <strong>‘doing something about cyber™’</strong>“</em></p>



<p>But why would that be interesting? Why announce something? And why now?</p>



<p><strong>Gut feeling</strong>, followed by a <strong>wild, unsubstantiated guess</strong>: this is not a capability which one would normally announce. Stuff like this is very nerdy, and best kept in-house. Therefore it is being announced for a “soft goal”, done for the sake of being seen to be done. </p>



<p>What’s a good soft goal? Well, based upon my corporate (rather than Government) experience, there are two obvious options:</p>



<ol><li>“We have budget that we have to spend, and which we have to be seen to be spending, so that we can get the same or increased budget, next year”; or, more interestingly…</li><li>Someone with an ounce of sense regarding strategic face-saving, is looking at all the European Commission-led brouhaha regarding <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/12/14/encryption-council-adopts-resolution-on-security-through-encryption-and-security-despite-encryption/">“We need to have good security IN SPITE of good security, oh, wait, did I say security? I meant ‘encryption’, of course”</a> – and  is announcing this in order to have a face-saving programme in the (likely? I hope likely) instance that all of that political sound and fury, comes to nothing.</li></ol>



<p>Number 2 is particularly interesting to me because the European Commission is called-out on the press release headline; I can’t imagine that as happening on a more mundane, geek- or budget-led press release. Hence thinking that the EC want to be seen to be taking a diversity of approaches towards encryption. </p>



<p>Maybe I am wrong, so perhaps someone who knows more about the operations of Europol press releases, can comment? Anonymously, via Strong Encryption and Tor, if desired?</p>

<h2 id="foreword"><a href="#foreword" aria-label="foreword permalink"></a>Foreword</h2>
<p>Welcome to the second issue of the <em>eBPF Updates</em>! This time we have
interesting resources about how to write eBPF programs with Zig, or with Rust,
or on how to manage them with libbpf. On the kernel side, modules now support
BTF, and improvements to memory accounting for eBPF should help to solve the
limitations of rlimit. Did this just sound incomprehensible to you? Do not
fear, we also have some gentle introductions to eBPF in the list. This issue
also introduces a “Did You Know” section, and this time the focus is on CO-RE.
Read, learn, trace, and filter!</p>
<h2 id="important-news"><a href="#important-news" aria-label="important news permalink"></a>Important News</h2>

<li><a href="https://blog.container-solutions.com/the-top-reasons-why-you-should-give-ebpf-a-chance"><em>The Top Reasons Why You Should Give eBPF a Chance</em></a>,
from Lucas Severo Alves.<br>
Several factors are responsible for eBPF's success and should make readers
consider learning about, or using, this technology. This post cites its
powerful tracing capabilities, with the ability to attach to nearly any
function in the kernel with little impact on performance. Another reason is
that more and more companies, including large ones, are adopting eBPF; a
detailed list follows. At last, eBPF makes it possible to quickly develop
tools to instrument new parts of the kernel, without the need to go through a
longer process to upstream new attach points.</li>
<li><a href="https://cmd.com/blog/making-bpf-easy-with-libbpf-and-zig/"><em>Making BPF easy with libbpf and Zig</em></a>,
from Matt Knight.<br>
The <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> programming language is used to create and
handle a simple eBPF program in this tutorial, both for the user space loader
and the eBPF program itself. The objective is mostly to understand how libbpf
manipulates the ELF object containing a program in order to load it, but
compiling from Zig, which aims at competing with C while offering some newer
features, may open new perspectives. The code is available
<a href="https://github.com/mattnite/zig-bpf-intro">on GitHub</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/13943">Weight support for Cilium's eBPF-based Maglev load balancer implementation</a>,
from Fankaixi Li.<br>
A new pull request by a software engineer at ByteDance (TikTok) popped up,
adding weight support to the eBPF-based
<a href="https://cilium.io/blog/2020/11/10/cilium-19#maglev">Maglev implementation in Cilium</a>.
Maglev provides consistent hashing for high-availability scenarios, and
balance packets to the same backends even if they arrive at different load
balancing nodes. The feature adds the possibility to assign weights to favor
some backends. It is still being discussed, but should land soon.</li>
<li><a href="https://kccncna20.sched.com/event/ekDR/beyond-the-buzzword-bpfs-unexpected-role-in-kubernetes-andrew-randall-alban-crequy-kinvolk"><em>Beyond the Buzzword: BPF’s Unexpected Role in Kubernetes</em></a>,
from Andrew Randall and Alban Crequy.<br>
After a high-level overview of eBPF, this presentation depicts the landscape
of the projects gravitating around this technology. The authors explain that
there are many powerful tools based on eBPF, although none of them would
cover Kubernetes clusters. As an answer to fill the gap, they introduce
Inspektor Gadget, which reuses some elements from the bcc tools to provide a
new set of monitoring gadgets for examining Pods. Note that the wording in
the slides might be misleading: If there was no equivalent to bcc for tracing
containers before Inspektor Gadget, there <em>are</em> other tools targeting the
platform, such as Cilium/Hubble for network and observability or BPFd for
running bcc scripts in containers.</li>
<li><a href="https://filipnikolovski.com/posts/ebpf/"><em>TIL: eBPF is awesome</em></a>,
from Filip Nikolovski.<br>
We all agree on this! This post is a gentle introduction to eBPF. A bit of
history, some details on the core infrastructure and its components, and a
simple “Hello, World!” example extracted from
<a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/34cada17f798b8e00268d1ba4a4a8d765b948532/examples/tracing/hello_fields.py">the bcc tools</a>.
A nice read if you just got started with eBPF.</li>
<li><a href="https://suchakra.wordpress.com/2020/11/20/building-an-esoteric-filesystem-tracing-tool-with-ebpf/"><em>Building an Esoteric Filesystem Tracing Tool with eBPF</em></a>,
from Suchakra Sharma.<br>
This post has a focus on the read-ahead mechanism in the Linux kernel. After
providing a refresher on how read-ahead works, Suchakra explains in details
how eBPF can monitor the hit rate and efficiency of this mechanism. It turns
out that the program used to do that already exists in two versions, one with
a mix of C and Python proper to the bcc tools, and another one based on
libbpf and the newer features brought by the library, like CO-RE (Compile
Once, Run Everywhere). The last section details the benefits of the latter
version and the motivations to port tools to libbpf.</li>
<li><a href="https://lac2020.sciencesconf.org/data/proceedings.pdf#section*.12"><em>eXpress Data Path Kernel Objects for Real-Time Audio Streaming Optimization</em></a> (PDF),
from Christoph Kuhr and Alexander Carôt.<br>
Focusing on audio packet processing, this work aims at facilitating the set
up of a rehearsal environment for conducted orchestras via the Internet with
up to sixty musicians. The system may be susceptible to latency issues when
the different UDP streams must be processed and combined. The authors
investigated the use of XDP for processing these UDP streams, aggregating
them in the kernel and reporting only the final audio sample to the user
application. The authors found that XDP was not ideal, because of its lack of
floating-point operations and because it does not permit to retrieve hardware
timestamps. They were also limited by the incompatibility between LLVM, used
to compile the eBPF programs, and their build system, and could not
experiment on one part of their frontend. And although XDP increased the
performance, they realized that they could obtain similar speeds for their
use case with an optimized handling of a generic raw socket. Still, the use
case and experiment remain an interesting read.<br>
Video of the presentation may be available in the future from
<a href="https://lac2020.sciencesconf.org/">the page of the conference</a>, if it gets
uploaded.</li>
<li><a href="https://thenewstack.io/primer-how-xdp-and-ebpf-speed-network-traffic-via-the-linux-kernel/"><em>Primer: How XDP and eBPF Speed Network Traffic via the Linux Kernel</em></a>,
from Jack Wallen.<br>
There is a resolute focus on XDP in this article which describes how this
eBPF hook can speed up network traffic on Linux. This is followed by a simple
tutorial, where bcc is used to attach a XDP program and to track UDP packets
sent to a given port.</li>
<li><a href="https://nakryiko.com/posts/libbpf-bootstrap/"><em>Building BPF applications with libbpf-boostrap</em></a>,
from Andrii Nakryiko.<br>
You want to start developing an eBPF application, but you feel intimidated by
libbpf's complexity or lack of documentation? You <em>must</em> have a look at
libbpf-bootstrap. This project builds simple application templates, on which
you can directly build your software. Of the two available templates, the
simplest one (<code>minimal</code>) manipulates an eBPF program that simply logs the PID
of the process that calls it. The more advanced template (<code>bootstrap</code>) sets
up an application with more advanced features like eBPF maps, read-only
configuration variables, eBPF ring buffer, or CO-RE which needs a BTF (BPF
Type Format) description of the kernel's internals. This means that using
these features gets simple and immediate, all is set up for you in the
template. This article goes into a thorough description of the mechanisms
involved. This is a long read, but well worth it if you want to program
applications working with eBPF.</li>
<li><a href="https://pluginized-protocols.org/xbgp/2020/11/29/xbgp-hello.html"><em>A first xBGP plugin</em></a>,
from Thomas Wirtgen.<br>
As a follow-up from the link to the paper for xBGP in the previous issue of
these <em>eBPF Updates</em>, this is the introduction of a first eBPF-based xBGP
plugin. The idea is that, quoting the post, “<em>a network operator would like
to ignore the BGP UPDATE messages that contain an unknown attribute. A
practical example of this usage is when problems with the processing of BGP
Path attribute 128 caused the failure of BGP sessions</em>”. All steps required
for running this example are provided. The code is hosted on
<a href="https://github.com/pluginized-protocols/xbgp_plugins.git">GitHub</a>, but there
is also a
<a href="https://github.com/pluginized-protocols/libxbgp/blob/master/misc/Dockerfile_xbgp">Dockerfile</a>
packaging all the required elements.</li>

from Thomas Graf.<br>
In this presentation at the NAG (Network Architecture Geeks) Cafe in
December, Thomas outlines how eBPF allows to build powerful service-centric
networking models and how to evolve away from the old device-centric
networking architecture to meet requirements of containers and cloud-native
environments.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/simplestaking/integrating-an-ebpf-based-firewall-into-the-tezedge-node-with-multipass-validations-769d4c6ccd93"><em>Integrating an eBPF-based firewall into the TezEdge node with multipass validations</em></a>,
from Juraj Selep.<br>
TezEdge peer-to-peer nodes validate blocks for the decentralized
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tezos">Tezos</a> blockchain, providing smart
contracts. Blockchain networks are subject to DDoS (Distributed Denial of
Service) attacks, generally mitigated with a firewall. In the current case,
XDP is used to implement it. The eBPF program checks that each connection
starts with a valid and unique proof of work, making it expensive for an
adversary to start many connections. This is further integrated with the

            <div>
              <div>
              <p>Haskell has a stigma of having poor or no documentation at all. Though more and more maintainers are doing a hell of a job to improve the quality of their libraries and applications, it is still not enough. We need to strengthen our vision of documentation collectively and as a consequence, master the existing tools for doing that.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/">different types of documentation</a>. Today we want to talk about API and libraries documentation inside your library, and accordingly about Haskell gear for that – <a href="https://www.haskell.org/haddock/">Haddock</a>.</p>
<p>The blog post is going to give Haddock overview, suggest documentation best practices, reveal the specialities of the Haddock tool, and show-and-tell lots of different examples of how to squeeze more out of your documentation. It should be interesting to library maintainers, developers who want to improve their documenting skills and everyone interested in documentation techniques in Haskell.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-haddock">What is Haddock<a href="#what-is-haddock">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Haddock is the Haskell way to document exposed API of your library or application. Writing special comments alongside your code helps to keep code and documentation synchronised and up-to-date (as outdated documentation is a painful problem to deal with). It also makes the docs comfy both for maintainers and users. And Haddock provides precisely that. Haskell is not always beginner-friendly, so giving a helping hand to users of your code in a convenient way is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>You write documentation using the special Haddock markup language right near the structures you want to document, and it can be rendered to different formats, including styled HTML, that could be viewable later on <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/">Hackage</a>, <a href="https://www.stackage.org/">Stackage</a> or even locally. Moreover, if you upload your library to Hackage or Stackage, <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/">Hoogle</a> will search for definitions by name or type across all packages, including yours.</p>
<p>Here is how a typical Haddock documentation page for a module looks like:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kowainik.github.io/images/haddock/haddock-membrain.png" alt=""><figcaption>Haddock Module Example</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To produce the documentation, Haddock needs to build the project first because it uses build-time information. But you don’t need to worry about it usually, because build tools do that automatically when you ask them to output documentation.</p>

<p>Haddock is written in Haskell comments with the special annotations. There are two types of Haddock marked comments – <strong>pre-</strong> (starting with the <code>|</code> symbol) and <strong>post-comments</strong> (starting with the <code>^</code> symbol), which means that Haddock comments could be put right before or after the function/type/class definitions.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>-- | I am the 'foo' function's Haddock pre-comment.</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>foo ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>bar ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span>-- ^ I am the 'bar' function's Haddock post-comment</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For multi-line Haddock comments you can use either <strong>per-line</strong> or <strong>block</strong> style comments for both pre and post types. The special Haddock symbol needs to be added just to the first line of the multi-line comment, and Haddock will consume following lines until the first non-comment line.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>-- | This is multiline</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>-- per-line Haddock pre-comment</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span>foo ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"></span>
<span id="cb2-5"></span>
<span id="cb2-6"><span>bar ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><span>-- ^ Another per-line Haddock</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><span>-- post-comment</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"></span>
<span id="cb2-10"><span>{- | Multiline Haddock</span></span>
<span id="cb2-11"><span>block pre-comment</span></span>
<span id="cb2-12"><span>-}</span></span>
<span id="cb2-13"><span>baz ::</span> <span>Double</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Text</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you write multi-line comments in your code, we strongly advise using <strong>block</strong> comments by default over per-line ones because of the number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are fewer chances to lose part of your documentation due to the extra newline with multiline comments syntax, unlike per-line comments. Remember, that Haddock consumes comments marked as documentation until the first non-comment line, and a newline without <code>--</code> separates such comments into ordinary independent groups.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>-- | I am a normal line of documentation.</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span>-- I will be in the docs too.</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"></span>
<span id="cb3-4"><span>-- I am not going to make it due to the missing @--@ in the previous line.</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><span>foo ::</span> <span>Int</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>As a consequence, it’s impossible to have conditional documentation chunks under the <a href="https://guide.aelve.com/haskell/cpp-vww0qd72">C Preprocessor (CPP)</a> pragmas when using the <code>--</code> style of comments, as CPP pragmas are stripped to empty lines.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiline comments contain less noise (no <code>--</code> on each line), making it easier to read and update.</p></li>
<li><p>They are more suitable for inserting/copying/updating code snippets quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>They also occupy less space horizontally on average, because you don’t waste 3 characters on each line.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-can-be-documented">What can be documented<a href="#what-can-be-documented">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Generally, Haddock documents the exposed API of your Haskell libraries and applications.</p>
<p>More specifically, Haddock can be applied to document the following parts of the Haskell code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Top-level module headers</li>
<li>Type definitions: <code>data</code>, <code>type</code> and <code>newtype</code></li>
<li>Constructors and fields</li>
<li>Typeclasses — <code>class</code> declarations</li>
<li>Typeclasses methods</li>
<li>Instances</li>
<li>Derived typeclasses</li>
<li>Top-level functions</li>
<li>Arguments and return results of functions</li>
<li>More exotic top-level definitions: <code>pattern</code>, <code>type family</code>, <code>data family</code>, <code>type instance</code> and <code>data instance</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The below example showcases some Haddock syntax and features:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>{- | Our example sum type.</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><span>__Examples:__</span></span>

<span id="cb4-47">    <span>getChar</span> (<span>CharCode</span> _ c) <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> c</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When documentation is built, it will look like on the screenshot below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kowainik.github.io/images/haddock/haddock-overall-example.png" alt=""><figcaption>Haddock Overall Example</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr>
<p>We don’t recommend using the Haddock comment syntax for other places where they cannot be applied by specification because this breaks Haddock. Even though the documentation states that such comments should be ignored, it is not what you would get on the output.</p>
<p>For example, the following innocent-looking Haddock results in the documentation error:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>var ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2">var <span>=</span> <span>42</span> <span>-- ^ The answer</span></span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>Haddock coverage:

src/BlogpostHaddock.hs:57:10: error:
    parse error on input '-- ^ The answer'
   |
57 | var = 42 -- ^ The answer
   |          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre>
<p>This issue will prevent the documentation appearing at Hackage and Stackage, which means that users won’t be able to read package documentation easily or search by the package in Hoogle.</p>
<p>Correct documentation looks like this:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>var ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-- ^ The answer</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2">var <span>=</span> <span>42</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you wanted to leave an ordinary (non-documentation) comment:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>var ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2">var <span>=</span> <span>42</span> <span>-- The answer</span></span></code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>We are not going to cover all annotation syntax. You can learn more from the <a href="https://haskell-haddock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">official documentation</a>. Instead, we will try to focus on best practices, advice and more explanation of suitability and usability of some various pieces of documentation on different levels.</p>
<h2 id="haddock-fishing">Haddock Fishing<a href="#haddock-fishing">🔗</a></h2>
<p>As most of us are looking at the libraries’ documentation through Hackage/Stackage/Haddock or local options of the same format, we are going to cover each layer of the documentation on the page piece by piece from top to bottom and see how we can use 100% of each element.</p>
<p>Every page is responsible for one Haskell module and correspondingly reflects its structure, though in a user-configurable way (we will cover later the ways to take control over that). So, with respect to that, let’s start diving into the meaning of each and every documentation piece.</p>
<div>
<p>Though, sometimes you are interested only in specific types and functions, not in reading the full documentation. Hackage helps here as well. You can press the <kbd>s</kbd> button on a package page to quickly jump to definitions.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kowainik.github.io/images/haddock/haddock-relude-search.png" alt=""><figcaption>Haddock Search Example</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<h3 id="top-level">Top Level<a href="#top-level">🔗</a></h3>
<p>First thing you see on the module documentation page is this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kowainik.github.io/images/haddock/haddock-top-level-header.png" alt=""><figcaption>Haddock top-level header</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This whole information is taken from the top-level Haddock comment for the module. The comment is attached to the <code>module</code> construction in the source file. You can put extensions (<code>{-# LANGUAGE ... #-}</code>) and options (e.g.&nbsp;<code>{-# OPTIONS_GHC ... #-}</code>) either <em>before</em> the module header comment or <em>after</em>, but we recommend putting module Haddock comment closer to the module keyword itself, <strong>after</strong> all language extensions and module-specific options.</p>
<p>So the module layout may look like this:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><span>{-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications    #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><span>{- | ... Module header comment</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><span>-}</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6"></span>
<span id="cb9-7"><span>module</span> <span>MyModule</span> (<span>...</span>) <span>where</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>The meta-information in the border to the right is the result of special annotations at the beginning of the top-level Haddock. If it isn’t present in the file, then none will be shown in there (except for automatically determined info by the tool you are using).</p>
<p>These annotations include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Module</code> – Module name</li>
<li><code>Description</code> – Short description</li>
<li><code>Copyright</code> – Copyright note (preserves newlines)</li>
<li><code>License</code> or <code>Licence</code> or <code>SPDX-License-Identifier</code> – the name of the license used in the project</li>
<li><code>Maintainer</code> – information about current maintainer, can include email</li>
<li><code>Stability</code> – <em>experimental</em> or <em>stable</em></li>
<li><code>Portability</code> – <em>portable</em> or <em>non-portable</em>, but you can put anything basically. This field meaning is not strictly defined. Some people use it for OS-portability and write something like POSIX, Windows, portable. Other people mean “the Haskell compiler according to standard portability” and put “non-portable” here if a module uses GHC-only extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Auto-filled, no manual fill-in is possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Safe Haskell</code> – <code>Safe</code>, <code>Trustworthy</code>, <code>Unsafe</code> or <code>None</code> (default)</li>
<li><code>Language</code> – Haskell report: 98 or 2010</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the fields are optional, in free format and don’t have any requirements. Adding this header to each module is advisable.</p>

         <p> 儘管遭點名的台廠都相當低調，但近期已有不少國內汽車零組件廠開始「動起來」，透露Apple Car大單將至的訊息。其中，和大位於嘉義大埔美園區的新廠，正加速AI智能化產線布建，明年第2季將可新增六條產線投產。</p>
         <!--3-->
         
         <p> 和勤也積極進行兩岸擴產，台灣全興廠預計年底完成搬遷及量產，嘉興和新廠第五車間擴廠訂明年第2季完成搬遷。</p>
         <!--4-->
         
         <p> 富田位於銅鑼的二期廠預計明年投產，一、二期廠電動車動力馬達零組件產能，可由目前的每年40萬套，一舉拉升至100萬套，動力集成系統則增至40萬套以上。</p>
         <!--5-->
         
         <p> 業界指出，除了電動車龍頭特斯拉之外，國內電動車供應鏈最近出現一個新的發燒名詞「美國雙A」，積極向台廠下單。</p>
         <!--6-->
         
         <p> 儘管供應鏈廠商都簽署保密協定，不願透露細節，但知情的業者坦言，「美國雙A」指的就是蘋果（Apple）與亞馬遜（Amazon）兩家廠商，業者暱稱為「一個大A，一個小A」。</p>
         <!--7-->
         
         <p> 蘋果對電動車的進度始終秘而不宣，外界原本預期，至少到2023年才會發表Apple Car。不過，國內供應鏈大廠董座直言，客戶規劃Apple Car明年9月將發表；另外，亞馬遜與Rivian合作的電動貨卡車，明年8月搶先問世，關鍵供應鏈也都是台廠。</p>
         <!--8-->
         
         <p> 電動車供應鏈大廠高層透露，隨著訂單出貨、組裝完成，Apple Car首款原型車，已有數十輛秘密在美國加州上路測試中，預料放量出貨與商機效益明年發酵，2022年全面爆發。</p>
         <!--9-->
         
         <p> 另外，電動車新創公司Rivian，去年獲得亞馬遜10萬輛電動貨車訂單，雙方密切研發客製化純電小貨車，相關零組件也是倚靠台灣供應鏈，新車預計明年8月在美國上路，2022年在全球開始服務。</p>
         <!--10-->
         
         <p> 據了解，配合特斯拉增產，以及「美國雙A」等新客戶的加入，國內主要電動車供應鏈包括和大、貿聯、和勤、富田等都出現「爆單」的情形，並積極擴廠、擴產。</p>
         <!--11-->
         
         <p> 值得注意的是，上銀集團也加速布局電動車領域，目前正與歐洲及中國大陸電動車零件大廠洽談客製化智慧滾珠螺桿，最快明年底前開始出貨，主要用於電動車轉向與剎車系統。</p>

<p>Such are images of hope: Nurses getting vaccinated. Pallets of packaged vaccines distributed on special flights. Mayors exulting over "the beginning of the end of the pandemic.” A president who is preparing the country for better times.</p>


<div>
<p>These images are from the United States.</p><p>In Germany, on the other hand, you see desolate shopping streets, shuttered restaurants and a government that is preparing its population for long, dark days.</p><p>The contrast is unmistakable. On the one hand, there is the supposedly incompetent Trump administration, which will provide vaccines to 20 million Americans in the next two to three weeks alone. By the end of March, the plan is for around 100 million Americans to have received the two vaccine injections they need.</p><p>On the other hand, there is the supposedly well-prepared Europeans, who continue to have to wait for a vaccine that was developed in Germany. And who still don’t know exactly how much of the vaccine they will be getting in the coming months.</p>
</div>

<p>Initially, Germany’s health minister has announced, there will probably only be 400,000 vaccine doses for Germany, with another 11 to 13 million to follow by March -- a fraction of the amount the Americans are getting.</p>

<section data-area="contentbox">

</section>
<p>It’s a politically dangerous situation that has now been recognized by the German government. Since last week, it has been taking hectic countermeasures. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) now wants to approve the vaccine a week earlier than planned, and vaccinations are slated to begin in Europe on Dec. 27. Negotiations are also underway with manufacturers to obtain more doses. On Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel even spoke with BioNTech founders Özlem Türeci and Uğur Șahin in a livestream, part of which was broadcast publicly. The message couldn’t be any clearer: Vaccination is now the chancellor’s business.</p>

<div>
<p>That realization has come too late, however. For months, it has been clear that other countries would have more doses of the vaccine, would start vaccinating sooner and, as a result, would be able to take more effective action against the pandemic.</p><p>But in Berlin and at European Union headquarters in Brussels, too little action was taken for too long, and it was often justified with complacent arguments: In Europe, medicines are tested better and more precisely than elsewhere in the world, and vaccines are available in abundance thanks to good planning. Health Minister Jens Spahn announced that the critical mass of around 60 percent of the German population could be vaccinated.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Too Little, Too Late</h3><p>But, so far at least, his optimism hasn’t been matched by reality.</p><p>And the late approval of the active ingredient in the BioNTech and Pfizer vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) appears to be the least of the problems. The bigger issue is that if the situation remains as it is now, there will not be enough vaccine available to get the pandemic under control in Germany before next autumn. The EU appears to have bought too little, too late and at times from the wrong producers. And it appears that it turned down hundreds of millions of vaccine doses that are now lacking.</p><p>Dramatic consequences are brewing for the German government: Without being able to vaccinate on a broad scale, the country won’t be able to stop the virus. Which means that the fall and winter of 2021 could be similar to this year, with high infection rates, contact restrictions and lockdowns. The only remedy would be a massive increase in the number of vaccines that are approved for use.</p><p>But Berlin has made an uncompromising commitment to European solidarity on the vaccination issue. And that means it’s not only the influential and economically strong member states that will have access, but also smaller countries like Romania and Slovenia. If Germany were to go out on its own and buy up vaccine doses that are in short supply, it would massively threaten cohesion in a Europe that is already fragile.</p><p>At the same time, though, the German federal government has an obligation to do all it can to protect its people.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Scientists estimate that 60 to 70 percent of Germany’s population would need to be vaccinated in order to stop the virus. That would require 100 to 120 million doses because, with one exception, all the vaccines currently available have to be administered in two doses before they deliver immunity.</p><p>The EU has ordered a total of 1.3 billion doses from six different manufacturers. Germany is entitled to 18.6 percent of those doses in a distribution mechanism calculated according to its share of the EU population. That amounts to around 250 million doses. But the number is misleading.</p><p>Currently, the only deliveries that are certain are those from German-American consortium BioNTech/Pfizer and the American biotech company Moderna.</p><p>BioNTech, whose vaccine is to be approved by the EU on Dec. 21, will be able to supply around 45 million doses to Germany in the first half of the year, according to current estimates. Moderna, whose vaccine is due to be authorized for use in Europe on Jan. 6, could supply around 15 million doses. Together, that’s a total of 60 million doses, which is far too little.</p><h3>But When?</h3><p>Additional supplies are to come from four other producers with whom the EU has contracts. But it remains highly uncertain when they will be able to deliver. No matter what happens, no significant quantities are expected before the summer.</p><p>The Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca had to interrupt its vaccine trial and delivered disappointing testing data. French company Sanofi has postponed possible approval for its vaccine candidate to the end of 2021. Meanwhile, the vaccine from CureVac, based in Tübingen, Germany, isn’t expected until this summer. The only company that is close to delivering another vaccine candidate is Johnson &amp; Johnson in the U.S., and it isn’t expected until March.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Of course, not all of these developments could have been foreseen. The U.S., for example, believed that Sanofi would be quicker in delivering its vaccine. Still, the procurement of vaccines in Europe has been a bumpy road from the start.</p><p>Germany initiated a small vaccine alliance in the spring together with France, Italy and the Netherlands. In a first step, they reached an agreement with AstraZeneca for 400 million doses. The move was primarily intended as a means of exerting pressure because there wasn’t enough happening in Brussels. "Many countries around the world have already secured vaccines, but Europe hasn’t yet,” Health Minister Spahn warned at the time.</p><p>In mid-June, the European Commission subsequently presented an EU vaccine strategy to "ensure fair and equitable access for all across the EU.” Sufficient supplies for the member states were to be ensured by providing purchasing guarantees to manufacturers.</p><p>Health care is actually one of the competencies that is reserved for the member states in the EU. But the vaccine supply was meant to serve as a symbol of solidarity in contrast to the U.S., where Donald Trump was propagating his "America First” stance and fueling merciless global competition for the coveted vaccines.</p><p>Between August and October, the EU concluded the first of its contracts: with the pharmaceutical giants Sanofi, Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca. Even at the time, though, it was conspicuous that the companies with the most promising vaccine candidates were not given firm contracts. BioNTech and Moderna had already obtained promising results from their studies in July and were entering the home stretch.</p><h3>No Comment</h3><p>Behind the scenes, this was the source of anger and irritation within government circles in Berlin. The irritation grew significantly in November, when the companies published data that their vaccine candidates are each up to 95 percent effective.</p><p>The manufacturers have repeatedly made it clear that they intend to distribute the vaccine according to two criteria: population size and when the contract was signed.</p><p>Way back in July, the U.S. secured 600 million doses of the BioNTech vaccine and 500 million doses from Moderna. Japan, Canada, Hong Kong and others signed contracts in the summer and autumn. The EU only reserved doses. It didn’t place concrete orders until mid-November. And even then, it ordered far less than it could have.</p>

<p>The EU only secured 200 million doses from BioNTech, with an option for 100 million more that would be manufactured later. According to sources with knowledge of the negotiations, BioNTech had additional capacity and apparently offered that capacity to the EU: up to 500 million doses in the first round.</p><p>But the European Commission reportedly rejected the offer. European Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides would not comment on the exact reason. "We do not comment on the progress of negotiations," a commission spokesman said.</p><p>Why were only 300 million doses of a vaccine secured that had already demonstrated 95 percent efficacy in clinical trials at the time? One that had been hailed as a sensation and was already on its way to regulatory approval? German Health Minister Spahn pushed for more to be purchased, but he failed to prevail in the end due to opposition from several EU member countries -- in part, apparently, because the EU had ordered only 300 million doses from the French company Sanofi. "That’s why buying more from a German company wasn't in the cards,” says one insider familiar with the negotiations. The European Commission has denied that version of events,&nbsp;saying it isn’t true that Paris took massive steps to protect Sanofi.</p>

<p>However, similar reports have emerged from the negotiations with the U.S. producer Moderna. Studies also showed its product to have efficacy of 95 percent. But the EU only ordered …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

After all, Jupiter and Saturn influenced Earth’s growth and evolution. Evidence suggests there were at least three occasions on which they (Jupiter especially) chose Earth’s evolutionary path, some 4.5 billion years ago, helping to shape the planet we know and love today.</p><p>The wee infant Earth was just sitting there growing<span><br></span>Some rocky things flying by, crashing and glowing.<span><br></span>But far from the Sun, way out in the cold<span><br></span>The giants were stirring. A force to behold!<sup>3</sup></p><p>Planets grow within swirling disks of gas and dust around young stars. We have images of these disks taken with our biggest telescopes, especially the giant radio telescope ALMA. Here is one of ALMA’s classics:</p><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18046_4fea1a6421a72296a12cd7898b93858e.jpg" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><i>ALMA image of the planet-forming disk around the nearby star TW Hydrae. The disk as a whole is similar in size to the solar system, and the inner hole in the inset is about the size of Earth’s orbit.</i></span><span>S. Andrews (Harvard-Smithsonian CfA), ALMA (ESO / NAOJ / NRAO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Jupiter starved the growing Earth. This may sound like a bad thing, but without Jupiter, Earth would probably have become a colossal “super-Earth” and moved inward, onto a roasting-hot orbit close to the Sun. Not great for life.</p><p>Planets grow out of dust. It drifts around in a disk, then piles up to form 100 kilometer-scale “planetesimals,” the real building blocks of the planets. Think of these like the potato-shaped asteroids from <i><a href="http://nautil.us/blog/the-emodiversity-of-star-wars" target="_blank">Star Wars</a></i>—just bigger, farther apart, and without the giant space slugs. The rings in the ALMA image are pile-ups of sand-sized dust, where these objects may be forming right now.</p><p>Planetesimals grow further by bashing into each other, and also by sweeping up dust drifting inward. When a growing planetesimal gets massive enough, it blocks the drifting dust, not only starving itself but also blocking the dust from getting to any planetesimal closer to the Sun. These planetesimals can keep growing by self-collisions but not by any new dust originating in the outer solar system.</p><p>Jupiter’s growing core—a super-big planetesimal about ten times the mass of Earth—may have done exactly that. It grew big enough, fast enough, to stop the flow of dust. Scientists don’t know exactly why Jupiter’s core formed so much faster than Earth’s, but the reason likely has something to do with the fact that Jupiter started forming further from the Sun, where (sticky) ices could exist and contribute to its growth.&nbsp;</p><p>Meteorites corroborate this idea. The thousands of meteorites in NASA <a href="https://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/astromaterials3d/" target="_blank">collections</a> can be divided into two main classes, based on their isotopes—the relative amounts of the same elements with different numbers of neutrons. These meteorites are made out of dust that’s just the right size to drift really fast within the disk. Yet the two types of meteorites didn’t mix. Why not? Jupiter’s dust-blocking core.</p><p>Our system was neatly just sliced right in two<span><br></span>As Jupiter’s core stopped the dust flowing through.<span><br></span>If not for this, Earth would have just kept on growing <span><br></span>And wound up so close to the Sun we’d be glowing!</p><p>Jupiter and Saturn also stunted Mars’ growth. The Red Planet gets a lot of press, but it’s a runt. Mars is nine times less massive than its closest neighbor, Earth. Decades of computer simulations (starting in the late 1970s) have shown that, without an outside perturbation, Mars would have grown to be about as big as Earth—even with Jupiter blocking the flow of dust into the inner solar system.</p><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18039_62b4521aec8fe13ad75560a2b41b2f95.jpg" width="733" alt=""></figure><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18040_152c97a9bb6f2ababc2c73a46cfef7a3.jpg" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><i>The actual inner solar system (top), and what the inner solar system would look like today if not for a strong outside perturbation during the planets’ growth (bottom; according to computer simulations).</i></span><span>planetplanet.net</span></figcaption></figure><p>So why isn’t Mars bigger? There are a few different ideas out there. One scenario—called the <a href="https://planetplanet.net/2013/08/02/the-grand-tack/" target="_blank">Grand Tack</a>—has Jupiter’s orbit shifting, or “migrating,” as it grew. On its own, Jupiter would have migrated inward and probably ended up somewhere close to Earth’s orbit, which is where most of the Jupiter-mass planets around other stars are found.</p><p>This is where Saturn comes in. Jupiter and Saturn together migrate outward instead of inward. This is a neat hydrodynamical effect that takes place when two gas giants are close to each other in the same disk, and the inner one is more massive than the outer one. The flow of gas changes and creates a pileup interior to the inner planet’s orbit, which acts to push both planets outward. Like two good friends, they have the wherewithal to go against the flow and migrate outward together, whereas each would migrate inward on its own.</p><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18041_a4396f61160d9bfa1ea9114dacd37247.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><i>A hydrodynamical simulation of Jupiter and Saturn (circled) migrating in the sun’s disk.</i></span><span>Arnaud Pierens</span></figcaption></figure><p>Jupiter and Saturn’s migration emptied out Mars’ feeding zone, stunting its growth.

Olmsted (StSci)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The gas giants eventually became unstable, pelting all of the other, more inner planets with stray rocks and ice. There are several pieces of circumstantial evidence leading scientists to suspect that our solar system suffered a dynamical instability, an event during which the giant planets’ orbits changed in sudden, dramatic fashion. For instance, the giant planets’ orbits are not circles, but modestly stretched out ellipses. The Kuiper belt is almost empty, yet Pluto and Eris, another dwarf planet (discovered in 2005), needed a lot more mass to grow as big as they are. The giant planets are surrounded by clouds of “irregular satellites” that seem to have been captured from somewhere else. The orbits of Jupiter’s Trojan asteroids are strangely tilted. The list goes on.</p><div id="inpagesub">

</div><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_model" target="_blank">Nice model</a>, a scenario of how our solar system dynamically evolved, developed in the French city of the same name, proposes that the giant planets’ orbits went unstable hundreds of millions of years after the planets formed (more on that later). The instability may looked something like this:&nbsp;</p><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18043_877d85181eb41f6b8db45bd2d29a97b4.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><i>Snapshots of the giant planet’s instability (from a computer simulation). The colored lines represent the orbits of the giant planets, and the white dots are leftover planetesimals.</i></span><span>Gomes et al. 2005 / Wikicommons</span></figcaption></figure><p>During the instability, the ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, were kicked all over the place. The outer disk of planetesimals—basically, a huge pile of leftover comets—was almost completely cleared out. Those leftovers rained down on the planets and a few were captured (like the irregular satellites).</p><p>And later on there was a big instability<span><br></span>This time the giants expressed their hostility<span><br></span>The ice giants’ orbits were strongly affected<span><br></span>An extra one may have been fully ejected!<span><br></span>(The Earth was bombarded; no planet protected.)</p><p>There is a new twist in this story related to the timing of these events. As you know, the Moon is covered in craters. Since the 1970s, the ages of craters were thought to show a big spike in the rate of impacts hundreds of millions of years after the planets formed (remember, that was still billions of years ago). This was called the “late heavy bombardment.”&nbsp;</p><p>New analysis shows that this spike is probably just the tail end of an early bombardment, the one that grew the planets in the first place. Not a “late” heavy bombardment. This doesn’t call the past instability into question, because it can explain so many features of the solar system at the same time. But it must have happened much earlier, maybe during the growth of the rocky planets. There’s a cherry on top: New simulations show that an early giant-planet instability can even <a href="https://planetplanet.net/2018/05/29/mars-growth-stunted/" target="_blank">explain</a> why Mars is smaller than Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>In modeling events billions of years ago, we are really only constrained by two things: the laws of physics (and available evidence) and our imaginations.</p><p>We don’t have a time machine, can’t see the past<span><br></span>But models can answer some questions we’ve asked<span><br></span>To test our ideas, we use simulations<span><br></span>On giant computers, with huge calculations.</p><p>Some people like to call Jupiter and Saturn the “architects” of the solar system, as though they had a clear plan for how our system should turn out.

But on closer inspection, this doesn’t hold up. Jupiter only protects Earth from comets that Jupiter put on Earth-crossing orbits in the first place. It’s like a bully—albeit, quite a beautiful one—asking for a handout to protect you from his fist.</p><p><i>Sean Raymond is an American astrophysicist working at the Bordeaux Astrophysical Laboratory in France.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <div> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p><em>By <a href="https://twitter.com/javisantana">Javi Santana</a></em></p> <p>One month before Black Friday, one of our clients in the retail space asked us to host for them the real time analytics API that feeds the dashboards that everyone in the company uses to see what’s going on (and of course, make decisions based on it).</p> <p>We knew it was tight but we specialize in running real-time stuff at scale: for example, while at Carto we served the Wall Street Journal frontpage map on 2012 during the election night, we hosted a website with a link from google.com’s home page (and a bunch of other countries) for 24 hours and some other high load events.</p> <p>In an ideal world you would setup a Kafka cluster, a streaming system to materialize some metrics on some fast key value store like redis and serve them using a lightweight backend through an API. With that you would get likely thousands of requests per second without much hardware.</p> <p>And while we can easily ingest Kafka streams, not every company works with streams, not all analytics can be precalculated easily and not all dashboards are simple counters.</p> <p>In this case we had to deal with data from a transactional database. And the analytics needed to be flexible due to filtering requirements as well as different configurations that needed to be changed on the fly and reflected instantly on the dashboard.</p> <h2 id="the-data-input">The data input</h2> <p>In order to “stream” data from the transactional database to our system, the client set up 5 parallel threads sending once per second all the rows that changed during the last second. Sounds easy but it gets complicated - wait for it.</p> <p>That means that even when just a column changes in an already existing row, the row needs to be sent again. And in a system like this, rows change quite a lot. Of course there are better ways to do this but for the use case it was good enough and allowed them to have high quality data (one of the requirements of the project)</p> <h2 id="the-infrastructure">The infrastructure</h2> <p>We used our product for the setup. It looks like:</p> <ul> <li>An Nginx load balancer</li> <li>A Varnish behind Nginx</li> <li>Our Tinybird backend. It runs the API endpoints, the load balancing for Clickhouse replicas and also the ingestion part. It’s a Python application with small bits of C++ for critical request paths.</li> <li>A Clickhouse cluster</li> <li>A Zookeeper cluster for data replication within Clickhouse</li> </ul> <p>It’s pretty simple (because we like to keep things as simple as possible) and using components we know pretty well. To be clear, in this case the amount of QPS was not going to be crazy high (less than 200QPS) so Nginx and Varnish acted just as routing tools with not so much load (more on this later) but any other load balancer would work pretty well too.</p> <h2 id="the-initial-numbers">The initial numbers</h2> <p>The plan was to have between 50-100QPS (with 120 QPS peaks) with a response time under 150ms over datasets with some millions of rows (trying not to be too specific here on purpose). The queries were not simple: they needed several joins with tables which were changing quite often so we couldn’t precalculate too many things.</p> <p>Around 5 ingestions happened per second with millions of rows ingested per minute.</p> <p>Every hour, many millions of rows would be imported to resync last hours’ with changes that might had been missed in the original database.</p> <h2 id="the-approach">The approach</h2> <p>The best way to run any analytics service is to serve static data. That’s the perfect world because it is inexpensive and fast as hell.</p> <p>With dynamic data, what you want to do is to convert the data as it’s ingested into static data so that you only process the data once. That’s possible when the amount of combinations you have to generate is low. A static blog generator with a few posts a day is one example of this.</p> <blockquote> <p>But when the amount of combinations is high you have to process the data as it comes in as much as you can so it’s fast to query, but taking into account the processing time should be low because you don’t want to add lag (if not, it would not be real-time)</p> </blockquote> <p>Our product uses Clickhouse and that’s what we used for the data storage and queries. It’s almost perfect for this use case: it allows to run queries over large amounts of data pretty fast, the latency is low and scales horizontally and vertically.</p> <p>So the plan was easy: using materialized views from Clickhouse, generating views to cover the most frequent use cases. Take into account that Clickhouse matviews are incremental - you don’t need to recalculate the whole view when new data is added. If you use Clickhouse and you are not using them you should take a look, you may save several orders or magnitude in query time.</p> <h2 id="ingestion">Ingestion</h2> <p>But there is one big problem: as I said we need to run upserts because the data comes from a transactional database. And Clickhouse (like other databases in the same space) doesn’t deal with upserts in real time.</p> <p>So what we did was to <em>split the main table</em>, the one with all the sales, in two: one (we call it RT) for the latest 30 minutes and another one for the rest (HISTORIC). Each table has the same materialized views but obviously they are different.</p> <p>The RT one is really easy to work with because the amount of rows in there is not going to be crazy, so we can recalculate it completely to run the upserts in real time. It takes less than 1 second with several million rows to run all the upserts and recalculate all the mat views for that “small” table.</p> <p>The HISTORIC one works as an incremental table and data older than 30 minutes is appended to the table. We don’t expect too many changes in rows after 30 minutes, that’s why we move data to this table.</p> <p>For rows that change after 30 minutes we run an hourly process to update parts of the HISTORIC table and recalculate all the materialized views for that table, only for data that has changed.</p> <p>The important part: we run this in several machines but taking into account we can never return inconsistent results, every operation needs to be aware of replication lag (pretty low I have to say) and run all the changes in an atomic way. This sounds easy but it isn’t; however, it is something that comes out of the box with Tinybird so we didn’t have to pay too much attention to it.</p> <p>For the table schema we tried to use the smallest possible data types to save as much space as possible since everything should be in memory to be fast. Also we used LZ4 compression (default for Clickhouse) since it provides a good ratio between compression and decoding speed, so it saves quite a lot of memory bandwidth.</p> <p>In order to optimize the ingestion process we also used one of the recently added features in Clickhouse, the in memory data parts, that lets you insert rows into a MergeTree table without actually syncing them to disk, which improves performance. All the tables were replicated (multi-master) so in case of a problem with the machine running the ingestion processes, we could switch to a different one without downtime. Data loss was really unlikely since the ingestion process would send the rows again in case of a failed insert.</p> <h2 id="querying">Querying</h2> <p>Once you have the materialized views, the queries are easy: just regular SQL following the real time rules:</p> <ul> <li>The best data is the one you don’t have to read. Using Clickhouse indexing to skip non needed data is key</li> <li>Lightweight operations first: filtering always goes first.</li> <li>Replacing joins with “WHERE column IN (SELECT …)” when possible, generally much faster. Using <a href="https://gist.github.com/javisantana/07c689564874cea6e4a31bd40fc770b1">transform function</a> when possible.</li> <li>Monitoring and optimizing query times, but also minimising the amount of bytes scanned. We always aim to scan as few bytes as possible in the first steps of the query and then try optimize to reduce the times. We split queries in several chunks so we know how many resources each part of the query takes, see <a href="https://ui.tinybird.co/snapshot/7437e5efa1f944a0b7cc017751696ea3">an example</a>.</li> </ul> <p>Also to be able to run queries over two tables without overlapping data, we used a simple but powerful technique: using a table to store the split date.</p> <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
</pre></td><td><pre><span>WITH</span> <span>(</span>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div> <p>We have to run the Common Table Expression twice because its scope only covers one select, something that is being improved in Clickhouse as I write this.</p> <p>The objective was to run all the queries under 150ms with just one core. This is important because there was a lot of concurrency and also we have to leave some spare cores to work on the ingestion process. In our standard setup the load balancer routes more read requests to the machines not ingesting data at that moment so query time percentiles stay low.</p> <p>For the read load balancer we used a round-robin policy (all the requests take more or less the same time) but ideally the load balancer should try to route requests that use the same part of the data to the same machines to use caching as much as possible. In this case it wasn’t critical because the tables we were querying were not huge and we were running in large machines (32 cores, 64gb ram), so read tables fit in memory.</p> <p>We also used Varnish to avoid duplicate requests. When running dashboards, it’s pretty common for many browsers to request the same url at the same time, so using <a href="https://varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/users-guide/vcl-grace.html#grace-mode">Varnish grace mode</a> we avoided extra work in the database.</p> <p>Varnish was also ready for plan B: in case of an unexpected load peak well outside of our predictions, we could enable caching with a small TTL to save some requests to the database.</p> <blockquote> <p>One final comment: we optimized queries and materialized views taking into account the distribution of calls to different endpoints. It’s much better to speed up an endpoint which is run 80% of the times than another one which is 2x slower.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this sounds like obvious but developers sometimes forget about two things: basic maths and the big picture. If you are interested we published a blog post on <a href="https://blog.tinybird.co/2020/12/15/eating-our-own-dog-food-how-we-investigate-performance-bottlenecks-using-our-product-and-google-sheets/">how we optimize our endpoints based on basic statistics</a></p> <h2 id="final-numbers-and-results">Final numbers and results</h2> <p>Numbers after Black Friday days (4 in our case):</p> <ul> <li>We ingested +650B rows.</li> <li>All the queries read a total of …</li></ul></div></article></div></div></div>

			<p>There is a growing body of evidence showing that many of our current chronic diseases (diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity) all revolve around the balance of utilizing fatty acids for energy, normalizing blood glucose levels, and maintaining a healthy muscle mass and weight. The SCD1 gene impacts all of these topics.</p>
<p>This article explains the function of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) and then dives into the genetic variants that impact your base levels. We will end with the research on how diet impacts SCD1 and how you may be able to manipulate it for weight loss.</p>

<h2><span id="StearoylCoA_Desaturase_1_%E2%80%93_converting_fatty_acids_in_your_cells"></span>Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 – converting fatty acids in your cells<span></span></h2>
<p>Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1 gene) is the rate-limiting enzyme needed for the body’s creation of monounsaturated fatty acids from saturated fatty acids.</p>
<p>First, some background information for context (skip ahead if you know this), and then I’ll get into the SCD1 gene and how it affects overall health, weight, and metabolic health.</p>
<h3><span id="Background_how_your_body_uses_food_as_fuel"></span>Background: how your body uses food as fuel<span></span></h3>
<p>Your cells create energy from <strong>two fuel sources: carbohydrates</strong>, which break down into glucose, <strong>and fat</strong>, which can be utilized in fatty acid oxidation for energy. When glucose is available, it is used preferentially for creating energy, and when glucose levels fall, fatty acids get used for energy.</p>
<p>We survive as a species because we are flexible in our ability to survive eating different diets — from hunter-gatherers eating mammoths and tubers to agrarian cultures eating mainly grains to my Irish ancestors who likely made it through famine times eating potatoes.</p>

<p>The body can convert glucose into fat for storage(called <em>de novo lipogenesis</em>), and it can convert fat back into glucose if needed (<em>gluconeogenesis</em>). While most cells can run on fatty acids for fuel, the brain needs glucose and thus the conversion of fat to glucose if needed.</p>
<p>When you eat foods containing fat, the fat gets broken down in a couple of ways with different lipase enzymes. These lipase enzymes (gastric, pancreatic) break up the fat into fatty acids and glycerol, and then bile acids act as emulsifiers, allowing the fatty acid to cross the mucous layer for absorption. (more thorough <a href="https://med.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Nutrition/Book%3A_An_Introduction_to_Nutrition_(Zimmerman)/05%3A_Lipids/5.04%3A_Digestion_and_Absorption_of_Lipids#:~:text=In%20the%20stomach%20fat%20is,fats%20through%20the%20lymph%20system." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explanation here</a>)</p>
<h4><span id="Background_Fatty_acids_in_the_body"></span>Background: Fatty acids in the body<span></span></h4>
<p>While we often just think of ‘fat’ as the extra padding around our waist and hips, fatty acids have <strong>three different roles</strong> in the body:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fatty acids, mainly unsaturated fatty acids, make up the<strong> cell membranes</strong> of all the cells in the body.</li>
<li>Fatty acids can break down for the mitochondria use them to create <strong>energy</strong> in the form of ATP. Fatty acids are also the main way of storing fuel for later use.</li>
<li>Fatty acids can act as <strong>signaling molecules</strong>, causing many different downstream effects.</li>
</ol>
<p>So keep in mind that as we dig into this topic of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, the body is regulating and using these fats in multiple ways.</p>
<h4><span id="Background_Types_of_fatty_acids"></span>Background: Types of fatty acids<span></span></h4>
<p>Fatty acids consist of carbon and hydrogen and referred to as saturated or unsaturated. Saturated fats have all of their carbons bound to hydrogens, and unsaturated fats have at least one carbon bound to another carbon instead of a hydrogen. This change in the structure of the fatty acid differentiates saturated from unsaturated fats.</p>
<p>Saturated fats are generally solids at room temperature, and unsaturated fats are liquids.</p>
<p>Fatty acids are named based on the number of carbons in the chain and how many unsaturated double bonds between carbons exist. Saturated fats have no unsaturated double bonds. Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) have one unsaturated double bond, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have two unsaturated double bonds.</p>

<h3><span id="SCD1_converting_saturated_fat_to_monounsaturated_fat"></span>SCD1: converting saturated fat to monounsaturated fat<span></span></h3>
<p>Getting back on topic here, the stearoyl-CoA desaturase enzyme is found in all cell types and in all animals and plants. The SCD1 gene codes for the stearoyl-CoA desaturase enzyme which converts saturated fatty acids into monounsaturated fatty acids.</p>
<p>The cell membrane surrounding all of your cells consists of fatty acids. Some of those fatty acids can be saturated, but most of them need to be unsaturated, in order to give more fluidity to the cell membrane. Saturated fats, which are solids at room temperature, are less fluid in cell walls.</p>
<p>The stearoyl-CoA desaturase enzyme changes the bond in the saturated fat to make it unsaturated and more flexible.</p>
<p>Specifically, the SCD enzyme converts stearic acid (saturated fat with 18 carbons) into oleic acid (unsaturated fat, 18 carbons, and one unsaturated double bond).&nbsp; It can also convert palmitic acid into palmitoleic acid.</p>

<p>Saturated and unsaturated fats are also found in foods that you eat. Stearic acid is found in beef fat (tallow), chocolate (cacao butter), and dairy fat. Palmitic acid is found in palm oil.</p>
<p>I’ll come back to the dietary aspects of SCD1 in the Lifehacks section…</p>
<p><strong>Does SCD1 alter your ability to burn off stored fat?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>To lose weight, you have to use your stored fat for energy at a rate that is higher than your rate of replacing that fat.</p>
<p>Researchers discovered that <strong>SCD1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) is increased in people with obesity and metabolic syndrome.</strong> Additionally, people who are obese have higher ratios of monounsaturated fat to saturated fat (MUFA:SFA ratio).[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5701860/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>][<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30754064/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>The question, though, is whether the increased SCD1 caused obesity or whether it was elevated in response to having metabolic syndrome.</p>
<p>Animal research may give us the answer. Research consistently shows that lower SCD1 levels keep the animal lean, even on a diet that normally would make them fat. The researchers decrease the SCD1 levels through manipulating the gene in various tissues of the animal, seeing the results of knocking out the gene in different organs.</p>
<p><em>Why does a lower SCD1 level keep mice lean?</em> The lack of SCD1 enzyme causes an increase in the rate of using up fat for fuel in the mitochondria. This increased fatty acid β-oxidation is through activation of the AMPK pathway.[<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31241768/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>decreased SCD1 = increased burning of fat</p>
<p>Additionally, mice with <strong>SCD1 deficiency had better insulin sensitivity and reduced liver fat</strong>. They were ‘hypermetabolic’, burning off fat at a faster rate, irrespective of a fattening diet. The researchers were able to pinpoint that the <strong>deletion of SCD1 in skin and muscle tissue</strong> is what keeps the mice lean through increasing overall metabolism.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5701860/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>][<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31241768/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>While <strong>decreased SCD1</strong> gives the benefit of decreasing weight gain, it also <strong>increases oxidative stress in the mitochondria and stress in the endoplasmic reticulum</strong>. Specifically, it seems that the decrease in oleic acid drives the ER stress, while low palmitoleic acid does not seem to matter.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5701860/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>

<p><em>Let’s dig into some more details here…</em></p>
<h4><span id="Liberating_fat_from_your_adipose_tissue"></span>Liberating fat from your adipose tissue:<span></span></h4>
<p>Lipolysis is the release of fatty acids from adipose tissue for use in the body as energy or in other ways.</p>
<p>Most cells in the body get replaced at the end of their lifecycle. This happens quickly for some cell types, like intestinal cells that turn over in a matter of days, and more slowly for other types, like heart cells which turnover very slowly, if at all.</p>
<p>Adipose cells are around for about 9 years, on average. Interestingly, the fat stored in adipose tissue has an average age of 1.4 years. This means that once the fat is stored, it doesn’t get used up and replaced very fast. As people who are obese get older, the usage of fat from fat cells for fuel tends to slow down and accumulation speeds up a bit.[<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21947005/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>The SCD1 enzyme is key in the fatty acid composition in your adipose tissue. Animal studies show that knocking out the SCD1 gene alters the fatty acid make up of adipocytes.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5625094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<h4><span id="Brown_fat,_beige_fat,_and_white_fat"></span>Brown fat, beige fat, and white fat:<span></span></h4>
<p>Brown fat, found in small amounts in adults, is an active type of fat cell that burns through a lot of fuel and produces a lot of heat. Lean people usually have more brown adipose tissue, and people who are obese usually have little to no brown fat. Brown fat is brown due to the high number of mitochondria in each cell, and it helps to both produce heat and burn off excess energy.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7034754/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>White fat (white adipose tissue) is what you typically think of for fat cells. It is a storage cell, keeping fat on board for a time of famine. Not as many mitochondria, not producing the heat or energy that the brown fat does.</p>
<p>Recently, researchers discovered that white adipose tissue can be induced to become more like brown adipose tissue. This in-between fat cell type is termed beige or brite adipose tissue. Exposure to cold is one way that white adipose tissue can be induced to become the heat-producing, metabolically active beige fat.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7034754/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>A 2020 research paper published in <em>PNAS</em> shows that when adipose cells are formed from stem cells, they can take two paths: white or beige. SCD1 is key to which path the stems cells take. The animal study showed that decreased SCD1 caused the stem cells to differentiate into beige adipose tissue, rather than white. The decreased SCD1 only affected the formation of new adipose cells – it didn’t convert existing white adipose tissue to beige.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7007576/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>Succinate is an intermediary formed when the mitochondria produce ATP in the electron transport chain. The researchers also found that the rising succinate levels due to the lack of SCD1 were the trigger for beige adipose differentiation. In cell culture, succinate alone is capable of causing adipose stem cells to differentiate as beige cells instead of white. The increase in succinate accompanies an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell.</p>

December 21, 2020 | https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/exploring-wikipedia-python/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/exploring-wikipedia-python/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>In this short tutorial, you will learn to search, browse, and retrieve wiki data from Wikipedia.</p>

<p>For this, we will be using a python library called <span>Wikipedia-API</span> which is quite impressive. Wikipedia-API is an easy to use Python wrapper for <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia’s</a> API. It supports extracting texts, sections, links, categories, translations, etc from Wikipedia.</p>

<p>It even allows you to retrieve the wiki information as HTML so that you could use it in web apps or websites.</p>



<p>We will begin by installing the library:</p>

<pre><code>pip install wikipedia-api</code></pre>



<h2>Searching Wikipedia</h2>

<p>Let's search for the term "Computer Programming"</p>

<pre><code>import wikipediaapi

wiki = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia('en')

page = wiki.page("Computer Programming")</code></pre>

<p>The <span>first line of code imports the<tt> wikipediaapi</tt></span> and the<span> second line creates a Wikipedia object</span>. The last line searches for the page on<em> "Computer Programming"</em> and returns a <span>WikipediaPage object </span>which is then stored in the <code>page</code> variable.</p>

<p>To check if the page exists:</p>

<pre><code>print(page.exists())          # True</code></pre>

<p><br>
To retrieve a page summary:</p>

<pre><code>print(page.summary)</code></pre>

<p><br>
For the full URL of the page:</p>

<pre><code>print(page.fullurl)           # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming</code></pre>



<h2>Extracting all information from the Wikipedia page.</h2>

<p>Ok, now let's do more like extracting the whole page in a text format. Putting it all together,</p>

<pre><code>import wikipediaapi

wiki = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia('en')

page = wiki.page("Computer Programming")

print("---------- title ----------")
print(page.title)

print("----------- Page URL ---------")
print(page.fullurl)

print("---------- summary ----------")
print(page.summary[:100])             # slicing summary
print()

print("---------- Main text information -----------")
print(page.text)</code></pre>

<p><br>
<strong><span>output:</span></strong></p>

<pre><code>---------- title ----------
Computer Programming
----------- Page URL ---------
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming
---------- summary ----------
Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to acco

---------- Main text information -----------
Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable 
computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms
 accuracy and resource consumption...(it's more)</code></pre>



<p>Note that the <strong>main text information </strong>is a lot of information and I've truncated it here for simplicity.</p>



<h2>Extracting page in HTML</h2>

<p>To extract a wiki page in HTML, we must tweak our wiki object a little bit:</p>

<pre><code>import wikipediaapi

wiki_html = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia(language="en",
                                   extract_format=wikipediaapi.ExtractFormat.HTML)

page_html = wiki_html.page("Computer Programming")

print("---------- HTML ----------")
print(page_html.text)</code></pre>

<p><br>
<span><strong>output (truncated):</strong></span></p>

<pre><code>---------- HTML ----------
&lt;p class="mw-empty-elt"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Computer programming&lt;/b&gt; is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. 
Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen 
programming language (commonly referred to as &lt;b&gt;coding&lt;/b&gt;). The source code of a program is
 written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. 
The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) 
on a computer, often for solving a given problem. 
Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the...(truncated)</code></pre>



<h2>How to get all Wikipedia pages under a category</h2>

<p>Wikipedia puts its pages under categories like Physics, Science, Programming, Medicine, Company, Celebrity, Countries, Books, etc.</p>

<p>To retrieve all pages in a particular category:</p>

<pre><code>import wikipediaapi

wiki_html = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia('en')

page = wiki_html.page("Category:Physics")

for c in page.categorymembers.values():
    print(c)</code></pre>

<p><strong>output</strong></p>

<pre><code>Physics (id: ??, ns: 0)
Outline of physics (id: ??, ns: 0)
Portal:Physics (id: ??, ns: 100)
Apriorics (id: ??, ns: 0)
Computational anatomy (id: ??, ns: 0)
Conformon (id: ??, ns: 0)
Diffeomorphometry (id: ??, ns: 0)
Dispersive medium (id: ??, ns: 0)
Galilean non-invariance of classical electromagnetism (id: ??, ns: 0)
Homeokinetics (id: ??, ns: 0)
...
...
...</code></pre>



<p>Well, that is it for this tutorial, this is useful when you want to use some data from Wikipedia inside your web applications or any programs you may write.</p>

It contains a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) which has instructions for making the spike protein. This is a protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which the virus needs to enter the body’s cells.</p><p>When a person is given the vaccine, some of their cells will read the mRNA instructions and temporarily produce the spike protein. The person’s immune system will then recognise this protein as foreign and produce antibodies and activate T cells (white blood cells) to attack it.</p><p>If, later on, the person comes into contact with SARS-CoV-2 virus, their immune system will recognise it and be ready to&nbsp;defend the body against it.</p><p>The mRNA from the vaccine does not stay in the body but is broken down shortly after vaccination.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/glossary/conditional-marketing-authorisation" id="glossary-term-43109" target="_blank" title="The approval of a medicine that addresses unmet medical needs of patients on the basis of less comprehensive data than normally required.

<p>This web page is also available in <a href="https://yash.osdn.jp/index.html.ja" lang="ja">日本語</a>.

</p>

<p id="summary">Yash, yet another shell,
is a POSIX-compliant command line shell written in C99 (ISO/IEC 9899:1999).
Yash is intended to be the most POSIX-compliant shell in the world
while supporting features for daily interactive and scripting use.
Notable features are:
</p><ul>
<li>Global aliases
</li><li>Arrays
</li><li>Socket redirection, pipeline redirection, and process redirection
</li><li>Brace expansion and extended globbing
</li><li>Fractional numbers in arithmetic expansion
</li><li>Prompt command and command-not-found handler
</li><li>Command line completion with predefined completion scripts for more than 100 commands
</li><li>Command line prediction based on command history
</li></ul>
<p>Yash can be modified/redistributed under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>
(Version 2) but the use of this program is
<strong>without any warranty</strong>.
</p><p><a href="https://osdn.net/"></a>:
Yash is an OSDN-hosted project. See also the
<a href="https://osdn.net/projects/yash/">project summary page</a>.

</p><h2 id="progress">Current Development Status</h2>
<p>Yash now fully supports POSIX.1-2008 (IEEE Std 1003.1, 2016 Edition)
except for the limitations listed in <a href="https://github.com/magicant/yash/blob/trunk/README">README</a>.
</p><p>Yash is stable. A maintenance update is released every three months or so.
For the change history, see <a href="https://github.com/magicant/yash/blob/trunk/NEWS">NEWS</a>.
</p><p>The source code is versioned in the <a href="https://osdn.net/projects/yash/scm/svn/">Subversion repository</a> and mirrored
on <a href="https://github.com/magicant/yash">GitHub</a>.

</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Yash is supposed to build and run on any POSIX.1-2001 environment
with the Software Development Utilities and the C-Language Development Utilities
options.
Currently, yash is mainly tested on Fedora, macOS, and Cygwin.

</p><h2 id="downloads">Installation</h2>
<p>The source tarball can be downloaded from the
<a href="https://osdn.net/projects/yash/releases/">release page</a>
(or the <a href="https://yash.osdn.jp/releases">release list</a>).
</p><p>On <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a>, the yash package can be installed by <kbd>sudo dnf install yash</kbd>. On <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, the yash package can be installed by <kbd>sudo apt-get install yash</kbd>. For macOS, <a href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> and <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> provide yash installation.
</p><p>After installation, enter <kbd>yash</kbd> in the terminal to start yash.
The <a href="https://yash.osdn.jp/doc/">manual</a> can be viewed by <kbd>man yash</kbd>.

</p><h2 id="configuration">Basic Configuration</h2>

<h3>Initialization scripts</h3>
<p>When yash is started as a login shell, it reads ~/.yash_profile.
This file is a shell script in which you define environment variables using the export command.
</p><p>When yash is started for an interactive use, it reads ~/.yashrc (after reading ~/.yash_profile if it is a login shell also).
In this file, you make other configurations such as aliases, prompt strings, key bindings for command line editing, and command-not-found handler.
Use the <a href="https://github.com/magicant/yash/blob/trunk/share/initialization/sample">sample yashrc</a> as a template for your ~/.yashrc.

</p><h3>Making yash your login shell</h3>
<p>In many Unix-like OSes, a shell must be listed in /etc/shells to be set as a login shell. Edit this file and ensure that the path to yash is written in the file.
</p><p>Then, run the <kbd>chsh</kbd> command in the terminal and follow instructions from the command.
Depending on your system, you may have to use another command to change the login shell.
See documentation on your system.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Commentary: Red Hat has been in hot water about changing the way CentOS operates, but that model looks like the exact right way for open source entrepreneurs to operate.</p><div data-component="lazyloadImages">
<figure><span></span><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Red Hat switched up CentOS to make it less of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) clone and more of a feeder project into RHEL (as Fedora was always supposed to be, yet wasn’t). Some people are mad, as <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/red-hat-resets-centos-linux-and-users-are-angry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols has written</a> on sister site ZDNet. Some people, like former Disney employee Justin Garrison, <a href="https://twitter.com/rothgar/status/1337818039799070722" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">think</a> it sounds perfect (the hipper, slightly edgier version of RHEL). If you’re a billion-dollar company upset that Red Hat appears to be trying to charge for something you value, the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/goodbye-centos-hello-rocky-linux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">founder of CentOS has a new way for you to get something for nothing</a>: Rocky Linux.</p>

<p>But if you’re an open source entrepreneur wondering what this means for you, well, Chef cofounder and System Initiative CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062314357514251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Adam Jacob has you covered</a>. In a series of tweets, he walks through how Red Hat’s CentOS strategy can play out for you. (He should know, as the company he co-founded, Chef, <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-chefs-100-open-source-move-is-smart-business/" data-absolute="true">last year open sourced everything</a>.)</p>
<p>Let’s observe.</p>
<h2>Open source all the things</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062314357514251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Jacob’s first rule</a>? Open it up. Completely. “If I do an open source strategy for a company ever again, I will own the upstream, it will be fully open source, and I’ll happily collaborate with anyone downstream.” But not just an open upstream–it’s also important to, “Produce a commercial distribution [and c]ollaborate on downstream non-commercial ones, in the open,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062321982758912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">argued</a>.</p>
<p>What does he mean by “upstream” and “downstream”? In open source, think of the <a href="https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/993/what-does-upstream-mean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">upstream</a> as the parent, the head, the initial open source project. Downstream might be forks or distributions (packaging up of a particular build of the upstream code) of the upstream.</p>
<p>What Red Hat announced was basically that CentOS would move from being downstream to upstream. It becomes a place, as <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062318451068929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Jacob noted</a>, that others <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">like Facebook</a> can collaborate with Red Hat in a way they simply couldn’t before (as Fedora wasn’t closely enough aligned with RHEL). CentOS as a downstream RHEL community was mostly one of users, of consumers, not of collaborators. It was somewhere to get RHEL, but rebranded CentOS, for free.</p>
<p>As such, Jacob pointed out, “They weren’t invested in it beyond using it.” And when someone removes the downstream they get mad “because it’s like someone threatened the water supply,” <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062319558434822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">he argued</a>. It’s therefore far better to condition people to participate as collaborators with an open source project, and through the commercial distribution to also condition users to become customers, if they want the certified distribution.</p>
<h2>Open source + cloud</h2>
<p>One way that open source companies are doing this model to fantastic effect is by open sourcing their upstream and creating a cloud distribution (read: managed service). A variety of companies have embraced this model to greater or lesser extents.</p>
<p>Yugabyte, for example, ditched its Open Core model a year ago and open sourced 100% of its database code. A year later, CTO Karthik Ranganathan told me in an interview, “It increased our adoption like crazy,” growing the number of Yugabyte clusters 10x, but it also has dramatically accelerated their business without them losing any known pipeline. Could someone take that upstream and create a competitive downstream competitor? Of course. But no one should be able to out-Yugabyte on their home turf.</p>
<p>Or take Redis Labs. The company has fiddled with licensing over the last few years, but has kept core Redis completely open while encouraging a growing community (which includes downstream competitors) to lend a hand to improving the code. While Redis Labs doesn’t publish results, its business is booming, even as 10 or so other companies have created competitive downstream managed service offerings.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to Jacob: “Run an open upstream from the jump. Produce a commercial distribution. Collaborate on downstream non-commercial ones, in the open.”</p>
<p>That’s the strategy. That’s the magic. You don’t need to go Open Core or any other permutation of kind-of, sort-of open source. You can open source everything and just ensure you have a rock-solid managed cloud service. This reliance on cloud is what’s driving MongoDB, Confluent, DataStax, Redis Labs, and others to great success. It can be your model, too.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Sunday, December 20, 2020</p>
<p>I just finished the implementation of an important feature of Pijul: clones, pushes and pulls on partial repositories. In this post, I explain why this matters.</p>
<h2 id="change-commutation">Change commutation</h2>
<p>Pijul is based on <em>changes</em>, also called <em>patches</em> or <em>diffs</em>.
This doesn’t mean that its only internal datastructure is patches, quite to the contrary: it was only by departing from a patch-only internal representation that we were able to solve the algorithmic challenges inherent to patch-based systems.</p>
<p>However, being change-based does mean that the core operations of Pijul are defined on changes, and that Pijul is designed in such a way that changes satisfy basic intuitive properties, similar to algebraic operations. One basic thing is that applying a change is an <em>associative</em> operation, like matrix multiplication: applying $A$ and $B$ at once, and then later $C$, is the same as applying $A$, and then $B$ and $C$ at once. In matrix multiplication, $(AB)C = A(BC)$. Moreover, in Pijul, all changes are invertible (whereas only some matrices are): for any change $A$, there is an “inverse change” $A^{-1}$ such that applying $A^{-1}$ after $A$ is the same as applying neither. Of course, both $A$ and $A^{-1}$ will appear in the log, but the contents of the repository will be the same as applying neither $A$ nor $A^{-1}$.</p>
<p>There is another property that users want from version control systems, and that is <strong>commutation</strong>.
Matrix multiplication rarely commutes<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
In Git, commutation is usually <em>simulated</em> using branches and rebase: indeed, rebasing a branch A on top of another branch B really means commuting the commits of A since the divergence between A and B, and the commits of B since the divergence. However, that commutation isn’t perfect, since the commits must change their hash when rebased.</p>
<p>Things are simpler in Pijul, because any two changes that <em>could have been written independently</em> always commute, meaning that if the two changes could be written without knowledge of each other, they can be applied in any order.</p>
<p>This of course raises a potential concern:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I can apply $A$ and $B$ in any order, how do I know which order is the <strong>right</strong> one?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Pijul, this question <strong>does not matter</strong>: both orders will yield <strong>the exact same result</strong>, the only difference is that the log will list the changes in the order in which they were applied. And I’m not saying that it doesn’t matter because I’m careless, but because it truly is the same thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I disagree: it does matter, I still prefer to have a “<em>linear</em>” order for my changes/commits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, everybody wants to see the order of operations in a repository, for many reasons. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to keep a record of the operations performed on our repository.</li>
<li>We want to go back in time.</li>
</ul>
<p>And in fact, Pijul allows you to do exactly that, but in a more rigorous way than Git. Indeed, take the scenario where Alice and Bob work together, Alice makes a change $A$ while Bob makes $B$. When they put their work together, Alice applies Bob’s change, resulting in the log $AB$, while Bob applies Alice’s change, resulting in the log $BA$. In this case, there is no “true” linear history, since they worked on different things, and took different steps at different times. However, both of them want to be able to go back in time, step-by-step, and not just “<em>step-by-step-according-to-Bob’s-order</em>”.</p>
<h2 id="commutation-and-massive-repositories">Commutation and massive repositories</h2>
<p>One of the biggest challenge for Pijul up to the recent releases was scalability: even modestly-sized repositories like Pijul’s source code would use a lot of disk space. This was even more disappointing since, as I’m about to explain, commutation was suposed to allow it to scale to gigantic repository sizes… in theory. The same problem also made massive tests impossible, meaning that getting past the “0.x releases” seemed more and more impossible as time passed.</p>
<p>Now that this phase is mostly behind us, the cool bits of the theory finally become practical.</p>
<p>In particular, in Pijul, each change contains a reference to the files it modifies. Note that, because we want operations on repositories (such as renaming files) to commute with edits inside files, we don’t identify files and directories by name, but by a unique identifier made from the hash of the change that introduced that file or directory.</p>
<p>For repositories with multiple projects, this makes it possible to clone and pull just parts of a repository, and work on that part as if we had the entire thing. Indeed, imagine we have a repository with the following log:</p>
<ol>
<li>A, adding file <em>x</em></li>
<li>B, editing <em>x</em></li>
<li>C, adding file <em>y</em></li>
<li>D, adding file <em>z</em></li>
<li>E, renaming <em>x</em> to <em>w</em></li>
<li>F, editing <em>y</em> and <em>z</em></li>
</ol>
<p>All these changes do not necessarily commute; however, since B and C touch completely different files (namely, <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>), they could be produced in parallel, and hence they commute. This means that we can pull only the changes related to a specific file, say <em>x</em>, and make the following history: A, B, E<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Moreover, any change made on top of that sequence will commute with C, D and F: indeed, if we edit file <em>x</em> again, producing a change G, then since G can be made in parallel to C, D and F, we can push G after any patch that comes after B in that history, for example getting history “ABCDEFG”.</p>
<p>Note that this is done without changing the changes nor their hash.</p>
<h2 id="another-trick-for-large-files">Another trick for large files</h2>
<p>As explained in previous posts on this blog, Pijul changes have a bit more information than diffs, and operate on graphs rather than files. This means that changes can be split into two parts, a short-ish one with a binary specification of the graph operations, and then the new content inserted by the change.</p>
<p>The change format is designed to be downloadable in two stages: one can download the operations without downloading the contents. One issue with this is security: if we don’t download the contents, how can we make sure that the hash is right? This is done by including a hash of the change in the “operations” section of the change, and letting the hash of a change be the hash of the “operations” section.</p>
<p>This makes it possible for someone to make five versions of a large binary file in a day, where each change deletes the entire file, and adds it again, the operation sections only contain the length of the different versions, not the actual bytes. In order to get the latest version of the file, a client will therefore only have to download the latest change completely, and only the operations section of the previous ones.</p>
<p>Note that this makes the following “attack” possible: a server might trick a client into believing that the server has a change with hash $A$, which inserts $n$ bytes into a file, and then another change with hash $B$, deleting all these bytes. When the client downloads $A$ and $B$, it doesn’t need to download the contents. However, if the client later decides to unrecord $B$, the contents of $A$ will have to be downloaded, and the client will be able to tell that the hash of $A$ was incorrect. This should make it impossible to unrecord $B$ without also unrecording $A$. However, if $A$ made other edits, and other changes depend on $A$, this could be problematic.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is next?</h2>
<p>There is one remaining painpoint for very large repositories, and this is the fact that in order to clone a repository with a very large history, one must download and apply all the changes, one by one. Even though our apply function is quite fast<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, this can still be problematic for dozens or hundreds of thousands of changes.</p>
<p>In my next post, I will talk about a solution to this problem, which I have started to implement.</p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Matrices that are simultaneously diagonalizable do, for example, but for two arbitrary matrices $A$ and $B$, $AB$ is often different from $BA$. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Note that in this case, we could also pull A, E, B, since renaming a file commutes with editing it. However, we must start with A, since adding a file could not be possibly done in parallel to editing or renaming it. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The complexity of apply is in $O(|p| |c| \log |H|)$, where $|p|$ is the size of the change, $|c|$ is the size of the largest conflict in which $p$ is involved, and $|H|$ is the number of edits made since the start of the repository. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

December 21, 2020 | https://www.transposit.com/blog/2019.12.23-tips-for-on-call-engineers-during-the-holidays/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.transposit.com/blog/2019.12.23-tips-for-on-call-engineers-during-the-holidays/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://transposit.imgix.net/img/2019.12.23a.jpg?auto=format&amp;ch=Width,DPR&amp;q=95&amp;w=800" alt="Picture of fire burning in a fireplace"></p><p>Are you sitting by the fire sipping cocoa, worrying secretly about whether you’ll have to put out an engineering fire any minute?</p><p>If only everyone could enjoy a well-earned break from on call life, the week would be more relaxing, but there is no rest for the technology that keeps our world running. This week certain industries are reaching a holiday high, and DevOps, SREs, and on call engineers everywhere will have to don their invisible superhero capes and keep us humans and our devices connected, just like they always do.</p><p>At Transposit, we know the pain of on call ourselves, and so we’ve banded together to come up with some of our top tips for making holiday on call shifts as painless as possible.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-one%3A">On Call Tip Number One: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-one%3A">#</a></h2><p>Whether on-callers are planning on having a Rockwellian Christmas, lighting the menorah with Bubbe, visiting family abroad, or taking a tropical trip with the two federal holidays padding their vacation request, there is one consistent truth about the holiday week between Christmas and New Years: Mass exodus from the office. So, before we even get into the challenges of answering a page when no one is around to help you, how can you avoid that conundrum in the first place?</p><p>On call engineering managers should be careful to adjust on call schedules so that the same people are not on call during multiple peak times. Which times are most painful are up to the individual, so giving each person the opportunity to sign up for what works for them first is always a best practice. Perhaps someone doesn’t mind being on call Christmas morning, but absolutely can’t do it on New Years Eve. Start by letting people pick what is ideal for them, and then fill in the remaining gaps, being sure not to unduly burden any one member of the team.</p><p>When making the on call schedule, make sure that there are primaries and secondaries who are committed to each shift, since they will likely be working together without quick access to the rest of the team when something goes wrong.</p><p>To reduce the pain further, consider upping on call bonuses for the entire week as an incentive for taking on undesirable shifts, and once everyone is back in the office in January, be sure to acknowledge the on-callers who responded quickly to keep the business running while everyone else was enjoying their time away from work.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-two%3A">On Call Tip Number Two: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-two%3A">#</a></h2><h3 id="communicate-early-and-often%2C-with-and-without-runbooks.">Communicate early and often, with and without runbooks. <a href="#communicate-early-and-often%2C-with-and-without-runbooks.">#</a></h3><p>Without easy access to the rest of the team, good playbook/runbook documentation during this period is even more important than it is the rest of the year. If your typical on call process involves opening up a collaborative team Slack thread or Jira ticket and then letting various experts or senior SREs weigh in, you might face a rude awakening when your reliable experts are MIA during the holiday week.</p><p>Make sure your runbooks are updated and everyone has easy access to the DevOps systems they need before everyone leaves on vacation, because if on-callers are left to search half-empty wikis by themselves, the speed to resolution is going to be stressful for everyone - engineers, managers, and executives alike.</p><p>Additionally, make sure that primary and secondary on-callers know exactly who they are paired with for a particular shift. Make sure that both are committed to being fully available and sober during their shifts, so that in the absence of the whole team, they are secure in having at least one problem-solving partner.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-three%3A">On Call Tip Number Three: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-three%3A">#</a></h2><h3 id="plan-around-potential-travel-problems">Plan around potential travel problems <a href="#plan-around-potential-travel-problems">#</a></h3><p>While it may seem obvious to plan your travel around your on call shifts so that you aren’t in the air while you’re supposed to be available, these days, we sometimes have too much faith in our connectivity during travel. Airports and even some planes have wifi, many airplane seats have built-in electricity and jacks, what could possibly go wrong?</p><p>Remember, this week is one of the busiest travel weeks of the year in the US, so our already strained infrastructure will be at the edge of capacity in the best of circumstances. You won’t be very effective at troubleshooting an outage if you are standing in a 2-hour long airport security line or sitting in a traffic jam on the way up to the mountains. Add unpredictable winter weather to the mix, and we have on call disasters in the making. So, what should on-callers do?</p><p>First, you should plan wider time-frames for travel around your on call shifts to avoid accidentally being unavailable. You also shouldn’t count on access to wifi on your flights (only some planes are equipped, and airlines often shift which plane is flying a certain route based on weather and mechanical issues). Don’t expect access to electricity in the airport to charge your computer or phone, as the high number of travelers may easily keep the charging stations fully occupied, and make sure you have your computer and charger easily accessible, so that if you are forced to gate-check a bag on your crowded flight, you will be sure to keep these precious items on your person.</p><p>Traveling on-callers should also remember that time zones are a thing - your on call planning will need to be adjusted accordingly. If you are the secondary, your primary may be in a different time zone (or vice versa), and you should discuss your plans with them beforehand so that you are prepared for them to be asleep at different hours.</p><p>Finally, if you are traveling anywhere that has inclement weather or otherwise unreliable access to internet, you should have a back-up plan, such as tethering your computer to your phone’s data service to get around unreliable wifi. If you arrive at your destination and realize that you have bad data service, finicky wifi, or (gasp) the possibility of power outages, you should admit your defeat early and find an understanding colleague to take your shift, rather than hoping for the best and leaving any alerts to your back-ups.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-four%3A">On Call Tip Number Four: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-four%3A">#</a></h2><p>We’ve already talked about the importance of secondaries as problem-solving partners, but what about the other, more social challenges of being on call during this time? Let’s say you’re sitting down to a nice family dinner, and, just like you were dreading, there goes your phone dinging with an urgent alert. How are you going to explain this situation to your relatives, who in many cases, don’t really understand what you do?</p><p>This is where a friendly ally can help serve as your secondary within your social situation. If you arm a sibling or supportive partner with talking points to explain why you have to get up from the festive table to crouch frantically over your laptop in the back room, you will be able to focus on troubleshooting without worrying about the familial fallout.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-five%3A">On Call Tip Number Five: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-five%3A">#</a></h2><h3 id="pat-yourself-and-your-team-on-the-back">Pat yourself and your team on the back <a href="#pat-yourself-and-your-team-on-the-back">#</a></h3><p>It should go without saying, and so often it does, that there is a reason the world functions so smoothly during this week, despite its unique circumstances. While a lot of the credit is due to excellent engineering and team planning throughout the rest of the year, there are always unanticipated incidents that simply can’t be avoided. That’s why on call shifts, DevOps, and SREs exist in the first place! And so, as we look back on the year, and the incidents resolved during this special last week of 2019, let’s remember to give a shout out to all the engineering heroes who stepped forward to make it happen. Cheers to you!</p></div></div>]]>

December 21, 2020 | https://smalldata.tech/blog/2019/08/16/getting-started-with-lisp-in-2019 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://smalldata.tech/blog/2019/08/16/getting-started-with-lisp-in-2019">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  It's 2019 and Lisp stories are on fire at HackerNews. While there exist multiple Lisp dialects, Common Lisp is the
  oldest and most mentioned. Thus, if you're looking to get started with programming in Common Lisp, then there are 2
  options:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="https://portacle.github.io/">portacle</a> to get up and running with SBCL + Emacs.</li>
  <li>
    Use
    <a href="https://github.com/roswell/roswell">roswell</a> to install multiple Lisp implementations + build and bundle
    lisp applications. Roswell installs SBCL by default.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  As for me, I did not feel like learning a brand new text editor just to get started with Lisp so I went with Roswell.
  Follow the instructions on installing Roswell for your platform. In my case, I decided to install it under
  <code>$HOME/bin</code> on my linux machine via:
</p>

<pre>$ sudo apt install rlwrap
$ mkdir $HOME/bin
$ git clone -b release https://github.com/roswell/roswell.git
$ cd roswell/
$ sh bootstrap
$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/bin
$ make
$ make install</pre>

<p>
  Make sure to add the roswell path to your <code>~/.bashrc</code> (note that roswell installed itself under
  <code>~/bin/bin</code> and if this looks odd to you, install it under <code>$HOME/apps</code> or something of the
  sort):
</p>

<pre>if [ -d "$HOME/bin/bin" ] ; then
  PATH="$HOME/bin/bin:$PATH"
fi</pre>

<p>
  Open a new terminal and setup roswell:
</p>

<pre>$ which ros
/home/xxx/bin/bin/ros
$ ros --version
roswell 19.06.10.100
$ ros setup </pre>

<p>
  We will now setup VSCode to run lisp. First install the
  <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mattn.Lisp">vscode-lisp</a> extension. Open a new file
  and type the following in:
</p>

<pre>(defun main ()
  (format t "Hello world"))
</pre>

<p>
  Then <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal">launch a terminal</a> inside VSCode. In
  the terminal run <code>rlwrap ros run</code> to start the REPL (Read/Eval/Print Loop). Select the above defined
  function and use the "Run Selected Text in Active Terminal" from the Command Palette (F1) to run your code!
  Note that you can exit the REPL via: <code>(SB-EXT:EXIT)</code>. The <code>rlwrap</code> utility remembers previously
  typed commands which makes for a much nicer REPL experience.
</p>

<p>
  What is amazing about Roswell is that is comes with a scripting / build ability that allows you to easily distribute
  your application. To see this in action first create a roswell script via <code>ros init hello-world</code>. Then add
  in the following code so that your script looks like the following:
</p>

<pre>#!/bin/sh
#|-*- mode:lisp -*-|#
#|
exec ros -Q -- $0 "$@"
|#
(progn ;;init forms
  (ros:ensure-asdf)
  ;;#+quicklisp(ql:quickload '() :silent t)
  )

(defpackage :ros.script.hello-world.3774807541
  (:use :cl))
(in-package :ros.script.hello-world.3774807541)

(defun helloWorld
  ()
  (format t "Hello world")
)

(defun main (&amp;rest argv)
  (declare (ignorable argv))
  (helloWorld))
;;; vim: set ft=lisp lisp:
</pre>

<p>
  We can now simply run this script via <code>ros hello-world.ros</code> but more interestingly, we can actually compile
  a binary via <code>ros build hello-world.ros &amp;&amp; ./hello-world</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Interestingly enough, I am not a complete noob to Common Lisp, I actually programmed it 15 years ago during my
  undergrad years. A colleague and I
  <a href="https://smalldata.tech/api/to/847c726edff337b818ba86914d9e71b6">compared an experimental genetic algorithm against an ant colony optimization algoritm on a path-finding problem</a>. Once I had lisp running I opened up the project and basically executed <code>ants.lisp</code> in the REPL, ran
  <code>(INITIALIZE-ANT-WORLD)</code> followed by <code>(DISPATCH-ANTS)</code> and voila, my ants were able to find
  their food!
</p>

<p>
  No guide to getting started with Lisp would be complete without a list of further reading that will keep you busy for
  the next 100 years so here we go:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A very basic Lisp <a href="https://lisp-lang.org/learn/first-steps">tutorial</a> which also features an excellent
    <a href="https://lisp-lang.org/books/">list</a> of Lisp books
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://smalldata.tech/api/to/3c02f249908494a961ac4b28e33f1ec5">A road to common lisp</a> - Steve Losh's excellent guide to
    getting into Lisp programming. The following is a small snippet of useful information from the post:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Files are files on your hard drive.
      </li>
      <li>Packages are containers of symbols. They are orthogonal to files.</li>
      <li>
        Systems are collections of code, instructions on how to load that code, dependency lists, and metadata. They are
        orthogonal to packages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Projects are high-level collections of "stuff" such as code, documentation, maybe some image assets,
        etc. They are (mostly) orthogonal to systems.
      </li>
      <li>Common Lisp itself knows about files and packages.</li>
      <li>ASDF adds systems.</li>
      <li>Quicklisp adds the internet.</li>
    </ul>

    This guide also provides a very nice review of libraries and is definitey worth a read.
  </li>
  <li>
    Another <a href="https://smalldata.tech/api/to/cb5d30e9026cba3d1d0b838611d1624c">article</a> that recommends roswell and provides
    instructions for Atom integration along with project and library management.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Well, that's about it - Lisp is beautiful and I'm off to wrap my head around some 15 year old code that doesn't look
  too bad, go functional programming!

You may also want to consider visiting our post on <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/training-yolov4-on-a-custom-dataset/">how to train YOLO v5 in PyTorch tutorial</a> as it gets much better results than YOLO v3.</p><p><a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection">Object detection models</a> are extremely powerful—from finding dogs in photos to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05747.pdf">improving healthcare</a>, training computers to recognize which pixels constitute items unlocks near limitless potential. However, one of the biggest blockers keeping new applications from being built is adapting state-of-the-art, open source, and free resources to solve custom problems.</p><p>In this post, we’ll walk through how to prepare a custom dataset for object detection using tools that simplify image management, architecture, and training. In each section, we’ll first follow what I’ve done for a specific example and and then detail what modifications you’ll need to make for your custom dataset. My recommendation is that you follow along step-by-step to duplicate my process before adapting these steps to your problem.</p><p>Let’s start with a clear description of our process.</p><p>Any given machine learning problem begins with a well-formed problem statement, data collection and preparation, model training and improvement, and inference. Often, our process is not strictly linear. For instance, we may find our model performs very poorly on one type of image label, and we need to revisit collecting more data on that example.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/data-process.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>The general machine learning workflow.</em></figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2><p>Chess is a fun game of wit and strategy. Improving your playing ability requires understanding where you’ve previously made notable mistakes and what move(s) a superior player to you may have made in the same situation. </p><p>Thus, having a system that recognizes the state of the game and records each move would be valuable. This requires not just determining what a given chess piece is, but where that piece is on the board—a leap from image recognition to object detection. For the purposes of this post, we will constrain the problem to focus on the object detection portion: <u>can we train a model to identify which chess piece is which and to which player (black or white) the pieces belong, and a model that finds at least half of the pieces in inference.</u></p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/computer-vision-problems-1.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>Image Processing Problems, adapted from Stanford’s CS231N course</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>For your non-chess problem statement</em>, consider constraining the problem space to a specific piece. Moreover, consider the minimal acceptable criteria for the model’s performance. (In this example, we are constraining to just the identification of correct bounding boxes, and setting a relatively low bar for acceptable criteria. To be more rigorous, we may want to identify our model’s <a href="https://giou.stanford.edu/">IOU</a> or <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-mean-average-precision-object-detection/">mAP</a> - but that is for <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-mean-average-precision-object-detection/">a different post</a>.)</p><hr><h2 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h2><p>To identify chess pieces, we need to collect and annotate chess images.</p><p>I made a few assumptions in my data collection. First, all my images were captured from the same angle. I set up a tripod on the table near my chess board. For inference, this would require that my camera is at the same angle as the training data was captured — and not all chess players may be setting up tripods before their games. Second, I created 12 different classes: one for each of the six pieces times the two colors.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/IMG_0167.JPG" alt=""><figcaption>An (unlabeled) image example from our dataset.</figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, I collected 292 images. I labeled all the pieces in each of these images, totaling 2894 <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/glossary/#:~:text=annotation">annotations</a>. This <a href="https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/chess-full">chess dataset</a> is publicly available on <a href="https://public.roboflow.ai/">Roboflow Public Datasets</a>. For labelling, there are many high quality, free, and <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/getting-started-with-labelimg-for-labeling-object-detection-data/">open source tools available like LabelImg</a>. I happened to use <a href="https://rectlabel.com/">RectLabel</a>, which is $3/month.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/rectLabel-example.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>An example image I labeled in RectLabel.</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>For your non-chess problem</em>, consider collecting images that are in-context of where your model will perform in production. This means ensuring you have a similar angles, lighting, quality, and objects in frame. The more situations your training set takes into account that your model may encounter in production, the better its performance will be. When labelling, it is best to draw bounding boxes that include the entirety of your objects, even if there’s a small amount of space between the object and the bounding box. Simply put, do not cut out any of the underlying object with your bounding boxes.

This specific model is a one-shot learner, meaning each image only passes through the network once to make a prediction, which allows the architecture to be very performant, viewing up to 60 frames per second in predicting against video feeds. Fundamentally, <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov3-keras">YOLO is a convolutional neural network (CNN)</a> that divides an image into subcomponents, and conducts convolutions on each of those subcomponents before pooling back to create a prediction.

		<article>
			<p>Consider the meetup speaker.  She’s had a topic in mind for while, and so when the request went out for speakers, she volunteered.  But that was three months ago, and now the meetup’s only a few weeks away, and she hasn’t even begun.  She starts to outline the talk, but can’t quite figure out where to start.  She can explain all the details easily, but the order in which they should be introduced, the organizing structure of the talk, remains elusive.  Giving a talk about a subject, it turns out, is not the same as having a conversation about it.</p>

<p>Consider the first-time meetup attendee.  He’s been interested in the technology for a few months, but there doesn’t seem to be any guides that help him progress from the ubiquitous “hello world” or “distributed word count” examples to actual, effective production usage.  Maybe, he thinks, there will be some people at the meetup who can guide him through this awkward adolescence.  So after a long day at work, he wanders over to the meetup space, where everyone’s hanging around the open pizza boxes.  A few are eyeing the kegerator in the corner, wondering if it’s off-limits.  He stands next to them and eats his pizza, listening to their conversation, wondering if he should introduce himself or just wait for the talk to begin.</p>

<p>Consider the long-time meetup attendee.  He’s been using the technology for a few years, and wants its adoption to grow, so every month he comes to the meetup, eats the pizza, makes small talk with the other regular attendees, and dutifully listens to the talk.  The talk, unfortunately, is usually either too remedial or focused on something not very relevant to his day-to-day usage.  Also, the talks tend to be scattered, introducing concepts out of order, with lots of mental throat-clearing as the speaker tries to remember what was going through their head when they made the slide.  Usually within ten minutes half the audience is looking at their laptops, with only the occasional glance up to confirm that the talk is, in fact, still going on.  He attends almost every month, and often leaves wondering why he bothers.</p>

<p>In this based-on-a-true-story scenario, everyone’s motivations are good: they want to educate and to learn, to nurture and grow the community, to meet people who share their enthusiasm.  And yet, a typical meetup is at best weakly successful in all of these dimensions.  This is for a variety of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Any growing community is at least half-filled with novices.</strong>  Very few assumptions can be made about what vocabulary and concepts are universally understood.  The speaker needs to make a conscious choice to either build up from first principles, greatly delaying the time it takes to get to the actual topic at hand, or leave a significant part of the audience behind.</li>
  <li><strong>Understanding something well enough to use it doesn’t mean you can explain it well.</strong>  We should all aspire to a clarity of understanding that lets us easily explain an idea to people from a variety of backgrounds, but that doesn’t come for free.  Details need to be synthesized into broader concepts, without losing sight of the practical knowledge necessary to apply those concepts.  Unsurprisingly, speakers are often still ascending that learning curve.</li>
  <li><strong>The standard lecture format expects and enforces passive participation.</strong> Ostensibly the attendees are making an active choice to learn and grow by attending a meetup, but upon arriving all that’s expected of them is to eat and listen.  Each attendee likely has interests and projects of their own, but unless the talk directly addresses them, any discussion must be crammed into the margins of the meetup - either before, when people are eating and the speaker is fussing with the projector, or after, when the hosts are tidying up and giving not-so-subtle looks to everyone who’s lingering.</li>
</ul>

<p>The lecture format still has value, of course, but much less so than its widespread usage would suggest.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State">Seeing Like a State</a>, James Scott contrasts two Ancient Greek words for knowledge, <em>techne</em> and <em>metis</em>.  <em>Techne</em> is universal and timeless: the Pythagorean theorem and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musica_universalis">harmony of the spheres</a>.  <em>Metis</em> is local and contextual: Odysseus infiltrating Troy and escaping the Cyclops.  Our educations are anchored in <em>techne</em> - data structures, algorithms, and exams with objectively correct answers - but upon entering the real world, we find the <em>techne</em> only takes us so far.  The problems we solve are not universal, they’re bounded by the context of our particular domains.  This is fortunate, because needing to solve the general form of every problem we come across would slow our work to a standstill.  However, this means our <em>metis</em> is unavoidably tangled up in the context in which we developed it.</p>

<p>Looking back, leaving the <em>techne</em> of school for the <em>metis</em> of our jobs can feel like a fall from grace.  What was once clear is now hopelessly muddled, littered with a thousand half-remembered details.  The promise of the lecture format is a return to that higher plane, an escape from the endless minutiae that awaits below.  And yet, most of what we’ve learned in our careers is within that minutiae.  There is enormous practical knowledge available at every meetup, and the lecture format uses almost none of it.</p>

<p>And so, at Factual we’ve been experimenting with <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Bay-Area-Clojure-User-Group/events/181057342/">a Clojure meetup</a> modeled on a different academic tradition: office hours.  At a university, students who have questions about the lecture content or coursework can visit the professor, and have a one-on-one conversation.  This can be enormously freeing for both parties: the student can ask questions without fear of looking stupid or holding up the rest of the class, and the professor can focus on giving an explanation that makes sense to this particular student, rather than the entire class.</p>

<p>At the beginning of every meetup, we give everyone a name tag, and provide a whiteboard with two columns, “teachers” and “students”.  Attendees are encouraged to put their name and interests in both columns.  From there, everyone can eat their food and read the whiteboard, and go in search of someone from the opposite column who shares their interests.  Typically they form groups of two or three, sometimes with a few more people listening in.</p>

<p>We’ve only had three meetups so far, each time with around twenty attendees, but the results have been promising.  It has been especially encouraging seeing novice Clojure users bring in their first project to get a critique of their approaches, and discuss how they can better use Clojure’s core abstractions.  These are precisely the sorts of conversations that create a healthy, growing community.</p>

<p>It’s unclear what the maximum practical size for this sort of meetup is.  Given the small size of each group it may scale fairly well, but at some point it becomes impossible for people to find each other.  Some sort of pre-event registration where people list their interests, and popular topics are assigned a physical location, may offset this.  However, for the vast majority of tech meetups, where the attendees number in the dozens rather than hundreds, this can be an enormously useful and engaging alternative to the lecture format.  We encourage everyone to give it a try.  And if you find yourself in San Francisco and have even a passing interest in Clojure, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Bay-Area-Clojure-User-Group/events/181057342/">give us a visit</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to do interesting work, a great starting point is to work on things you find interesting. Instead of trying to optimize for what you think others are likely to find interesting—chasing the market is a Sisyphean task—just keep digging deeper into what <i>you</i>&nbsp;find interesting.</p><p>That way, making your work interesting to others is simply a matter of sharing your enthusiasm. I took a geology class my freshman year of college. It’s easy to imagine how boring a class about rocks could be. But my professor <i>loved</i>&nbsp;rocks. She had contributed to the discovery of plate tectonics. She took us up into the mountains and showed us how you could decode geological layers laid bare by erosion to reveal the violence and wonder of how the Earth took shape. She could forge a path through the entire universe starting from a single grain of sand. Another professor could have taught the same curriculum to no effect. My professor’s love for the material brought it to life. She used her enthusiasm to ignite our curiosity.</p><p>But working on things you find interesting is not sufficient to make your work interesting to other people. We’ve all been bored to death by experts who speak in impenetrable acronyms or super-fans who get lost in their own rabbit holes. Their individual interest in the material may be genuine, but it isn’t contagious because they lack empathy. You (probably) wouldn’t tell a dirty joke to your grandmother in the same way you’d tell it to your best friend. Empathy is meeting people where they are so you can take them someplace new. That’s why rock stars shout out the name of the city they happen to be performing in. Despite her academic fame and scientific expertise, my geology professor didn’t get stuck in solipsistic obsession. Instead, she <i>used</i>&nbsp;her enthusiasm as a tool to inspire her students, to pry open new worlds for us. As a result, we found her work tremendously interesting.</p><p>So doing interesting work doesn’t require guessing what others might like or a benevolent hiring manager offering you your dream job. Doing interesting work requires working on things you find interesting, and then cultivating sufficient empathy to find effective ways to share your enthusiasm with the right people. Empathy is the catalyst that makes curiosity contagious. You’ll know you’re doing it right when the people you seek to reach find your work at least as interesting as you do.</p><p>*</p><p>Complement with <a href="https://www.eliotpeper.com/2020/12/quantity-is-route-to-quality-not-its.html">Quantity is a route to quality, not its opposite</a>, <a href="https://www.eliotpeper.com/2020/10/lasting-value.html">Lasting value</a>, and <a href="https://www.eliotpeper.com/2020/07/creativity-is-choice.html">Creativity is a choice.</a></p><p><b>Get new posts delivered straight to your inbox:</b></p><!--Begin MailChimp Signup Form-->

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Sunday morning while I was scrolling through my Twitter feed one tweet caught my eye,</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaScript?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#JavaScript</a> Challenge:</p><p>Can you make a TO-DO app within a single Tweet?

<p>The challenge was to make a todo app that fits in a single tweet, just like any other todo app, you should be able to add or remove tasks and clear the task list. I thought how hard this can get, I thought to myself this is doable just by using plain JavaScript.</p>
<p>So since I don’t have a laptop, what resulted was a whole day of torture having to code though my iPad on codepen.</p>
<h2><strong>Plain JavaScript</strong> </h2>
<p>Soon after I started using plain JavaScript it became obvious that I was not able to make it within one tweet, the DOM manipulation was taking too much characters<em>, document.createElements, document.getElements. </em></p>
<p>It was obvious that was not the right approach.</p>
<h2>Using vue</h2>
<p>Vue framework won’t require any build tools, so I don’t have to go through setting up Webpack,</p>
<p>Also I can easily create the DOM within the script tag using simple HTML. So that will save some characters for me in DOM manipulation.</p>
<p>The first version I made use the <em>method</em> option in Vue app to handle button clicks, the button click event will call the function in methods to add new tasks and clear the task list.</p>
<p>However, I was unable to reduce it to one tweet. Then I went back to in-line functions, the same methods were added to button click events inline and not within the <em>methods</em> section.</p>
<p>Also I had to change buttons to anchor tags, in order to save some characters, and I had to use emojis instead of button text to save some more characters.</p>
<p>I also had to drop few buttons like a button to add a task, and instead I had to go with pressing enter key to add a task instead.</p>
<p>So I made the final version, the JavaScript code looked like this, </p>
<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="js" data-user="rukshn" data-slug-hash="qBaXmpE" data-pen-title="qBaXmpE">
<span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn/pen/qBaXmpE">
qBaXmpE</a> by Rukshan Ranatunge (<a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn">@rukshn</a>)
on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

<p>Then I ran the code through an online JavaScript minifier and then the whole HTML though an HTML minifier, and ended up with this piece of code,</p>
<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=https://unpkg.com/<a href="https://ruky.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="3c4a49597c52594448">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;var x={data:()=&gt;({t:[],k:""}),template:'&lt;input @keyup.enter="t.push(k)" v-model="k"&gt;&lt;a @click="t=[]"&gt;❎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p v-for="(v,i) in t"&gt;&lt;a @click="t.splice(i,1)"&gt;🅾️&lt;/a&gt;{{v}}&lt;/p&gt;'};Vue.createApp(x).mount("body")&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>With my fingers crossed, I copied the code on to Twitter, and guess what it fits perfectly inside a single Tweet.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=<a href="https://t.co/FY9eWOxLgZ">https://t.co/FY9eWOxLgZ</a>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;var x={data:()=&gt;({t:[],k:""}),template:'&lt;input <a href="https://twitter.com/keyup?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@keyup</a>.enter="t.push(k)" v-model="k"&gt;&lt;a <a href="https://twitter.com/Click?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@click</a>="t=[]"&gt;❎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p v-for="(v,i) in t"&gt;&lt;a <a href="https://twitter.com/Click?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@click</a>="t.splice(i,1)"&gt;🅾️&lt;/a&gt;{{v}}&lt;/p&gt;'};Vue.createApp(x).mount("body")&lt;/script&gt;</p>— Rukshan (@JustRuky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustRuky/status/1340862545322762240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2020</a></blockquote>
<p>And here is the code in action, <a href="https://jsbin.com/venihiliha/1/edit?html,output">link</a> </p>
<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="rukshn" data-slug-hash="qBaXmpE" data-pen-title="qBaXmpE">

on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

<h2>What I failed to achieve </h2>
<p>The original Tweet says, that the completed tasks should have a strike through.</p>
<p>But because css was costing me too much characters I had to fall back to remove completed tasks instead, but I’m sure someone will figure a solution for that as well.</p>
<p>At the same time, I think you can save even more characters by using <a href="https://mithril.js.org/">mithril</a>, because you have short-codes for DOM elements as well, but I haven’t tried mithril in awhile.</p>
<h4>One last thing</h4>
<p>No I didn’t waste my whole Sunday on this problem, but I had to spend few hours, thinking and trying different versions. </p>
<p>I would have cut back some more time if I had a laptop. Somerimes I feel like buying an old laptop and refurbishing it and installing Ubuntu on it.</p>
<p>Sunday well spent? Absolutely yes.</p>
<h2>Best answer?</h2>
<p>One thing I love about HN is the fact that there are lot of bright minds out there. Since I posted this on HN I knew it was just a matter of time since someone figures this out.</p>
<p>I guess this is the best answer and also ticks all the boxes, well done.</p>
<pre><code> &lt;script&gt;document.write(`&lt;style&gt;:checked+*{text-decoration:line-through}#t{display:none}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;p id="t"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;&lt;input&gt;&lt;div id="f"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;button onclick="f.appendChild(t.cloneNode(true)).id=''"&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;&lt;button onclick="f.innerHTML=''"&gt;×&lt;/button&gt;`)&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>My daily driver is a desktop that I originally built as a Hackintosh for my wife's use. She outgrew it a year
or so ago for a new iMac, and I inherited it. Over the year, I've been using macOS less and less, and have spent
much more time on the dual-booted Windows 10 installation, especially since WSL is getting better and better
all the time. It's almost not painful to use for just about all the coding, writing, and occasional photography
or design projects I undertake.</p>
<p>Two days ago, I noticed while doing some file cleanup that there really was a terrific lot of crap that had
accumulated on the Windows drive. I'm fairly certain that this drive started out as a Windows 7 install, then
probably skipped Windows 8 and has been on Windows 10 through several Insider Ring upgrades over the years.
Anyway, I thought I'd just finish my backup and then re-install Windows to have a nice clean start. At the same
time, I figured since I wasn't really using the macOS installation that much, I'd move that one to a slower SATA
SSD and move Windows over to the <a href="https://amzn.to/2KGpd3x">Western Digital 500GB NVMe M.2 drive</a> that previously
hosted the Hackintosh boot drive.</p>
<p>Based on my recollection of the last time I'd installed/updated Windows, it seemed like a reasonable afternoon
project that should be pretty straightforward. As it turns out, the actual installation of Windows 10 is even quicker
than I had remembered, but the getting to the point where installation was possible was more than I bargained for.</p>
<p>This is a write-up because I ran into a few problems that were difficult to find great answers for, and I'm sure
there's someone else out there who will get into a similar situation. That someone is most likely to be a future
version of me…</p>

<p><strong>Windows 10 install media</strong></p>
<p>This is the easy part. I remembered having had issues in the past with the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10">Windows Media Creation Tool</a>,
and so I went out of my way to download the plain old ISO.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pro-tip: if you want to do this you need to
<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/427223/how-to-download-a-windows-10-iso-without-the-media-creation-tool/">spoof your User-Agent</a>
if you're on Windows.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pro-pro-tip: you probably don't need to do this. I ended up using WMCT and had no issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, if you want to get the ISO then you'll probably want something like <a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a> to help
you burn it into a USB thumb drive. As I mentioned above, during the course of about 15 installation attempts,
I ended up recreating the bootable media with WMCT and that's the version I ultimately successfully used. The
other failures weren't due to the ISO or Rufus, but it's probably easier to just use WMCT unless you have some
other burning reason not to.</p>
<p><strong>Hard drive prep</strong></p>
<p>I had already cleaned everything I needed off of the M.2 drive, and had reformatted it before leaving macOS.
The drive doesn't need to be in any particular state, format, or partitioning scheme - you can take care
of that in the Windows installer.</p>
<p>Some motherboards have little quirks about whether you can actually have more than one M.2 drive connected,
and if so, what other SATA ports you might lose access to, or which other PCIe slots get degraded lanes or
just stop working altogether. In my case, I'd already connected it up correctly several years ago and didn't
need to make any changes, but worth checking if you're using the M.2 drive for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>BIOS prep</strong></p>
<p>I'm going to skip all of the many, many things I tried that didn't work with BIOS settings for this, and
just make note of what I ended up finding was important. Obviously all BIOSs are different and so this won't
be an exact prescription unless you also happen to have a GIGABYTE GA-Z170X-UD5 on F21 BIOS version, but
it may be helpful nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>CSM needs to be turned off.</strong> This is Compatibility Support Module, and it (possibly among other things) will
force the boot media into MBR mode, and not UEFI mode. You want UEFI mode unless your motherboard is somehow
so old that it's not enabled. But if that were the case you're probably not trying to install Windows 10 on it.</p>
<p>If you have CSM enabled, it's very likely that you'll see an error message like “Windows cannot be installed to this disk.
The selected disk is of the GPT partition style.”</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ansonvandoren.com/images/the-selected-disk-is-of-the-gpt-partition-style.png#center" alt="This may mean you have CSM enabled"> <figcaption>
            <p>This may mean you have CSM enabled</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I also needed to set <strong>Secure Boot to Disabled</strong> otherwise I couldn't even get to the BIOS screen… I needed to
hard-reset the CMOS a few times before I figured this out definitively.</p>
<p>The final setting that mattered was the <strong>“Windows 8/10 Features”</strong>, which needed to be set to “Windows 8/10”.
The WHQL setting isn't needed, and the “Other OS” had been my previous setting when the boot manager was
Clover from the Hackintosh EFI partition, but didn't work with a Windows EFI boot loader.</p>
<p>I also had “Fast Boot” turned off, but I don't think it should matter either way. All these settings (in my BIOS)
were under the tab labeled “BIOS”.</p>

<p>I don't know why this is a problem. Others seem to have it as well, but not consistently. I don't know if
it's related to this being a clean install with multiple internal hard drives connected, or to something
about USB 3.x vs USB 2.0 for the installer media, or maybe something entirely different. Either way, as I made
it through the initial few steps of the Windows 10 installation, I kept running into a failure with the error
message “Windows could not prepare the computer to boot into the next phase of installation. To install Windows,
restart the installation.” Of course, restarting the installation doesn't change anything.</p>
<p>Before getting to this point, I had used the partition manager in the installer to delete all partitions from
the target NVMe drive, then chose the Unallocated Space on which to install Windows. I also tried creating
the partitions manually myself, with the same error message.</p>
<p>After much swearing both at the installer and the garbage that is the Microsoft Community Forums, I finally
found my way to a gentleman who went by <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7a26b9f6-6f40-419f-a7bd-9fc6389899c8?sort=LastReplyDate&amp;dir=Desc&amp;tab=Threads&amp;forum=allcategories&amp;meta=&amp;status=&amp;mod=&amp;advFil=&amp;postedAfter=undefined&amp;postedBefore=undefined&amp;threadType=All&amp;page=1">RichardKay1</a> and seemed
to have not only the same exact problem as I, but also a solution that <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-10-fresh-install-fails/f9614ae4-6dbd-4715-9a81-8586b16dfaf7?page=2">looked like it might have merit</a>.</p>
<p>His steps outlined on the forum were not exact, and mostly dealt with the <code>diskpart</code> utility, with which
I am not all that familiar, so I also spent some time trying to figure out how to safely use that tool
without deleting all the data on the 4 other disks that I had connected still.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pro-tip: probably safer to disconnect all the other disks you're not using for the actual install
before messing around with <code>diskpart</code>. Unless you're very careful. Or brave/stupid.
I decline to identify into which category I fell.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WARNING: <code>diskpart</code> can seriously ruin your day. BE CAREFUL BEFORE YOU HIT ENTER. You have been warned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Mr. RichardKay1, the root cause is that the USB installer <em>actually</em> tries to install Windows
onto the same USB stick, despite me having chosen an internal drive as the target. I don't really know how
to verify this, but regardless, his solution worked.</p>

<p>This is the key takeaway to solve the “Windows could not prepare the computer to boot into the next phase
of installation”. Or it was in my case, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Reformat the target drive</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Boot into the USB installer (I assume you can do this, else you probably the target audience.).</li>
<li>Select the language, time, and keyboard type, click Next.</li>
<li>Click “Repair your computer”, then “Troubleshoot”, then “Command Prompt”.</li>
</ol>
<p>This puts you on the X: drive (temporary RAM disk with some command line utilities) and able to access
the rest of the connected drives. First step is to fully erase the target disk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: it's up to you to choose the correct disks, and make sure that erasing them is actually what you
want to do!</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>From the command prompt, type <code>diskpart</code> to start the utility. You'll get a little prompt like <code>DISKPART&gt;</code>
and not much else.</li>
<li>Type <code>list disk</code> to show all disks, and identify (by size or whatever) which is your target.</li>
</ol>

</code></pre></div><p>My target in this case was a 500GB disk, so here shown as Disk 2 (it's not exact).</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Type <code>select disk 2</code> to choose this disk for manipulation.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>WARNING: the next step will erase EVERYTHING on the disk you have selected!</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7">
<li>Type <code>clean</code> to erase all partitions on this disk. If you run <code>list disk</code> again after this you should
see that the value in the “Free” column has gone up to the full drive capacity.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="8">
<li>We eventually want to boot in UEFI mode, and so need the partition scheme to be GPT. Type
<code>convert gpt</code> to accomplish this.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is where I diverged a bit from the forum answer. I wanted to create a EFI partition manually so that
I could keep it big enough to later use <code>grub</code> for a dual-boot Linux install, and also to get the EFI partition
in the right spot on the disk so when I collapsed partitions later I wouldn't leave a gap.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Create an EFI partition with <code>create partition EFI size=500</code> (size is in MB).</li>
<li>Format the EFI partition to FAT32 (important) with <code>format FS=FAT32 label=System</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that EFI was ready to go, I wanted to create a ~10GB partition to hold the install media that was currently
on the USB thumb drive. The process is similar to creating the EFI partition except that it's a ‘primary’ partition
and formatted as NTFS:</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Create installer partition with <code>create partition primary size=10000</code>.</li>
<li>Format installer partition with <code>format quick FS=NTFS label=Installer</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, I needed to access files on both the installer USB and also on the new internal partition. To do that
I needed to assign a drive letter.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>To see what letters are assigned, type <code>list volume</code></li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cmd">DISKPART<span></span>&gt; list volume

December 20, 2020 | https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/08/21/survey-of-rust-gui-libraries.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/08/21/survey-of-rust-gui-libraries.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>a popular trend in the Rust community is to ask "Are We X Yet" for various things that it would be nice to be able to develop easily in Rust - <a href="https://arewegameyet.rs/">game</a> and <a href="https://www.arewewebyet.org/">web</a> are the most prominent ones as far as i can tell - and one such question is <a href="https://areweguiyet.com/">Are We GUI Yet</a>.
that's a good question; <em>are</em> we GUI yet?
Are We GUI Yet has a list of libraries for building GUIs: let's go through them in alphabetical order and see if we can build a simple to-do list with them without too much struggle.</p>
<p>some notes before we get started.</p>
<ol>
<li>this is all extremely subjective.</li>
<li>the only ui toolkits i have used and not hated are Swing (i know), Electron (<em>i know</em>), and wxWidgets, which doesn't have Rust bindings because Rust bindings to C++ libraries are generously described as a nuisance to create (i've tried, and i'm writing this post instead of trying harder).
as such, i might be using some of these wrong, who knows.</li>
<li>i use windows, and so anything that's a nuisance to set up on windows is not going to fare well regardless of how cool it is once you get it working.
it could be the best thing since sliced bread or Meteor on release and i wouldn't care.
do not @ me.</li>
<li>the people who wrote these libraries have done more than i have to make the rust gui ecosystem not suck, and i don't want any of this to come across as suggesting that they suck and their work is bad.
the strongest thing i want to say is that a library is not designed in a way that i would want it to be designed, or that it doesn't work for me.
doing this shit at all is really goddamn difficult, and i don't want to minimize that by being unhappy with the results.</li>
<li>i started drafting this post in early July 2020, and finished it in late August 2020.
some things may have changed in the meantime while i wasn't paying attention.</li>
</ol>
<h2>azul</h2>
<p>first on our list is <a href="https://azul.rs/">azul</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A free, functional, immediate-mode GUI framework for rapid development of desktop applications written in Rust, supported by the Mozilla WebRender rendering engine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the wiki says we need cmake installed, which is never a good sign, but conveniently, i've already got that set up on my computer, for reasons i forget but probably didn't enjoy.
the runtime dependencies on linux are a mile long, but fortunately i don't have to care.
azul isn't currently available on crates.io for reasons that presumably exist but are difficult to explain, so we have to add it directly as a git dependency.</p>
<p>once we've got it added as a dependency, we can attempt to run our test crate, just to make sure everything's not on fire. unfortunately:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>error: failed to run custom build command for `servo-freetype-sys v4.0.5`

Caused by:
  process didn't exit successfully: `D:\Melody\Projects\we-are-not-gui-yet\target\debug\build\servo-freetype-sys-1fae054761ff82c5\build-script-build` (exit code: 101)
--- stdout
running: "cmake" &lt;snip&gt;

--- stderr
CMake Error: Could not create named generator Visual Studio 16 2019
</pre></div>
<p>this is an inauspicious beginning.
one version history crawl later and it looks like my cmake is from April 2019, which is not all that old but maybe they hadn't caught up on the latest visual studio yet, who knows.
this is already more work than i was prepared to do, but i've come this far, so it's time to update my cmake.</p>
<p>okay one installer later and it's time to try again.
armed with a cmake from May 2020, let's give this another shot:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>error[E0433]: failed to resolve: could not find `IoReader` in `bincode`
   --&gt; C:\Users\Melody\.cargo\registry\src\github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823\webrender_api-0.60.0\src\display_list.rs:270:35
    |
270 |             let reader = bincode::IoReader::new(UnsafeReader::new(&amp;mut self.data));
    |                                   ^^^^^^^^ could not find `IoReader` in `bincode`
</pre></div>
<p>welp.
the cmake update fixed things, i guess, but now we've got a whole other pile of mess.
this might be fixable, it may have been fixed by the time you read this.
regardless, this library does not work for me.</p>
<h2>conrod</h2>
<p>next up is <a href="https://github.com/pistondevelopers/conrod">conrod</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An easy-to-use, 2D GUI library written entirely in Rust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i've actually used this one before in a couple of projects, but it's been a minute, so i forget the details.</p>
<p>they do not have a real tutorial, which is unfortunate, but they do have some examples.
unfortunately, step one is to pick which of the half dozen backends i want.
do i want glium or vulkano or rendy or piston?
do i look like i know what a vulkano is?
i just want a picture of a <a href="https://youtu.be/EvKTOHVGNbg">god dang hot dog</a>.
okay that's not quite fair, i recognize three of those and can infer from context what the fourth one is, but that's only because i've been down this road before, and i still have no clue which one is the right one to pick.
all the examples live under glium, though, so let's go with that.</p>
<p>wait actually i'm staring at these examples and there's an entire ass event loop in the support code for the examples.
something in here mentions a <code>GliumDisplayWinitWrapper</code> and i'm scared.
i have literally used this library before - on two different projects - and i'm at a loss.
i don't want to just copy and paste the examples without actually understanding what's going on, i can't understand what's going on in the examples, and there's nowhere else to get started.
so there goes that i guess.</p>
<h2>core-foundation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Bindings to Core Foundation for macOS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>oh hey, it's an OS i don't have access to at all.
next.</p>
<h2>druid</h2>
<p>our next contender is <a href="https://linebender.org/druid/">druid</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Druid is a framework for building simple graphical applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>apparently this sprung out of that vi-like text editor a couple googlers were working on, so apparently it's at least possible to use it for real software.
there's a tutorial, they're on crates.io, they're describing it as "conceptually simple and largely non-magical" which i am always a fan of, i am cautiously optimistic.
if we throw it in our dependencies and just see if anything breaks, we find the surprising result that everything just works.</p>
<p>oh hey the first real chapter in the tutorial starts with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this is outdated, and should be replaced with a walkthrough of getting a simple app built and running.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>you love to see it.
fortunately, we can just ignore that and skip to the hello world example, reproduced here in its entirety:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>druid</span>::<span>{</span><span>AppLauncher</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>WindowDesc</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Widget</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>PlatformError</span><span>};</span><span></span>
<span>use</span><span> </span><span>druid</span>::<span>widget</span>::<span>Label</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>fn</span> <span>build_ui</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>impl</span><span> </span><span>Widget</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>Label</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello world"</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span><span> </span><span>PlatformError</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>AppLauncher</span>::<span>with_window</span><span>(</span><span>WindowDesc</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>build_ui</span><span>)).</span><span>launch</span><span>(())</span><span>?</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>Ok</span><span>(())</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>and somehow, this actually works.</p>
<p>the tutorial ends here, which is unfortunate, but there's more documentation, including explanations of core concepts with examples that are... todo lists!
with even more features than what i was planning to include here!
so that's convenient.
the UI hierarchy is based on CSS Flexbox, which i also appreciate.
this is what peak UI layout API looks like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>build_new_todo</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>impl</span><span> </span><span>Widget</span><span>&lt;</span><span>TodoState</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>textbox</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>TextBox</span>::<span>new</span><span>()</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>with_placeholder</span><span>(</span><span>"New todo"</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>lens</span><span>(</span><span>TodoState</span>::<span>next_todo</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Button</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Add"</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>on_click</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>data</span>: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>TodoState</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_</span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>create_todo</span><span>());</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>Flex</span>::<span>row</span><span>()</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>with_flex_child</span><span>(</span><span>textbox</span><span>.</span><span>expand_width</span><span>(),</span><span> </span><span>1.0</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>with_child</span><span>(</span><span>button</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>1 hour and 80 lines of code later, we've got ourselves a perfectly valid and working todo list!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.boringcactus.com/assets/2020-08-21-survey-of-rust-gui-libraries-1.png" alt="our sample druid application, showing a todo list"></p>
<p>i'm not quite happy with this, though: we can type text and hit the button and it adds the todo, but pressing enter in the text field doesn't do anything.
there's no way out-of-the-box to make that happen; let's see if we can build that ourselves.</p>
<p>~30 lines of code later, we've got it!
the <code>Controller</code> trait is designed for exactly this sort of thing, when you need to wrap the behavior of an existing component and intercept some events to inject your own logic.</p>
<p>if you're curious, you can take a look at <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~boringcactus/survey-of-rust-gui-libraries/tree/main/druid-test">the source for our druid example</a>.</p>
<p>so apparently druid is actually pretty darn usable.
i only have a couple tiny issues with it:</p>
<ol>
<li>it doesn't use platform native UI widgets, so it doesn't look quite like a windows app should, and it won't look quite like a mac or linux app should either if i test it there.
this one is a feature as far as some people are concerned, but i am not on that list.</li>
<li>accessibility features like being able to tab between UI widgets (<em>update 2020-12-14</em>: and also literally any screen reader support) are missing, so you'd have to roll those yourself in a real application.
 maybe they'll add that by default in future versions, maybe not, but it would be neat if it existed.</li>
<li>high-level documentation is incomplete.
the individual struct/function docs are really good, but at a high level you don't really have a convenient place to jump in.</li>
</ol>
<p>i was about to add "no support for web" to that list, but even though the high-level docs don't mention it, the crate root docs and the examples do.
on the plus side, it just works, and i didn't have to make any changes to my code because i use <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/pull/736">this patch to wasm-pack that lets you just use binary crates in wasm-pack</a> even though it hasn't been merged yet upstream.
on the minus side, it points everything at a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> tag, which means you get none of the accessibility features of actually using the DOM.
so that one's a mixed bag.</p>
<p>but yeah, overall druid is perfectly usable for gui development.
i was originally calling this post "we are not gui yet" but i guess we are at least a little bit gui already.
pleasant surprises are the best kind.</p>
<h2>fltk</h2>
<p>following up that success is <a href="https://github.com/MoAlyousef/fltk-rs">fltk</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The FLTK crate is a crossplatform lightweight gui library which can be statically linked to produce small, self-contained and fast gui applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>cross-platform and statically linked are both good things.
the upstream FLTK website makes my eyes bleed, which is never a good sign for a UI library, but that doesn't mean much one way or the other.
the simple hello world example is once again a mere handful of lines:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>fltk</span>::<span>{</span><span>app</span>::<span>*</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>window</span>::<span>*</span><span>};</span><span></span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>app</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>App</span>::<span>default</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>wind</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Window</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>100</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>400</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3…</span></pre></div></div></div>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It’s that time of year again where I’m fiddling around with Z3Py. I’m booting it back up because I’m scheduled to do a <a href="https://fmie2021.github.io/agenda.html">tutorial on Z3</a> on Feb 3. It’s kind of silly because I probably already have too much content, and the tutorial is aimed at newbies, but there are some fun new things that I’ve learned in the last year I can do in Z3. As one example, it’s not so hard to build a pretty reasonable simulacrum of TLA+ in Z3.</p>

<p><a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html">TLA+</a> is a modelling/specification language for computational processes. It is particularly useful for modeling concurrency, where our intuitions fail us <a href="http://deadlockempire.github.io/">http://deadlockempire.github.io/</a>. It’s the mind child of Leslie Lamport, the same guy behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTex</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a>. The language doesn’t aim for deep verification of your actual code as is sometimes the goal with tools like Coq, but because of that it is significantly more lightweight and easy to use. 
The <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html">TLA+ Toolbox</a> is a freely available IDE and checker to TLA+, but I think it is kind of a neat idea to replicate something in the flavor of TLA+ in all too familiar python. By leveraging Z3, we can get a lot of logical mileage and solver power for free.</p>

<p><a href="https://rise4fun.com/z3/tutorial">Z3</a> is an SMT solver. Its input language <a href="http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/examples.shtml">smtlib2</a> is a kind of typed first order logic with special support for things like booleans, integers, reals, bitvectors, and algebraic datatypes. You can ask Z3 if propositions are valid, or if not it can provide a counterexample. It works pretty crazy good, especially if you work around its weaknesses (mostly quantifiers and nasty nonlinear stuff). Z3 has top class performance and its <a href="https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/namespacez3py.html">python bindings</a> are widely regarded as very good.</p>

<p>The main unusual things TLA brings into play compared to bog standard logics is the primed variables \(x'\), representing the values of variables at the next time step, and some temporal operators like always \(\Box\) and eventually \(\Diamond\).</p>

<p>We could mark primes by creating variables in pairs</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>z3</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span>
<span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>xnxt</span> <span>=</span> <span>Ints</span><span>(</span><span>"x x'"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But I’ve chosen to mark the prime variables using a special uninterpreted function, which we strip out later.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>nxt</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):</span> <span># next is a special function for generators in python, so we shouldn't use that name
</span>    <span>assert</span> <span>is_const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>decl</span><span>().</span><span>kind</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>Z3_OP_UNINTERPRETED</span><span>:</span>
    <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>Function</span><span>(</span><span>"nxt"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One breakage here as compared to with TLA+ is the use of types. TLA+ curiously insists on a lack of intrinsic types and argues against them as a foundational feature. Types are instead propositions that are proved in the system. This just is really not convenient for using with Z3, so from the get-go I’m going to take liberties.</p>

<p>We can implement an <code>always</code> operator via a fairly simple procedure, we just roll out the execution of any formula for <code>n</code> time steps. This is the trick of bounded model checking. This rollout can be achieved by using the Z3 <code>substitute</code> function, a surprisingly useful little fellow.</p>

<p>You do have to be careful with using always. Arbitrarily nesting it’s usage may give unexpected results. Lamport makes an argument that specs very rarely do or should make sophisticated use of the temporal operators. Maybe this is good enough or maybe there is a way to patch this up.</p>

<p>Z3 does in fact return a counter model that fills the buckets up as desired.</p>

<p>TLA+ has a tendency to use functions/records which are not so obvious how to encode. There are different ways of going about this. One aspect of playing around with Z3py is that it makes extremely clear the existence of the logic language and a metalanguage. The logic is Z3 expressions, but the metalanguage is python and they are obviously very different. But there is often a choice of whether to encode things in the logic vs the metalanguage. It is usually better I think to encode as much in python as possible if you can get away with it. Z3 likes piles of simple constraints more than it likes complicated quantifiers and things.</p>

<p>For example, we can want to encode an Enum type in python or in Z3.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>enum</span> <span>import</span> <span>Enum</span><span>,</span> <span>auto</span>
<span>#python enum
</span><span>class</span> <span>RMState</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
     <span>WORKING</span> <span>=</span> <span>auto</span><span>()</span>
     <span>PREPARED</span> <span>=</span> <span>auto</span><span>()</span>
     <span>COMMITTED</span> <span>=</span> <span>auto</span><span>()</span>
     <span>ABORTED</span> <span>=</span> <span>auto</span><span>()</span>

<span># z3 enum
</span><span>RMState</span> <span>=</span> <span>Datatype</span><span>(</span><span>"RMState"</span><span>)</span>
<span>RMState</span><span>.</span><span>declare</span><span>(</span><span>"working"</span><span>)</span>

<span>RMState</span> <span>=</span> <span>RMState</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or we can choose to encode records in Z3 vs python.</p>

<p>Downsides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Very ad hoc. The use of special autogenerated names is a great way to inadvertently smash things together</li>
  <li>TLA syntax is designed to be readable. The python adds a lot of noise</li>
  <li>TLA toolbox can format specs nicely using latex.</li>
  <li>TLA has a lot of thought gone into it. Making changes to it in an afternoon of thought is probably not to be trusted</li>
</ul>

<p>Upsides:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Better fits Z3, so we get good automation from the get go</li>
  <li>python is lingua franca of computing. It is comforting compared to TLA+, even if Z3py might be discomfiting.</li>
  <li>Having to download the toolbox and figure out how to use it is always going to be a slight speedbump. There is a TLA+ vscode extension now though. That might help</li>
</ul>

<p>Using Python ast parsing <a href="https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html</a>, we could probably use regular simple python syntax as a PlusCal like DSL and compile it into the above Z3-TLA+ hybrid.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if the CHOOSE operator of TLA+ will be easy to implement. It kind of seems like it requires nested solves? Can it be encoded using</p>

<p>I don’t particularly understand the TLA+ module system yet and I’m not so sure how to emulate it. Python modules might be one way, or perhaps classes.</p>

<p>Although I tried to copy exactly, perhaps one shouldn’t spec in precisely the style of standard TLA+.</p>

<p>I mean, is this even up for argument?</p>

<p>One of the whitest-ass things in the world is our people’s obsession with songs at sporting events, and indeed, in large crowds. If you’re reading this and you’re from Europe, feel free to replace my references to Sweet Caroline with Seven Nation Army, same diff. That said, you can fairly reliably trigger this behavior in most cultures in most parts of the world by finding a sufficiently rowdy bar around midnight and playing <em>something</em> on the jukebox that gets folks going. Humans, we’re social creatures, yeah? A few bars of Neil Diamond, a couple people singing along, and by the time you’re at ‘Hands, touching hands’ you’ll have a swelling crescendo that culminates in a ear-shattering and atonal screech of ‘SWEEEEEEEEEEEEET CAR-O-LINE (WOAH OH OH)’ making the bartenders silently plot the murder of everyone in their line of sight.</p>
<p>People like being around people, and most people don’t treat everyone around them as some sort of incredibly delicate faberge egg. There’s a lot of “wow look at all these accomodations people are making that disabled people have asked for now that nobody is supposed to leave their house! hypocrisy, much??” and I’m like, yeah, duh? Pointing out hypocrisy is the lowest form of engagement in 2020. This is why virtual events suck – because nobody is actually planning on doing them any longer than they need to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the benefits of in-person conferences is that they temporarily remove you from your day-to-day work and immerse you in a community of like-minded individuals. It’s not just about getting to hear new ideas, but also about the break from your daily routine. This is one of the things that is hardest to replicate in a virtual event. DIDevOps was perhaps the most successful virtual conference I’ve seen in making their event feel like An Event. This event was clever and whimsical, the community was engaged, and it definitely didn’t feel like just another video call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://redmonk.com/rstephens/2020/04/30/deserted-island-devops/">Rachel Stephens, RedMonk</a></p>
<p>I wrote earlier this year about the idea of a <a href="https://aparker.io/posts/deserted-island-devops/">decisive moment</a> and how that influenced the thinking behind Deserted Island DevOps. To elaborate a bit, Cartier-Bresson was a street photographer who coined this phrase in the introduction to his 1947 book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as of a precise organisation of forms which give that event its proper expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is, then, the ‘decisive moment’ of a tech conference? My original criteria was that an event was <em>etherial</em> or placeless; From the smallest DevOpsDays to the largest re:Invent, an event is defined less by the where than by the who. As an attendee, you are swept away from the status quo for a time (even as it inorexably pulls you back in, given the amount of people I see working on laptops during events) into a convention center or hotel or theater or whatever, specifically to focus on something other than what you normally would. Quite literally, you are being moved out of your comfort zone. This can prime you to accept ideas that normally you wouldn’t, can rejigger your brain chemistry for a few hours to make you see things from a different perspective. That’s valuable! As a speaker, you’re transported to a new stage, with a new audience, a new set of eyes and ears to reflect off of. It’s almost like being a comedian and testing out material – you try some new lines, some new jokes, add an anecdote here, shave one off there. Repetition builds mastery. Next week, or next month, you’re going to do it all again. Our traversal through the liminal spaces between these potemkin stages lends itself to inward focus where we must Do The Work to shut out the world around us. To be less floral about it, the demands of the road make us better speakers because the only way we don’t go fuckin’ mad is to focus on the work.</p>
<p>Virtual events offer none of this, unfortunately. As attendees, another Slack, another Zoom call, another wave of talking heads and PowerPoint. As speakers, our audience disappears behind a chat window. We lose our reflection. It’s sad and terrible and great for some people, but on the balance I think we dislike it more than we like it.</p>
<p>The bad is part of the fun! You can’t replicate the feeling of gnawing on an underripe banana while chugging overly-hot-but-not-terribly-flavorful coffee watching someone who’s company paid way too much for a keynote while mentally ticking off the people you need to talk to that day while working out the soreness in your back from the bed that isn’t yours that you got maybe four productive sleeping hours in due to jet lag while figuring out who you’re going to catch up with after the show wraps that day as you muse about how it looks like your competitors have a much nicer booth than yours, and you wonder if they’re hiring except that one asshole still works there and so on and so forth. “That sounds terrible!” you may be musing, <em>and you’d be right</em>, but I love the terrible. I thrive in the terrible. I’m drinking single origin fair trade coffee beans that were roasted in small batches locally brewed in a fancy coffee maker and I can tell you that when this is all over and I can have a cuppa brewed in the backroom of a Hilton it is going to be the sweetest thing I can possibly imagine for five seconds right before I start hating everything about it again and <em>that’s fine</em>.</p>
<p>The bad of an in-person event is terrible, but it’s a terrible I can work with. I go outside like once or twice a week now to get groceries and that’s all I’ve done for the past nine months. <em>I want the workable terrible, not this horrific stasis</em>.</p>

<p>The reason that virtual events suck is that we’re trying to replicate in-person events. We’re doing old-school iOS skeumorphism but for primarily social gatherings. No wonder they suck! There’s a few broad reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bad UX</em>: Sometimes I like to style on babies by displaying object permanance, but you wouldn’t know that given the utter contempt event platforms seem to have for their audiences by doing dumb skeumorphic “conference halls” with badly ‘shopped people standing around.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://aparker.io/images/kubeconlobby.png" alt="KubeCon EU ‘Lobby’"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Pervasive Surveillence</em>: I use ad blockers but a bunch of people don’t, on principle though it’s really fuckin’ creepy that every click you make on one of these event platforms is tracked. Simply navigating to a sponsor booth counts as a ‘lead’ to the sponsor. Yikes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor AV Quality</em>: I get that people have to record from their homes but maybe recording someone’s Zoom isn’t the best way to do this? I’m sympathetic, this is legit a hard problem to solve, but many large conferences are still charging an arm and a leg to sponsors (and less for attendees but that’s a different point) so how about you do local recording then edit things later? If you’re going to charge me at <em>all</em> then I expect the production values to at least beat out a random Twitch streamer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor Viewing Experience</em>: A tiny pop-out 720p video that artifacts when I change the size is… not great. Integrate chat and Q&amp;A better. Do <em>something</em> unique with the format. I sit on enough Zoom calls. Like, why would I <em>pay money</em> to <em>watch videos</em> with a <em>worse player than YouTube</em>? There’s millions of hours of shit out there for free!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Yet Another Slack</em>: I just don’t want to join more Slack channels where people are randomly @here’ing and I never know if it’s an event organizer with an announcement or some salesperson trying to coax people into their virtual booth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Did I Mention Virtual Booths Yet</em>: I have never interacted with anyone in a Virtual Booth and I never will. This appears to be a common sentiment.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Alright, let’s flip the script. I’m wearing my business hat now.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Bad UX</em>: You think the <em>attendee</em> experience is bad, the admin/sponsor controls and views on these platforms is worse. Arbitrary requirements, poor control over look and feel, nah fam miss me with this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor Interactivity</em>: You know what’s great about a real booth? People wander by and they get interested. Why do they wander by? Because they’re not at home, they need to kill time, and the snacks are on the trade floor. Maybe they just want a t-shirt or whatever, fine, but we do actually get a lot of really valuable feedback and eyes on the product by doing demos. This is extremely useful, and it simply doesn’t happen at virtual events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Attendee Impedence Mismatch</em>: This is more of a theory but I suspect that the attendee mix for virtual events in terms of titles is significantly out-of-balance compared to in-person events. One popular (<em>n</em> = ~1300) virtual event this year had self-reported attendance of only 4% for management roles, but over 40% IC (developer/devops/ops) roles. My hypothesis is that “decision makers” are less likely to attend virtual events because they’re intensely overbooked during the in-person -&gt; distributed team transition period and are oversubscribed on other things, which translates into less useful direct sales conversations, but I could be off-base here. If nothing else, my anecdata from talking about this seems to indicate that attendees just don’t really go to virtual booths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Success Looks Different</em>: This is one of those ‘two-way street’ problems, but I don’t think organizers did a great job in general making sponsors successful, and I don’t think sponsors had the muscle to make themselves successful in a lot of ways. Trying to be too different caused a lot of friction, however, and during a time of reinvention this friction reduced experimentation in my opinion.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Last part - the speaker experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>My Home Is Not Your Home</em>: One of the low key worst things about the pandemic has been the idea of us ‘opening up our homes’ and letting people see how we live. Could we fuckin’ not? Like I don’t believe that I even have to discuss this but we should probably put the Room Rater person on trial for crimes against humanity. I don’t <em>want</em> to have to be super concious about my webcam or audio or whatever, I don’t <em>want</em> to …</p></li></ul></div></div></div>

<h4>This classic article from Mario Wolczko first
appeared on Usenet in 1986.  </h4>

Have you ever left your terminal logged in, only to find when you
came back to it that a (supposed) friend had typed "<kbd>rm -rf
~/*</kbd>" and was hovering over the keyboard with threats along the
lines of "<em>lend me a fiver 'til Thursday, or I hit return</em>"?
Undoubtedly the person in question would not have had the nerve to
inflict such a trauma upon you, and was doing it in jest.  So you've
probably never experienced the worst of such disasters....<p>


It was a quiet Wednesday afternoon.  Wednesday, 1st October, 15:15
BST, to be precise, when Peter, an office-mate of mine, leaned away
from his terminal and said to me, "<em>Mario, I'm having a little
trouble sending mail.</em>" Knowing that msg was capable of confusing
even the most capable of people, I sauntered over to his terminal to
see what was wrong.  A strange error message of the form (I forget
the exact details) "<kbd>cannot access /foo/bar for userid 147</kbd>"
had been issued by msg.  My first thought was "<em>Who's userid 147?;
the sender of the message, the destination, or what?</em>" So I leant
over to another terminal, already logged in, and typed</p><blockquote>        <kbd>grep 147 /etc/passwd</kbd></blockquote>

<p>only to receive the response</p><blockquote>        <kbd>/etc/passwd: No such file or directory.</kbd></blockquote>

Instantly, I guessed that something was amiss.  This was confirmed
when in response to<blockquote>        <kbd>ls /etc</kbd></blockquote>

<p>I got</p><blockquote>        <kbd>ls: not found.</kbd></blockquote>

I suggested to Peter that it would be a good idea not to try anything
for a while, and went off to find our system manager.<p>

When I arrived at his office, his door was ajar, and within ten
seconds I realised what the problem was.  James, our manager, was
sat down, head in hands, hands between knees, as one whose world has
just come to an end.  Our newly-appointed system programmer, Neil, was
beside him, gazing listlessly at the screen of his terminal.  And at
the top of the screen I spied the following lines:</p><blockquote>
        <kbd># cd <br>
        # rm -rf *</kbd>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, shit, I thought.  That would just about explain it.</p><p>


I can't remember what happened in the succeeding minutes; my memory
is just a blur.  I do remember trying <kbd>ls</kbd> (again),
<kbd>ps</kbd>, <kbd>who</kbd> and maybe a few other commands beside,
all to no avail.  The next thing I remember was being at my terminal
again (a multi-window graphics terminal), and typing</p><blockquote>
        <kbd>cd /<br>
        echo *</kbd>
</blockquote>
<p>I owe a debt of thanks to David Korn for making <kbd>echo</kbd> a
built-in of his shell; needless to say, <kbd>/bin</kbd>, together
with <kbd>/bin/echo</kbd>, had been deleted.  What transpired in the
next few minutes was that <kbd>/dev</kbd>, <kbd>/etc</kbd> and
<kbd>/lib</kbd> had also gone in their entirety; fortunately Neil had
interrupted <kbd>rm</kbd> while it was somewhere down below
<kbd>/news</kbd>, and <kbd>/tmp</kbd>, <kbd>/usr</kbd> and
<kbd>/users</kbd> were all untouched.</p><p>


Meanwhile James had made for our tape cupboard and had retrieved what
claimed to be a dump tape of the root filesystem, taken four weeks
earlier.  The pressing question was, "<em>How do we recover the
contents of the tape?</em>".  Not only had we lost
<kbd>/etc/restore</kbd>, but all of the device entries for the tape
deck had vanished.  And where does <kbd>mknod</kbd> live?  You
guessed it, <kbd>/etc</kbd>.  How about recovery across Ethernet of
any of this from another VAX?  Well, <kbd>/bin/tar</kbd> had gone,
and thoughtfully the Berkeley people had put <kbd>rcp</kbd> in
<kbd>/bin</kbd> in the 4.3 distribution.  What's more, none of the
Ether stuff wanted to know without <kbd>/etc/hosts</kbd> at least.
We found a version of <kbd>cpio</kbd> in <kbd>/usr/local</kbd>, but
that was unlikely to do us any good without a tape deck.</p><p>


Alternatively, we could get the boot tape out and rebuild the root
filesystem, but neither James nor Neil had done that before, and we
weren't sure that the first thing to happen would be that the whole
disk would be re-formatted, losing all our user files.  (We take dumps
of the user files every Thursday; by Murphy's Law this had to happen
on a Wednesday).  Another solution might be to borrow a disk from
another VAX, boot off that, and tidy up later, but that would have
entailed calling the DEC engineer out, at the very least.  We had a
number of users in the final throes of writing up PhD theses and the
loss of a maybe a weeks' work (not to mention the machine down time)
was unthinkable.</p><p>


So, what to do?  The next idea was to write a program to make a
device descriptor for the tape deck, but we all know where
<kbd>cc</kbd>, <kbd>as</kbd> and <kbd>ld</kbd> live.  Or maybe make
skeletal entries for <kbd>/etc/passwd</kbd>, <kbd>/etc/hosts</kbd>
and so on, so that <kbd>/usr/bin/ftp</kbd> would work.  By sheer
luck, I had a <kbd>gnuemacs</kbd> still running in one of my windows,
which we could use to create <kbd>passwd</kbd>, etc., but the first
step was to create a directory to put them in.  Of course
<kbd>/bin/mkdir</kbd> had gone, and so had <kbd>/bin/mv</kbd>, so we
couldn't rename <kbd>/tmp</kbd> to <kbd>/etc</kbd>.  However, this
looked like a reasonable line of attack.</p><p>


By now we had been joined by Alasdair, our resident UNIX guru, and as
luck would have it, someone who knows VAX assembler.  So our plan
became this: write a program in assembler which would either rename
<kbd>/tmp</kbd> to <kbd>/etc</kbd>, or make <kbd>/etc</kbd>, assemble
it on another VAX, <kbd>uuencode</kbd> it, type in the uuencoded file
using my gnu, <kbd>uudecode</kbd> it (some bright spark had thought
to put <kbd>uudecode</kbd> in <kbd>/usr/bin</kbd>), run it, and hey
presto, it would all be plain sailing from there.  By yet another
miracle of good fortune, the terminal from which the damage had been
done was still <kbd>su</kbd>'d to root (<kbd>su</kbd> is in
<kbd>/bin</kbd>, remember?), so at least we stood a chance of all
this working.</p><p>


Off we set on our merry way, and within only an hour we had managed
to concoct the dozen or so lines of assembler to create
<kbd>/etc</kbd>.  The stripped binary was only 76 bytes long, so we
converted it to hex (slightly more readable than the output of
<kbd>uuencode</kbd>), and typed it in using my editor.  If any of you
ever have the same problem, here's the hex for future reference:</p><blockquote>
   <kbd>070100002c000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br>
        0000dd8fff010000dd8f27000000fb02ef07000000fb01ef070000000000bc8f<br>
		8800040000bc012f65746300</kbd>
</blockquote>

<p>

I had a handy program around (doesn't everybody?) for converting
ASCII hex to binary, and the output of <kbd>/usr/bin/sum</kbd>
tallied with our original binary.  But hang on---how do you set
execute permission without <kbd>/bin/chmod</kbd>?  A few seconds
thought (which as usual, lasted a couple of minutes) suggested that
we write the binary on top of an already existing binary, owned by
me...problem solved.

So along we trotted to the terminal with the root login, carefully
remembered to set the umask to 0 (so that I could create files in it
using my gnu), and ran the binary.  So now we had a <kbd>/etc</kbd>,
writable by all.  From there it was but a few easy steps to creating
<kbd>passwd</kbd>, <kbd>hosts</kbd>, <kbd>services</kbd>,
<kbd>protocols</kbd>, (etc), and then <kbd>ftp</kbd> was willing to
play ball.  Then we recovered the contents of <kbd>/bin</kbd> across
the ether (it's amazing how much you come to miss <kbd>ls</kbd> after
just a few, short hours), and selected files from <kbd>/etc</kbd>.
The key file was <kbd>/etc/rrestore</kbd>, with which we recovered
<kbd>/dev</kbd> from the dump tape, and the rest is history.</p><p>


Now, you're asking yourself (as I am), what's the moral of this
story?  Well, for one thing, you must always remember the immortal
words, <strong>DON'T PANIC</strong>.  Our initial reaction was to
reboot the machine and try everything as single user, but it's
unlikely it would have come up without <kbd>/etc/init</kbd> and
<kbd>/bin/sh</kbd>.  Rational thought saved us from this one.</p><p>


The next thing to remember is that UNIX tools really can be put to
unusual purposes.  Even without my <kbd>gnuemacs</kbd>, we could have
survived by using, say, <kbd>/usr/bin/grep</kbd> as a substitute for
<kbd>/bin/cat</kbd>.</p><p>


And the final thing is, it's amazing how much of the system you can
delete without it falling apart completely.  Apart from the fact that
nobody could login (<kbd>/bin/login</kbd>?), and most of the useful
commands had gone, everything else seemed normal.  Of course, some
things can't stand life without say <kbd>/etc/termcap</kbd>, or
<kbd>/dev/kmem</kbd>, or <kbd>/etc/utmp</kbd>, but by and large it
all hangs together.</p><p>


I shall leave you with this question: if you were placed in the same
situation, and had the presence of mind that always comes with
hindsight, could you have got out of it in a simpler or easier way?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaBostian/status/1334435314673348609">Emma Bostian tweeted about how she was sick of “[CSS]’s shit.”</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaBostian/status/1334863522749145096">She later apologised</a>, but her wording suggests she still thinks it isn’t lack of knowledge. It’s fairly common for software engineers to complain about CSS. Interestingly enough, that portion of the web development community also thinks CSS is easy.</p>
<p>In contrast, <a href="https://twitter.com/meyerweb/status/1334862797822373889">Eric Meyer</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan/status/1334796914831855617">Sara Soueidan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/brucel/status/1334818455275626499">Bruce Lawson</a>, and more (principal) web developers seem to agree that CSS is hard to master. It’s interesting how experts say CSS is hard, while a group of people who specialise in other technology say otherwise.</p>
<p>I feel we, the community, have to acknowledge that CSS is easy to get started with and hard to master. Let’s reflect on the language and find out what makes it hard.</p>
<h2 id="syntax-and-common-properties"><a href="#syntax-and-common-properties">#</a> Syntax And Common Properties</h2>
<p>Back in 2013, Hugo “Kitty” Giraudel published <a href="https://hugogiraudel.com/2013/04/15/css-is-easy/">CSS is Easy</a>, in which they also write about how CSS is perceived as easy. In the article, Kitty makes an excellent point: “CSS is easy… syntactically.” I wholeheartedly agree. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code><span>body</span> {
  <span>background-color</span>: black;
  <span>color</span>: white;
}

<span>@media</span> (<span>min-width:</span> <span>64em</span>) {
  <span>body</span> {
    <span>background-color</span>: white;
    <span>color</span>: black;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this snippet, you can see much of the syntax used in CSS. There are selectors, declarations, I even added an at-rule (<code>@media</code>). The properties and values in this example are straight-forward; they just work. The at-rule, although syntactically simple, adds some cognitive load to understanding this snippet. It creates a relationship between what’s inside and outside the at-rule. In other words, to determine what colour the <code>body</code> is, we have to parse the entire file mentally.</p>
<p>This snippet isn’t too complex, but as we get more code the number of relationships (like the at-rule) do too.</p>
<h2 id="a-web-of-relationships"><a href="#a-web-of-relationships">#</a> A Web Of Relationships</h2>
<p>Syntax and basic properties are pretty easy, indeed. However, the learning curve of CSS quickly gets steeper when you start dealing with various relationships. Let’s look at some.</p>
<h3 id="property-sets"><a href="#property-sets">#</a> Property Sets</h3>
<p>Many properties are part of a set, meaning you may need several others to make one work. For instance, the <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and the <code>z-index</code> properties are ignored until you add the <code>position</code> property and set it to anything but <code>static</code>. That means that you have to learn a couple of properties of a set and how they relate to each other before being able to use one. If you’re unaware which properties rely on others, it can be extremely frustrating because it may appear that a declaration just doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s not always obvious which pieces of the set are declared. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code><span>.snackbar</span> {
  <span>position</span>: fixed;
  <span>bottom</span>: <span>1rem</span>;
  <span>left</span>: <span>1rem</span>;
  <span>right</span>: <span>1rem</span>;
}

<span>@media</span> (<span>min-width:</span> <span>64em</span>) {
  <span>.snackbar</span> {
    <span>bottom</span>: <span>2rem</span>;
    <span>left</span>: <span>2rem</span>;
    <span>right</span>: <span>2rem</span>;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If we look at the first rule, we can easily tell how an element with the <code>snackbar</code> class would be positioned on our page. If we look at the second rule, the one in the <code>@media</code> at-rule, we’re not so sure. We’d have to look up the <code>.snackbar</code> rule outside the at-rule. This example is fairly obvious, but it can get pretty obscure. The <code>position: fixed</code> declaration could be set elsewhere, on another selector, or inline.</p>
<h3 id="the-dom"><a href="#the-dom">#</a> The <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr></h3>
<p>We can’t determine which styles are applied just by looking at your CSS. The HTML, or rather the DOM, also affects them. We have to consider the tag name of the element, its attributes, its siblings, its parents all the way up to the root node, and all relevant styles. If you render HTML server- or client-side, all of this may be dynamic and influenced by the application state.</p>
<p>The adjacent sibling combinator (<code>+</code>) is a simple example of how HTML influences CSS. The following style is only applied when a <code>li</code> is followed by another:</p>
<pre><code><span>li</span> + <span>li</span> { <span>margin-top</span>: <span>1rem</span>; }
</code></pre>
<p>This example is quite expressive but doesn’t have to be. Another example that took me a while to get as a beginner was using <code>position: absolute</code> on an element with a parent with <code>position: relative</code>. The element with <code>position: absolute</code> is positioned relative to the viewport or relative to an ancestor element with <code>position: relative</code>. In order to place this <code>absolute</code> element correctly in the interface, we have to know whether the element sits in a container with <code>position: relative</code>. Again, we’d have to look at the DOM, and at all it’s states, to be sure this is the case.</p>
<p>A similar, perhaps more familiar, example is the <code>flex</code> property. It only works if the element is a direct child of an element with the <code>display: flex</code> declaration.</p>
<p>When we write CSS, we always have to consider the DOM.</p>
<h3 id="cascade"><a href="#cascade">#</a> Cascade</h3>
<p>Let’s say I want text and links in the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element to be red. We might write the following CSS:</p>
<pre><code><span>nav</span> { <span>color</span>: red; }
<span>nav</span> <span>a</span> { <span>color</span>: inherit; }
</code></pre>
<p>These two simple declarations imply various relationships. The link colour is now dependent on the colour of the text. Because of that, we can set the text colour of the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element and the link will inherit this colour. If we remove either of these two declarations, the link colour won’t be red anymore.</p>
<p>The flexibility cascade gives has its benefits, but it’s not hard to imagine that it can get difficult to track the relationships between all styles. It’s no surprise that many opt to use cascade as little as possible.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility"><a href="#compatibility">#</a> Compatibility</h2>
<p>Designing an interface with CSS that doesn’t break is no easy task. There are numerous devices, browsers, resolutions, and users we have to take into account. We can also account for device settings, like dark mode using <code>prefers-color-scheme: dark/light</code>. On top of that, there are often various conditions in the interface that affect the styling as well.</p>
<p>Every combination of all these states and overrides have to be taken into account to produce the right output style. Again, this is no easy feat. It often involves a lot of tools and testing during and after development.</p>
<h2 id="maintainability"><a href="#maintainability">#</a> Maintainability</h2>
<p>Like all other code, CSS should be clean, readable, and maintainable. We can group styles into various files, or prefix selectors, but all rules live globally. This is a challenge, but also greatly contributes to keeping the code <abbr title="Don’t Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr>.</p>
<p>I earlier explained various types of relationships in CSS. They play a part in maintainability as well. Some of the methodologies used in CSS — like atomic design, <abbr title="Block Element Modifier">BEM</abbr>, <abbr title="Inverted Triangle CSS">ITCSS</abbr>, and others — help to keep the coupling in check. They’re similar to paradigms and best practises in programming, and also steepen the learning curve and requires additional knowledge.</p>
<p>Then there are also preprocessors. We have a lot of them (e.g. PostCSS, Sass, LESS, and Stylus) at our disposal to do things we can’t do with vanilla CSS. This usually improves maintainability but does add another layer of complexity.</p>
<p>Finally, not unlike other languages, there often are various solutions to one problem. A common example is deciding between <code>display: inline-block</code>, the <code>float</code> property, flexbox, or grid to horizontally stack a list of items. Each has its pros and cons. When mentoring beginners, I found this is a challenge for them. It’s also difficult to convey the differences of these options — that are often subtle — and which is the most robust in a given situation.</p>
<p>All together, maintainability in CSS is a tradeoff. The code gets more complex syntactically and bound by self-imposed rules, but (hopefully) reduces the effort it takes to understand and modify the code.</p>
<h2 id="concluding"><a href="#concluding">#</a> Concluding</h2>
<p>CSS may seem simple at first, but the learning curve isn’t linear; mastering it is hard. By no means is the language perfect, but it’s amazingly efficient at what it’s designed to do. Despite its simple syntax, there’s little it can’t do.</p>
<p>I think mastering CSS comes down to having a good amount of knowledge about it, recognising the subtle dependencies between different declarations, rules, and the DOM, understanding how they make your CSS complex, and how to best avoid them. Reaching that point is naturally frustrating because you will run into code that is a tangled mess where the tiniest edit might change the interface in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>I worry that the way we think about CSS might affect how beginners perceive the language. If they are taught that CSS is easy, they might be discouraged from seeking help when they struggle or just blame the language. Admitting you struggle with something is difficult enough. Let’s not make it worse for them.</p>
<p>I feel it’s better if we acknowledge the complexity of writing CSS. We might also stop looking down on CSS specialists. Today, they’re often considered half a developer, whilst (JavaScript) software engineers (or UI engineers, or whatever they’re called nowadays) that know little about the complexities of CSS are considered full-fledged front-end developers. We see this on social media, in job openings, and in pay.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> See the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25491568">Hacker News thread</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/kh6ox0/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/programming</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/kh6gh2/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/ProgrammingLanguages</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/kh1p0a/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/gamedev</a> posts for discussions on this article and Cakelisp.</p>
<p>I have been working on a new programming language since the end of August 2020. It is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/makuto/cakelisp/">Github</a>, and mirrored on <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/cakelisp/">my site</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to see a working example first, <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/test/src/VocalGame.cake">VocalGame.cake</a> is a simple audio looper with Ogre 3D graphics and SDL for windowing, input, and audio. This demo supports code hot-reloading and doesn't require an external build system, only Cakelisp. You can also check <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/cakelisp/src/branch/master/runtime/Macros.cake">Macros.cake</a>, which demonstrates some use-cases for compile-time code.</p>
<p>I figured showing non-trivial examples would be much more interesting. It also proves that Cakelisp is working.</p>

<p>Cakelisp is built for me first, but it should appeal to fellow programmers who know what they're doing and want to try a more powerful language.</p>
<p>Cakelisp might be for you if you want…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uncompromised performance</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trust in you, the programmer</strong></li>
<li><strong>Powerful code generation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the things in that list don't make sense to you, or you think you're already getting them in language <em>X</em>, then Cakelisp isn't for you, and that's okay! We have different domains and different problems, so it makes some sense to use different languages and methodologies.</p>
<p>While many languages have these features, few have the combination of all three. Lisp has extremely powerful code generation, but makes serious performance compromises. C is great for performance but can require extremely repetitive code writing to accomplish tasks a simple code generator could handle. Rust is fast (well, apart from compilation, which is very important for iterative development to be productive), but doesn't trust the programmer.</p>

<p>My goal is to "have my cake and eat it too", meaning all three of these features in one coherent package. Importantly, there isn't one dominating principle in Cakelisp (no <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH9VCN6UkyQ">Big Idea</a>). I've found that the small things like removing the need for header files, no longer dealing with external build systems, or being able to run Cakelisp files like scripts, end up making a big difference when combined in one package.</p>
<p>It is useful to go over the goals in detail so you can understand my decisions.</p>
<h2 id="uncompromised-performance">Uncompromised performance</h2>
<p>This means no garbage collection, no type boxing/unboxing, etc. Fewer abstractions (besides the ones you create) between you and what the computer is actually doing. Idiomatic usage of the language should result in performance comparable with C (in most cases, it should be identical, because it's only a thin layer on C).</p>
<h2 id="trust-in-you-the-programmer">Trust in you, the programmer</h2>
<p>While languages like Rust offer benefits in terms of security and stability, they cost programmers in terms of productivity. It makes sense to value safety so highly if your code is safety-critical (operating systems, aerospace, automotive, etc.), but it's much less valuable when safety isn't as important (e.g. in games).</p>
<p>In a perfect world all programs would be as robust as space flight software, but in reality, that level of robustness is unnecessary for most programs. It's important to realize that the safety focus is just one way of doing things, not the <em>One True Way</em> or anything.</p>
<h2 id="powerful-code-generation">Powerful code generation</h2>
<p>In my opinion, most languages offer far too little opportunity for the programmer to automate the actual writing of code. This power also relates to trusting in the programmer, because gone wild, the code can become incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The company I work for has what I consider to be a state-of-the-art code generator built for the company's use-case: multi-platform MMOs. It's used very effectively on serialization, RPC, automatic commands, monitoring, automatic documentation, and more.</p>
<p>To give more credence to the use of code generation in games, <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/GameplayArchitecture/index.html">Unreal</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiJqUWfR90I">Naughty Dog</a> also rely on code generation.</p>
<h2 id="simplify-project-setup-and-management">Simplify project setup and management</h2>
<p>I want to dramatically reduce time wasted on C++ project set-up and "code logistics". This includes setting up build systems, creating header files, adding and managing new C/C++ 3rd party libraries, and other things of that ilk.</p>
<h2 id="gain-more-power">Gain more power!</h2>
<p>Every language has limitations. The lack of straightforward, all-powerful code generation was my primary gripe with C++.</p>
<p>For example, automatically creating function and structure bindings using C++ template metaprogramming is very complex. These are two very useful tools in game development: function bindings for commands, scripting languages, and RPC; structure bindings for serialization or game monitors.</p>
<p>I also wanted features like hot-reloading (being able to load new versions of the code without restarting the program/losing runtime state). Cakelisp made it possible to implement hot-reloading entirely in "user-space", thanks to code modification.</p>
<h2 id="have-my-cake-and-eat-it-too.">"Have my cake and eat it too."</h2>
<p>By this I mean lose little-to-nothing on metrics I care about, which include build time, runtime performance, overall complexity, and various other things. I looked into several languages in my <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/LanguageTests">LanguageTests</a> experiment and found they all had major drawbacks I couldn't accept.</p>
<h2 id="unexpected-freedom">Unexpected freedom</h2>
<p>I did not realize when I started Cakelisp how freeing it felt. All of the sudden, I got to decide what made sense to <em>me</em>, not what made sense to previous language designers.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-in-syntax">Freedom in syntax</h3>
<p>A simple example is type declarations. In C:</p>

<p>The same variable, in Cakelisp:</p>

<p>In my opinion C type declarations are much harder to parse than my explicit type declarations. You need to work backwards from the name to properly interpret the type. The parentheses do add more typing, but they're more clear, machine-parseable, and can be read naturally (e.g. read left to right "pointer to constant character" vs. C's "constant character pointer", which seems worse in my mind).</p>
<p>My form also handles arrays as part of the type: <code>(var my-array ([] 5 int))</code> rather than <code>int myArray[5];</code>, another way it is more consistent, readable, and parsable.</p>
<p>I chose to swap the order of name and type because it places more emphasis on the name. A well-written program will convey more useful information in the name than in the type, so it makes sense to me to have it come first for the reader.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-in-process">Freedom in process</h3>
<p>I also found that having an executable which preprocesses my code exactly how I want it opens the door to a huge amount of awesome features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile-time code execution. "Macros" and "Generators" are defined in-line with the rest of your code, making them feel like a natural part of your code. Defining them in-line makes it acceptable to add one-off macros, whereas adding such a thing to an external code generator would quickly become unmaintainable</li>
<li>Build optimization. A recent idea I discovered is automatically creating precompiled headers for large batches of 3rd-party headers. This would be a complex task that would need to be integrated in whatever build system you use, whereas Cakelisp can have it built-in</li>
<li>Other data processing. Compile-time code execution means you can do things like prepare assets, download 3rd-party code, run tests, etc. without having to set up all these additional tools</li>
</ul>

<p>I was inspired by Naughty Dog's use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Oriented_Assembly_Lisp">Game Oriented Assembly Lisp</a>, GOOL, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSmqbnhHp1c">Racket/Scheme</a> (on their modern titles). I've also taken several ideas from Jonathan Blow's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jblow888">talks on Jai</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a software engineer in the game industry. I've been working since July 2015 at a studio that makes cross-platform MMOs. The company has a custom engine written in C (with some C++).</p>
<p>I <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/LanguageTests">experimented</a> with other languages before deciding I needed to write my own.</p>

<p>Now that my goals are clear, I will show you how I approached achieving them.</p>
<h2 id="notation">Notation</h2>
<p>Cakelisp uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-expression</a>-style notation. Here is some Cakelisp code from <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/test/src/VocalGame.cake">VocalGame</a>:</p>

<p>There are a few things you can notice from reading this code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Types. Cakelisp is strongly- and explicitly-typed. I prefer reading code with explicit types because I can better imagine what the computer is actually doing, and what possibilities I have with each variable</li>
<li>Name-type order. I talked about this in a previous section. I wanted to emphasize the name of a variable for conveying meaning, especially when you may have many variables of the same type</li>
<li>Explicit <code>return</code>. I find I prefer code where return points are made explicit. Lisp will implicitly return the result of the last evaluation</li>
<li>Lisp-y style. The parentheses, plus keywords like <code>unless</code>, <code>defun</code>, <code>var</code>, <code>at</code>, and <code>incr</code>. I matched Lisp only when I didn't have strong opinions for a better notation. I am not trying to create something which is compatible with existing Lisps</li>
<li>C types and function calls. Cakelisp has seamless C interop, which means Cakelisp's "standard library" <em>is</em> C's standard library. No bindings had to be written to use the C types or make the function calls</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more Cakelisp code in <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/src">Gamelib</a>.</p>
<p>You should think of Cakelisp more as "C in S-expressions" rather than "Lisp with C performance". If you know C, you'll have a relatively smooth transition to Cakelisp. If you only know Lisp, you're going to have a rougher time.</p>
<h3 id="why-s-expressions">Why S-expressions?</h3>
<p>When I set out to make Cakelisp, I decided on S-expressions syntax for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsability. S-expressions shift the burden of creating a syntax tree onto the programmer. This does result on more work for the human, but I value its extremely explicit nature. It also facilitates simpler tokenization, domain-specific-language implementation, and external tool support</li>
<li>Consistency. There are only four types of tokens in Cakelisp: open and close parenthesis, symbol, and string. The consistency is admittedly limiting, so things like paths (<code>myThing-&gt;member.member</code>) become much more verbose to type, unfortunately. However, this limitation keeps Cakelisp code parsable, and has an elegant feel that I appreciate</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't believe there is one notation to rule them all, especially after I've encountered the disadvantages of using S-exprs. I'm still happy with the decision though, and it does give Cakelisp a novel and distinguishing characteristic from the many …</p></article></div>

<p>The Apple M1 available in the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 13”, and Mac Mini has
been the focus of a ton of benchmarking writeups and blog posts about
the new chip. The performance overall, and especially performance/watt,
that Apple has achieved with the chip is very impressive.
As a ray tracing person, what caught my eye the most was the
performance AnandTech reported in their
<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested/2">CineBench benchmarks</a>.
These scores were 1.6x higher than I got on my old Haswell desktop and 2x
higher than my new Tiger Lake laptop!
I had also been interested in trying out the new
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10012/">ray tracing API for Metal</a>
that was announced at WWDC this year,
which bears some resemblance to the DirectX, Vulkan, and OptiX GPU ray tracing APIs.
So, I decided to pick up a Mac Mini to do some testing
on my own interactive path tracing project,
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT">ChameleonRT</a>,
and to get it running on the new Metal ray tracing API.
In this post, we’ll take a look at the new Metal ray tracing
API to see how it lines up with DirectX, Vulkan, OptiX and Embree,
then we’ll make some fair (and some extremely unfair) ray tracing
performance comparisons against the M1.</p>

<!--more-->



<p><a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT">ChameleonRT</a> is an open source
interactive path tracer that I’ve been working on to learn the different ray tracing APIs,
and to provide an example or starting point for myself and others working with them
in other projects.
ChameleonRT provides backends for the GPU ray tracing APIs:
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/dxr">DirectX Ray Tracing</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/vulkan">Vulkan KHR Ray Tracing</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/optix">OptiX 7</a>.
Through the work discussed in this post, it also has a new
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/metal">Metal</a> GPU backend.
ChameleonRT also has an <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/embree">Embree backend</a>
for fast multi-threaded and SIMD accelerated ray tracing on CPUs through
<a href="https://www.embree.org/">Embree</a>, <a href="https://ispc.github.io/">ISPC</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB">TBB</a>.
The rendering code in each backend is nearly identical and they produce almost pixel exact outputs,
with some possible small differences due to subtle differences in the ray tracing
libraries or shader languages.</p>

<p>ChameleonRT is different from popular ray tracing benchmark applications like
<a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/cinebench">CineBench</a>, <a href="http://www.luxmark.info/">LuxMark</a>,
and <a href="https://opendata.blender.org/">Blender Benchmark</a>, in that ChameleonRT is
a minimal interactive path tracer. CineBench, LuxMark, and Blender Benchmark are excellent
for getting a full picture of what performance to expect from a production film
renderer, as they are production renderers. However, there’s a lot more going
on in a production renderer than just ray tracing to support the kind of complex
geometries, materials, and effects used in film; and the large code
bases can be challenging to quickly port to a new architecture or API.
ChameleonRT is the exact opposite, supporting just one geometry type,
triangle meshes, and one material type, the Disney BRDF.
The rest of the code is similarly written to achieve interactive path tracing performance,
though I have tried to balance this with how complex the code is to read.
For example, the renderers use iterative ray tracing instead of recursion,
support only a simple sampling strategy, and don’t support alpha cut-out effects.
The use of iterative ray tracing is valuable on both the CPU and GPU, but is
especially important on the GPU, as the
overhead of recursive ray tracing calls in the pipeline can have a significant performance impact.
Similarly, ignoring alpha cut-out effects allows the GPU renderers
to skip using an any hit shader (and the Embree on to skip needing an intersection
filter). The any hit shader (or intersection filter) would be called during
BVH traversal after a candidate intersection with a triangle is found.
In the case that the BVH traversal is hardware accelerated, this ends up
producing a lot amount of back and
forth between the fixed function traversal hardware and the shader cores to run the any hit
shader during traversal, limiting the hardware’s performance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s a path tracer? Path tracing is a technique in computer graphics for
rendering photo-realistic images by simulating the light transport in
the scene. It is a Monte Carlo technique, meaning that it randomly samples
light paths emitted from lights in the scene that reach the camera
by bouncing off objects in the scene. This is done by tracing the paths in reverse,
starting from the camera and tracing the path back through the scene.
A large number of light paths need to be sampled to produce a noise-free
image. Path tracing is not restricted to photo-realism, and is the
core rendering algorithm used in major film renderers, such as: Pixar’s Renderman,
Disney’s Hyperion, Autodesk’s Arnold, and Weta’s Manuka.
See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing">Wikipedia</a> for more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The new ray tracing API in Metal will be familiar to those who’ve used inline ray
tracing in DirectX or Vulkan. For a good introduction to Metal’s API, check out the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10012/">Discover ray tracing
with Metal</a> video from WWDC 2020,
and the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/accelerating_ray_tracing_using_metal?language=objc">accompanying sample</a>.
Inline ray tracing allows applications to make ray tracing calls in any shader stage,
e.g., fragment/pixel shaders, vertex shaders, compute shaders, etc.
Inline ray tracing allows ray tracing effects, for example accurate reflections and shadows,
to be integrated into the regular rasterization pipeline.
Inline ray tracing can also be used from a compute shader to implement a standalone
path tracing based renderer. ChameleonRT is a standalone path tracer, and takes
the compute shader approach for Metal.</p>

<p>At a high-level, ray tracing in Metal proceeds as follows: you upload your
geometry data, build bottom-level primitive acceleration structures over them, then create instances
referencing those acceleration structures and build a top-level acceleration structure over
the instances.
To render the scene you dispatch a compute shader and trace rays against the top-level
acceleration structure to get back intersection results. The intersection results provide
you with the intersected primitive and geometry IDs, and if using instancing, the instance ID.
Your shader can then look up the geometry data for the object that was hit and shade it,
after which it can continue tracing the path.</p>

<p>At this time Metal only supports inline ray tracing, in contrast to DirectX and Vulkan, which
also provide support for ray tracing pipelines. Ray tracing pipelines are used
to implement standalone ray tracing renderers, and is the approach ChameleonRT
uses in its DirectX and Vulkan backends.
OptiX only supports ray tracing pipelines.
Ray tracing pipelines require the creation of a Shader Binding Table to
provide the API with a table of functions to call when specific objects
in the scene are intersected. The SBT can be difficult to setup and debug,
and is a common point of difficulty for developers learning these APIs.
For more information about the SBT, check out my post
<a href="https://www.willusher.io/graphics/2019/11/20/the-sbt-three-ways">“The RTX Shader Binding Table Three Ways”</a>.
However, the potential benefit of the SBT is that the GPU can reorder or group function
calls to reduce thread divergence. With inline ray tracing, the developer
must do this themselves, or do without
(check out another video from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10013/">WWDC20</a>
for information here).
Right now, ChameleonRT does not do any reordering to reduce divergence.</p>

<p>Those familiar with Metal may know of the previous
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders/metal_for_accelerating_ray_tracing?language=objc">Metal Performance Shaders ray intersector</a>.
The new support for inline ray tracing improves on this by allowing the renderer
to move entirely to the GPU. The previous ray intersector worked by taking
batches of rays, finding intersections in the scene, and writing these results
back out to memory. Multiple compute shaders would need to be dispatched to
trace the primary rays and create shadow and secondary rays, then trace the shadow rays
and continue the secondary rays while filtering out paths that terminated.
This requires significantly more memory traffic and compute dispatches, introducing overhead
to the renderer. Such an approach is also not well suited to augmenting traditional
rasterization pipelines with ray tracing effects.
Approaches based on tracing and sorting rays and intersection information to extract
coherence are valuable for complex film renderers, and can be implemented efficiently using inline
ray tracing as well.
For example, <a href="https://www.yiningkarlli.com/projects/hyperiondesign.html">Disney’s Hyperion renderer</a>
uses sorting and batching extensively to
extract coherent workloads from an otherwise incoherent and divergent distribution of rays.
There’s also an excellent higher-level <a href="https://youtu.be/frLwRLS_ZR0">video</a> explaining how this
works.</p>

<p>The Metal ray tracing API is quite nice to work with.
It bears a lot of similarity to the other ray tracing APIs, but has been streamlined
to be easier to use.
For example, compare the code required to build and compact a BVH in
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/dxr/dxr_utils.cpp#L877-L977">DirectX</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/vulkan/vulkanrt_utils.cpp#L46-L214">Vulkan</a>
with <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/metal/metalrt_utils.mm#L318-L396">Metal</a>.
OptiX’s API provides a similar simplification, here’s the
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/optix/optix_utils.cpp#L183-L244">BVH build in OptiX</a>
for reference.
It’s also nice to have templates and C++ style functionality in the shader language,
a feature Metal shares with OptiX, which uses CUDA for the device side code.</p>

<p>This simplicity also has some drawbacks. For example, while in DirectX, Vulkan, and OptiX
you have control over where the acceleration structure memory is allocated,
Metal makes this allocation for you. As a result, you cannot allocate the acceleration
structures on a <code>MTLHeap</code>, and so to make sure they’re available for your rendering
pipeline, you must individually mark them as used in a loop instead of a single <code>useHeap</code> call.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span></span><span>// Use our top level acceleration structure</span>
<span>[</span><span>command_encoder</span> <span>setAccelerationStructure</span><span>:</span><span>bvh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bvh</span> <span>atBufferIndex</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>
<span>// Also mark all mesh acceleration structures used, as they're indirectly</span>
<span>// referenced by the top level one</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>auto</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mesh</span> <span>:</span> <span>bvh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>meshes</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>command_encoder</span> <span>useResource</span><span>:</span><span>mesh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bvh</span> <span>usage</span><span>:</span><span>MTLResourceUsageRead</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This can add some overhead if you have a lot of bottom level BVHs, as can be the
case in scenes with many instances.
It’d be nice to be able to allocate the acceleration structures on a heap, and replace this loop
with a single <code>[command_encoder useHeap:data_heap-&gt;heap];</code></p>

<p>The API is also simplified significantly by not including ray tracing pipelines and
only requiring a Shader Binding Table-esque
structure when implementing custom geometries or other operations that need
to happen …</p></div></div></div>

For a local installation, supply instead of "pil" the actual path like "./pil"
or "../pil21/pil".

The pieces are indicated by the letters 'K'ing, 'Q'ueen, 'R'ook, 'B'ishop,
k'N'ight and 'P'awn, with black pieces in angular brackets.

You can enter your moves with the field names (in lower case) for the "from" and
"to" positions:

: (go e2 e4)

Castling may be entered by just specifying the king's move:

: (go e1 g1)

To promote a pawn to some piece other than a queen, you can specify a class:

: (go h7 h8 +Knight)

To undo one or several moves, enter

: (go -)

and to redo them

: (go +)

To switch sides (and have the computer play against itself), call 'go' without
arguments:

: (go)

The initial board position can be restored with

: (main)

The global variable '*Depth' holds the maximal depth of the alpha-beta tree
search. It defaults to 5. You may change it to some smaller value for a faster
response, or to a larger value for a deeper search:

: (setq *Depth 7)

The same effect can be achieved by passing the desired depth as the first
argument to 'main':

: (main 7)

The second (optional) argument to 'main' is your color ('NIL' for white and 'T'
for black).

To setup some given board position, call 'main' with a list of triples, with
each describing:

   1. The field
   2. The piece's classes
   3. An optional flag to indicate that the piece did not move yet

: (main 5 NIL

      (a2 (+White +Pawn) T)
      (b1 (+White +King))
      (d4 (+Black +King)) ) )

At any time, you can print the current board position in the above format to a
file with

: (ppos "file")

which later can be restored with

: (load "file")


   === PilBox and Web App ===

If you have the PilBox App installed on your Android device, just type "chess"
in the settings and press the "Download" button.

To start the Web application, use

   $ pil chess/main.l -chess~main -go +

Alternatively, you can start it with German localization as

   $ pil chess/main.l -'chess~main "DE" "de"' -go +

then point your browser to http://localhost:8080

In both cases you can interact with the chess board in this way:

   â€” To enter a move, drag a piece to the new field.
   â€” A click on the board does an auto-move and then switches sides.
   â€” The search depth can be changed with a drop-down menu.
   â€” The "New" button starts a new game, and the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons
     navigate in the history.
   â€” The text "White" or "Black" indicate who is to move next. It changes to
     "White ..." or "Black ..." while the computer is thinking.
   â€” After a move, the moved piece and the old and new positions are indicated
     above that text.

The "Setup" button switches to edit mode and allows you to change the position
manually:

   â€” A click on a piece removes it from the board.
   â€” Dragging a piece moves it to another field.
   â€” A new piece can be placed on the board by dragging it from the setup area.
   â€” The "Clear" button removes all pieces from the board.
   â€” The "New" button sets up all pieces for a new game.
   â€” The "Game" button switches back to play mode.

As in any PilBox app, you can go to the settings (wheel icon on top right) and

   â€” switch to another language in the "Language" tab or
   â€” view the App's source code by clicking on the app name "chess" in the
     "PILs" tab.

                            <p>In May 2020, Riverlane revealed that they will lead a consortium which has been <a href="https://www.riverlane.com/news/2020/05/uk-companies-to-build-radically-new-operating-system-for-quantum-computers/">awarded a £7.6m grant to build a radically new operating system</a> for quantum computers. We marked a ‘hello world’ moment in September, with the first <a href="https://www.riverlane.com/news/2020/09/commercial-breakthrough-following-success-of-deltaflow-os-trials/">successful trials of Deltaflow.OS</a>, using quantum hardware belonging to leading trapped-ion company, <a href="https://www.oxionics.com/">Oxford Ionics</a>.</p>
<p>The latest milestone is the public release of the first version of Deltaflow.OS; ‘Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ’. The product has been built to enable quantum hardware companies as well as algorithm and app developers to accelerate their research by making collaboration easier and reduce down-time in labs. This version uses simulated hardware and <a href="http://m-labs.hk/experiment-control/artiq/">ARTIQ</a> as a backend. ARTIQ is a control system which is widely used in the trapped-ion community.</p>
<p>Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ consists of the Deltaflow language (Deltalanguage), and various hardware models on which the language can be run, including an emulator of the ARTIQ control system. The Deltalanguage lets users define a graph of different hardware nodes corresponding to the type of hardware elements found in labs. After defining a programme, users can test it on increasingly realistic hardware models.</p>
<p>Robert Jördens of M-Labs commented, “My hands are twitching because I really want to see and try that&nbsp;emulator and Deltaflow. There are so many valuable pieces in there.”</p>
<p>A first <a href="https://vimeo.com/480247763/d8fd4a0708">public demonstration of Deltaflow.OS</a> took place at the virtual National Quantum Technologies Showcase on 6 November 2020, where the team demonstrated how a Rabi-Oscillation would be performed.</p>
<p>The release of Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ marks a significant step towards Riverlane’s mission to build a quantum operating system that is high performance, portable across all qubit technologies and scalable to millions of qubits.</p>

For some systems, this longer startup time can be mitigated by never fully shutting down, and relying on sleep modes to reduce power consumption when the system is not in use. However for some systems, such as non-battery-backed devices where each usage requires a full power-on sequence, it is important that the cold power-on time is minimised.</p><p>As is often the case with complex systems, slow boot speed is generally not caused by one single issue, but rather a large collection of smaller factors. Following that, we find that fast overall startup time tends to be achieved as the result of the culmination of say 10 to 20 minor improvements.</p><p>When looking at startup time, we typically break the boot time of a Linux system down into three broad stages:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Power-on to Linux kernel load. This is typically referred to as the bootloader, but on some systems this can be entirely performed by the boot ROM. This phase starts when power is applied to the system, and is finished when the Linux kernel has been loaded from non-volatile storage into RAM.</p></li><li><p>Linux boot. This covers the time it takes the Linux kernel to unpack itself and initialise sufficient hardware to mount a root filesystem and begin executing application (userspace) software.</p></li><li><p>Application startup. This phase covers not just the start of the final application itself, but also all of the dependencies it might have - such as mounting filesystems, initialising network interfaces, performing any pre-run checks and so on.</p></li></ol><p>Before attempting any improvements, it is important to analyse the existing system to determine the baseline boot speed. </p><p>For some systems this can be done by simply monitoring the console output, however this has two drawbacks - it cannot capture any time taken before the serial port is initialised, and as the serial port is often one of the slowest peripherals, outputting to it will actually slow the boot down. For these reasons, it is often good to instrument some lower level timing mechanisms. The simplest is to use spare GPIO pins, toggling them at various stages in the boot. Monitoring these signals on an oscilloscope can produce highly accurate timing without interfering with the boot itself. This kind of system can also be left enabled in the production software to make regression testing of boot speed easier (or even automated).</p><p>Once a baseline has been established, various techniques can then be used to begin making improvements. There are far more of these techniques than can reasonably be covered here, however the main areas we focus on are:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Ensuring that the initial kernel load is being performed as fast as the hardware can support. Typically backing storage systems, such as SPI, often have multiple modes or speeds. Often conservative defaults are supplied for these to ensure maximum compatibility with hardware designs. However if the particular hardware design has faster chips, this speed may not be being exploited in the default configuration.</p></li><li><p>Ensuring that busy-wait loops in the bootloader are minimised. Before Linux has started, the bootloader tends to be a much simpler, single-threaded system. This means that one operation will not be started until the previous operation has fully completed. However overlapping some operations (such as beginning kernel uncompression in parallel with loading it from storage), can provide significant gains.</p></li><li><p>Ensuring that only the drivers used on the embedded system are included in the kernel. By default Linux provides support for a massive array of hardware. For desktop environments, this is ideal as it provides maximum flexibility. However embedded systems typically have a much narrower target, and as such do not benefit from this flexibility. Reducing the drivers in the kernel will not only reduce the binary size (which makes for a faster kernel load time), it will also drop the driver initialisation code, which directly impacts boot speed.</p></li><li><p>Choosing the correct filesystem for the application. In particular, using a read-only filesystem for the core system, and using a read-write filesystem for user data. This allows for the read-write filesystem to be initialised in parallel with the application startup.</p></li><li><p>Ensuring parallel execution of application startup. This may require some rework of the application, but having a system that can cope with some subsystems not being immediately available can provide significant speedups. For instance, it may be that the user cannot save new data for the first 2-3 seconds of the application startup. However this allows other functionality to be fully available in that time, and can dramatically improve the perceived performance of the system.</p></li></ul><p>Boot speed is an issue heavily discussed online, and is constantly evolving as new hardware becomes available and new software is written. There are some excellent resources on the topic available, such as:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://elinux.org/Boot_Time" target="_blank">Embedded Linux Wiki - Boot Time</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://elinux.org/images/9/97/Boot_one_second_altenberg.pdf" target="_blank">How to boot Linux in one second</a></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div>

                Can some quick Python magic give us the edge we need in this cruel, cruel Net? You bet. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A quick overview of the minigame: You're given a square matrix and one or more sequences of hexadecimal numbers, along with a buffer of certain length. 
                Your goal is to complete the most amount of sequences choosing as many nodes as the buffer allows.
                Each sequence will advance in progress if the node chosen is the next node in the sequence.
                When the game starts, you may choose any of the values in the first row of the matrix.
                After that, the values you can choose will alternate between the Nth column/row each turn, with N being the index of the last picked value.
                If this horrible description wasn't helpful, click <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/12/14/cyberpunk-2077-hacking-minigame-breach-protocol-explained/">here</a> for a more detailed one, courtesy of RPS.

            <p>
                All valid paths are considered and the final score of each path is calculated depending on how many sequences were completed by traversing it.
                The path with the best score is then printed to screen.
                The algorithm itself isn't particularly interesting nor efficient, unfortunately. However, it should be fast enough to solve any of Cyberpunk's minigames in a few seconds, so fast enough!
                I'm sure there's some low hanging fruit that could speed up execution, but I thought I'd share what I have so far and update the post as new ideas/suggestions come up.

                The path generation is pretty similar to a DFS graph traversal. 
                The only significant difference is that the nodes accessible will vary depending on the current turn and the previous node's coordinates.

                Let's run it and check that everything is working correctly.
                While most of the breach protocol minigames have randomized values, the "Spellbound" quest involves a fixed state and the best solution is already known. Courtesy of GamerJournalist:

            <pre><code>
paths = [(path, PathScore(path, sequences, buffer_size).compute()) for path in generate_paths(buffer_size)]
max_path = max(paths, key=lambda path: path[1])
# [(0, 1), (2, 1), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 3)] -&gt; Should traverse 3rd and 4th sequences, finishes in ~3 seconds

            </code></pre>

            <p>
                Success! Out of curiosity, I thought I'd try increasing the buffer size until I could find a path which cleared all sequences. 
                Be warned though, the result might take some time to compute since it has to go through every possible path of length 11.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
buffer_size = 11
paths = [(path, PathScore(path, sequences, buffer_size).compute()) for path in generate_paths(buffer_size)]
max_path = max(paths, key=lambda path: path[1])

# [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 3), (3, 3), (3, 1), (0, 1), (0, 3), (2, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2)] -&gt; Should traverse all sequences, finishes in ~40 seconds
print(max_path[0], max_path[1])
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                OK, optimization time! We'll assume that there's at least 1 path with a non-negative score.
                That way, we can actually stop traversing a partial path if its current score (adjusted depending on buffer's size and current turn) is lower than 0.
            </p>

      <div>
        <p>In this post we'll get a basic semgrep environment set up in Docker
running some custom rules against our code.</p>
<h3 id="existing-linters">Existing linters</h3><p>Linters like <a href="https://www.pylint.org/">pylint</a> for Python or
<a href="https://eslint.org/">eslint</a> for JavaScript are great for general,
broad language standards. But what about common nits in code review
like using print statements instead of a logger, or using a defer
statement inside a for loop (Go specific), or the existence of
multiple nested loops.</p>
<p>Most developers don't have experience working with language
parsing. So it's fairly uncommon in small- and medium-sized teams to
see custom linting rules. And while no single linter or language is
that much more complex than the other (it's all just AST operations),
there is a small penalty to learning the AST and framework for each
language linter.</p>
<h3 id="semgrep">Semgrep</h3><p><a href="https://semgrep.dev/">Semgrep</a> is a generic tool for finding patterns
in source code. Unlike traditional regex (and traditional grep) it can
find recursive patterns. This makes it especially useful as a tool to
learn for finding patterns in any language.</p>
<p>An advantage of semgrep rules is that you can learn the semgrep
pattern matching syntax (which is surprisingly easy) and then you can
write rules for any language you'd like to write rules for.</p>
<p>And while the <a href="https://semgrep.dev/editor">online rule tester</a> is
awesome, I had a hard time going from that to a working sample on my
own laptop with Docker. We'll do just that.</p>
<h3 id="catching-print-statements-in-python">Catching print statements in Python</h3><p>Let's say we want a script to fail on any use of print statements in
Python:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat test/python/simple-print.py
def main():
  print("DEBUG: here")
  print("DEBUG: ", "now here")
</code></pre>
<p>The current <a href="https://semgrep.dev/editor">default example</a> shown in the
online editor happens to be for just this. Click the Advanced tab and
you'll see the following:</p>
<pre><code>rules:
- id: fail-on-print
  pattern: |
    print("...")
  message: |
    Semgrep found a match
  severity: WARNING
</code></pre>
<p>Copy this into <code>config.yml</code>. Let's modify the pattern to
warn on all print calls, not just print calls with a single string
argument:</p>
<pre><code>rules:
- id: fail-on-print
  pattern: |
    print(...)
  message: |
    Semgrep found a match
  severity: WARNING
</code></pre>
<p>The editor doesn't mention it (nor do any docs I can find) but we also
need to include two keys in the individual rule
object: <code>mode</code> and <code>languages</code>.</p>
<pre><code>rules:
- id: fail-on-print
  pattern: |
    print(...)
  message: |
    Semgrep found a match
  severity: WARNING
  mode: search
  languages: ["generic"]
</code></pre>
<p>Semgrep fails really weirdly if you set <code>mode</code> to
anything other than <code>search</code>, but it won't warn you that
what you set is garbage. The <code>languages</code> setting is
similarly fickle and doesn't give you much feedback if you set it
incorrectly.</p>
<p>
  Also, I'm using the "generic" language here because I don't
  understand the difference between languages and as far as I'm
  concerned the syntax I'm using here is already pretty generic.
</p><p>We run the semgrep Docker image:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run -v "${PWD}:/src" returntocorp/semgrep --config=config.yml test/python
A new version of Semgrep is available. Please see https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep#upgrading for more information.
running 1 rules...
test/python/simple-print.py
severity:warning rule:fail-on-print: Semgrep found a match

2:print("DEBUG: here")
ran 1 rules on 1 files: 1 findings"")
</code></pre>
<p>And there we've got our warning!</p>
<p>
  Not completely clear to me why we're getting warned about a new
  version when we've pulled <code>latest</code> as the linked docs
  suggest. Maybe there's a newer version that hasn't made it into a
  Docker image yet.
</p><h3 id="catching-fmt.print*-statements-in-go">Catching fmt.Print* statements in Go</h3><p>Let's say we also want to fail on print statements in Go (because we
should use a logger instead):</p>
<pre><code>$ cat test/golang/simple-print.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  a := fmt.Sprintf("here")
  fmt.Println(a)
  fmt.Printf("%s\n", a)
  e := fmt.Errorf("My crazy error")
}
</code></pre>
<p>We could try to look for any <code>import "fmt"</code> code in a file
but that would fail on uses of <code>fmt.Sprintf</code>
or <code>fmt.Errorf</code> which are fine. Instead we'll just focus on
uses of <code>fmt.Printf</code> or <code>fmt.Println</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat go-config.yml
rules:
- id: fail-on-print

    - pattern: fmt.Printf(...)

<p>Cool! Making some sense. Now let's try a harder pattern.</p>
<h3 id="catching-triple-nested-for-loops">Catching triple-nested for loops</h3><p>Let's try to warn on the triple-nested loop in this code:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat test/golang/loopy.go
package main

import "log"

func main() {
  doneFirst := false
  for i := 0; i &lt; 10; i++ {
    log.Print(i)

    for j := 0; j &lt; 100; j++ {
      c := i * j

      going := true

        k++
        log.Print(k)
      }
    }

    doneFirst = true
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If we want to catch the use of nested for loops here then we'll need
to search for the loops surrounded by arbitrary
syntax. Semgrep's <code>...</code> syntax makes this easy.</p>

<p>That's just swell.</p>
<h3 id="limits-of-static-analysis">Limits of static analysis</h3><p>Now let's say we refactor one of the inner loops into its own
function.</p>
<pre><code>$ cat test/golang/loopy.go
package main

import "log"

func inner(i, j int) {
  c := i * j

  going := true
  k := 0
  for going {
    if k == c {
      break
    }

    k++
    log.Print(k)
  }
}

func main() {
  doneFirst := false
  for i := 0; i &lt; 10; i++ {
    log.Print(i)

    for j := 0; j &lt; 100; j++ {
      inner(i, j)
    }

    doneFirst = true
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>And run semgrep again:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run -v "${PWD}:/src" returntocorp/semgrep --config=go-config2.yml test/golang
 A new version of Semgrep is available. Please see https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep#upgrading for more information.

</code></pre>
<p>Well great. The 3-nested loop still exists but we can't find it
anymore because it's not syntactically obvious anymore.</p>
<p>At this point we'd need to start getting into linting based on runtime
analysis. If you know of a tool that does this and lets you write
rules like semgrep for it, please tell me!</p>
<h3 id="in-summary">In summary</h3><p>In the end though, it's still very useful to be able to learn a single
language for writing syntax rules at a high level to enforce behavior
in code. Furthermore, a generic syntax matcher helps you write easily
write rules for things that don't already have linters like YAML
or JSON configuration or Vagrantfiles.</p>
<p>It can be annoying to work around some missing docs in semgrep but
overall it's a great tool for the kit.</p>

December 20, 2020 | https://filipnikolovski.com/posts/ebpf/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://filipnikolovski.com/posts/ebpf/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was doing some research at work for tracing and observability for microservices, when I came across <a href="https://pixielabs.ai/">Pixielabs</a>. This tool advertises that you can instantly troubleshoot applications without any instrumentation or special code inside the apps, which sounded ✨magical✨ to me. So naturally I wanted to know a little more about what enables this technology to work, and after scrolling through the site, under the “No Instrumentation” section was this acronym <strong>eBPF</strong>.</p><p>After some further digging on the internet, reading the <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">design papers</a> and watching several videos, it was safe to say this technology caught my attention, so I wanted to write some notes on it and I hope this post will spark some further interest in you as well.</p><h2 id="so-what-is-ebpf-exactly">So what is eBPF exactly?</h2><p>The TL;DR version is that this technology enables sandboxed user space applications to run in the Linux kernel itself. In a way it makes the kernel <em>programmable</em> which unlocks tremendous possibilities.</p><p>You can pick <strong>any function</strong> from the kernel and execute the program every time that function runs. Running a program that “attaches” to network sockets, tracepoints and perf events can be extremely useful. Developers can debug the kernel without having to re-compile it. There are plenty of use cases such as:</p><ul><li>Application performance &amp; troubleshooting</li><li>Networking &amp; security</li><li>Runtime security</li><li>Application tracing</li><li>Observability</li></ul><p>That’s what enables tools like Pixie to do blackbox analysis, without requiring any tinkering inside the applications that we’re trying to debug.</p><p>Originally BPF was <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">designed</a> for capturing and filtering network packets that matched specific rules, discarding any unwanted packets. That’s why it was called the “Berkeley Packet Filter”. If you’ve ever used <strong>tcpdump</strong> you’ve probably already used it. Nowadays eBPF can be used for many different things and not just packet filtering but the name stuck for some reason.</p><p>This architecture of network monitoring was vastly superior to the current existing packet capture technologies in terms of performance, mainly because the filtering was done in the kernel instead of copying all of the packets in user space and doing
the calculations there. But with the advancement of processors it didn’t hold up so well with it’s initial design. That’s why the <strong>extended BPF</strong> (eBPF) design was introduced, to take advantage of the modern processing power.</p><p>Initially eBPF was to be also used as a network packet filtering solution, but the ability to run user-space programs inside the kernel proved to be very powerful. The new design extended what the BPF virtual machine could do, which was to allow it to run on all kinds of events, not just packets, and also do certain actions instead of just the ability to filter things.</p><h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2><p>An eBPF program is just a sequence of 64-bit instructions. The virtual machine’s instruction set is fairly limited and it has two goals in mind:</p><ol><li>The code needs to be executed as fast as possible.</li><li>All BPF instructions must be verifiable at load time to ensure the safety of the kernel.</li></ol><p>Okay so, eBPF code is run in a safe virtual machine inside the kernel. Writing these programs is done with the help of some frameworks (like <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">bcc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace">bpftrace</a>) and the program bytecode is then loaded via the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><code>bpf</code></a> system call.</p><p>To nullify the security and stability risks when running a user space program inside the kernel, several checks are performed
to ensure that the code we run is safe and that it terminates so our computer won’t freeze up.</p><p>Firstly, to even be able to run a user program which loads eBPF code, it needs root privileges to do so, unless unprivileged eBPF is enabled, in which case the process can load a program with a reduced functionality. Secondly, there’s the eBPF verifier which all eBPF programs must go through before they can be executed.</p><p>The verifier runs several checks on the code that safeguards the kernel. The first check ensures that any unbounded
loops which could freeze up the kernel are prohibited. The second check, which is more extensive, simulates the execution of the code making sure that all paths of the code run to completion, no out of bounds memory is accessed and overall the state of the virtual machine is valid.</p><p>The last step of the verification process involves restricting the eBPF program abilities, which kernel functions are callable and which data it can access. The verifier knows how to apply those restrictions because of the <strong>program type</strong>. The program type is determined when we associate the program with a certain event.</p><p>After the verification process is done, the BPF bytecode is then interpreted, or compiled by a JIT compiler, into native instructions that run efficiently whenever an event happens in the kernel.</p><h2 id="kprobes--uprobes">kprobes &amp; uprobes</h2><p>We can create and insert kernel probes or kprobes for short to virtually any function in the kernel, and attach an eBPF program so that it executes each time that function is invoked.</p><p>Here’s a simple hello world example from the <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/examples">bcc</a> repository:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> bcc <span>import</span> BPF
<span>from</span> bcc.utils <span>import</span> printb

</span><span>}
</span><span>"""</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The eBPF program is written in a pseudo-C code and it’s placed in the variable <code>prog</code> as a string. The bcc framework does all the heavy lifting of generating the bytecode, loading the programs and all that stuff, which makes writing these programs a bit easier.</p><p>In this example, the hello function invokes a bpf helper function called <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> which outputs a “Hello, World!” trace. Then we load the program and we attach a kernel probe for the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><code>clone</code></a> event, basically saying that we want to call the <code>hello</code> program each time <code>clone</code> is called.</p><p>After that the script waits for new traces to arrive, fetches the fields and prints the values to the screen.</p><p>Let’s try running it:</p><pre><code>$ sudo python3 hello-ebpf.py
TIME(s)            COMM             PID    MESSAGE
</code></pre><p>The script has successfully loaded the program and now we wait for the traces to arrive. The next thing to do is to try and invoke the <code>clone</code> syscall. We can run any command on the terminal, such as <code>ls</code> and a child process will be created. Since I had firefox running, it created some child processes in the meantime and traces started to show up:</p><pre><code>611.247475000      firefox          5378   Hello, World!
</code></pre><p>As we can see, the message “Hello, World!” is printed on the screen along with the other trace fields. Super cool!</p><p>Besides attaching to kernel functions, we could also observe functions invoked in user space, such as <strong>malloc</strong> or <strong>strlen</strong>. This is possible via another Linux kernel feature - <strong>uprobes</strong>.</p><p>Here’s an interesting script that counts frequencies of strings by tracing strlen() and using a hash map to store the strings along with the count of their recurrence: <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/tracing/strlen_count.py">https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/tracing/strlen_count.py</a></p><h2 id="helper-functions">helper functions</h2><p>Since arbitrary kernel functions are prohibited to be called by ebpf programs, there are several helper functions which the kernel provides for us, such as the <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> function. We can use them to:</p><ul><li>Get the current time</li><li>Interact with eBPF maps</li><li>Manipulate network packets</li><li>Print debugging messages</li></ul><p>Note that each program can only use a subset of these helpers because of the different contexts the programs can run in. Here’s the extensive <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bpf-helpers.7.html">list</a> of bpf helpers.</p><h2 id="map-storage">map storage</h2><p>To write more complicated programs you’ll need some type of data store, and that is where <strong>maps</strong> come in. They are an important part of the BPF internal system, which allows programs to store information that can be accessed from userspace.</p><p>BPF supports different <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#maps">types</a> of data stores - you can use a hash map, an array, or even a stack or a queue, depending on the use case of course.</p><h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2><p>eBPF opens up all kinds of possibilities for observability. You can treat a system as a blackbox, without really knowing anything about it, and run all kinds of interesting analysis: count the most frequently called functions, trace network packets, do performance tracing and debugging, etc.</p><p>There are a myriad of tools that you can use to observe every component of the system: the CPU, memory, file system, networking, containers, applications…</p><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b19abde4b1ccfe4ce140969c8bf44f39d1c2fe70/f9ed3/images/ebpf/bcc_tracing_tools_early2019.png" alt="ebpf-tracing-tools"><figcaption>BCC performance tools (courtesy of Brendan Gregg)</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve only scratched the surface on this subject and I can’t wait to learn more about it, as well as Linux performance in general.

<div>


<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>China has received abundant ridicule for its role in Covid-19, from its <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/82574e3d-1633-48ad-8afb-71ebb3fe3dee" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>early negligence</span></a>, to its <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/05/china-global-influence-who-united-states/611227/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>influence</span></a> over the World Health Organization, to its <a href="https://time.com/5796425/china-coronavirus-lockdown/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>draconian measures</span></a> to control the virus. Part of the negative perception in the West was an assumption that reporting on Covid cases and deaths within China was not to be trusted — just as the Chinese political system had failed to acknowledge the emergence of the virus, surely the government would use its extensive societal control to downplay the disease’s impacts within China.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<div><p>Months later, however, the evidence suggests that China indeed succeeded in controlling the virus. While many advanced Western democracies <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>continue to flounder</span></a>, China is almost entirely open, with kids in school, families traveling, and economic growth returning to normal. This week, The Factual used 30 articles from 20 sources across the political spectrum to explore how China achieved this outcome, whether official data for China can be trusted, and what this apparent success portends.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LhbaqO6B3R89g-SeB_4ce3UsWk3ZyK_XDD2KnfJImK5eO-ZEXwgr-B2xihV_cIVrJKPiIETuD34ZBAZnUHLFzK06JxqbxYFYTyiVV_o8drZB5GxnhDpA5YAHPi8GpvRwGIjujqeq" width="624" height="417"></p>
<div><p>Note: China’s case count is imperceptible in comparison to the U.S., EU, and UK counts. (U.S. population = 328 million; EU population = 446 million; UK population = 67 million; China population = 1.39 billion)<br>Source: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Our World in Data</span></a></p></div>
<h4><strong>By Controlling Its Population, China Controlled The Virus</strong></h4>
<p>As Wuhan experienced the first severe urban outbreak of Covid-19, media attention focused on the dystopian elements of China’s response. Citizens were locked in their residences, <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/02/how-china-is-using-drones-to-contain-the-coronavirus.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>drones</span></a> played out public health warnings, and government entities assumed responsibility for the delivery of necessities to citizens. But these responses were part of one of the world’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/world/asia/china-covid-coronavirus.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>most effective</span></a> Covid-19 interventions.</p>
<div><p>On April 7, as case counts and deaths climbed around the world, China reported its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/04/07/china-heavily-criticized-for-its-coronavirus-numbers-claims-no-new-deaths/?sh=3ba3b7ae77ad" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>first day without a Covid-19 fatality</span></a>. By that point, Wuhan — the epicenter of the disease — had only reported two new cases in the prior week. The Chinese government, learning rapidly, exercised its societal control to avoid similar outbreaks in other cities. Today, China’s official statistics show a total of around 90,000 cases and less than 5,000 deaths. By contrast, the U.S. has officially registered 17 million cases, almost 190 times more than China, despite having just a quarter of China’s population.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/38aoRz3ugRGds0xMtDZjr8SoGZWFX_9peIj-dXLtJvgvahsA-Y8KoY4DiwyHd81_WfSLm8RVdfhe-2wKl4KWJTzXuGcud5fs0T-L_xtQ5xOk1XTAkdpEJzCCgz7iQnscB3RZc6Qg" width="676"></p>

<p>At the most extreme, China’s interventions involved <a href="https://reason.com/2020/03/30/the-world-must-not-mimic-chinas-authoritarian-model-to-fight-covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>intensive restrictions</span></a> on the movement of citizens on as many as <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/china-didnt-stop-virus-cold-outside-wuhan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>750 million people</span></a>. However, since the intense first weeks, the measures have seemed comparatively less extreme, relying mostly on the routine monitoring of citizens. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/covid-19-runs-riot-across-world-china-controls-pandemic-n1246587" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>These measures</span></a> include “color-coded designations based on a person’s health status,” widespread testing, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/08/17/how-china-controlled-the-coronavirus" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>routine temperature taking</span></a>, and careful monitoring of people entering the country — now seen as the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/10/16/924382187/city-in-china-tests-10-million-people-after-13-covid-19-cases-are-found" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>primary source</span></a> of most new cases in China. Mask wearing was compulsory, though such orders have largely been lifted now.</p>
<p>New cases are comprehensively attacked through a combination of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/nov/23/china-tests-millions-after-coronavirus-flare-ups-i/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>testing</span></a>, contact tracing, and quarantines. For example, in October in the port city of Qingdao, the emergence of a handful of new cases led local authorities to conduct over <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-testing-qingdao-city-9-million-after-12-cases-hospital-2020-10" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>9 million tests</span></a> in the course of five days, ultimately identifying around a dozen cases. Similarly, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2020/11/23/china-launches-mass-testing-in-three-cities-chaotic-scenes-follow-at-shanghai-airport/?sh=783168a93ede" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>a video emerged</span></a> in Western media in November of a confrontation between workers in a Shanghai airport and hazmat-wearing government officials. It was later revealed that, upon learning of a potential case, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tianjin-shanghai-coronavirus-pandemic-china-united-states-8d46e90bc0a3b75c1b5a66c196e45025" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>17,719 workers were tested</span></a> to locate a single positive case.</p>
<div><p>While it’s easy to see China’s purported success in controlling the virus as solely the result of the government’s active measures, citizen compliance and appreciation for science and health messaging has also likely <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/covid-19-runs-riot-across-world-china-controls-pandemic-n1246587" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>played a consequential role</span></a>, as has the clarity and consistency of official messaging and pre-existing proclivities toward mask usage. There has not been similar skepticism toward virus mitigation efforts nor a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/world/asia/china-covid-coronavirus.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>politicization of the pandemic</span></a>, as seen in Western democracies. High levels of compliance meshed with government action to bring about what is likely one of the fullest and fastest recoveries anywhere in the world.</p></div>
<h4><strong>Can China’s Numbers Be Trusted?</strong></h4>
<p>Skepticism of China’s handling of Covid-19 has been consistent, and it’s no surprise that many also doubt the official tallies of cases and deaths. Already receiving flak as the origin of the virus and for a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/82574e3d-1633-48ad-8afb-71ebb3fe3dee" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>failure to contain its spread early</span></a>, China has much to gain from positive press, meaning that “conquering” the virus would be the beginning of a much-needed win. But while this nominally gives China a motivation to underreport cases and deaths, and it by many accounts has much of the control needed to do so (consider China's <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/leaked-documents-show-how-chinas-army-of-paid-internet-trolls-helped-censor-the-coronavirus" rel="noopener">extensive censorship efforts</a> early on), there is no evidence that it is hiding significant numbers of either — at least not at a magnitude that would alter its narrative of success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critics point to a number of choices and anecdotes to substantiate the claim that China is obfuscating the real extent of the virus within its borders. For example, China has altered its definition of a confirmed case <a href="https://time.com/5813628/china-coronavirus-statistics-wuhan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>numerous times</span></a> over the course of the pandemic and made the choice not to include asymptomatic cases in the official tally, moves that some argue are aimed at limiting the official extent of the virus. However, others have pointed out that some of these redefinitions <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/06/the-china-syndrome-part-iv-did-china-fudge-its-data/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>have resulted</span></a> in case counts being revised upward as well as downward and that some changes in definition are expected, given the novelty of the virus. Furthermore, the decision to exclude asymptomatic cases, while perhaps counterintuitive, has been both ridiculed and defended by experts as a plausible epidemiological choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, the anecdotes used to suggest significantly worse outcomes in China do not hold up to scrutiny. For example, one such popular story from Wuhan suggested that crematoriums were <a href="https://time.com/5813628/china-coronavirus-statistics-wuhan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>distributing huge numbers of burial urns</span></a> during the worst part of Wuhan’s outbreak, and extrapolations were made to suggest that many times more people were dying. Further scrutiny, however, suggests that such evidence is rather <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/06/the-china-syndrome-part-iv-did-china-fudge-its-data/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>flimsy</span></a>, and while we can’t be sure just how many people died in the worst days in Wuhan, there’s scant evidence to suggest that there’s been any coordinated coverup of a large number of cases and deaths.</p>
<div><p>Quite plainly, if China was trying to hold back more severe outbreaks or impacts, Chinese society would not be so <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/covid-19-runs-riot-across-world-china-controls-pandemic-n1246587" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>obviously recovering</span></a>, with 240 million students in school and 637 million Chinese <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/china-attractions-630-million-people-travel-during-golden-week.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>travelling in the first week of October</span></a> for the mid-autumn festival, not far behind the 782 million that travelled during the same period in 2019. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/08/17/how-china-controlled-the-coronavirus" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Full flights</span></a>, classrooms, and events returned fairly quickly to China, with authorities gathering that the risk was sufficiently low in many areas. And while China has first-rate censorship capabilities and enormous influence on the behavior of citizens, it lacks the ability to cover up or hide a serious crisis on the scale of Covid-19 outbreaks. People would be <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/06/the-china-syndrome-part-iv-did-china-fudge-its-data/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>documenting, discussing, and sharing</span></a> the events the same way they were able to in Wuhan at the onset of the pandemic — from watching out for family, friends, and neighbors, to recording videos of government officials, to noticing the construction of new <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-china-can-build-a-coronavirus-hospital-in-10-days-11580397751" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Covid-specific hospitals</span></a>. The Chinese government knows its strengths, but probably also its limitations, and seems to understand that containing the actual virus is far more beneficial and feasible than containing information about its spread.&nbsp;</p></div>
<h4><strong>China’s Wins</strong></h4>
<div><p>Given what we know about the virus in China, the evidence suggests that the country really has Covid-19 under control, that the Chinese government has strategies that effectively and comprehensively keep it at bay, and that the reported numbers of cases and deaths are likely not hugely different from what has been officially reported. Western media has at times been distracted by China’s behavior in the first weeks of the pandemic, allowing those decisions to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/11/china-coronavirus-covid-19-medical-research" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>color or even discount</span></a> what has happened since. A sober assessment now reveals <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/world/asia/china-xinjiang-covid.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>heavy-handed</span></a> but exceedingly effective management of the virus on a scale likely impossible anywhere else in the world.</p></div>

<p>While questions are still being asked about China’s early role in the virus’s spread, attention must also be paid to what this apparent success means for China. Economically, it has managed a rapid recovery, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-gdp/chinas-economic-recovery-quickens-as-consumption-returns-idUSKBN27404Z" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>growing by 4.9%</span></a> between July and September and profiting handsomely from a world stuck at home and dependent Chinese goods. In terms of global health, its success in managing the virus has allowed it to engage in <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/global-push-covid-19-vaccines-china-aims-win-friends-and-cut-deals" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>vaccine diplomacy</span></a> (rather than vaccine nationalism), helping develop and disseminate vaccines in close collaboration with other countries. And internally, some surveys show Chinese citizens indicating <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/23/913650298/as-u-s-views-of-china-grow-more-negative-chinese-support-for-their-government-ri" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>more faith in the Chinese government,</span></a> especially in contrast to the dawdling responses seen elsewhere around the world. At least internally, China’s pandemic successes seem to be quickly outweighing the costs of its mistakes.</p>
<div><p>To assume that China has been similarly afflicted by the virus as other advanced countries and has simply hidden the truth would be to ignore the fundamental differences in pandemic response and government that many so keenly point out. All things considered, China’s experience with Covid-19 first reflects its weaknesses, in the hiding of the initial outbreak, but then demonstrates its <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/china-didnt-stop-virus-cold-outside-wuhan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>strengths</span></a>, through intense control and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/10/us-has-absolutely-no-control-over-coronavirus-china-is-top-tiniest-risks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>exacting management of risks</span></a>. It turns out the truth might be rather boring: China has the capacity to implement effective physical restraints to stop the virus but probably not the ability to cover up huge numbers of Covid-related deaths. In short, the story adds up.</p></div>

<h2>Why I even started working on this madness?</h2>
<p>Anyone who is working with geospatial data, will probably sometime in h/er/is career will need to aggregate data based on a common field. For a project of mine, I wanted to provide insights about neighborhoods and how they are evolving over time.</p>
<p>As I started mining the web and aggregate the data, the Least Common Multiple I could find, the foreign key for all the tables or name it however you want, was the Postcode or Postal Code or Zipcode.</p>
<p>So far so good, but when I started searching for ways to visualize the data, I quickly found out that there is not a single postcode boundary map on the web to serve my needs. If you live in the U.S. someone else has probably worked to help you. But many countries lack those data.</p>
<h2>Using Open Data to solve this problem</h2>
<p>After searching for quite a long time and writing on forums like <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/77790/postal-code-clustering-from-osm-dataf">help.openstreetmap.org</a> I started having a feeling that there is a chance that I can produce an approximate map myself using open data.</p>
<p>Below are the steps I followed to create my country’s (Greece) postcode boundary map. You can perform similar steps to produce your map.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Finding the right data</h3>
<p>OpenStreetMap dataset is huge. Even if you try to parse the whole dataset, I am sure that your PC will have a really hard time. The best thing to do when you are working for a specific country is to download a specific dataset from a website like <a href="https://www.geofabrik.de/">Geofabrik</a>.</p>
<p>Geofabrik is a company offering consulting services for OSM related projects. For our luck, they offer clean datasets for each country. <a href="https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/greece.html">Here</a> you can find the OSM data for Greece.</p>
<p>Download the latest <code>pbf</code> file and then we will continue with the next step.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is <code>pbf</code>? <code>pbf</code> is a Protocol Buffer Binary Format and is used as a more efficient alternative of XML. For more info about <code>pbf</code> and why OSM are using it read <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format">here</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Step 2: Cleaning the data</h3>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>.</span>
└── <span>[</span><span>4</span>.1G<span>]</span>  greece-latest.osm</code></pre></div>
<p>I downloaded the file, and now I have a <code>4GB</code> file, full of data. Most of them are not essential to our task, so let’s find out how we can reduce the data to the minimum.</p>
<p>For the process of pruning the dataset, there is a beautiful tool, called <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmfilter">osmfilter</a>.</p>
<p>After reading the documentation, I figured out which data was essential for producing the map, all the addresses that included a postcode. The command to keep only these data is the following</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>osmfilter greece-latest.osm --keep<span>=</span><span>"addr:postcode"</span> <span>&gt;</span> greece-post-only.osm</code></pre></div>
<p>This will take some time, so don’t worry if you cannot see anything printing for a while in the bash.</p>
<p>Now our file size went from <code>4.1GB</code> to <code>37M</code>. Now it is easier for programs like QGIS to handle our file.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>.</span>
├── <span>[</span><span>4</span>.1G<span>]</span>  greece-latest.osm
└── <span>[</span> 37M<span>]</span>  greece-post-only.osm</code></pre></div>
<p>If we want further pruning of our data, let’s keep only the nodes that have a postcode and drop ways and relations. Feel free to read OSM documentation on what do these data represent.</p>
<p>Execute the following command and let’s check the result.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>osmfilter greece-latest.osm --drop-ways --drop-relations --keep<span>=</span><span>"addr:postcode"</span> <span>&gt;</span> greece-post-only-nodes.osm</code></pre></div>
<p>Now you will see that the resulted document will be smaller (hopefully). In our case, it is <code>9MB</code> smaller than the previous one.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>.</span>
├── <span>[</span><span>4</span>.1G<span>]</span>  greece-latest.osm
├── <span>[</span> 28M<span>]</span>  greece-post-only-nodes.osm
└── <span>[</span> 37M<span>]</span>  greece-post-only.osm</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>As I imported the data in the GQIS, I found that the postcode attribute is nested inside the <code>other_tags</code> field. Find the relevant post I made <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/380685/unpacking-attributes-from-osm">at gis.stackexcange</a>, but I did not have any luck.</p>
<p>A workaround I found, is to get the data I wanted from Overpass Turbo, executing this query, and download them as GeoJSON:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>
<span>[</span>out<span>:</span>json<span>]</span><span>[</span>timeout<span>:</span><span>25</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>

<span>{</span><span>{</span>geocodeArea<span>:</span>Greece<span>}</span><span>}</span><span>-</span><span>&gt;</span><span>.</span>searchArea<span>;</span>

<span>(</span>
  
  node<span>[</span><span>"addr:postcode"</span><span>]</span><span>(</span>area<span>.</span>searchArea<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>)</span><span>;</span>

out body<span>;</span>
<span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
out skel qt<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>Step 3: Import them to QGIS</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>QGIS is a Free and Open Source Geographic Information System</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it’s time to import our data to QGIS and start playing around to create our boundary map. Not sure what QGIS is? Do not worry, I did not know anything either, but there is a ton of documentation and a lovely community ready to support you.</p>
<p>Open the QGIS app and import the file we downloaded from Overpass Turbo.</p>
<p>To import our data perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click Layer → Add Layer → Add Vector Layer</li>
<li>Then Navigate to the file you created in the previous step and select it</li>
<li>Click Add</li>
</ol>
<p>You should see a screen like the one below if everything worked right.</p>

      </picture>
      </span>
  </span>
  
    <figcaption>Our data successfully loaded.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Also, click a node and you should see in the Feature window the attribute <code>addr:postcode</code>.</p>
<p>If you wish to display a map behind to get a better feeling of your data, in the Browser panel on your left click <code>XYX tiles → OpenStreetmap</code> and voila.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Voronoi to the rescue</h3>
<p>Now that we imported the data what? We need to find an algorithm to somehow connect all these dots and occupy the space they deserve.</p>
<p>Voronoi, a Russian Mathematician, gave us a pretty elegant solution for this problem. The theory behind although technically is pretty complex, the following GIF will help you visualize what we are going to perform with the help of QGIS.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Voronoi_growth_euclidean.gif/220px-Voronoi_growth_euclidean.gif">
    <figcaption>How Voronoi works.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Read more about how Voronoi works <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">here</a> and let’s continue building this map.</p>
<p>To run the Voronoi algorithm perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the layer that contains our data</li>
<li>Click on Vector → Geometry Tools → Voronoi Polygons</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you can press <code>Run</code> immediately or you can play around with the <code>Buffer region</code> variable. <code>Buffer region</code> is explained <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/220894/what-does-buffer-mean-in-qgis-voronoi-dialog">here</a>, but also take a look at the meaning in the image below.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oYk9j.png">

</figure>
<p>Now let’s click Run and check the results (note that the process takes some time, hopefully they enable parallelization of the process in the future).</p>

</figure>
<h3>Step 5: Connecting Polygons</h3>
<p>Our polygons are ready. But many of them have the same postcode. To merge them into one polygon we will use the <code>Dissolve</code> function.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the layer that contains our Voronoi Polygons</li>
<li>Click on Vector → Geometry Tools → Dissolve</li>
<li>In the Dissolve fields select the <code>addr:postcode</code> to tell our algorithm to merge them based on the postcode attribute</li>
</ol>

      </span>
  </span>
  
    <figcaption>And now we have the polygons grouped  based on the postcode. But they overflow the land.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Step 6: Union</h3>
<p>As you can see in the picture above, our polygons are spread across the sea. To avoid that, we can import a boundary map of our country.</p>
<p>I found one map for Greece from <a href="https://geodata.gov.gr/en/dataset/op1a-anuot1kwv-ko1votntwv/resource/b387a8a0-69b9-42a4-a08b-e33136096b95">GeoData.gov</a> and imported the shapefile. This shapefile includes the boundaries for all the municipalities, but it fits our needs.</p>

<ol>
<li>Click on the layer that contains our Dissolved layer and the Country’s boundaries map</li>

<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>The results seem promising. I can see a pretty high accuracy in some areas, but unfortunately some areas with only a few nodes are not able to get represented appropriately.</p>

<p>If by any means you are someone from the QGIS or OSM community, I would appreciate your feedback on how to make the map even more accurate. Although this method worked, I feel that higher accuracy can be achieved!</p>
<p>The simplest way to achieve higher accuracy would be to generate more nodes with postcodes. If anyone knows how, please comment or reach me directly on my <a href="https://twitter.com/CostasAlexoglou">twitter</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Tesla unlocks the full range of the new 2021 Tesla Model 3 with its latest software update version 2020.48.12.1. Tesla started offering all the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/10/16/tesla-launches-the-refreshed-2021-tesla-model-3-with-range-boost/#range-boost">new Model 3 variants with range boost</a> back in October, but the cars were showing the old ranges on the center display screen.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the owners of imported Tesla Model 3 cars in Germany found out that the new versions of the car had an 82 kWh battery pack instead of the usual ~74 kWh. This discovery was posted by a German Model 3 owner on a local Tesla forum when he took the following screenshot from his vehicle registration book.</p>

<p>So, the mystery of the boosted <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a> range is solved. This has been possible due to Panasonic producing more energy-dense 2170 cells at its Gigafactory Nevada cell production plant.</p>

<p>The 2020.48.12.1 release notes state the newly extended / unlocked range as:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Range Display</strong></p><p>Your car will now display a slightly higher range to more accurately reflect the capacity of the battery.</p><cite>Get the full release notes (2020.48.12.1) at <a href="https://teslascope.com/teslapedia/software/2020.48.12.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TeslaScope.com</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>The North American reservation holders of the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/10/16/tesla-launches-the-refreshed-2021-tesla-model-3-with-range-boost/">new and refreshed Tesla Model 3</a> have not been able to verify the larger battery pack because the European owners received their deliveries first.</p>



<p>Just yesterday I was talking to several new Model 3 reservation holders from the United States, mostly from California, they are all still waiting for their deliveries. Some are hoping their cars will be delivered after Christmas.</p>



<p>The biggest beneficiary of this range boost will be the owners of the Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD, as it got a staggering +30 miles of extended range in the new 2021 Model 3 version.</p>



<p>Besides this, Tesla is soon going to release the most exciting <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/ota-updates/">software update</a> of the year, the feature-packed <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/v11-update/">firmware version v11</a>. Elon Musk had <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/11/19/elon-musk-teases-tesla-v11-holiday-season-software-release/">teased about this upcoming major software update</a> last month, V11 is most probably going to start rolling out any day now. The best thing is all Tesla owners will be getting it without spending a dime.</p>

						<p>According to <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/uarl-asf121720.php">an announcement in EurekAlert</a>!, The U.S. Army has been researching with Duke University a technological approach that uses robotics and "biohybrid" muscle elements.</p><p>Army researchers claim that robotic systems filled with muscle tissue will deliver a new level of agility and flexibility. In order to maximize efficiency, biohybrid robotics incorporates living organisms into mechanical systems. The team's first applications are legged platforms similar to the LLAMA and Marine Corps Legged Squad Support System (LS3), the legged locomotive and movement adaptation device of the Army.</p><p>"Though impressive in their own right, today's robots are deployed to serve a limited purpose then are retrieved some minutes later," said research scientist Dr. Dean Culver, "ARL wants robots to be versatile teammates capable of going anywhere soldiers can and more, adapting to the needs of any given situation." Culver added, "Organisms outperform engineered robots in so many ways. Why not use biological components to achieve those remarkable capabilities?"</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="Humanoid robot Robotis Bioloid with the hands in the air, cheering." srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@anilinverse?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Adam Lukomski</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>In addition, a separate team from Duke University will focus on the characteristics of macroscopic performance of muscles, tendons and ligaments in skiping animals using legged robots.</p><p>The muscle tissue is excellent for generating a certain mechanical strength, and its flexibility is unrivaled in today's robotic service. The research could show the bio-hybrid engineering community how to grow strong muscular tissue instead of extracting it from a trained organism in addition to providing insight into the mesomechanics that control motor protein movement.</p><p>"Muscle tissue is outstanding at producing a specific amount of mechanical power at a given moment," says Culver, "and its versatility is unrivaled in robotic actuation today."</p>

<p>It's been a decade since danah boy introduced me to the idea of "email sabbaticals." That's when you go away and turn off your email.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/12/08/i-am-offline-on-email-sabbatical-from-december-9-january-12.html">http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/12/08/i-am-offline-on-email-sabbatical-from-december-9-january-12.html</a></p>
<p>Not just setting an out-of-office message, but rather deleting all inbound mail and asking correspondents to try again after the break. In her message, boyd explains to those correspondents who know how to reach her mother that this is the only way to reach her.</p>
<p>Here's the rationale: if you allow email to pile up while you're trying to unwind, it'll take months to catch up on when you get back, and you'll immediately burn out, incinerating all the value you got out of your break.</p>
<p>What's more, you'll still fail to clear the backlog – you'll have to declare "email bankruptcy" and fail everyone who'd contacted you anyway. It's a bad deal for you <em>and</em> for the people who email you during your break.</p>
<p>Here's how boyd's email sabbaticals work: six months prior, she informs her collaborators that she'll be taking some protracted downtime; a month before she confirms her commitments to collaborators and composes a checklist to ensure that she meets them prior to departure.</p>
<p>A week in advance, she warns everyone again that she's going offline and shuttering her inboxes. Close family members and her network administrator are given instructions for reaching her while on break, but no one else is.</p>
<p>She leaves, and shuts down her email. She knows she's going to miss new, time-sensitive stuff, but makes peace with it. In return, she gets the peace of mind that comes from knowing that she's going to come home to an empty in-box.</p>
<p>At the close of business today, I'm going on email (and work) sabbatical until Jan 4, 2021. Apart from one live event (the remote Chaos Communications Congress on Dec 27) I won't be accepting emails and I won't be replying to DMs or other messages.</p>
<p><a href="https://rc3.world/">https://rc3.world/</a></p>
<p>I really, really need it.</p>
<p>Over the years, many people have expressed their admiration at my "productivity" – but the dirty secret of that productivity is that work is how I cope with stress.</p>
<p>It's not the worst problem to have: I wrote a whole novel since the crisis, while also launching four books and keeping up with my day-job at EFF.</p>
<p>But working to cope with stress has its limits. It's a good temporary fix, but it's no long-term solution.</p>
<p>For one thing, I've got a serious, untreatable, degenerating chronic pain condition, and working is how I hope with the pain, too – distraction works far better than any prescription meds for me.</p>
<p>But ignoring your body's pain signals is a dangerous tactic. It's why I'm now experiencing the worst continuous pain of my adult life (it's been a stressful year). Last week it was so bad I was walking with a cane.</p>
<p>I say all of this not to humblebrag about my commitment to my work, but rather in the interests of transparency. I'm keenly aware that we live our own blooper reels and everyone else's highlight reels.</p>
<p>I'm grateful for my work habits, truly – but they come at a really high cost, and balancing work-as-distraction and work-as-pathology is really, really hard. If you're wondering how to do what I do, have a little peek into the blooper reel, first.</p>
<p>It's been a high-stress, crazy year. We nearly went broke, then had a spectacular recovery (thank you, Kickstarter backers!), have tried our best to be good parents (with varying degrees of success). We've gone through blazing rows and many sleepless nights.</p>
<p>I've spent most of the year with sores at the corners of my mouth, which I only get under in the most extreme times of stress.</p>
<p>And we've had it <em>good</em>. We're solvent, safe, and healthy. Thinking about what this would be like if any of those changed is terrifying.</p>
<p>Hanging out with my digital community is a huge net benefit to me, but unplugging from that community is something I increasingly value as I head towards my 50th birthday next July.</p>
<p>My first digital community experience was sending IMs to other users of the timeshare mainframe we plugged into when I was six years old, in 1977, when my dad brought home an acoustic coupler and my mom found 1,000' of brown paper towel to feed into the teletype.</p>
<p>Some (most) of my life's most important relationships, friendships, and discussions have taken place over this medium, and an enormous amount of that good stuff started with a conversation with a stranger.</p>
<p>I never felt the outrage that attended the introduction of the telephone into Edwardian England: "Anyone — any wild fool off the street — could simply barge bellowing into one's office or home, preceded only by the ringing of a telephone bell."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mit.edu/hacker/part1.html">https://www.mit.edu/hacker/part1.html</a></p>
<p>For me, finding my people (and being found by them) has been the highlight of my half-century. Touring and speaking turned these digital relationships into personal ones.</p>
<p>But: moderation in all things. I'm writing four of these threads this morning, doing a couple interviews and meetings, and then putting my lid down until 2021 (save for a brief dial-in to CCC on the 27th).</p>
<p>I'm going to swim in our lovely outdoor public pool, which, thankfully, has figured out how to remain open during the pandemic. I'm going read in the backyard hammock and hike in Griffith Park.</p>
<p>I'm not going to answer – or accept – email while I'm gone.</p>
<p>And I say all of this because it's taken a decade for me to really understand what danah was getting at (she's a very smart person and I often benefit from reflecting on our conversations).</p>
<p>And also, to show you a bit of the blooper reel. Coping strategies are great and necessary, but they're no substitute for addressing the underlying problems. I'm proud of the work I do, but I'm also still learning how to do it right.</p>

<p>I'm about to go offline until 2021 and I had planned to do <em>absolutely no work of any sort</em> while on break, but I made an exception, for an exceptional opportunity: the 32nd Chaos Communications Congress, which is remote this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://rc3.world/">https://rc3.world/</a></p>
<p>CCC is – notoriously – held during Christmas week, which means that the attendees are limited to people who either care about tech policy and security more than their families, or people who can talk their families into coming along.</p>
<p>It's one of the best events I've ever attended (I brought my family along). My talk at that event, "The Coming War on General Purpose Computing," has had a long afterlife, in large part because of the kind and thoughtful reactions of the attendees.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg</a></p>
<p>I've been trying to get back ever since but haven't managed it – until this year. RC3 (the first all-remote CCC) has invited me to speak on Dec 27.</p>
<p>I'm doing two back-to-back events: a talk called "What the cyberoptimists got wrong – and what to do about it" then a "fireside chat" (a reading from my book ATTACK SURFACE followed by a Q&amp;A;).</p>
<p>They're back-to-back, starting at 10AM Pacific (7PM CET) and running to 12/9PM.</p>
<p>The tickets are currently sold out, but they've mooted releasing another block. If you're attending, I hope you'll consider tuning into my talk (and of course, as with all CCC talks, these will be online shortly thereafter for public viewing).</p>

<p>The Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers, Swissleaks, Luxembourg Leaks, the Fincen Files – the past decade has been filled with financial secrecy scandals wherein we learned how the world's worst people hide the world's dirtiest money.</p>
<p>Governments have fallen as a result of these leaks. Journalists have been murdered for reporting them, whistleblowers have been imprisoned for telling the truth. These are a high-stakes window on the corruption, self-dealing and viciousness of the 1% and their criminal pals.</p>
<p>One critical revelation is the role that "onshort-offshore" plays in money-laundering: rich countries with a reputation for a strong rule of law and good governance are the lynchpin of global financial secrecy, thanks to lax corporate enforcement.</p>
<p>Money laundering, tax-evasion, bribery and other finance crimes were only possible because places like New Zealand, the City of London, Scotland, and US tax-havens like Delaware, Nevada and Wyoming knowingly abetted them.</p>
<p>Anti-financial-secrecy campaigners have made major progress in shutting down onshore-offshore havens, and now they've scored a massive victory in the USA, with the inclusion of an anti-money-laundering amendment to the defense bill.</p>

<p>It's a must-pass bill, and there's always intense jockeying to attach other legislation to it, virtually guaranteeing its passage (this is not always a good thing: Trump wants terrible, dangerous changes to internet law included in the bill):</p>

<p>The Corporate Transparency Act requires that all US companies report their true owners to the US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (Fincen). This will make Fincen investigations vastly cheaper…and more effective.</p>
<p>It's got strong bipartisan support, and is the culmination of a decade of debate, consultation and coalition-building. It passed the House and Senate with a nominally …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page"><div id="content"><section id="primary"><main id="main" role="main"><article id="post-622"><div><p><a href="https://gnome.org/">The GNOME project</a> turned 23 this year, and despite equally persistent rumors to the contrary, it’s still alive and kicking.</p><p>Just how alive, though? All I know is this: Where the topic of GNOME’s health goes, accurate data rarely follows. Of course, there <em>is</em> data — lots of it in fact, in public source code repositories. Though flawed in many ways, it allows us to make comparisons to the past — and maybe predictions for the future: Are a few organizations carrying most of the workload, making them critical points of failure? Are new contributors able to pick up the slack from those who leave? Is the project graying (i.e. increasingly dominated by veterans)?</p><p>In one of my occasional fits of hubris, I set out to process this data to see if I could shake out anything meaningful. I’m usually fine with just satisfying my own curiosity and leaving it at that, but it’s one of those times where the results seem interesting enough for a blog post. So here we are.</p><p>I’m going to lead with the nice graphs and follow on with a <a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/2020/12/16/on-the-graying-of-gnome/#methodology">section on methodology</a>. The latter is long, boring, and mandatory reading.</p><h2 id="contributors">Active contributors</h2><h3>By generation</h3><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Active GNOME authors per year, first-year cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>The stacked histogram above shows the number of contributors who touched the project on a yearly basis. Each contributor is assigned to a generational cohort based on the year of their first contribution. The cohorts tend to shrink over time as people leave.</p><p>There’s a special “drive-by” cohort (in a fetching shade of off-white) for contributors who were only briefly involved, meaning all their activity fits in a three-month window. It’s a big group. In a typical year, it numbers 200-400 persons who were not seen before or since. Most of them contribute a single commit.</p><p>According to this, GNOME peaked at slightly above 1,400 contributors in 2010 and went into decline with the GNOME 3.0 release the following year. However, 2020 saw the most contributors in a long time, even with preliminary data — there’s still two weeks to go. Who knows if it’s an anomaly or not. It’s been an atypical year across the board.</p><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Active GNOME authors per month, first-year cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>This is the same histogram, but with per-month bins. There’s a clear periodicity caused by the semiannual release cycle. The peak month was March 2011, right before the <a href="https://www.gnome.org/press/2011/04/gnome-3-0-released-better-for-users-developers-3/">GNOME 3.0 release</a>. About 450 contributors got involved that month.</p><p>The drive-by cohort is relatively smaller on a monthly basis. This makes sense, as it has little overlap from month to month, and the per-year bins tend to add them all up.</p><h3>By affiliation</h3><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Active GNOME authors per year, top-15 domain cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>Above, the top 15 affiliations of active contributors. I’ve excluded personal accounts. This is pretty flawed (details below), but interesting nonetheless. For what it’s worth, it mostly lines up with my memory of things.</p><p>The pattern tracks well with the total despite only capturing a minority portion of it. I think this means that paid and unpaid contributions are driven by the same underlying trends, or that there’s a lot of the former hiding in the latter.</p><h2 id="commitcount">Commit count</h2><h3>By generation</h3><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Number of GNOME commits per year, first-year cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>Here I’m counting the number of commits per year in the various cohorts.</p><p>At first glance, this looks much less dire. However, note how newcomers are having a smaller impact, especially from 2014 on. And the 2018-2020 bounce is entirely due to a handful of veterans making a comeback.</p><p>Half the commits in 2020 were made by contributors who’ve been with the project for ten years or more.

It’s safe to say that GNOME is dependent on paid developers in a big way. Specifically, and to no one’s surprise, it leans heavily on Red Hat.</p><h2 id="observations">General observations</h2><p>A few observations can be made with confidence:</p><ul><li>By F/OSS standards, the project is not <em>un</em>healthy. It has hundreds of experienced and first-time contributors every year. It is well-organized and arguably well-funded compared to its peers. But:</li><li>Every metric has the project peaking around 2010.</li><li>A diminishing number of veterans is doing an increasing share of the work.</li><li>Although recruitment is stable, newcomers don’t seem to be hitting their stride in terms of commits.</li><li>Corporate sponsorship is probably necessary to keep the project going, but the field of sponsors has kept thinning.</li></ul><p>I think GNOME is addressing the risk factors competently by modernizing infrastructure (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/">Discourse</a>). This has obvious value even in the absence of quantifiable results, but it’ll be interesting to see if the effect can be measured over the next couple of years.</p><p>Diminished enthusiasm may also be due to there being fewer ways for a new contributor to make their mark or assume a role of responsibility. GNOME has become more conservative, certainly much more so than it was a decade ago in the run-up to GNOME 3. The rationale and phrasing in <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/t/new-gnome-versioning-scheme/4235">the announcement of the new versioning scheme</a> (e.g. <em>“Radical technological and design changes are too disruptive for maintainers, users, and developers”</em>) seems indicative of this trend<sup>1</sup>.</p><h2 id="methodology">Notes on methodology</h2><p>So what’s wrong with this analysis? If you’re so inclined, you can find the details under the next couple of subheadings and pass harsh, harsh judgement.</p><p>I’ve set the unscientific rigor bar high enough to hopefully yield something useful, but low enough that I could do it in my spare time and not get stuck in the dreaded state commonly known as “90% done”.</p><h3>Module selection</h3><p>I aggregated data from <a href="https://github.com/hpjansson/fornalder/blob/45d4e9703dfa1fed1f9396b2cfc6f8425fae9389/projects/gnome-repos">189 Git repositories</a>. The vast majority of these are hosted on <code>gnome.org</code>, with a handful from <code>freedesktop.org</code> and <code>github.com</code>. Commits are uniquely identified by their commit hash, meaning trivial duplicates are counted only once.</p><p>GNOME has always been a decentralized, big-tent project, so it’s not obvious how to delineate it. I’ve tried to be fair by including most of the repositories from a full meta-gnome-desktop jhbuild, including fairly low-level dependencies like Cairo, Pango, and Pipewire, as well as past, present and would-be flagship applications under the GNOME umbrella. Documentation and infrastructure is represented, as are many archived projects (e.g. ORBit2, Bonobo, Sabayon, GAL).</p><p>I was a little uncertain about what to do with X.Org and Wayland. In the end I decided to include the latter, but not the former, since Wayland has close ties to GNOME (it even references GTK+ in its TODO file), while X.Org has its roots in the much older XFree86.</p><p>Mono is another project I resisted including; its development was tangential to GNOME proper, diverging completely in the most recent decade. However, I did include GtkSharp and several GNOME-hosted C# applications common on desktops in the 2005-2010 time frame.</p><p>Since I haven’t established hard criteria for module selection, it’s subject to various biases. Older code is probably underrepresented, since providers of important functionality were more loosely attached to the project early on (e.g. GNOME Online Accounts and Telepathy got pulled in, should I have included Gaim or Pidgin too? How about XChat?).</p><p>Anyway, the list isn’t terrible, but there’s room for improvement.</p><h3>Contributor identities</h3><p>Similar studies often identify contributors by their e-mail addresses. I used full author names instead, since there’s good reason to think they’re more stable over a 20-year time span. We’re fairly consistent in spelling our own names, and we change them rarely (often never). On the other hand, e-mail addresses come and go with different hosting arrangements, employers, etc.</p><p>An added challenge with this approach is that sometimes different people have the exact same name. In practice, I’m not aware of any instances of this happening in GNOME. It seems to be rare enough that I doubt it’d introduce significant error in most projects.</p><p>I should add here that the drive-by cohort depends on a fair amount of hindsight (you never know when someone might come back with more contributions, but the likelihood drops off quickly as time passes). This means the cohorts for 2020 are preliminary. They’ll be a lot more accurate with another run late next year.</p><h3>Domain names</h3><p>I’m using e-mail domain names as a proxy for organizations in some of the graphs. This is a notoriously unreliable approach for at least three reasons:</p><ol><li>Contributors often use personal e-mail addresses for paid work, leading to significant undercounting in general.</li><li>Specific companies may require their employees (or ask them nicely) to use company e-mail for collaboration. Out of the listed companies, I know of at least one that definitely did this. However, there are many that don’t, and these will be comparatively less well represented.</li><li>The mapping between DNS and organizations isn’t one-to-one. A company may operate under multiple names or TLDs (e.g. <code>.co.uk</code> and <code>.com</code>).</li></ol><p>Despite these weaknesses, it’s common to slice the data this way. It’s difficult to do better without access to semi-closed data troves, and depending on your views on privacy and ability to handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">PII</a> safely, it might not be something you’d want to get into anyway. But I bet you’d be well-positioned for it if you were, say, the corporate owner of both LinkedIn and GitHub.</p><p>When grouping by organization, the goal is to get an idea of which outside entities are sponsoring contributions.

Analogously, the appearance of parasitic gaps in domains relatively inaccessible to ordinary extraction is not quite equivalent to nondistinctness in the sense of distinctive feature theory.
So far, any associated supporting element appears to correlate rather closely with the ultimate standard that determines the accuracy of any proposed grammar.
By combining adjunctions and certain deformations, a subset of English sentences interesting on quite independent grounds is to be regarded as a general convention regarding the forms of the grammar.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	

	<p>ClickHouse is a polyglot database that can talk to many external systems using dedicated engines or table functions. In modern cloud systems, the most important external system is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">object storage</a>. First, it can hold raw data to import from or export to other systems (aka a data lake). Second, it can offer cheap and highly durable storage for table data. ClickHouse now supports both of these uses for S3 compatible object storage.</p><p>The first attempts to marry ClickHouse and object storage were merged more than a year ago. Since then object storage support has evolved considerably. In addition to the basic import/export functionality, ClickHouse can use object storage for MergeTree table data. While this functionality is still experimental, it has already attracted a lot of attention at meetups and webinars. In this article, we will explain how the integration works.</p><p><h2 id="h-s3-table-function">S3 table function</h2>
</p><p>ClickHouse has a powerful method to integrate with external systems called ‘table functions’. Table functions allow users to export/import data into other sources, and there are plenty of sources available, e.g. MySQL Server, ODBC or JDBC connection, file, url, and, lately, S3-compatible storage. At the time of writing the s3 table function is not in <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/table-functions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the official list</a>, but it should be fixed soon. The basic syntax is the following:</p><p><code>s3(path, [aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key,] format,</code>  <code>structure, [compression])</code></p><p>Input parameters</p><div><ul>
<li><code>path</code> — bucket url. Path to file.&nbsp; Supports following wildcards in readonly mode: *, ?, {abc,def} and {N..M} where N, M — numbers, `’abc’, ‘def’ — strings.</li>
<li><code>format</code> — The <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/interfaces/formats/#formats" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">format</a> of the data.</li>
<li><code>structure</code> — Structure of the table. Format ‘column1_name column1_type, column2_name column2_type, …’.</li>
<li><code>compression</code> parameter is optional, currently ‘gzip’ is the only option but other methods are being added.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><pre><code>INSERT INTO tripdata
SELECT *
FROM s3('https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/altinity-clickhouse-data/nyc_taxi_rides/data/tripdata/data-20*.csv.gz',&nbsp;
'CSVWithNames',&nbsp;
'pickup_date Date, id UInt64, vendor_id String, tpep_pickup_datetime DateTime, tpep_dropoff_datetime DateTime, passenger_count UInt8, trip_distance Float32, pickup_longitude Float32, pickup_latitude Float32, rate_code_id String, store_and_fwd_flag String, dropoff_longitude Float32, dropoff_latitude Float32, payment_type LowCardinality(String), fare_amount Float32, extra String, mta_tax Float32, tip_amount Float32, tolls_amount Float32, improvement_surcharge Float32, total_amount Float32, pickup_location_id UInt16, dropoff_location_id UInt16, junk1 String, junk2 String',&nbsp;
'gzip');

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 238.439 sec. Processed 1.31 billion rows, 167.39 GB (5.50 million rows/s., 702.03 MB/s.)</code></pre>
</div><p>Note the wildcards! They allow you to import multiple files in a single function call. For example, our favorite <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NYC taxi trips dataset</a> that is stored in one file per month can be imported with a single SQL command:</p><p><strong>On an Altinity.Cloud ClickHouse instance it takes me less than 4 minutes to import a 1.3B rows dataset!</strong></p><p>A few important hints:</p><div><ul>
<li>As of the 20.10 ClickHouse version, wildcard paths do not work properly with ‘generic’ S3 bucket URLs, region specific one is required. So we have to use:<br><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; “https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/altinity-clickhouse-data/”,<br></em>instead of<br><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; “https://altinity-clickhouse-data.s3.amazonaws.com/”</em></li>
<li>On the other hand, single file download can use convenient bucket URLs.</li>
<li>The S3 import performance heavily depends on the level of client side parallelism. In glob mode multiple files can be processed in parallel. The example above used 32 insert threads. If you have a smaller server and VM try setting higher values of max_insert_threads setting. It can be done by a ‘SET’ command, for example:
<p><code>set max_threads=32, max_insert_threads=32;<br></code></p></li>
<li>From the other side, ‘input_format_parallel_parsing’ setting may result in overcommitting the memory, so better to turn it off.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>S3 table function can be used not only for imports but for exports as well! This is how an ‘ontime’ dataset can be uploaded to S3.</p><div><pre><code>INSERT INTO FUNCTION s3('https://altinity-clickhouse-data.s3.amazonaws.com/airline/data/ontime2/2019.csv.gz', '*****', '*****', 'CSVWithNames', 'Year UInt16, &lt;other 107 columns here&gt;, Div5TailNum String', 'gzip') SELECT *
FROM ontime_ref
WHERE Year = 2019

Ok.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 43.314 sec. Processed 7.42 million rows, 5.41 GB (171.35 thousand rows/s., 124.93 MB/s.)</code></pre>
</div><p>Uploading is pretty slow because we can not benefit from the parallelism in this case. ClickHouse can not automatically split the data into multiple files, so only one file can be uploaded at a time. There is a feature request to enable automatic partitioning when inserting to an external table function. That would make export more efficient and convenient.</p><p>Also it is a bit annoying that ClickHouse requires table structure to be supplied to the S3 table function. This is going to be improved in the future releases as well.</p><p><h2 id="h-clickhouse-storage-architecture">ClickHouse storage architecture</h2>
</p><p>S3 table function is a convenient tool for exporting or importing data but it can not be used in real insert/select workloads. The closer integration with ClickHouse storage system is required. Let’s look at ClickHouse storage architecture in more detail.</p><div><ul>
<li>Storage policies define what volumes can be used, and how data migrates from volume to volume;</li>
<li>Volumes allow to organize multiple ‘disk’ devices together;</li>
<li>Disk represents the physical device or mount point.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/36Pvq-MZVcWezKbm3tYvkh-IuOSW2HMoqo9AqmETg6zOooXZNurWZ4hELaHRw9M1rPli7GP7uOM1YPmjZTqFaR_ebZ-M_s6PPRgQM6kqQtkCPP19bIOjBLwBISEsl5kxOug2sky-" alt="storage configuration" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
</div><p>When this storage design was implemented in early 2019, ClickHouse supported only one type of disk that maps to OS mount points. A few months later the ClickHouse development team added an extra abstraction layer inside the disk itself, that allows to plug in different disk types. As one can probably guess the rationale for this was object storage integration. The new disk type ‘S3’ was added shortly after. It encapsulated the specifics of communicating with S3-compatible object storage. Now we can configure S3 ‘disks’ in ClickHouse, and store all or some data on the object storage.</p><p><h2 id="h-object-storage-configuration">Object storage configuration</h2>
</p><p>Disks, volumes, and storage policies can be defined in the main ClickHouse configuration file config.xml or, better, in the custom file inside /etc/clickhouse-server/config.d folder. Let’s define the disk S3 first:</p><p><strong>config.d/storage.xml:</strong></p><p>This is a very basic configuration, ClickHouse supports quite a lot of different options here; we will discuss some of them later.</p><p>Once the S3 disk is configured, it can be used in volume and storage policy configuration. We can setup several policies for different use cases:</p><div><ul>
<li>S3 volume in a policy next to other volumes. It can be used for TTL or manual moves of table partitions.</li>
<li>S3 volume in a policy with no other volumes. This is an S3-only approach.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><pre><code>&lt;yandex&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;storage_configuration&gt;
...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;policies&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;tiered&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;volumes&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;default&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;disk&gt;default&lt;/disk&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/default&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;s3&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;disk&gt;s3&lt;/disk&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/s3&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/volumes&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/tiered&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;s3only&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;volumes&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;s3&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;disk&gt;s3&lt;/disk&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/s3&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/volumes&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/s3only&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/policies&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/storage_configuration&gt;
&lt;/yandex&gt;</code></pre>
</div><p>Now let’s try to create some tables and move data around.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-inserting-data">Inserting data</h2>
</p><p>We will be using an ‘ontime’ dataset for this example. You can get it from <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/getting-started/example-datasets/ontime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ClickHouse Tutorial</a>, or download from an Altinity S3 bucket. The table has 193M rows and 109 columns, that’s why it is interesting to see how it performs with S3, where file operations are expensive. The reference table name is ‘ontime_ref’ and it uses default EBS volume. We can now use it as a template for experiments with S3.</p><div><pre><code>CREATE TABLE ontime_tiered AS ontime_ref
ENGINE = MergeTree
PARTITION BY Year
ORDER BY (Carrier, FlightDate)
<mark>TTL toStartOfYear(FlightDate) + interval 3 year to volume 's3'
SETTINGS storage_policy = 'tiered';</mark>

CREATE TABLE ontime_s3 AS ontime_ref
ENGINE = MergeTree
PARTITION BY Year
ORDER BY (Carrier, FlightDate)
<mark>SETTINGS storage_policy = 's3only';</mark></code></pre>
</div><p>‘ontime_tiered’ table is configured to store a full 3 years of data on block storage, and move earlier data to S3. ‘ontime_s3’ is the S3-only table.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, let’s insert some data. Our reference table has data up to March 31st, 2020.</p><div><pre><code>INSERT INTO ontime_tiered SELECT * from ontime_ref WHERE Year=2020;

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.634 sec. Processed 1.83 million rows, 1.33 GB (2.89 million rows/s., 2.11 GB/s.)</code></pre>
</div><p>That was almost instant. The data still goes to the normal disk. What about the S3 table?</p><div><pre><code>INSERT INTO ontime_s3 SELECT * from ontime_ref WHERE Year=2020;

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 15.228 sec. Processed 1.83 million rows, 1.33 GB (120.16 thousand rows/s., 87.59 MB/s.)</code></pre>
</div><p>Same amount of rows takes 25 times more to insert!&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>INSERT INTO ontime_tiered SELECT * from ontime_ref WHERE Year=2015;

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 16.701 sec. Processed 7.21 million rows, 5.26 GB (431.92 thousand rows/s., 314.89 MB/s.)&nbsp;

INSERT INTO ontime_s3 SELECT * from ontime_ref WHERE Year=2015;

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 15.098 sec. Processed 7.21 million rows, 5.26 GB (477.78 thousand rows/s., 348.33 MB/s.)</code></pre>
</div><p>Once data lands on S3 insert performance degrades quite a lot. This is certainly not desirable for a tiered table, so there is a special volume level setting that disables TTL moves on insert completely, and runs it in the background only. Here is how it can be configured:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;policies&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;tiered&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;volumes&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;default&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;disk&gt;default&lt;/disk&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/default&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;s3&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;disk&gt;s3&lt;/disk&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark>&lt;perform_ttl_move_on_insert&gt;0&lt;/perform_ttl_move_on_insert&gt;</mark>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/s3&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/volumes&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/tiered&gt;</code></pre>
</div><p>With such a setting insert goes always to the first disk in the storage policy. TTL moves to the corresponding volume are executed in the background. Let’s clean the ‘ontime_tiered’ table and perform a full table insert (side note: truncate takes a long time).</p><div><pre><code>INSERT INTO ontime_tiered SELECT * from ontime_ref;

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 32.403 sec. Processed 194.39 million rows, 141.25 GB (6.00 million rows/s., 4.36 GB/s.)</code></pre></div></div></div>

	<p><span>December 20, 2020</span></p><figure>
    <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1edc6507f68f4292d2ff9f550b74217f2997d049/b8e60/images/why-i-left-the-us-1.jpeg"> 
</figure>

<p>Last week I <a href="https://twitter.com/fatih/status/1338272277712969730">announced on Twitter that I’m leaving the U.S.</a> and going back to my country. I’m writing these lines from my home in Ankara, Turkey. Many people have asked me <em>why</em> I am leaving. 2020 was one of the most dramatic years in modern history due to the pandemic. Still, there are many other points, and I wanted to share my journey and feelings.</p>
<p>I also want to leave a trail for myself, for the future Fatih, to remind myself how things can sometimes <em>evolve</em> in a very natural (and unexpected) way.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-started">How it started</h2>
<p>It’s crucial in the first place to understand why I moved to the U.S. As some of you know, I was working for DigitalOcean, which is a cloud company based in NYC. I was working remotely (before it became cool) for almost four years for DigitalOcean. The work was challenging, and I had a lot of fun during my time there. We created many internal and external products (i.e., Managed Kubernetes offering), and it’s something I’m very proud of.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c309d2b056548c0fcc9525ad9379a220768a9fe7/879a5/images/why-i-left-the-us-2.jpeg" alt="Kubecon 2018, Seattle"> <figcaption>
            <p>Kubecon 2018, Seattle</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>However, there was always the feeling that I should be in the U.S. for the <em>next big thing</em> (whatever that is). Most of my friends gradually moved abroad (mostly to the U.S.) over the past 5-10 years. With time, friends and family members around me also started questioning my lifestyle. They started asking questions like: “Why are you still living in Turkey?” or “Why is someone like you not living abroad, such as in a European country or U.S.?”</p>
<p>I received these kinds of questions most of the time, but it increased a lot in the 2018/2019 years. At the end of 2018, my wife and I decided that moving abroad to a Western country could be a nice improvement and that we should give it a shot. My daughter was due in 2019, so my wife wouldn’t work for 1-2 years as she wanted to take care of her. That was the perfect time to do the switch (more on this later).</p>
<p><strong>Which country would that be?</strong> I was born and grew up in Germany, and being a German citizen also means that Germany was always the first place in my head. Half of my family is still living there, so it would entirely make sense to move to Germany. However, my wife wanted to live in an English-speaking country. Because we once lived in San Francisco temporarily in 2013/2014 and most of our friends moved to Bay Area, we focused on living there.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7d75062f992106d84f1723ec9d5d0304ee0becf5/ef92f/images/why-i-left-the-us-3.jpeg" alt="Preparing for upcoming interviews"> <figcaption>
            <p>Preparing for upcoming interviews</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Once we decided where we wanted to live, I started looking around and preparing myself for the interviews in Spring 2019. I talked to various companies and looked for a place where I could work on the things I was passionate about. The interview process and later the negotiation part was a very energy-draining process (some of you know this already), so I won’t go into that.</p>
<p>In the end, I had several offers from several companies (all based in the Bay Area), and I accepted an offer from GitHub to lead the Go framework and libraries team. This position was the perfect job, and it had the potential for me to do impactful work at GitHub.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b6e2d08586ce6375596f5e4c3c9473efbad7ccac/13151/images/why-i-left-the-us-4.jpeg" alt="My first day at GitHub (HQ, San Francisco)"> <figcaption>
            <p>My first day at GitHub (HQ, San Francisco)</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>I joined GitHub in August 2019</strong>, but because we didn’t have any place to live and it would be challenging for us to look for a new house with two kids (one being a newborn), I came alone. GitHub supported me a lot during this time, and I could find a lovely apartment at the end of August. I bought all the furniture and the things that we needed to function as a family of four. Once I finished, I flew back to Turkey and brought the family back to the Bay Area. It was October 2019, when my kids and my wife finally arrived in the U.S.</p>
<h2 id="life-in-the-us">Life in the U.S.</h2>
<p>Let me explain why we decided to live in the Bay Area:</p>
<ul>
<li>Great job and career opportunities</li>
<li>One of the best weather climates in the world (if you don’t count the wildfires)</li>
<li>Nature and parks</li>
<li>A diverse and welcoming place for immigrants like us</li>
<li>We lived with my wife once temporarily in San Francisco for around six months and knew the area very well</li>
<li>There were friends we knew from Turkey</li>

<p>As a side note, <strong>we didn’t move for a better financial life.</strong> We were already comfortable, and I want to make sure that’s known throughout the blog post. I understand that’s one of the biggest reasons people move abroad from countries like Turkey (and I fully support that), but for me, that wasn’t the case.</p>

<p>The first couple of months were not easy due to the adoption of a new country. Because I have traveled a lot to the U.S., I already knew how things work. But for my wife and the kids, that wasn’t the case. Even small things like “what kind of milk should we get?” or “what bread tastes good?” took some time to figure out. These were small concerns but worth mentioning because all of these eventually add up.</p>
<p>We slowly started meeting new friends, had gatherings with some of our old friends, etc. I applied for a driver’s license and also bought a car, which was very much needed because the U.S. is mostly a car-centric country. Once we had the car, we also started to explore our surrounding neighborhoods and cities. It was so great. Each weekend we would go somewhere in the Bay Area, and as I said, the Bay Area has many things to offer. It’s one of the best metropolitan areas in the world.</p>

<p>I also started going to the GitHub office. Our apartment was just next to a BART station, so it was convenient to go to the office. It was also something I wanted a lot. Working for years and years remotely, you miss being among people and working from an office. My wife also supported me a lot during this time, so every Tuesday and Thursday (sometimes it would be just Tuesday), I would go to the office.</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>Those days were just fantastic. And because GitHub was a remote-first company, the office was designed in a way with many great amenities. We had a library + lounge area where speaking and eating were forbidden. I would usually work from there. We also had a coffee shop inside the office (with real baristas and dope coffee). As a coffee lover, I loved every single bit. <strong>Being at the office just made me happy.</strong></p>
<p>The kids also started loving the area. My son started going to a preschool and picked up English words quickly. It wasn’t easy for him because he couldn’t communicate his needs anymore, but he slowly adapted. And seeing his progress brought us a lot of happiness because one of the reasons we wanted to live abroad was so that the kids could pick up a foreign language.</p>
<p>Due to the visa restrictions, my wife wasn’t able to work legally. I was on H1B, and my wife on H4. <strong>Unfortunately, the H4 visa restricts spouses to work legally in the U.S.</strong> But as I said earlier, because we had a newborn daughter, it wasn’t an issue. She wanted to take care of her for one year until she would looking for a job.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, GitHub was going to apply for the Green Card process, giving her the legal foundations to work here. Previously she was working for Deloitte and was a CPA in Turkey. Hence, the plan was to get the training and the necessary education to be a CPA in the U.S. and then start working once we got the Green Card.
As you see, the initial 4-5 months were pretty good. Everything was on track and going according to the plan. We had a great start at the beginning.</p>
<p>In December, we started hearing about the case in Wuhan, China. A deadly virus has begun to spread. A couple of months later, we heard from the news that a ship in California was infected. We found ourselves at the beginning of the pandemic. Everything happened so fast that we even didn’t know what to do.</p>
<h2 id="pandemic">Pandemic</h2>
<p>Just like everyone else, we didn’t know what was going on. <strong>Everything just happened instantly</strong>. I think the first instinct and feeling I had at that time was: “I’m stranded in the U.S. alone. I have a family to take care of, and I’ll have to do everything in my hands to make that happen”. Of course, as a tech worker, financially, we were in a good position in the Bay Area. But the pandemic slightly changed that perspective, especially for me.</p>
<p>Gradually, things got worse and worse. They closed down the schools, afterward the playgrounds as well. I wasn’t able to go to the office anymore. We got stuck at home with our two kids. And any parent knows how miserable it if you’re staying for an extended period at home with the kids. We realized that being cut off from the family and support network made things a lot harder.</p>

</figure>

<p>By now social distancing had started. We would probably experience the same thing in Turkey, but it would be quite different. In Turkey, friends with families would arrange for one of the parents to come and stay with them for months. There is a vast network, and culturally, people lived with their parents. So, it was a common thing where your parent would live with you.</p>
<p>For us, <strong>being in the Bay Area meant that we didn’t have this support network.</strong> It was just extremely difficult for my wife and me. I started to sleep around 8/9 pm with the kids and then wake up around 4 am to work without disruption for a couple of hours. In the morning, my wife would take care of the kids, and then during the evening, I would cook the food or take care of the kids. I’m not sure how we would handle the pandemic without my wife’s extraordinary support. As I said, it wasn’t easy, and things didn’t get better.</p>

  <article>
    <p>For a while now I have wanted to write a simple dictionary app for the Apple
Watch. The goal was to be able to quickly look up words from paper books,
by storing the book on the watch to be able to do fuzzy matches against the text.
While Apple ships amazing dictionaries with macOS and iOS, they only provide a very
limited API.
On iOS, all you get is 
a <em>view</em> into the dictionary via <code>UIReferenceLibraryViewController</code>,
for the Watch, there is no API at all,
and on OS X you get an antique <code>DCSCopyTextDefinition</code> that only
returns a plain-text definition, which is not nice to display. The whole
definition is returned as one blob of non-rich text, no newlines.</p>

<p>It was while attempting to parse this output that I realized it would be so much
easier to get the source, which I’m showing here how to do.
I open-sourced the code to parse the dictionary
<a href="https://github.com/fab-jul/parse_dictionaries">on github</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a pic of the OS X dictionary:</p>

<p><img src="https://fmentzer.github.io/assets/img/dictionary.png"></p>

<p>And here is what I managed to extract:</p>

<p><img src="https://fmentzer.github.io/assets/img/dictionary_watch.jpg"></p>

<p>I started by trying to figure out where dictionaries are stored.
Some googling <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250861549?answerId=251679363022#251679363022">revealed</a>
that they are burried in <code>/System</code> 
(at least for macOS 10.15 and possibly higher), at</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/System/Library/AssetsV2/
  com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This folder contains various cryptically-named folders ending in <code>.asset</code>,
which represent the different installed dictionaries. E.g., for me:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ ls
24effbf40402f823bb9d9f6f12b75af3e679a4a6.asset
26e585a43423edb02b25fa7ba9af3fdc08eed6d7.asset
4094df88727a054b658681dfb74f23702d3c985e.asset
96d637557afb292134db05d7d7f30c0fed9cef9f.asset
976258f0b1fad70dd8e7ee7c1b4be8f8536e19a7.asset
a1d5710e8c3932361413f22ff588a1a3c7c337bf.asset
com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX.xml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of these, <code>4094df88727a054b658681dfb74f23702d3c985e.asset</code> is the 
“New Oxford American Dictionary”. Going into that folder and
a few levels deeper, we land at a promisingly named “Resources” folder:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ ls /System/Library/AssetsV2/

<p>which is filled with a whole bunch of files. Sorting by size, it turns out
that <code>Body.data</code> could be a promising candidate at 23MB.</p>

<p>Sadly, it seems to be a binary blob without a discernible content.</p>

<p>Scanning through the file with <code>xxd</code>, I did not find any visible structure.</p>

<p>However, given that the file is only ~23MB, I was thinking it may just be a ZIP file
in disguise.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>unzip Body.data
Archive:  Body.data
  End-of-central-directory signature not found.  Either this file is not
  a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive.  In the
  latter case the central directory and zipfile comment will be found on
  the last disk(s) of this archive.
unzip:  cannot find zipfile directory in one of Body.data or
        Body.data.zip, and cannot find Body.data.ZIP, period.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>No luck! Same for <code>tar xvf</code>.</p>

<p>At this moment, I remembered
that the last time I had been thinking about this problem, years ago,
I had stumpled upon some cryptic C code. I remembered fiddling around with
XML, so I tried to dig up old projects, but sadly, I must have deleted them.</p>

<p>Some googling later, I stumpled upon the very <a href="https://gist.github.com/josephg/5e134adf70760ee7e49d">gist</a>
I had found years ago. It’s a very short and sweet python script to
extract entries from <code>Data.entry</code>. However, it’s also somewhat magical
in that it’s not documented, seeks random offsets, and even makes use
of the <code>struct</code> library.</p>

<p>But, it also does <code>import zlib</code>, so I thought, let’s try
to reverse engineer it myself.</p>

<p>The first simple
thing to try was to just attempt to find a ZIP file by going through the
bytes of the file one by one. After all,
it was very plausible that the file starts with some Apple
header followed by some compressed data.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>zlib</span>
<span>import</span> <span>itertools</span>

<span>DATA_FILE_PATH</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>

<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>DATA_FILE_PATH</span><span>,</span> <span>'rb'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
  <span>content_bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>()</span>

<span># Try all offsets to see if we find a ZIP file
</span><span>for</span> <span>offset</span> <span>in</span> <span>itertools</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>():</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>'Trying {offset}...'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>try</span><span>:</span>
    <span>content_decompressed</span> <span>=</span> <span>zlib</span><span>.</span><span>decompress</span><span>(</span><span>content_bytes</span><span>[</span><span>offset</span><span>:])</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'Found ZIP!'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>break</span>
  <span>except</span> <span>zlib</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>:</span>  <span># Current content_bytes is not a zipfile -&gt; skip a byte.
</span>    <span>pass</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>… and, low and behold, at byte number 108, a ZIP file starts!</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Trying 102...
Trying 103...
Trying 104...
Trying 105...
Trying 106...
Trying 107...
Trying 108...
Found ZIP!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Very exciting! What’s in this ZIP?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; content_decompressed.decode()
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xa3 in position 0: invalid start byte
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ok, so already the first byte cannot be decoded by ‘utf-8’, that’s a bit sad.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(content_decompressed[:20])
b'\xa3\x02\x00\x00&lt;d:entry xmlns:d'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Aha, already a few bytes later, some XML starts. For now, let’s just 
ignore the first four bytes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; content_decompressed[4:].decode()
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe7 in position 2065: invalid continuation byte
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s already more promising, we can decode 2065 bytes.
Looking around position 2065, we find:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(content_decompressed[2055:2085])
b'an&gt;&lt;/d:entry&gt;\n\xe7\x02\x00\x00&lt;d:entry xml'
#              ^ |              |
#        newline |__ 4 bytes ___|
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see the entry ends, followed by a newline <code>\n</code>, some more
seemingly random bytes, and another entry starts!</p>

<p>For reference, here is the first entry (defining <code>007</code>, as it turns out):</p>

<p>Exploring some more,
I did not find a pattern in these delimiter bytes except it always being
 4 bytes. I’m assuming they somehow tell you how long the next entry is.
 But we can just always ignore the 4 bytes and keep reading until the
 next newline appears.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>split</span><span>(</span><span>input_bytes</span><span>):</span>

    <h3>How Changing One Sentence led to 2.5x more Reviews</h3>
    
        <h6>December 17, 2020</h6>
    
    </p>

		<p><strong><u>June 2019</u></strong><br>
Fifteen years in business and we had a measly three reviews on Google.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>I reminded myself that this is <em>exactly</em> why I moved back from the Bay area to work on the family business – to use technology to expand. Let’s fix this!</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>I’d read somewhere that people are most willing to review right after their experience – good or bad.
I’d been itching to use Twilio, and this was the perfect use case!
Our inside sales person saves a visitor’s contact information right after a visitor leaves. Their phone number is included in this.</p>
<p>So, June 2019 I wrote a python script that sent an SMS to the visitor an 1 hour after they left. The SMS said:</p>
<div>
	<div>
<blockquote><small><i>If you enjoyed your visit (or didn't), please let us know how we did!<br>http://bit.ly/stoneland-google-stl <br>-Stoneland Team</i></small></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>I thought it was pretty slick, getting the URL, a cohesive message and proper formatting into one SMS.</p>
<p>At the same time, our sales team made a push to get reviews by emailing old customers.</p>
<p><strong><u>December 2019</u></strong><br>
We have 18 reviews now! While a big improvement over the last 15 years, it was still far below our competition.
And most of the reviews were in September when our sales team made the push. Now the trickle had dried up.</p>
<p>I’d been reading and listening to a lot of <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">Indiehackers</a>, especially interviews with founders who were marketing specialists. After ingesting Indiehacker nuggets, I settled on changing one factor at a time to understand what drove reviews.</p>
<p>In January 2020, I tweaked the copy of the SMS to read:</p>
<div>
	<div>
<blockquote><small><i>If you enjoyed your visit, leave us a 5 second rating!<br>http://bit.ly/stoneland-google-stl<br>-Stoneland Team</i></small></blockquote></div></div>
<p><strong><u>December 2020</u></strong><br>
That tiny change made all the difference! As of December 15, 2020, we have <strong>93 reviews</strong> with a 4.9 rating!
We’ve outstripped all our competitors in the area, as well as several of our customers.</p>
<p>Bottom line? Copywriting matters.</p>

</figure>

<p>P.S. For anyone wondering about the math around ‘2.5x’, here’s the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>June 2019 - December 2020 (~6 months): 15 reviews</li>
<li>Extrapolated over 12 months: 30 reviews</li>
<li>January 2020 - December 2020 (~12 months): 75 reviews</li>
</ul>
<p><span>75/30 = <strong>2.5</strong></span></p>

<p>Published on 2020-12-20 by <b>Sunaina Pai</b></p>
<h2>To Tmux or Not to Tmux, That Is the Question!</h2>

<p>
Before getting started with tmux, let us go over some questions to see
if tmux is right for you:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Do you use a terminal as part of your your development workflow?
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you use multiple terminals in different tabs or windows to
    navigate files, edit text, compile and run code, tail log files,
    push code to repository, and run one-time adhoc commands?
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you work on multiple projects at a time, each with its own set of
    workflow and environment requirements, and often have to switch
    context?
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you SSH into remote systems?
  </li>
  <li>
    Have you ever got disconnected from a remote SSH session in the
    middle of a task that you were running and monitoring?
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
If you answered yes to any of these questions, then tmux is for you!
</p>


<h2>What Is Tmux?</h2>

<p>
Tmux is a terminal multiplexer. You can run multiple terminal programs
inside tmux, all of which can be accessed from the single terminal that
is running tmux. This is called a tmux session. You can have multiple
such tmux sessions, say one for each project you are working on. You can
detach from a tmux session and later reattach to it. When you run
programs in a tmux session, the session remains intact and continues
running your programs even if you detach from the session. You can start
where you left off the previous day, or you can even access the session
from a different computer.
</p>

<p>
If you have worked with remote servers using remote desktop connection,
you will be familiar with how the applications that you open in the
server are kept as is even when you disconnect. You can then resume the
session by reconnecting to it. You can even reconnect to the remote
desktop using a different client or a different computer. Tmux helps you
to achieve similar results for terminal sessions.
</p>

<p>
When you run the <code>tmux</code> command, tmux starts a server process
if it is not already running, and a tmux session is created. The tmux
server runs as a background process in your system and manages all the
terminals running inside tmux. You can create additional sessions in the
tmux server if needed by using the <code>tmux</code> command. A tmux
session is a group of related tmux windows. Think of all the terminal
tabs you open to get to your development workflow of a particular
project. All these can be grouped together as windows in a tmux session.
A tmux window comprises of one or more panes. Each pane is like a
terminal by itself. Panes can be organized vertically, horizonatally, or
a mix of both. Think of editing, compiling, and executing code on the
left pane while tailing a related log file on the right pane as an
example. At any given time, there is one active pane where the commands
you type are accepted. You can switch between panes, windows, and
sessions as needed.
</p>

<p>
Let us now see how to get started with tmux.
</p>


<h2>Install Tmux</h2>

<p>
If you are on a Debian, Ubuntu, or another Debian-based system, enter
the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install tmux</code></pre>

<p>
If you are on macOS with Homebrew installed, enter the following
command:
</p>

<pre><code>brew install tmux</code></pre>

<p>
If you are on any other system or environment, see
<a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing">Tmux Wiki:
  Installing</a> for installation details.
</p>


<h2>Create, Detach From, and Attach to Sessions</h2>

<p>
To create a new tmux session, enter the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux</code></pre>

<p>
Run some program in this session. Maybe tail a log file. This will help
with the next steps where you detach and reattach to a session.
</p>

<p>
To detach your terminal from a tmux session, enter the following
command:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux detach</code></pre>

<p>
Tmux will keep your session intact. All your programs keep running on
the server. To attach your terminal as a client back to an existing tmux
session, enter the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux attach</code></pre>

<p>
Note that it is not necessary to type out the <code>tmux</code> commands
in full. You can use any unambiguous abbreviation of the commands. For
example, <code>tmux det</code> and <code>tmux at</code> are equivalent
to <code>tmux detach</code> and <code>tmux attach</code>, respectively.
</p>

<p>
By default, the new sessions are named 0, 1 and so on. To choose another
name for the session, use the following command to start a new session:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux new -s &lt;session-name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
Here <code>&lt;session-name&gt;</code> denotes the name of the session
you choose. You can also rename an existing session with this command:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux rename &lt;new-name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
If you have multiple tmux sessions running and you want to target a
specific session to rename, you can use the <code>-t</code> option to
specify the session name you want to target, like this:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux rename -t &lt;session-name&gt; &lt;new-name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
Without the <code>-t</code> option, it renames the current session.
</p>

<p>
The <code>-t</code> option is useful for attaching to a specific tmux
session too when multiple tmux sessions are running. By default
<code>tmux attach</code> attaches to the most recently used session that
is not attached. You can attach to a specific session like this:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux attach -t &lt;session-name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
Sometimes while attaching to a tmux session, you might want to detach
the other clients to connected to it. That can be achieved with the
following commands:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux attach -d</code></pre>
<pre><code>tmux attach -d -t &lt;session-name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
While you are inside a tmux session, you can also change the name of the
attached session by using the key-sequence <code>C-b $</code> which
prompts for a new name for the session. The key-sequence <code>C-b
$</code> is bound to the <code>rename</code> command that you saw above.
Similarly, the key-sequence <code>C-b d</code> is bound to the
<code>detach</code> command. To understand how tmux key bindings and
commands work together, read the next two sections.
</p>


<h2>Understand Tmux Prefix Keys</h2>

<p>
Once you attach your terminal as a client to a tmux session, all
keystrokes are sent to the program running in the active pane of the
current tmux window. By default it is your shell. For key-sequences that
control tmux itself, a special key-sequence called the prefix key must
be pressed. By default the prefix key is <code>C-b</code>. Here
<code>C</code> denotes the <code>Ctrl</code> modifier key, i.e., to
enter <code>C-b</code>, press and hold the <code>Ctrl</code> key, then
press and release the <code>b</code> key, and finally release the
<code>Ctrl</code> key. When the prefix key is entered like this, tmux
waits for another keystroke or key-sequence to determine which tmux
command needs to be executed. For example, when you enter <code>C-b
$</code> to rename the current session, <code>C-b</code> is the prefix
key that tells tmux that you are going to invoke a tmux command and then
the <code>$</code> keystroke tells tmux that you want to invoke the tmux
<code>rename</code> command.
</p>


<h2>Key Bindings, Commands, and Command Prompt</h2>

<p>
The key-sequence <code>C-b ?</code> shows the list of key bindings along
with short descriptions about what they do. The output is shown in the
view mode in the active pane. The pane in view mode has its own key
bindings which don't need the prefix key. By default the view mode has
Emacs key bindings that you can use to navigate the output. However, it
can be configured to use vi key bindings too.
</p>

<p>
Any time key bindings are used, they run the underlying tmux commands.
For example <code>C-b c</code> runs the <code>neww</code> command that
creates a new window. Commands can be run directly from the shell as you
saw when you created new session using the <code>tmux new</code>
command. Just like any other Unix commands, tmux commands have zero or
more command line options that may or may not accept arguments. For
example, the <code>attach</code> command that you saw earlier accepts
the <code>-d</code> option to detach any other clients that are attached
to the session. This option does not require an argument. The
<code>attach</code> command also accepts another option <code>-t</code>
that requires an argument to specify the name of the target session you
want to attach to.
</p>

<p>
You might mostly want to use the key bindings to manipulate tmux because
they are convenient. However, the tmux commands can be useful especially
when you want to perform a task that is supported only by an option. The
tmux commands are also useful if you want to write a script to
manipulate tmux.
</p>

<p>
Tmux commands can be run from the shell as you have seen so far. There
is also an interactive command prompt available within tmux that you can
open using <code>C-b :</code>. This prompt accepts tmux commands. For
example, <code>C-b :neww</code> creates a new window in the attached
session. Some of the tmux commands run in this manner show the output in
the view mode in the active pane. For example, <code>C-b :ls</code>
shows the list of all available sessions.
</p>


<h2>Create New Windows in a Session and Switch Between Them</h2>

<p>
You can create new window in a session by using <code>C-b c</code> or
<code>C-b :neww</code>. Each window is numbered starting from 0. Every
new window is created at the first available index. This means that if
there are gaps in the list of window numbers, a new window occupies the
first available number in the gaps. The new window thus created becomes
the current window of the session. The current window is identified by
the <code>*</code> suffix in its name and the previous window is
identified by the <code>-</code> suffix in its name.
</p>

<p>
If you want to create a new window but not make it the current window,
you can do so with the <code>-d</code> option like this: <code>C-b :neww
-d</code>. You can also create a window at a specific index by using the
<code>-t</code> option like this: <code>C-b :neww -t 9</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>C-b 0</code> takes you to window 0, <code>C-b 1</code> takes you
to window 1, and so on until <code>C-b 9</code>. <code>C-b '</code>
prompts for an index to switch to that window. This can be useful if you
want to go to windows with indices greater than 9. <code>C-b p</code>
takes you to the previous window and <code>C-b n</code> takes you to the
next window in the window list by index. <code>C-b l</code> takes you to
the last window that was active before the current one. This is very
useful for alternating between two windows again and again.
</p>

<p>
To rename the current window, you can use <code>C-b :renamew
  &lt;new-name&gt;</code> or <code>C-b ,</code> which prompts for the
new name for the window.
</p>

<p>
I find it convenient not to exceed 10 windows (indices 0-9) in a
session, so that I can switch between them using <code>C-b
&lt;number&gt;</code>.
</p>


<h2>Create New Panes in a Window and Switch Between Them</h2>

<p>
You can create a new pane by splitting a pane in a window. <code>C-b
  %</code> splits the current pane into left and …</p></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Hi! I'm Marcel, web developer at <a href="https://www.q42.com/">Q42</a> and creator of the <a href="https://micr.io/">Micrio storytelling platform</a>.</p>
<p>In 2015, I started developing a JavaScript viewer for ultra high resolution 2D and 360° images with added markers, tours, audio, and more. Since then, I've been pushing to find the best balance between hardware performance, minimal CPU and bandwidth use, and compatibility for older browsers to deliver a sharp and high quality viewing experience.</p>
<p>For Micrio, it is vital that the performance on the client's browser is as good as possible. The reason for this is very simple: when you are being told a story, or watching a movie, even <em>a single frameskip</em> immediately takes you out of your experience.</p>
<p>Since Micrio is being used for an <a href="https://micr.io/showcases">ever growing list</a> of awesome projects, the most important thing is that for whoever visits a Micrio project, it must work, and <em>work well</em>: delivering fast load times, and a butter smooth interactive experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (Wasm) is the ability for your browser to run <em>compiled</em> code at (near-) native speeds. It is now recognised by the W3C as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/12/pressrelease-wasm-rec.html.en">4th official web programming language</a>, after HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>With it, you can run compiled code written in a variety of programming languages (C/C++, Rust, Go, AssemblyScript, <a href="https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs">and many more</a>) in your browser, without any need for plugins.</p>
<p>Finding out about Wasm in late 2019 really made me want to try it out. Could I use this tech to make the Micrio client run smoother than the current version does? Would I need to rewrite everything in C++, and if so, how would that work? Would the effort be worth the gains it would give me? And not in the least.. <em>how does it work!?</em></p>
<p>This article describes my journey from upgrading the Micrio <strong>JavaScript-only client to use WebAssembly</strong>, with the hopes of improving performance, and taking my code to the next level.</p>
<h3 id="thecurrentversion">The current version</h3>
<p>To give a rough idea about the tech stack of the current latest JS-only revision of Micrio (<a href="https://b.micr.io/micrio-2.9.min.js">version 2.9</a>): This library as a single JS file works on all semi-modern browsers, including even Internet Explorer 10 for 2D, and IE 11 for 360° images.</p>
<p>It uses Canvas2D for the rendering of 2D images, and <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>/WebGL rendering for 360° images. Written in <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=es6">ES6 JavaScript</a> (or ECMAScript 6, the latest version of JavaScript), it still <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler">compiles</a> to ES5 to support Internet Explorer 11.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, displaying a <a href="https://micr.io/i/xCSYV/">231.250 x 193.750 pixel image</a> in your browser in a matter of milliseconds, allowing the user to freely zoom in and navigate, requires a little bit of processing power.</p>
<p>Now, Micrio 2.9 <em>isn't bad</em>. It runs pretty smoothly on all devices. But with WebAssembly around the corner, allowing all calculations to be done at native CPU speeds, this could potentially make a big difference in making Micrio's performance even better, and could improve the code architecture a lot.</p>
<p>And, perhaps, this could also mark the setup for a new major version, where I will draw a clear line and drop all compatibility and polyfills for older browsers: <strong>Micrio 3.0</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="firstrewritecandemscripten">First Rewrite: C++ and emscripten</h2>
<p>As a first step into the world of WebAssembly, getting to know the ecosystem, I started to play around with <a href="https://emscripten.org/">emscripten</a>. With it, you can take almost any project made in C or C++, and compile it to a binary <code>.wasm</code> file that your browser can natively run.</p>
<p>At this point, I didn't really have a clear image of where WebAssembly starts and ends, and how autonomously it could run inside your browser. So I started a new project from scratch to see if I could make a C++-implementation of the basic Micrio logic: a virtual <em>zoomable</em> and <em>pannable</em> image consisting of a lot of separate tiles, using a virtual camera for displaying only the tiles necessary for what the user is viewing inside your screen.</p>
<p>It turns out, emscripten already had great compatibility for <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">libsdl</a>: a low-level audio, keyboard/mouse input, and OpenGL library. Which is awesome, because I could write my code using this very well documented library, even including mouse and key inputs and WebGL rendering. Since I was also working with downloading images, I also used the <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">stb_image.h</a> image library.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/cpp.png" alt="Setting up SDL and OpenGL" title="C++ in the 21st century"></p>
<p>The largest struggle of this was picking up C++ again, never having used it outside of hobby scope many years ago. But after a few days of cursing and second guessing myself, I had a working first version with all of the most important features written with help of the SDL library:</p>
<ul>
<li>A virtual camera and all necessary viewing logic;</li>
<li>Image tiles downloading;</li>
<li>Rendering using WebGL(/OpenGL) using a simple shader;</li>
<li>Mouse event handling for panning and zooming the image;</li>
<li>Resize event handling to fit Micrio to the desired <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> HTML element</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see this version running here: <a href="https://b.micr.io/_test/wasm/index.html">https://b.micr.io/_test/wasm/index.html</a> :</p>

<h3 id="firstresults">First Results</h3>
<p>As incredibly awesome it was to see Micrio in C++ running smoothly in my browser, and even handing all the user's input, there were a few reservations, which left me with an unsatisfied feeling.</p>
<h4 id="1codingcfeltoldfashioned">1. Coding C++ felt old-fashioned</h4>
<p>Writing C++ felt like going back in time. Incredibly powerful and fully proven, but also archaic, especially for me as a web developer. I spent more time fiddling with making an optimized <code>Makefile</code> than I care to admit.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/makefile.png" alt="The emscripten C++ Makefile" title="( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"></p>
<h4 id="2thecompiledwasmbinarywasverylarge">2. The compiled <code>.wasm</code> binary was very large</h4>
<p>As great as the help of <code>libsdl</code> and <code>stb_image.h</code> were to let me use OpenGL and JPG image functions, as much did they add to the final compiled binary file. Even with all <code>emcc</code> compiler optimizations (which can even use the awesome <code>closure</code> JS compiler), the resulting WebAssembly binary file was 760KB. Compared to the JavaScript version of Micrio being around 240KB, this was a major setback. These libraries packed a lot of functionalities that were not necessary for Micrio, but were still included in the compiled version.</p>
<h4 id="3tilagluefile">3. TIL: A <em>glue</em> file</h4>
<p>This is the part where I learnt where the limits of WebAssembly start and finish. <strong>WebAssembly is not a magical self-contained binary that lets you run full applications out of the box</strong>. It actually needs to be <em>bound</em> to the browser using JavaScript.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/glued.png" alt="glue clipart"><br>
<small><a href="http://www.clker.com/clipart-13445.html">Image source</a></small></p>
<p>Where I thought that all the SDL OpenGL code in C++ would automagically be recognised by the browser: <em>wrong</em>. What <code>emscripten</code> does, is to take all OpenGL operations from C++, and <em>convert them</em> to WebGL operations your browser can understand.</p>
<p>Same with the <code>libsdl</code> mouse and keyboard-inputs: these were <strong>glued</strong> to the browser using an extra JavaScript file that would set event listeners for the specific cases, and send them to the WebAssembly binary. This separate JavaScript file was generated by the emscripten compiler, and had to be included in the HTML alongside the compiled binary <code>.wasm</code> file.</p>
<p>Everything added together, the new total of the <em>base engine</em> of Micrio was a whopping <strong>791KB</strong>; a bit too much for my liking.</p>
<h2 id="secondrewriteassemblyscript">Second Rewrite: AssemblyScript</h2>
<p>Fast forward a few months, to just after having attended the awesome <a href="https://webassembly-summit.org/">WebAssembly Summit</a> in Mountain View in February 2020. With a bundle of fresh energy and inspiration, I decided to see if I could use WebAssembly to improve the Micrio JavaScript client a second time.</p>
<p>During the WebAssembly conference, I was very impressed by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8j_ieOm4vE">synth demo</a> written in <strong><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/">AssemblyScript</a></strong>, a language created specifically for WebAssembly, using the TypeScript syntax. Basically you can write (near) TypeScript, which compiles to a <code>.wasm</code>-binary. So anyone familiar with either TypeScript or JavaScript ES6 will not have a lot of difficulties using it.</p>
<p>And the great thing-- it's all installed using <code>npm</code>, so <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/quick-start.html">getting it up and running</a> and compiling your program is super easy!</p>
<p>There are a few basic <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/types.html"><code>types</code> added in AssemblyScript</a>, which are required for compile-time optimizations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>f64</code> / <code>f32</code> : For 64 or 32-bit floats;</li>
<li><code>i8</code> / <code>i16</code> / <code>i32</code> / <code>i64</code> : For signed <code>int</code>s, ranging in precision</li>
<li><code>u8</code> .. <code>u64</code> : For unsigned <code>int</code>s</li>
<li><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/types.html">And a few more</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="goingatomic">Going atomic</h3>
<p>This time, I wanted to see if it was possible to only let a small part of Micrio run inside WebAssembly, and still use most of the JavaScript that was already inside the client. <em>How small can we get it?</em> I decided to focus on a subset of camera functions, such as translating screen coordinates to image coordinates and vice versa. So this time no rendering, event handling, or writing shaders.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/assemblyscript.png" alt="Simple camera functions in AssemblyScript" title="My First AssemblyScript"><br>
<small><em>Simple camera functions in AssemblyScript</em></small></p>
<p>The result: a 3KB binary containing some basic math functions, that take an input and return an output. AssemblyScript offers some <em>glue-tooling</em> by providing its own <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/loader.html">Loader</a>, which will deal with importing the binary file and being able to call these functions.</p>
<p>However, this is optional and I ended up using the JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Using_the_JavaScript_API">WebAssembly API</a>, <em>neat</em>. And it turns out, this is super easy: simply use the <code>fetch</code> API to load your compiled <code>.wasm</code> file, cast it as an <code>ArrayBuffer</code>, and use the <code>WebAssembly.instantiate()</code> function to get it up and running.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/instantiate.png" alt="Loading a wasm file" title="Gluing it yourself"></p>
<p>The compiled binary will then offer an <code>exports</code> object, containing the functions that you have exported in the AssemblyScript file, which you can immediately call from JavaScript as if they were normal functions.</p>
<p>Wait.. "<em>which you can immediately call from JavaScript as if they were normal functions</em>"...</p>
<p><strong>WebAssembly is running synchronously to JavaScript!</strong> 🤯</p>
<p>Having worked with WebWorkers before, I honestly thought that WebAssembly would run inside its own CPU thread, and that any function calls would be <code>async</code>. Nope, the Wasm-functions you call will return immediately!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/exports-and-imports.html#exports"><em>This is, like, powerful stuff</em>!</a></p>
<h3 id="bundlingthecompiledwasminsidethejsfile">Bundling the compiled Wasm inside the JS file</h3>
<p>Since I now had some extra performing hands on deck for Micrio that was very easy to integrate, I decided to include this minimal WebAssembly binary in the then-stable release of Micrio (2.9).</p>
<p>However, I didn't want an extra HTTP request for the Wasm binary every time someone loaded the Micrio JS. So I included a <code>base64</code> encoded version of the Wasm-file <em>inside</em> the Micrio JS, and for browsers that support it, auto-loaded that.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Sunday, December 20, 2020</p>
<p>I just finished the implementation of an important feature of Pijul: clones, pushes and pulls on partial repositories. In this post, I explain why this matters.</p>
<h2 id="change-commutation">Change commutation</h2>
<p>Pijul is based on <em>changes</em>, also called <em>patches</em> or <em>diffs</em>.
This doesn’t mean that its only internal datastructure is patches, quite to the contrary: it was only by departing from a patch-only internal representation that we were able to solve the algorithmic challenges inherent to patch-based systems.</p>
<p>However, being change-based does mean that the core operations of Pijul are defined on changes, and that Pijul is designed in such a way that changes satisfy basic intuitive properties, similar to algebraic operations. One basic thing is that applying a change is an <em>associative</em> operation, like matrix multiplication: applying $A$ and $B$ at once, and then later $C$, is the same as applying $A$, and then $B$ and $C$ at once. In matrix multiplication, $(AB)C = A(BC)$. Moreover, in Pijul, all changes are invertible (whereas only some matrices are): for any change $A$, there is an “inverse change” $A^{-1}$ such that applying $A^{-1}$ after $A$ is the same as applying neither. Of course, both $A$ and $A^{-1}$ will appear in the log, but the contents of the repository will be the same as applying neither $A$ nor $A^{-1}$.</p>
<p>There is another property that users want from version control systems, and that is <strong>commutation</strong>.
Matrix multiplication rarely commutes<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
In Git, commutation is usually <em>simulated</em> using branches and rebase: indeed, rebasing a branch A on top of another branch B really means commuting the commits of A since the divergence between A and B, and the commits of B since the divergence. However, that commutation isn’t perfect, since the commits must change their hash when rebased.</p>
<p>Things are simpler in Pijul, because any two changes that <em>could have been written independently</em> always commute, meaning that if the two changes could be written without knowledge of each other, they can be applied in any order.</p>
<p>This of course raises a potential concern:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I can apply $A$ and $B$ in any order, how do I know which order is the <strong>right</strong> one?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Pijul, this question <strong>does not matter</strong>: both orders will yield <strong>the exact same result</strong>, the only difference is that the log will list the changes in the order in which they were applied. And I’m not saying that it doesn’t matter because I’m careless, but because it truly is the same thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I disagree: it does matter, I still prefer to have a “<em>linear</em>” order for my changes/commits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, everybody wants to see the order of operations in a repository, for many reasons. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to keep a record of the operations performed on our repository.</li>
<li>We want to go back in time.</li>
</ul>
<p>And in fact, Pijul allows you to do exactly that, but in a more rigorous way than Git. Indeed, take the scenario where Alice and Bob work together, Alice makes a change $A$ while Bob makes $B$. When they put their work together, Alice applies Bob’s change, resulting in the log $AB$, while Bob applies Alice’s change, resulting in the log $BA$. In this case, there is no “true” linear history, since they worked on different things, and took different steps at different times. However, both of them want to be able to go back in time, step-by-step, and not just “<em>step-by-step-according-to-Bob’s-order</em>”.</p>
<h2 id="commutation-and-massive-repositories">Commutation and massive repositories</h2>
<p>One of the biggest challenge for Pijul up to the recent releases was scalability: even modestly-sized repositories like Pijul’s source code would use a lot of disk space. This was even more disappointing since, as I’m about to explain, commutation was suposed to allow it to scale to gigantic repository sizes… in theory. The same problem also made massive tests impossible, meaning that getting past the “0.x releases” seemed more and more impossible as time passed.</p>
<p>Now that this phase is mostly behind us, the cool bits of the theory finally become practical.</p>
<p>In particular, in Pijul, each change contains a reference to the files it modifies. Note that, because we want operations on repositories (such as renaming files) to commute with edits inside files, we don’t identify files and directories by name, but by a unique identifier made from the hash of the change that introduced that file or directory.</p>
<p>For repositories with multiple projects, this makes it possible to clone and pull just parts of a repository, and work on that part as if we had the entire thing. Indeed, imagine we have a repository with the following log:</p>
<ol>
<li>A, adding file <em>x</em></li>
<li>B, editing <em>x</em></li>
<li>C, adding file <em>y</em></li>
<li>D, adding file <em>z</em></li>
<li>E, renaming <em>x</em> to <em>w</em></li>
<li>F, editing <em>y</em> and <em>z</em></li>
</ol>
<p>All these changes do not necessarily commute; however, since B and C touch completely different files (namely, <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>), they could be produced in parallel, and hence they commute. This means that we can pull only the changes related to a specific file, say <em>x</em>, and make the following history: A, B, E<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Moreover, any change made on top of that sequence will commute with C, D and F: indeed, if we edit file <em>x</em> again, producing a change G, then since G can be made in parallel to C, D and F, we can push G after any patch that comes after B in that history, for example getting history “ABCDEFG”.</p>
<p>Note that this is done without changing the changes nor their hash.</p>
<h2 id="another-trick-for-large-files">Another trick for large files</h2>
<p>As explained in previous posts on this blog, Pijul changes have a bit more information than diffs, and operate on graphs rather than files. This means that changes can be split into two parts, a short-ish one with a binary specification of the graph operations, and then the new content inserted by the change.</p>
<p>The change format is designed to be downloadable in two stages: one can download the operations without downloading the contents. One issue with this is security: if we don’t download the contents, how can we make sure that the hash is right? This is done by including a hash of the change in the “operations” section of the change, and letting the hash of a change be the hash of the “operations” section.</p>
<p>This makes it possible for someone to make five versions of a large binary file in a day, where each change deletes the entire file, and adds it again, the operation sections only contain the length of the different versions, not the actual bytes. In order to get the latest version of the file, a client will therefore only have to download the latest change completely, and only the operations section of the previous ones.</p>
<p>Note that this makes the following “attack” possible: a server might trick a client into believing that the server has a change with hash $A$, which inserts $n$ bytes into a file, and then another change with hash $B$, deleting all these bytes. When the client downloads $A$ and $B$, it doesn’t need to download the contents. However, if the client later decides to unrecord $B$, the contents of $A$ will have to be downloaded, and the client will be able to tell that the hash of $A$ was incorrect. This should make it impossible to unrecord $B$ without also unrecording $A$. However, if $A$ made other edits, and other changes depend on $A$, this could be problematic.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is next?</h2>
<p>There is one remaining painpoint for very large repositories, and this is the fact that in order to clone a repository with a very large history, one must download and apply all the changes, one by one. Even though our apply function is quite fast<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, this can still be problematic for dozens or hundreds of thousands of changes.</p>
<p>In my next post, I will talk about a solution to this problem, which I have started to implement.</p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Matrices that are simultaneously diagonalizable do, for example, but for two arbitrary matrices $A$ and $B$, $AB$ is often different from $BA$. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Note that in this case, we could also pull A, E, B, since renaming a file commutes with editing it. However, we must start with A, since adding a file could not be possibly done in parallel to editing or renaming it. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The complexity of apply is in $O(|p| |c| \log |H|)$, where $|p|$ is the size of the change, $|c|$ is the size of the largest conflict in which $p$ is involved, and $|H|$ is the number of edits made since the start of the repository. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
</ol>

        <p>I recently had the opportunity to encrypt/decrypt stuff using AES, but I didn’t know it inside out well. I couldn’t help but be curious about how it is working, and I realized my mind could only be satisfied by digging deeper into its implementation.
This post walks you through how AES encryption works by reading core implementation written in Go.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-aes-encryption">What is AES encryption?</h2>
<p>The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cipher, an alternative to the DES. Cryptographers from around the world proposed algorithms, from which the Rijndael algorithm was selected in 2000. Hence we’ll take a look the implementation of this Rijndael.</p>
<h2 id="rijndael">Rijndael</h2>
<p>Rijndael is a block cipher algorithm. A block cipher is a cryptographic algorithm that processes a specific number of bits at a time.
The number of bits (called block length) to be processed at a time depends on the algorithm, AES is 128-bits (16-bytes). Most plaintext we encrypt is longer than this block length, so we typically use this block cipher algorithm repeatedly.
Keep in mind this post goes into some details on only on one block’s process to focus more on the core algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="digging-deeper-into-the-implementation">Digging deeper into the implementation</h2>
<p>The Go language officially provides the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/aes/">crypto/aes</a> package, which makes use of Go Assembly to leverage Intel’s hardware support for AES if it’s built for amd64.
It otherwise uses the implementation written in pure Go. Let’s take a look at the pure Go implementation that the human mind relatively can work in.</p>
<p>The public method <code>aesCipher.Encrypt</code> defined in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/55b58018f41e6de63bdaa8f3d9a284077d4e88c1/src/crypto/aes/cipher.go#L54-L65">aes/cipher.go</a> looks to implement a block cipher:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Rijndael encrypts a block by repeating a process called a round.
In a round, there are four processes: SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey. As commented out in the snippet, the number of rounds depends on the key length.</p>
<h3 id="subbytes">SubBytes</h3>
<p>The conversion is done 1-byte at a time based on a conversion table called S-box which has 256 values.
Below illustrates to perform <code>sbox[s0[1]]</code> well:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nakabonne.dev/img/aes-sbox.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"> 
</figure>

<p>Unlike DES, we can see that all bytes have been converted at this point.
This post doesn’t cover AES’s S-Box as it is mentioned in many places and much better than I could do.</p>
<h3 id="shiftrows">ShiftRows</h3>
<p>The next step is to process the rows that are grouped into 4-byte units and shifted regularly to the left.
The number of bytes to be shifted depends on the line, as shown below:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nakabonne.dev/img/aes-shift-rows.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"> 
</figure>

<h3 id="mixcolumns">MixColumns</h3>
<p>In the previous step, it dealt with rows, but the next is to process the bytes in columns.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nakabonne.dev/img/aes-mix-columns.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"> 
</figure>

<p>It involves multiplication operations in a finite field, hence this step is a bit tough to describe. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_MixColumns">Wikipedia</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="addroundkey">AddRoundKey</h3>
<p>Finally, it XORs the output of MixColumns with the round key. The following figure shows the execution of <code>s0[1] ^ xk[4]</code> (the <code>^</code> denotes an XOR operation in Go).</p>

<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2>
<p>While this post has only shown you the encryption process, these processes are fully reversible with an Inverse MixColumns, ShiftRows, SubBytes. How beautiful!
I’ll keep reading the implementation to deepen my understanding of cryptography.</p>

            <h2>2009 - Communication</h2>
            <p>
              Far back in 2009, while following Digital Communication, Advertising and Art Direction at NABA (New Academy of Fine Arts of Milan), I became interested in Professor Massimo Banzi's classes and managed to get an Arduino Diecimila. In just one day my vision of the world had changed and I slowly started to better understand computers and electronics while sharing results with the Arduino community both on my website and on Arduino's forum. I started to build robots and after few years of experiments I launched my first start­up: a webshop of arduino-compatible, CNC machined robot kits, boards and sensors.

            <h2>2010 - Let's transmit data</h2>
            <p>
              At the time in my projects I had to connect many microcontrollers on a common bus and I found myself not satisfied by the solutions available, for this reason I started to develop my own data link. I perfectly remember that night back in 2010 when I started bit-banging bits using an Arduino and trying to sample them with another. The first problem I hit were bugs in the implementation that were quickly resolved. Then I unsterstood I did not have any synchronization, depending on when the receiver was powered on bits were shifted. That night, with no experience in electronics or engineering I instinctively defined the synchronization pulse that is still present as the core of <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/13.0/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang/specification/PJDL-specification-v5.0.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJDL (Padded Jittering Data Link) v5.0</a>. To make sure to synchronize with the start of each byte I have added a 1 longer than data bits followed by a 0 and instructed the receiver to find it and only then start sampling 8 bits. Data was coming in perfectly. That was <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang/specification/obsolete/padded-jittering-protocol-specification-v0.1.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJDL (Padded jittering data link) v0.1</a> which was basic and working by mere chance. Then, after debugging it further, experiments proved it was working well not only through wires and the human body, but also wirelessly through radio and infrared light, yet it showed to be robust operating bidirectionally in spite of interference. After I noticed that it was possible to connect more than 2 devices to the same wire, I started to experiment with an initial collision avoidance phase, an 8 bits device id and a synchronous acknowledgement at the end of the packet. It was shocking to see that many devices were able to send and receive data through the same wire. Soon after I released <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/specification/obsolete/PJON-protocol-specification-v0.1.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON v0.1</a> on the Arduino forum, receiving plenty of "don't ­reinvent ­the ­wheel" and few active contributors.

            <h2>2014 - Let's network</h2>
            <p>
              In those days I became aware of how quickly the cloud was eating the world and how difficult was to connect stuff directly without relying on a third-party. It seemed like noone could connect computers together anymore without an ever present observing big brother. To be honest, I did not like it: that was the point when I understood how <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON</a> could have changed the game and what I personally could have done to influence the outcome. I decided to double my efforts on the protocol and try my best to provide humanity with a free and more efficient way to make networks. With a working protocol layer and support from the community, I went further in the address space development adding an optional 32 bits bus id used to identify a group of up to 255 devices, supporting up to 4.294.967.295 buses and a total of 1.090.921.692.930 devices. This addition released in <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/specification/obsolete/PJON-protocol-specification-v0.2.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON v0.2</a> enabled coexistence and networking for groups of devices. Thanks to Micheal Teeuw's post on his blog, PJON received contributions, testing, debugging and feature requests. Then many talented contributors added support for devices like ESP8266, Teensy 3.2 and Node MCU.

            <h2>2015 - Abstracting the data link</h2>
            <p>
              The community wanted to use PJON over different existing protocols and physical layers, to obtain that without making the implementation complex and more difficult to use I have defined the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strategy</a> abstraction. The curiously recurring template pattern or CRTP was adopted to abstract the physical layer in separate classes called strategies. Thanks to this change from then it was possible to instantiate a PJON object passing the selected data link. Initially, I developed three strategies, a bit-banged implementation of <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/13.0/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang/specification/PJDL-specification-v5.0.md">PJDL</a> called <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang">SoftwareBitBang</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies/OverSampling">OverSampling</a> for radio communication and <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies/AnalogSampling">AnalogSampling</a> able to communicate wirelessly or with optical fiber using off-the-shelf LEDs. Later on, I developed together with Fred Larsen <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies/ThroughSerial">ThroughSerial</a> able to operate through a serial port.

The initial response, especially in the Hackaday's comments, was quite negative - trolls were raging. Only when I joined the discussion and answered openly and sincerely to all the complaints and questions asked, the tone changed dramatically. Well, so dramatically, that in the next comments I got the most praiseworthy compliments I have ever received, those people for sure helped me not to desist. Since then, the PJON protocol specification has been used in academic researches and PhDs in different parts of the world, and the official PJON implementation has already been applied globally in a wide range of different systems.

            <h2>2016 - Let's add a header</h2>
            <p>
              The release of the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/specification/obsolete/PJON-protocol-specification-v0.3.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON v0.3</a> was the result of the most interesting proposal I have received so far, by Fred Larsen, who is a great friend already even if we never met personally. He proposed the addition of a 8 bits header containing a map of the fields contained in the packet and the configuration requested by the sender. At this point we left a fixed configuration scenario, where interoperability was impossible, heading towards a dynamic network architecture. An entire new set of possibilities opened up and users started to make use of this new field.

It became possible to create a PJON network of devices using also an Internet connection. Our constantly growing community has already provided PJON implementations in other programming languages like <a href="https://github.com/Girgitt/PJON-python">PJON-python</a> by Zbigniew Zasieczny and <a href="https://github.com/Matheus-Garbelini/PJON-C">PJON-c</a> by Matheus Garbelini. Thanks to their work, it was for the first time possible to run PJON on a wider range of devices. At the same time the protocol reached its first stable version with the release of the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/specification/obsolete/PJON-protocol-specification-v1.0.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON v1.0</a> which added a lot of new features.

            <h2>2017 - Let's make it universal</h2>
            <p>
              New features brought new objectives: the community wanted to have <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON">PJON</a> working on many different MCUs and real time operative systems although I wanted to avoid code duplication and maintain only one unified implementation. For this reason I defined the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/interfaces">interface</a> abstraction. With interfaces it was for the first time possible to run and cross-compile the same implementation on all supported targets. I developed the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/interfaces/RPI">RPI</a> interface to support Raspberry Pi, after few weeks Zbigniew Zasieczny developed the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/interfaces/WINX86">WINX86</a> interface enabling PJON communication on Windows computers, and soon after, Fred Larsen developed the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/interfaces/LINUX">LINUX</a> interface. In late 2017 I discovered that frame inizialization was missing from both the specification and the implementation and that arbitrary data could have been mistaken for a valid frame. I vividly remember how shocked I was, that was a serious hole, so I quickly found a way to safely identify frames in each strategy. After that was fixed and all seemed perfect I discovered the <a href="https://betterembsw.blogspot.com/2012/02/can-protocol-vulnerabilities.html">length corruption vulnerability</a> that affected PJON and still affects CAN (Controlled Area Network). To close that hole I added an additional CRC8 to protect the header and soon after I released <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/9.0/specification/PJON-protocol-specification-v2.0.md">PJON v2.0</a>.

            <p>
              Although PJON is licensed "AS IS", the more it was applied in the real world, the more I was feeling the responsibility for possible failures. When in 2018 Fred Larsen used PJON and <a href="https://github.com/fredilarsen/ModuleInterface">ModuleInterface</a> to handle the life support systems of his hens' house in Norway I started to be preoccupied for those animals and be finally aware of the potential consequencies and the risks involved in PJON real world applications, specially if dealing with living beings. If for whatever reason the temperature value transmitted was corrupted by interference or because of a bug, the hens could have ended up frozen or roasted. The conception of this possibility pushed me to study deeper the implementation and make better software.

<p>Hey guys, today I am going to talk about some features of the <code>print()</code> function in python. You will probably have come across some of these functions while others could seem new.</p>
<p>Let's start by understanding the basics of the print function. 
In python, the built-in print function is used to print all kinds of stuff - text, numbers, objects, dictionaries etc.
But how does this function handle that ?! You might think; it just can do it, it was made for that. But in reality, the print function in python can only handle strings.</p>
<p>Under the hood, anything you pass to the <code>print()</code> function gets converted to a string before being printed to your screen. That mean it will make use of the <code>str()</code> type casting and convert all other data types to strings before displaying them to your console/terminal.
Now that you know how the <code>print()</code> work, let's dive into its features.</p>
<p>Furthermore, print doesn't know how to print text to the screen. I won't go detail into that for now. Later in this post, you will know what happens under it.</p>
<p>Basically, you can print whatever you want . The simplest example you have come across is <code>print("Hello World!")</code>
It take a string enclosed in double quotes or single quotes and prints it.
You can also print multiple stuff by simply separating them with comas as such :</p>
<pre><code>name = <span>"Mike"</span>
age = <span>24</span>
print(<span>"Hello"</span>, name, <span>"Your age is"</span>, age)

</code></pre>
<p>You can as well print text that takes more than a line. In this case, you will be using the newline escape character <code>\n</code>
Example :</p>
<pre><code>print(<span>"Hello \nWorld"</span>)



</code></pre>
<p>You can also format text with it. Making use of <code>f-strings</code></p>
<pre><code>name = <span>"Samson"</span>
print(<span>f"Hello <span>{name}</span>"</span>)

</code></pre>
<p>The example above showcase the basics of the print function. It can take a variable number of values to print. Other than that, there are also some keyword arguments.
Let's dive into them</p>
<h2 id="1-separator">1. Separator</h2>
<p><code>print()</code> allows you to decide what separates text we print with it. By default, all the values you pass to it are separated by empty strings. But we change that. It suffices to include <code>sep=</code> followed by whatever you want to separate your text.
Let's make use of the previous example.</p>
<pre><code>name = <span>"Mike"</span>
age = <span>24</span>
print(<span>"Hello"</span>, name, <span>"Your age is"</span>, age, sep=<span>"-"</span>)

</code></pre>
<p>You notice that all what we passed into it separately are separated by a <code>-</code>. You can modify that however you want. You just need to make sure the separator is a valid string.</p>
<h2 id="2-ending">2. Ending</h2>
<p>You can specify by whatever you want your output to end with. By default, what you print end with a newline escape character <code>\n</code>. Let's change that and see what happens</p>
<pre><code>
print(<span>"Hello James"</span>)
print(<span>"How are you doing"</span>)





print(<span>"Hello James"</span>, end=<span>""</span>)
print(<span>"How are you doing"</span>, end=<span>""</span>)


</code></pre>
<p>If we execute that, we notice the text is no more separated by a new line. Let's try that again! But this time, we want it to end by <code>y</code> and move to a new line.</p>
<pre><code>print(<span>"Hello James"</span>, end=<span>"y\n"</span>)
print(<span>"How are you doing"</span>, end=<span>"\n"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>We get the following output</p>
<pre><code><span>Hello</span> Jamesy
How are you doingy
</code></pre><p>Yay it worked !</p>
<h2 id="3-writing-to-a-file">3. Writing to a file</h2>
<p>At the beginning of this post, I said python doesn't know how to print stuff to the screen by itself. It rather uses <code>sys.stdout</code> and writes your text to that file. 
Wait what ! Print will write text to a file object which I sent to your screen via <code>sys.stdout</code>. Therefore, you can modify this behaviour too in order to have this printed elsewhere.
Let's give it a try.
Write the following code:</p>
<pre><code><span>with</span> open(<span>"hello.txt"</span>, <span>"w"</span>) <span>as</span> file_object:
        print(<span>"This message is for you"</span>, file=file_object)
</code></pre>
<p>Executing the above will end in a file name <code>hello.text</code> in the same directory with the text <em>This message is for you</em> in it. 
Therefore, we can direct where we want our text to be printed. In this case, we created a file name <code>hello.txt</code> and use the <code>file</code> keyword argument to direct the result to be written to that file rather than our terminal. You can use this to direct any result to wherever you want, even through a socket connection.</p>
<h2 id="4-flushing">4. Flushing</h2>
<p>This one requires an example. Let's have one!</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> time

names = [<span>"John"</span>, <span>"Sylvia"</span>, <span>"Smith"</span>]

<span>for</span> name <span>in</span> names:
    print(name, end=<span>" "</span>)
    time.sleep(<span>1</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>What this code should do is; print a name after a second. Try and run it and see what happens. 
You notice it unexpectedly waits and print all at once.  This is because since it's on a single line, it is all buffered (packed) before we get it. 
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_buffer#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20data,from%20one%20place%20to%20another.&amp;text=However%2C%20a%20buffer%20may%20be,comparable%20to%20buffers%20in%20telecommunication.">Read more about buffers here</a>
But we could go around that by simply adding the <code>flush=</code> keyword argument to the print function. By default it it set to <code>False</code>. Setting it to true will ensure every print statement is executed and freed from buffer before the next one.
The following code will make it :</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> time

names = [<span>"John"</span>, <span>"Sylvia"</span>, <span>"Smith"</span>]

<span>for</span> name <span>in</span> names:
    print(name, end=<span>", "</span>, flush=<span>True</span>)
    time.sleep(<span>1</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>If you run it. It will print a name, sleep for a second and print another, all on the same line. 
Yay we did it !</p>
<p>You have reached the end of this post.

            <p>
            In this post we will tackle Artificial Intelligence with baby steps and try to build a very simple neural net in Java.
            </p>

            <h5 id="what-is-a-neural-net">What is a Neural net?</h5>

            <p>
            A neural net is a software representation of how the brain works. Unfortunately, we do not know as of yet how exactly does the brain really work but we do know a little bit of the biology behind this process: the human brain consists of 100 billion cells called neurons, connected together by synapses. If sufficient synapses connected to a neuron fire, then that neuron will also fire. This process is known as "thinking".
            </p>

            <p>
            We thus try and model the above process using a very simple example that has 3 inputs (synapses) and results in a single output (1 neuron firing).

            <img alt="Neural net example" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/nn-1-simple-problem.png" width="400">
            </p>



            <h5 id="a-simple-problem">A simple problem</h5>

            <p>
            We will train our above neural net to solve the following problem. Can you figure out the pattern and guess what the value of the new input should be? 0 or 1?
            </p>

            <div>
              <table>
              <tbody><tr>
                <th>Examples</th>
                <th colspan="3">Input</th>
                <th>Output</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Example 1</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Example 2</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Example 3</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Example 4</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td colspan="5">&nbsp;</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>New situation</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>?</td>
              </tr>

              </tbody></table>
            </div>

            <p>
            The answer is actually very simply the value of the left-most column, i.e. 1!
            </p>


            <h5 id="training-process">The training process</h5>

            <p>
            So now that we have the model of a human brain, we will try and get our neural net to learn what the pattern is given the training set. We will first assign each input a random number to produce an output.
            </p>

            <p><img alt="Neural net example" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/nn-1-simple-problem-neuron-weights.png" width="400"></p><p>
            The formula for calculating the output is given as follows:
            $$\sum weight_i . input_i = weight1 . input1 + weight2 . input2 + weight3 . input3$$
            </p>

            <p>
            As it turns out we would like to normalize this output value to something between 0 and 1 so that the prediction makes sense. After normalization we compare the output with the expected output of our inputs. This gives us the error, or how far off is our prediction. We can then use this error to slightly adjust the weights of our neural net and try our luck on the same input again. This can be summarized in the following image:
            </p>

            <!--
            <div>
                <a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/img/blog/nn-1-training-process.png">
                    <img class="img-responsive centered img-border" alt="Neural net training process" src="/img/blog/nn-1-training-process.png" />
                </a>
                <div class="img-desc">
                </div>
            </div>
            -->

            <p><img alt="Neural net training process" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/nn-1-training-process.png" width="450"></p><p>
            We repeat this training process for all the inputs <i><b>10,000 times</b></i> to reach a satisfactorily trained neural net. We can then use this neural net to make predictions on new inputs!
            </p>

            <p>
            Before we jump into the implementation however, we still need to clarify how we achieved the normalization and the weight adjustment based on the error (also known as back-propagation).
            </p>

            <h5 id="normalization">Normalization</h5>

            <p>
            In a biologically inspired neural network, the output of a neuron is usually an abstraction representing the rate of action potential firing in the cell. In its simplest form, this is binary value, i.e., either the neuron is firing or not. Hence, the need for normalization of this output value.
            </p>

            <p>
            To achieve this normalization we apply what is known as an activation function to the output of the neuron. If we take the example of a really simple Heaviside step function which assigns a 0 to any negative value and a 1 to any positive value, then a large number of neurons would be required to achieve the required granularity of slowly adjusting the weights to reach an acceptable consensus of the training set.
            </p>

            <p>
            As we will see in the next section on back-propagation, this concept of slowly adjusting the weights can be represented mathematically as the slope of the activation function. In biological terms, it can be thought of as the increase in firing rate that occurs as input current increases. If we were to use a linear function instead of the Heaviside function, then we would find that the resulting network would have an unstable convergence because neuron inputs along favored paths would tend to increase without bound, as a linear function is not normalizable.
            </p>

            <p>
            All problems mentioned above can be handled by using a normalizable sigmoid activation function. One realistic model stays at zero until input current is received, at which point the firing frequency increases quickly at first, but gradually approaches an asymptote at 100% firing rate. Mathematically, this looks like:
            $$ \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} $$
            </p>

            <p>
            If plotted on a graph, the Sigmoid function draws an S shaped curve:
            </p>

            <p><img alt="sigmoid plot" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/nn-1-sigmoid-plot.png" width="450"></p><p>
            Thus, the final formula for the output of a neuron now becomes
            $$ Output = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\sum weight_i . input_i)}} $$
            </p>

            <p>
            There are other normalization functions that we can use but the sigmoid has the advantage of being fairly simple and also having a simple derivative which will be useful when we look at the back propagation below.
            </p>

            <h5 id="back-propagation">Back-propagation</h5>

            <p>
            During the training cycle, we adjusted the weights depending on the error. To do this, we can use the "Error weighted derivative" formula
            $$ Adjustment = error . input . SigmoidCurveGradient(output) $$
            </p>

            <p>
            The reason we use this formula is that firstly, we want to make the adjustment proportional to the size of the error. Secondly, we multiply by the input, which is either a 0 or a 1. If the input is 0, the weight isn’t adjusted. Finally, we multiply by the gradient of the Sigmoid curve (or the derivative).
            </p>

            <p>
            The reason that we use the gradient is because we are trying to minimize the loss. Specifically, we do this by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">gradient descent method</a>. It basically means that from our current point in the parameter space (determined by the complete set of current weights), we want to go in a direction which will decrease the loss function. Visualize standing on a hillside and walking down the direction where the slope is steepest. The gradient descent method as applied to our neural net is illustrated as follows:
            </p><ol>
                <li>If the output of the neuron is a large positive or negative number, it signifies the neuron was quite confident one way or another.</li>
                <li>From the sigmoid plot, we can see that at large numbers the Sigmoid curve has a shallow gradient.</li>
                <li>Thus, if the neuron is confident that the existing weight is correct, it doesn’t want to adjust it very much and multiplying by the gradient of the sigmoid curve achieves this.</li>
            </ol>
            

            <p>
            The derivative of the sigmoid function is given by the following formula
            $$ SigmoidCurveGradient(output) = output . (1 - output) $$
            Substituting this back into the adjustment formula gives us
            $$ Adjustment = error . input . output . (1 - output) $$
            </p>

            <h5 id="code">Code</h5>

            <p>
            An important but subtle point that was missed out when explaining the mathematics above was that for each training iteration, the mathematical operations are done on the entire training set at the same time. Thus, we will make use of matrices to store the set of input vectors, the weights and the expected outputs.
            </p>

            <p>
            You can grab the entire project source here: <a href="https://github.com/wheresvic/neuralnet">https://github.com/wheresvic/neuralnet</a>. For the sake of learning, we implemented all the math ourselves using only the standard java Math functions :)
            </p>

            <p>
            We will begin with the <code>NeuronLayer</code> class which is just a placeholder for the weights in our neural net implementation. We provide it with the number of inputs per neuron and the number of neurons which it can use to build a table of the weights. In our current example, this is very simply the last output neuron which has the 3 input neurons.
            </p>

<pre>public class NeuronLayer {

    public final Function<double, double=""> activationFunction, activationFunctionDerivative;

    double[][] weights;

    public NeuronLayer(int numberOfNeurons, int numberOfInputsPerNeuron) {
        weights = new double[numberOfInputsPerNeuron][numberOfNeurons];

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfInputsPerNeuron; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j &lt; numberOfNeurons; ++j) {
                weights[i][j] = (2 * Math.random()) - 1; // shift the range from 0-1 to -1 to 1
            }
        }

        activationFunction = NNMath::sigmoid;
        activationFunctionDerivative = NNMath::sigmoidDerivative;
    }

    public void adjustWeights(double[][] adjustment) {
        this.weights = NNMath.matrixAdd(weights, adjustment);
    }
}
</double,></pre>

            <p>
            Our neural net class is where all the action happens. It takes as a constructor the <code>NeuronLayer</code> and has 2 main functions:
            </p><ul>
                <li><code>think</code>: calculates the outputs of a given input set</li>
                <li><code>train</code>: runs the training loop <code>numberOfTrainingIterations</code> times (usually a high number like 10,000). Note that the training itself involves calculating the output and then adjusting the weights accordingly</li>
            </ul>
            

<pre>public class NeuralNetSimple {

    private final NeuronLayer layer1;
    private double[][] outputLayer1;

    public NeuralNetSimple(NeuronLayer layer1) {
        this.layer1 = layer1;
    }

    public void think(double[][] inputs) {
        outputLayer1 = apply(matrixMultiply(inputs, layer1.weights), layer1.activationFunction);
    }

    public void train(double[][] inputs, double[][] outputs, int numberOfTrainingIterations) {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfTrainingIterations; ++i) {

            // pass the training set through the network
            think(inputs);

            // adjust weights by error * input * output * (1 - output)

            double[][] errorLayer1 = matrixSubtract(outputs, outputLayer1);
            double[][] deltaLayer1 = …</pre></div></div>

<p>When your father suffers a heart attack and needs emergency surgery, who would you rather have operating on him?</p>



<p>An inspiring doctor who lost an arm in a tragic car accident, and still heroically manages to attain an average level of success as a surgeon?<br>Or the son of a multimillionaire who has breezed through life with minimal setbacks, and boasts one of the best surgical track records?</p>



<hr>



<p>There is a common perception that a meritocracy is the most fair way to run society. That because we are avoiding bias and favoritism and picking candidates purely based on their capabilities and achievements, a meritocratic system is the most fair of all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such a belief is hogwash. There’s nothing “fair” about not selecting the surgeon who lost his arm in a car accident, and is now trying desperately to hold on to his career. There’s nothing fair about the fact that some people are born into good circumstances which confer a tremendous headstart in life. There’s nothing fair about the fact that so many of society’s most accomplished individuals grew up in upper-middle-class families that nurtured them, raised them well, and gave them access to highly regarded schools and teachers.</p>



<p>A meritocracy never was, and never will be, “fair”. <strong>And that’s the whole point.</strong></p>



<p>The reason meritocracies work so well, is not because they are fair, but because they produce peak performance.</p>



<p>NFL teams draft the “best” players they can find, because they know that’s how they can win the most games. Universities grant tenure to the most productive professors, because that will best enhance the University’s reputation, and further the frontiers of knowledge. Hospitals hire the best doctors, because they can save the most lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hiring people who are “good enough” is simply not good enough. There has never been, and never will be, a team that won the world cup by selecting players who are “good enough.” And what’s true for a kid’s game, is doubly true for our society. A society should delegate its jobs to those who are smartest, most capable, and most accomplished in that field. Because they are the ones who can best lead society through the worldly challenges we face everyday. Corrupting this process by discriminating on the basis of family ties, personal friendships, wealth, race, or gender, is simply cutting your nose to spite your face.</p>



<p>Which is not to say that “fairness” and Social Justice isn’t important. It is vital. But you don’t get to it by hiring less qualified candidates. By turning down the best possible candidate in favor of someone who is more sympathetic and “good enough”. A meritocracy excels at producing wealth and economic prosperity. Universal basic income, universal healthcare, unemployment insurance, better public schooling and free job trainings… these are the kind of Social Justice programs that can share the resulting prosperity among everyone.</p>



<p>Social justice teaches us how to distribute the pie fairly, so that no one is left behind. This is absolutely essential, and something we should always keep in mind. But social justice doesn’t have all the answers on how to grow the pie in the first place. And unless we harness the power of a meritocracy to keep the pie growing, we will all soon be fighting over scraps.</p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25485766" target="_blank"><em>Discussion thread on HackerNews</em></a></p>



<p><em><strong>Addendum</strong>: This article’s thesis is that we should select/hire candidates who will perform best in the role, regardless of their personal circumstances. Many have mentioned that traditional methods of assessment may be flawed, incomplete, or biased. In accordance with the thesis, we should certainly strive to refine our assessment methods, and continually make them more accurate. This article is certainly not stating that current methods of assessment are perfect.</em></p>



<p><em>Many have also brought up the point that personal circumstances often do impact job performance. For example, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/diversity-work-group-performance" target="_blank">some studies have suggested that diverse teams perform better than homogenous teams</a>, especially in certain job roles. If you are an ardent believer in improving team performance, this would mean taking into account any demographic info that would help the organization perform better. This is also a double-edged sword for a couple reasons:<br>1. By legalizing the use of race or gender as a factor in hiring decisions, you would also be enabling prejudiced employers who discriminate against women or minorities, for purely bigoted reasons<br>2. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/05/the_downside_of_diversity/" target="_blank">Studies have also found that communities operate better in some ways, when they are more homogenous</a>. If more such studies are unearthed in future, the same reasoning above could be used to justify discriminating against all women and people of color. Something most of us, including myself, would consider to be dystopian.</em></p>

<![CDATA[Efficient Navigation in Vim]]>

December 20, 2020 | https://blog.bespinian.io/posts/efficient-navigation-in-vim/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.bespinian.io/posts/efficient-navigation-in-vim/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>When editing a file, it is quite crucial that you can navigate your cursor around rather quickly. <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and <a href="https://neovim.io/">NeoVim</a> allow for many different ways of doing so which, depending on the situation, can be more or less efficient and useful. This article examines the different ways of moving the cursor and compares them. Here, the term “efficiency” refers to navigating the cursor with as little time and effort (i.e. the number of keystrokes) as possible.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-mouse">Using the Mouse</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Not recommended</strong></p>
<p>Using the mouse pointer to navigate Vim may seem like an obvious choice for users coming from a GUI editor like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> or similar. However, in Vim, the goal is to keep your fingers on the “home row” of the keyboard (the row where the <code>F</code> and the <code>J</code> keys reside) and not having to move them greatly towards the touchpad or even the mouse. This should reduce the strain on your hands and wrists and make editing more efficient. Therefore, navigating with the mouse should be highly discouraged in most situations and is even disabled by default.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to enable it for users transitioning from one of the aforementioned editors who would like to have a smooth transition by allowing themselves to use the mouse initially and switching it back off again later in their learning journey. To turn on mouse navigation, add the following to your configuration file (either <code>~/.vimrc</code> or <code>~/.config/nvim/init.vim</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Temporarily enable mouse support</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>mouse</span>=<span>a</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This will allow you to point and click to move the cursor and to scroll through the current buffer.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-arrow-keys">Using the Arrow Keys</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Not recommended</strong></p>
<p>Again, for users used to other text editors or even word processing software like <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/">LibreOffice Writer</a>, it may be tempting to use what they know. In these programs, you mostly use the arrow keys for keyboard-based navigation. This is not recommended because… you guessed it: They require the user to move their fingers away from the home row.</p>
<p>The alternative is, as described in the next section, to use the <code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code> and <code>l</code> keys on the keyboard which are conveniently placed at the center and where you most likely have your fingers most of the time.</p>
<h2 id="using-hjkl">Using h,j,k,l</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Use for small navigations. Use in combination with relative line numbers.</strong></p>
<p><code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code> and <code>l</code> are the basic movement keys in Vim. They should be used instead of the usual arrow keys on the keyboard to, as discussed above, keep your fingers on the home row as much as possible. It takes a little practice but will pay off in the long run.</p>
<p>One hugely important thing to do with these keys is to not press them multiple times in sequence or even hold them down to move several columns or rows. As with many commands in Vim, they can be prefixed with numbers to move multiple times. For example, <code>12j</code> can be used rather than pressing the <code>j</code> key twelve times which is, obviously, much more efficient (3 vs. 12 keystrokes). However, it is recommendable to only use these keys for small movements and mostly to move lines up or down because there are more efficient ways of moving longer vertical distances or horizontal distances in general.</p>
<p>It can be very useful to enable relative line numbers to see at a glance what number to prefix <code>j</code> or <code>k</code> with to move to a certain line. They can be enabled by adding the following two lines to your configuration file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Enable relative line numbers</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>relativenumber</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>number</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This will always show the absolute number of the line the cursor is currently on and relative numbers for all others.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-within-a-line">Navigation Within a Line</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Mostly use <code>f</code>. Also consider <code>w</code>,<code>b</code>,<code>e</code>,<code>^</code> and <code>$</code>.</strong></p>
<p>So far, we’ve mostly looked at navigating from one line to another. The next step is to navigate within a line. In many cases, the straight forward thing to do is to use <code>w</code> or <code>W</code> to move to the next word, <code>b</code> or <code>B</code> to move to the previous word or even <code>e</code> or <code>E</code> to move directly to the end of the next word. For all of them, the lowercase variant considers a “word” to be what we intuitively see as one using delimiters like <code>-</code>, <code>/</code> or <code>.</code> to separate one word from another. The uppercase variant considers anything a word that is delimited by whitespace. Obviously, any of these commands can be prefixed with a number to jump multiple words in one go (e.g. <code>7w</code>). Other useful commands are <code>^</code> which moves to the first non-whitespace character of the line and <code>$</code> to move to the last character of a line. Considering the following line</p>
<p>with the cursor currently on the <code>g</code> character, pressing the following commands is the most efficient way to get to a specific target character:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Target Character</th>
<th>Command</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>j</code></td>
<td><code>2w</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td><code>W</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>d</code></td>
<td><code>B</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>i</code></td>
<td><code>e</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>l</code></td>
<td><code>E</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>a</code></td>
<td><code>^</code> or <code>0</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>o</code></td>
<td><code>$</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When moving multiple words back and forth or to a specific place within a word, <code>t</code> and <code>f</code> are incredibly helpful. Especially <code>f</code> moves to the next occurrence of a specific character which lets you make big jumps within a line. The difference is that <code>f</code> moves to a character and <code>t</code> moves to right before a character. So <code>t</code> is mostly useful for deleting everything to a character. These commands' uppercase variants <code>F</code> and <code>T</code> do the same thing but backwards. All of these commands can be “repeated” with the <code>;</code> command which jumps to the next occurrence of the targeted character while <code>,</code> jumps to the previous one.</p>
<p>Another command worth mentioning at this point is <code>%</code> which you can use when a character which is part of a pair (e.g. <code>[</code> or <code>}</code>) is currently under your cursor. The <code>%</code> command will take the cursor to the corresponding “partner” of that character in the pair. So placing the cursor on a <code>(</code> and then executing this command will take you to its closing <code>)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="changelist-and-jumplist">Changelist and Jumplist</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Use <code>ctrl+o</code> and <code>ctrl+i</code> to jump “back” and “forward”. Use <code>g;</code> to jump to last edit.</strong></p>
<p>The jumplist contains all the points in any buffer you recently jumped to (e.g. with <code>12j</code>). It can be accessed with <code>:jumps</code>. The commands to jump back and forth in the jumplist are <code>ctrl+o</code> and <code>ctrl+i</code> respectively. They can be very useful because they act like the “back” and “forward” buttons in a web browser.</p>
<p>The changelist on the other hand contains all the points in the current buffer where you have recently changed something. It can be accessed with the <code>:changes</code> command. A very useful command here is <code>g;</code> which jumps to the last place where you have changed something (i.e. jumps back in the changelist). <code>g,</code> on the other hand takes you back to where you were before (i.e. jumps forward in the changelist). This allows you to easily switch back and forth between a point of reference (e.g. some documentation) and the place where you are currently editing.</p>
<h2 id="search">Search</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Great for moving larger distances vertically and horizontally</strong></p>
<p>By far one of the most efficient ways of moving longer distances horizontally and vertically in a buffer is to use the search. The <code>/</code> key lets you search for a term and conveniently jump to its location. Pressing the <code>n</code> and <code>N</code> keys jumps to the next and previous occurrence of the search term respectively. The <code>?</code> key searches backwards from the current cursor position (which inverts <code>n</code> and <code>N</code>). Even though, the main purpose of the search command is obviously to search, it is an incredibly powerful tool to navigate quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>The user experience of the search command can be vastly improved by adding the following settings to your configuration file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Incrementally search while typing</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>incsearch</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>" Use smart case for searching</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>ignorecase</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>smartcase</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>" Highlight searches</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>hlsearch</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>" Use &lt;C-L&gt; to clear the highlighting of :set hlsearch.</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>if</span> <span>maparg</span>(<span>'&lt;C-L&gt;'</span>, <span>'n'</span>) ==# <span>''</span><span>
</span><span></span>  <span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>C</span>-<span>L</span>&gt; :<span>nohlsearch</span>&lt;<span>C</span>-<span>R</span>&gt;=<span>has</span>(<span>'diff'</span>)?<span>'&lt;Bar&gt;diffupdate'</span>:<span>''</span>&lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;&lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;&lt;<span>C</span>-<span>L</span>&gt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>endif</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p><code>incsearch</code> will make sure that the search pattern is applied incrementally while typing instead of only after pressing the enter key. The combination of <code>ignorecase</code> and <code>smartcase</code> ignores the case of the search term when not using any uppercase letters and doesn’t ignore it when using at least one uppercase letter which is quite convenient and surprisingly intuitive. <code>hlsearch</code> highlights any matches for the search term allowing to easily jump between them using <code>n</code> and <code>N</code>. The last statement lets you clear the highlighted search results by pressing <code>ctrl+l</code> to unclutter your view once done searching and jumping.</p>
<p>All in all, search is one of the most powerful tools for intuitive and efficient navigation. It covers the common use case of knowing the word or part of a word to navigate to but not having your eyes directly pointed there yet. Furthermore, it’s simply the fastest way of jumping somewhere in many cases and beats other methods of navigation quite often in that regard.</p>
<h2 id="clunky-movements">Clunky Movements</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Use for very specific use cases only. Consider <code>gg</code> and <code>G</code> for getting to know a file.</strong></p>
<p>In this section we’ll discuss what can be referred to as “clunky movements”. They let the user navigate larger distances in the buffer while sacrificing precision. These commands are less useful for exactly that reason. Vim can be a very efficient text editor by letting the user think about what they want to change, jumping precisely there with very few keystrokes, entering insert mode, performing a change with scalpel-like precision and finally exiting insert mode as soon as it’s done. The movement commands in this section however, get the cursor around the document as a whole while it’s hard for the user to predict at a glance, which line and column exactly they will land on.</p>
<p>A good example are the <code>H</code>, <code>M</code> and <code>L</code> keys which take the cursor to the top, the middle or the bottom of the current view port respectively. While this is a very big movement with just one keystroke, it’s highly likely that they won’t exactly get the cursor to the line needed but rather will have to be accompanied by pressing <code>j</code> or <code>k</code> multiple times which will result in much more thinking and many more keystrokes than what can be achieved with other methods. Similar are the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> keys which take the cursor to the next paragraph (a block of text delimited by blank lines).</p>
<p>A useful exception to that are the <code>gg</code> and <code>G</code> commands which take the cursor to …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I said in my <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/blog/2020/10/25/canframe_py_tool/">previous blog post</a> that
“My next goal is to create a
GTKWave filter so that an arbitrary waveform can be decoded” and in an early
Christmas present to those who are into the CAN protocol, I’ve done that!
But I’ve done even better and I therefore present to you <strong>the new CAN
protocol decoder</strong> for the Sigrok project.</p>

<p>First, a quick summary of <a href="https://sigrok.org/">Sigrok</a>:
it’s a set of drivers and tools that
provide a desktop oscilloscope / logic analyzer UI for many, many different
instruments (from Siglent, Rigol and others). The UI runs on
Mac, Windows and Linux (and others) and the GUI is called PulseView (there’s
also a command-line tool for batch decoding, useful for an automated test
environment). 
PulseView has an API for protocol decoders, and I’ve wrtten one for CAN: it’s called <code>can2</code>.</p>

<p>A couple of quick bear trap warnings for using PulseView before I
talk about <code>can2</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t use the Sigrok package that comes with your Linux distro: it’s very
likely to be too old and there have been lots of changed; download binaries directly.</li>
  <li>If importing a VCD file make sure the Downsampling factor is set so that the logic analyzer sample period is no more than about 1ns. If you don’t and you feed it a VCD that came from a simulator that used 1ps steps then your PC is going to spinning up its fans for a long time!</li>
</ul>

<p>OK, back to the protocol decoder it can be installed by
copying the directory <code>can2</code> (containing two Python files) into
the directory (on Linux) <code>~/.local/share/libsigrokdecode/decoders</code>.</p>

<p>The decoder appears in the decoders list as “CAN 2.0” and it requires just one
input: the CAN RX line (from the RX pin of a CAN transceiver).
The options include the sampling point (default 75%) and the bit rate
(default 500kbit/sec).</p>

<p>When the decoder is applied to a CAN signal on it 
then then the output is like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://kentindell.github.io/assets/pulseview1.png" alt="PulseView screenshot"></p>

<p>The top row of the decoder output (“CAN 2.0: Bits”) shows the CAN bits
(regular and stuff bits). A tooltip will
appear giving the bit value if the mouse pointer is hovered over the bit
(PulseView automatically displays the information it can in the space available
at a given zoom level).</p>

<p>The next row shows the CAN fields: the first bit is SOF (Start of Frame),
the next is the 11-bit ID, and so on. A frame ends with the IFS field.
Two other states are not shown: Bus Integration (where the decoder is syncing
to the CAN signal from a reset state) and Idle (where nothing is happening).</p>

<p>The third row shows the full CAN ID (if the frame is an extended frame -
i.e. IDE=1 - then there is a second 18-bit field, and the ID is then
29 bits long). The row also shows the payload decoded into individual bytes.</p>

<p>The fourth row is the really interesting one: it shows information about
the CAN frame. In the screenshot, it displays an “E” to indicate an
error flag. The tooltip says “Form error”, which means that the field
contains the wrong value: it is read as a dominant (0) bit and it should
be recessive (1). This is an indication of an error, and the decoder
shows that the subsequent bits are an Error Flag followed by an Error
Delimiter, and then IFS again.</p>

<p>The info row also shows other interesting events, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the frame has been received OK (i.e. second to last bit of EOF)</li>
  <li>When the frame has been transmitted OK (i.e. last bit of EOF)</li>
  <li>If there is an ACK error (i.e. the ACK bit is not 0)</li>
  <li>If the received CRC doesn’t match the calculated CRC (the protocol decoder
keeps track of the expected CRC value)</li>
  <li>If there is a ‘double receive’ (i.e. there is an error after the frame
has been received OK but before the frame has been transmitted OK)</li>
  <li>If there is an overload rather than an error. Modern CAN controllers should
never generate overload frames so to see one means that something odd is
going on. To see two in a row means something <em>very</em> odd is going on.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last two are symptoms of protocol attacks: the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/2020/01/20/new-can-hacks/">Double Receive Attack</a>
and the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/2020/01/20/new-can-hacks/">Freeze Doom Loop Attack</a>. 
The <a href="https://github.com/kentindell/canhack">CANHack toolkit</a> can actually
generate these attacks (and a whole bunch of other attacks)
and so the <code>can2</code> protocol decoder is a good starting
point if an attack on the CAN bus is suspected.</p>

<p>The CAN Double Receive problem isn’t just a symptom of an attack: it can 
happen for real, and is a consequence of CAN’s
amazingly useful <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/2020/07/11/can-atomic-multicast/">atomic broadcast</a> property (very few
communications protocols provide this and it’s an essential building block
for robust mission-critical applications). So my top
tip for anyone building a CAN-based application: for any frame that includes
event-based data (like a command) then include a sequence number (it can
be just one bit) so that duplicates can be detected and discarded. Doing
this doesn’t just fix a wrinkle in the protocol, it also defends against
the Double Receive Attack.</p>

<p>Finally, a couple of things about the decoder. It doesn’t implement the
CAN time quanta bit sampling scheme (where sync is limited by the SJW
parameter) but it does implement the sync rules (in particular, glitches after
a bit is sampled as 0 are ignored). Also, <code>can2</code> goes into
Bus Integration if it samples the CAN r0 bit as recessive, which means that
CAN FD frames are ignored and skipped over rather than causing the decoder
to get scrambled (incidentally, this is why CAN FD can’t share a bus with
classic CAN 2.0 controllers).</p>

<p>Oh, one last thing: anyone wanting a GTKWave filter for CAN could use this
<a href="https://gist.github.com/smunaut/4239a17ea116d5ddfdaecad381f712e9#file-gtkwave-sigrok-filter-py">neat little tool</a> to turn the <code>can2</code> Sigrok decoder into exactly that.</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi Rack Server Mark I и Mark II have been working pretty nice for 6 month already. Both of them are based on a model which I found on <a href="https://thingiverse.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://thingiverse.com">thingiverse.com</a> and inherited the basic design idea.</p>



<p>With Mark III, I completely rethought the design, which allowed to:</p>



<ul><li>increase the number of raspberries in 2 rack units</li><li>significantly reduce printing time and plastic consumption</li><li>significantly reduce the time required for assembling and disassembling the server</li><li>reduce the number of parts</li><li>implement a modular design, which means that MARK III will be available in various modifications</li></ul>



<p>I’m glad to present the first basic model, designed for 14x of Raspberry Pi and 14x of a standard 2.5″ SSD.</p>



<p>BTW I will be glad if you subscribe to my instagram <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/uptime.lab/" target="_blank">instagram.com/uptime.lab</a> your feedback and likes are very important for me!</p>

      <div><p>&gt; 1194 words, 32 paragraphs, about 4 minutes to read (300 wpm).</p><p>&gt; First published on 2020-11-16.</p><p>&gt; This article has been loaded 2378 times.</p><p>This post will require a lot of in-knowledge to understand. It's okay if you have no idea what I'm talking about.</p><div><p><span> ##</span></p><h2>The supposed differences of the fediverse</h2></div><p>When someone tries to explain the fediverse to someone who doesn't know what it is, chances are they'll be saying that it's like traditional corporate social media, but with these differences:</p><div><ul><li>open source</li><li>federated (and what that means)</li><li>lots of LGBT people on it</li></ul></div><div><p><span> ##</span></p><h2>The real similarities of the fediverse</h2></div><p>Those things are true. But I don't believe they make a difference to how people interact with the site on a fundamental level.</p><p>What do you do on Twitter Dot Com? You scroll down and look at other people's shitty posts. Sometimes you even press the buttons on them. What do you do on the fediverse? You scroll down and look at other people's shitty posts. Sometimes you even press the buttons on them.</p><p>It's the same feedback loop and it creates a very similar feel and environment. After all, that loop is exactly what Mastodon and Pleroma were designed to replicate.</p><p>Federation is touted as a good thing which splits users into separate communities organised by topics. Communities then have to try a little harder to reach across to each other. It's never stated, but the implication is that there's a whole spectrum and variety of communities, and that they're somehow equal in some kind of democratic society.</p><p>In reality, what happens is that 5 very different, distinct, and clearly identifiable varieties of communities emerge. Please see my diagram:</p><p>(Despite the assumptions one might make from the "political compass" format, these are distinct quadrants with solid borders, not sliding scales across the lines.)</p><p>(That chart does not include the 5th segment on it. The 5th segment is the centrists. My commentary about them wouldn't fit in the space.)</p><p>The centrists just use the social media as a social media. They talk about themselves, and others, and what they saw on the news. They don't get involved with the drama between the quadrants. They're likely blissfully unaware of it. They just want to grill for god's sake.</p><p>It's a simple life, and in my opinion, one to be envied.</p><p>In the red zone, we have the likes of hellsite.site, who post more about the network itself and engaging in blocking warfare against the latest suspicious user and the latest suspicious site, than actually making posts and using the social media for a reason.</p><p>Let me try to put this another way. They're trying to create a safe space online, which is a laudable goal. I can appreciate a safe space. But the problem is that they're so focused on trying to curate the perfect social media that they haven't thought about what they're going to do once they actually manage to create that space. They're too caught up in the inter-site hellscape. And if the only thing that they post about is commentary on drama from the spaces they're excluding... is it really a safe space, if the war is the only thing visible?</p><p>Of course, the social media utopia that they aim for will never exist. Blocking sites doesn't work: there will always be something more to block. Instance allowlists get closer, but they'll still never be perfect. There will always be that one user on that one site that did something bad and now everyone hates them. But they're part of an allowed site. Can't get rid of them entirely. What to do? Ah yes, aggressively subpost about them on your timeline. _That'll_ solve the problem! Finally: a safe space!</p><p>While this war continues, there will never be anything but the war to post about. They are fighting for nothing. If they win, which won't happen, it would just be over. The reason they exist would have ended. They are fighting because they exist to fight.</p><p>The red zone is a very tiring existence, and I'm pleased to be rid of it.</p><p>In the purple zone, the only fucking thing they know is technology and "freedom". Christ. How awful.</p><p>Obviously the blue zone is abhorrent.</p><p>The left quadrant is where I find myself nowadays.</p><p>If you run a fediverse site that other people can join as members, then there are exactly two reasons to blanket block another site for all your members.</p><div><ul><li>At least 2 users on the other site are harassing at least 2 of your own members, and the moderators on the other site are not helping.</li><li>Or, the site is dedicated to hosting hate speech.</li></ul></div><p>Otherwise... what's the point?</p><p>The thing is that many things make up a fediverse site.</p><div><ul><li>The site's rules</li><li>The moderators</li><li>The people on it</li></ul></div><p>The people and their behaviour is the most important aspect of any site. If you as a moderator are considering blocking a site, what you are doing is depriving your members of the choice of who to interact with. Mastodon has powerful controls in the hands of the users. Users can block people, users can block entire sites. They can do this themselves. They don't need you to do it for them - unless there's a bigger problem of uncontrolled harassment.</p><p>Uncontrolled harassment is the only use case for a domain block. Did you see one specific person on another site who is being annoying or has really terrible takes? Of course, we've all seen that one person. But WHO THE FUCK CARES. If they aren't specifically being annoying at your members, just live and let live. They can exist in their own world. You don't need to care about them.

<p>Quite a while ago, Santa got a feature request for a web application called <a href="https://www.agrammon.ch/en">AGRAMMON</a>, developed by the elves of one of his sub-contractors <a href="https://www.oetiker.ch/">Oetiker+Partner AG</a> in what then was called Perl 5. When Santa asked the <a href="https://www.oetiker.ch/en/company/team/fz">elf responsible</a> for this application to get to work, the elf suggested that some refactoring was in order, as the application dated back almost 10 years and had been extended regularly.</p>



<p>As the previous year had seen a real Christmas wonder, namely the <a href="https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2015/12/">release of Perl 6c</a>, the elf suggested, that instead of bolting yet another feature onto the web application’s Perl backend, a rewrite in Perl 6 would be a bold but also appropriate move. The reason being that the application used a specially developed format for describing it’s functionality by none-programmers. What better choice for rewriting the parser than Perl 6’s grammars, the elf reasoned. Fittingly, the new AGRAMMON was going to be version 6.</p>



<p>When Santa asked when the rewrite would be finished, the elf’s obivous answer was “by Christmas”. And as things went in Perl 6 land, by the time the rewrite is finally going into production, the backend is now implemented in Raku.</p>



<h2><a href="https://github.com/zaucker/agrammon/blob/Advent/Advent2020/raku-in-the-wild.md#agrammon"></a>AGRAMMON</h2>



<p>Most people nowadays know about the negative side-effects of agriculture on climate, namely emissions of methane and nitrous oxide (strong greenhouse gases) and deforestation. A lesser known, but also significant environmental problem, are ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) and nitrous oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) emissions. For the agricultural production, NH<sub>3</sub> is a major gaseous pollutant while NO<sub>x</sub> is of minor importance.</p>



<p>The main source of these emissions are excretions of farm animals, mainly from cattle, pigs, and poultry. Both liquid and solid manure contain nitrogen compounds such as urea. These compounds are decomposing when the excretions are deposited onto the farm surfaces, subsequently stored in manure stores, and when applied to the field as fertilizer.</p>



<p>In addition to induce negative environmental impacts, these emissions entail a substantial loss of nitrogen (N) from manure and either result in diminished productivity of farms or the loss must be compensated by mineral fertilizers at additional costs to the farmers. In Switzerland alone, about 40,000 tonnes of nitrogen are lost every year, amounting to about 30% of the N load in manure.</p>



<p>In order to address these problems, the processes of ammonia volatilisation are studied, emission mitigation options developed, and the effects measured where possible under controlled conditions. However, as controlled conditions are difficult to implement at farm-scale, the effects of the reduction measures as well as the total amount of emissions can be simulated by model calculations. AGRAMMON is a tool that facilitates such simulations at the scale of a single farm. Such calculations can also be done at regional scale by means of simulating “typical farm types” using average process types and cumulated numbers of animals, storage facilities, and fertilizer application. The following picture shows the processes simulated by the model:</p>



<figure><a href="https://github.com/zaucker/agrammon/blob/Advent/Advent2020/N-model.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://github.com/zaucker/agrammon/raw/Advent/Advent2020/N-model.jpg" alt=""></a><figcaption>The model Agrammon calculates ammonia loss on the basis of the N-flux (mass-flow model). For the stages housing/yard, manure store, manure application, and other sources the loss is calculated by using emission rates as a proportion of the total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) in the system. For slurry stores, an emission rate per m2 of surface area of the slurry store is used. Important production variables such as feed, housing system, covering of slurry store or emission-mitigating application systems are taken into account in emission rates as correction factors.</figcaption></figure>







<h2>The Application</h2>



<p>AGRAMMON is a typical web application, with data stored in a PostgreSQL database, a web frontend implemented in JavaScript using the <a href="https://qooxdoo.org/">Qooxdoo framework</a> , and a Raku backend. The physical and chemical processes are not directly implemented in the backend, but as already mentioned in a none-programmer-friendly custom “language”, describing (user) inputs, model parameters, calculations, and outputs (results).</p>



<p>Each process is broken down into smaller sub-processes and each is described in its own file, including documentation and references to appropriate scientific sources. Here is a small example for such a file:</p>


<pre title="">*** general ***

author   = Agrammon Group
date     = 2008-03-30
taxonomy = Livestock::DairyCow::Excretion

+short

Computes the annual N excretion of a number of dairy cows as a function of the
milk yield and the feed ration.

+description

This process calculates the annual N excretion (total N and Nsol (urea plus
measured total ammoniacal nitrogen)) of a number of dairy cows as a
function of the milk yield and the supplied feed ration. Nitrogen
surpluses from increased nitrogen uptake are primarily excreted as
Nsol in the urine. Eighty percent of the increased N excretion is
therefore added to the Nsol fraction.

<p>In the current version of the AGRAMMON model there are 133 such model files with 31,014 lines. From those, the backend can generate</p>



<ul><li>the PDF documentation of the model (allowing <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> formatting in the files)</li><li>the actual model simulation using the user’s input data</li><li>a description of the web GUI which can be rendered by the frontend</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://github.com/zaucker/agrammon/blob/Advent/Advent2020/inputs.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://github.com/zaucker/agrammon/raw/Advent/Advent2020/inputs.png" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>The results are presented in the web GUI in tabular form (showing various subsets of the data that can also be defined in the model files)</p>



<figure><a href="https://github.com/zaucker/agrammon/blob/Advent/Advent2020/results.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://github.com/zaucker/agrammon/raw/Advent/Advent2020/results.png" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>and can be exported as <a href="https://github.com/zaucker/agrammon/blob/Advent/Advent2020/TestSingle6.pdf">PDF report</a> or <a href="https://github.com/zaucker/agrammon/blob/Advent/Advent2020/TestSingle6.xlsx">Excel file</a>, together with the actual inputs provided by the user.</p>



<p>A special instance of AGRAMMON is used by a <a href="https://lawa.lu.ch/">regional government agency</a> in the evaluation process of the environmental impact of modifications to local farms and the approval of the respective building applications. For this, the ammonia emissions before and after the planned modifications must be simulated by the applicant and can be directly submitted to the agency’s AGRAMMON account, including a notification of the agency by eMail with the PDF report attached.</p>



<h2><a href="https://github.com/zaucker/agrammon/blob/Advent/Advent2020/raku-in-the-wild.md#the-raku-backend"></a>The Raku backend</h2>



<p>The refactored backend as of today consists of 59 <code>.pm6</code> <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/modules">modules/packages</a> with 6,942 lines and is covered by tests in 38 <code>.t</code> files with 5,854 lines. It uses the 13 Raku modules shown in the following excerpt of the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/modules#index-entry-META6.json-META6.json">META6.json</a> file:</p>


<pre title="">  "depends": [
    "Cro::HTTP",
    "Cro::HTTP::Session::Pg",
    "Cro::OpenAPI::RoutesFromDefinition",
    "Cro::WebApp::Template",
    "DB::Pg",
    "Digest::SHA1::Native",
    "Email::MIME",
    "LibXML:ver&lt;0.5.10&gt;",
    "Net::SMTP::Client::Async",
    "OO::Monitors",
    "Spreadsheet::XLSX:ver&lt;0.2.1+&gt;",
    "Text::CSV",
    "YAMLish"
  ],
  "build-depends": [],
  "test-depends": [
    "App::Prove6",
    "Cro::HTTP::Test",
    "Test::Mock",
    "Test::NoTabs"
  ],

</pre>


<p>Those modules can be found on the <a href="https://modules.raku.org/">Raku Modules Directory</a>. Note that <a href="https://github.com/jnthn/spreadsheet-xlsx"><code>Spreadsheet::XLSX</code></a> was specifically implemented for this project. As a side-effect, just yesterday our expert elf (see below) submitted a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/libxml-raku/LibXML-raku/pull/49">pull request</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/libxml-raku/LibXML-raku">LibXML</a>&nbsp;used in Spreadsheet::XLSX leading to a factor of 2 performance improvement.</p>



<p>Speaking of the actual implementation, although our brave elf didn’t have much experience with either grammars, parsers, or even Perl 6 / Raku, he was smart enough to engage a real <a href="https://www.edument.se/en/page/jonathan-worthington-eng">expert elf</a> for that. This elf did most of the heavy lifting of the backend implementation and helped our elf with advice and code review for the parts he implemented himself.</p>



<p>Please note that the goal of this rewrite was to leave most of the syntax of the model implementation and also the frontend as is, so the blame for all the sub-optimal design decisions are solely on our primary elf as well as the responsibility for imperfect implementation details passing under the review radar.</p>



<h2>Some Raku features used in AGRAMMON</h2>



<p>In this section we’ll present a few Raku features used in AGRAMMON. This is not meant as a hardcore technical explanation for experts, but rather as a means to give a taste to people interested in Raku.</p>



<p>Most code examples are taken straight from the current implementation, sometimes the examples are slightly shortened by leaving of code that is irrelevant to the concept presented. There are many links to the original modules on GitHub. As AGRAMMON is still being worked on, those links might point at a more recent version of the module.</p>



<h3><a href="https://github.com/oposs/agrammon/blob/master/bin/agrammon.pl6">bin/agrammon.pl6</a></h3>



<p>The actual AGRAMMON “executable” is just a three-liner (of which only two are Raku):</p>


<pre title="">#!/usr/bin/env raku
use lib "lib"
use Agrammon::UI::CommandLine;

</pre>


<p>This exploits the fact that Rakudo (the Raku implementation used here) has a pretty nice <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/faq#index-entry-Precompile_(FAQ)">pre-compilation</a> feature which is useful for minimizing (the still not neglegible) startup time after the first run of the program.<a href="https://github.com/zaucker/agrammon/blob/Advent/Advent2020/raku-in-the-wild.md#agrammonuicommandline"></a></p>



<h3><a href="https://github.com/oposs/agrammon/blob/master/lib/Agrammon/UI/CommandLine.pm6">Agrammon::UI::CommandLine</a></h3>



<p>This module contains the main functions of the AGRAMMON application available from the command line.</p>



<h4><a href="https://github.com/zaucker/agrammon/blob/Advent/Advent2020/raku-in-the-wild.md#usage"></a>Usage</h4>



<p>Running <code>./bin/agrammon.pl6</code> gives the following output:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure id="w-node-8ad322b2e409-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5fdef365db8935cbdaab25b0_pexels-fauxels-3184422.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In the past 3 months of working on <a href="http://delightchat.io/" target="_blank">delightchat.io</a>, this week was the only week where we managed to hit our deadlines exactly as planned. So I decided to dissect this further and tried to understand what we did right this time that we kept missing in the past few weeks.<br></p><p>On Dwelling deeper I found a few things that seemed to have really helped. The include</p><ul role="list"><li>Breaking up a week into simple and complex tasks.</li><li>Breaking up your day into time slots.<br></li></ul><h3><strong>Breaking up a week into simple and complex tasks.</strong><br></h3><p>After speaking to <a href="https://akash.substack.com/" target="_blank">our founding engineer Akash</a>, I realised something which should have been very obvious but somehow slipped past me. In the past few weeks we have been trying to knock off as many difficult tasks as possible, and by difficult I mean the tasks that had many unknowns and the quantum of work required to finish them was not really predictable. The idea behind this was that if we finished these types of tasks first, we could do the easy and predictable tasks at any point of time.<br></p><p>Turns out that this was not the correct way to approach things. In order to boost the morale of the team, there needed to be a few tasks which did not have any unknowns and therefore an ETA can be accurately established. As a result of this, finishing these tasks early in the week gives a feeling of achievement and fuels the desire to get more done in the remaining days of the week.<br></p><p>After this initial boost in morale, a complex task which requires a lot of research and deeper thinking can be undertaken more easily and confidently. This seemed to be the key to meeting our deadline for the week. We had two easy and predictable tasks this week that got done in two days. Post that Akash took up one complex task which took the remainder of the week.<br></p><h3><strong>Breaking up your day into time slots.</strong><br></h3><p>As Co-founders, Preetam and I have many things to do including development, meetings, writing content and many miscellaneous ad hoc tasks which come up. If we plan to be productive we would have to apply the above concept not only to the week but to every single day. Preetam suggested to me to divide the day into these 4 parts.<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Distraction free time to undertake complex and high priority tasks.</li><li>Time to complete a few easy tasks which might not be entirely distraction free.</li><li>A buffer time for any ad hoc tasks or meetings that might come up.</li><li>Time to relax<br></li></ul><p>So the full week must be divided into a few easy and a few difficult tasks, but each day within the week must be divided into the above 4 time frames. <br></p><h4><strong>Distraction free time</strong><br></h4><p>If you want to be be devoid of any distractions, you and your team can agree upon a certain period of time during the day where nobody is supposed to message each other on slack or call each other. We tried doing this in the initial stages but it was hard to pull this off because there could be pressing issues that cannot wait till the specified time window is over.<br></p><p>So I decided to change my strategy a little bit and do this during a period where our team is not working or at least is not expected to work. This only left me with 2 options - late night or early morning. I choose early morning because it feels healthier and it really helps to accomplish something early in the day because that will determine your mood for the rest of the day. <br></p><p>A while back I read this article about how the military mandates you to make your bed as soon as you get up and the idea behind it was for you to feel like you finished the first task of your day successfully and the result can be seen in the form of a clean made up bed which sets the tone for your mindset for the rest of the day. The other advantage of this is that if the rest of your day turns out to be bad, at least you can look forward to sleeping on an already clean and made up bed.<br></p><h4><strong>Time to complete easy tasks</strong><br></h4><p>After the early morning period has passed, the team is fully awake and active on slack, so you can no longer expect to be fully distraction free. Which means that the next few tasks that you do must be planned in a way that they do not require too much concentration and are mostly labour intensive. <br></p><p>An example of this is UI development work that involves minimal business logic and mostly assembling of components. This way even if you get distracted, you can context switch and get back into development quite easily. Obviously this is not always possible but one can prioritise their tasks in a way that whatever tasks require the least amount of brain power can be planned during this time frame. <br></p><h4><strong>Buffer time for ad hoc tasks</strong><br></h4><p>There are many such occurrences where a previously defined and agreed upon task can no longer be done in the way that was discussed because some new information has come to light. This may lead to more development or changing of the feature set to accommodate this new information. Either ways this requires your full attention to get through. <br></p><p>There could also be occurrences where a teammate wants to discuss or clarify something with you without which he/she is not able to proceed and therefore his/her time is blocked. This is not something that can be avoided because for the smooth functioning of any team, there must be no blockers or dependencies. <br></p><p>It is therefore important to dedicate some time during the day where you can schedule all of such ad hoc requests. Even if you receive these requests while the other time slots are in progress, you can schedule them for this time slot. <br></p><p>During this time slot you cannot expect to get much work done of your own, but at the same time you can’t just sit and wait for a teammate to message you about something, so you could use this time to browse the internet for some articles/resources that you always planned to look at for various purposes but never found the time. You could also use this time to work on some backlog tasks that have been pending for a while but lower in the priority list.<br></p><h4><strong>Time to relax</strong><br></h4><p>In my experience, out of all the above time slots, the time spent on ad hoc tasks is the most exhausting due to the amount of context switching needed and the lack of predictability. Therefore it is natural for one to transition from the ad hoc tasks time into relaxing time.<br></p><p>Unfortunately I do not have the luxury of always being able to have some time to relax. There are some days where this particular time slot gets skipped due to the workload but I try to clock in at least 45 minutes a day for a workout which for me counts as time to relax. I also have a hot bath right after my workout which really elevates the experience.<br></p><h3><strong>Closing notes</strong><br></h3><p>It has only been 3 months since Preetam and I started running a team and we are very much still learning. So it is entirely possible that we change our strategy in the coming days to accommodate the workload, the personalities of the new folks who join our team and our product roadmap.<br></p><p>But I feel like regardless of what happens, I can totally see the early morning distraction free time as something that I will continue to adapt for the foreseeable future. The benefits of doing this are too many to ignore. </p></div></div>]]>

<!-- internalpointers responsive -->
<p>An iterator is an object that points to an element inside a container. Like a pointer, an iterator can be used to access the element it points to and can be moved through the content of the container. Each container in the C++ Standard Library provides its own iterator, as well as some methods to retrieve it. Using iterators is quite easy: obtain an instance from a container, move it around where needed and then get the pointed element.</p>
<p>Concretely, an iterator is a simple class that provides a bunch of operators: increment <code>++</code>, dereference <code>*</code> and few others which make it very similar to a pointer and the arithmetic operations you can perform on it. In fact, iterators are a generalization of pointers, which are often used as a foundation when writing the iterator itself.</p>
<p>Iterators are one of the building blocks of the Standard Library containers, but they are also useful when you want to provide the ability to iterate over elements of a custom container that you wrote yourself: this is what I want to investigate in the present article. Adding iterators to your containers will make them compatible with the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/range-for">range-based for loops</a> and the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm">C++ Algorithms library</a>: a collection of functions for searching, sorting, counting and manipulating containers, based on iterators.</p>
<h2>A dummy container for our experiments</h2>
<p>Before digging deeper, let's define a silly custom container that we want to spice up with iterators:</p>
<pre><code>class Integers
{
private:
    int m_data[200];
};
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Integers</code> class is a wrapper around a raw array of <code>int</code>s: we want to be able to access elements of that private array through an iterator, as well as to loop over it or pass it to any of the Standard Library algorithms. Let's start by making some design decisions.</p>
<h2>Choose the nature of our iterator</h2>
<p>The first step is to choose the type of iterator we want to implement. Modern C++ defines six types:</p>
<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>#</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/InputIterator">Input Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Can scan the container forward only once, can't change the value it points to (read-only);</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/OutputIterator">Output Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Can scan the container forward only once, can't read the value it points to (write-only);</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ForwardIterator">Forward Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Can scan the container forward multiple times, can read and write the value it points to;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/BidirectionalIterator">Bidirectional Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Same as previous one but can scan the container back and forth;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/RandomAccessIterator">Random Access Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Same as previous one but can access the container also non-sequentially (i.e. by jumping around);</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ContiguousIterator">Contiguous Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Same as previous one, with the addition that logically adjacent elements are also physically adjacent in memory.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The six categories are hierarchical: a Bidirectional Iterator is also a Forward Iterator and a Random Access Iterator is both a Bidirectional and a Forward Iterator and so on. Normally, all iterators are Input Iterators (1) which makes them read-only, also known as <strong>constant iterators</strong>. Iterators that both support read and write operations are also Output Iterators (2) and are called <strong>mutable iterators</strong>.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monocasual/internalpointers-files/master/2020/12/iterators/iterator-hierarchy.png" alt="Iterators hierarchy"></p><p>1. Iterators hierarchy in C++. All iterators are Input Iterators, Output Iterators or both.</p>
</div><p>Input and Output iterators are often used for low-level components such as input and output streams (the so-called <strong>single-pass algorithms</strong>) and thus have limitations. We want to do more with our custom container, so we will skip those two and jump straight to the mutable Forward Iterator.</p>
<h2>Prepare the custom iterator</h2>
<p>An iterator is usually declared inside the class it belongs to, for example:</p>
<pre><code>class Integers
{
public:
    struct Iterator { /* ... */ };

    // ...
};
</code></pre>
<p>The first thing to do is to assign the iterator some properties. Until C++17 this is done by <em>tagging</em> it with the <a href="https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/04/27/tag-dispatching/"><strong>tag dispatch</strong></a> mechanism, while C++20 uses <strong>concepts</strong>: in this article I will follow the traditional approach.</p>
<p>C++ expects some properties from an iterator:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>iterator_category</code> — one of the six iterator categories we have seen above. The full list is available <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/iterator_tags">here</a>. The <code>std::forward_iterator_tag</code> tag is what we need;</li>
<li><code>difference_type</code> — a signed integer type that can be used to identify distance between iterator steps. Our iterator is basically a wrapper around a pointer and leverages pointer arithmetic, so the default <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/ptrdiff_t"><code>std::ptrdiff_t</code></a> is a good choice;</li>
<li><code>value_type</code> — the type the iterator iterates over. <code>int</code> in our case;</li>
<li><code>pointer</code> — defines a pointer to the type iterated over. <code>int*</code> in our case;</li>
<li><code>reference</code> — defines a reference to the type iterated over. <code>int&amp;</code> in our case;</li>
</ul>
<p>Translated into code:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;iterator&gt; // For std::forward_iterator_tag
#include &lt;cstddef&gt;  // For std::ptrdiff_t

struct Iterator 
{
    using iterator_category = std::forward_iterator_tag;
    using difference_type   = std::ptrdiff_t;
    using value_type        = int;
    using pointer           = int*;  // or also value_type*
    using reference         = int&amp;;  // or also value_type&amp;
};
</code></pre>
<h3>Why are tags useful?</h3>
<p>Some of the tags above might seem useless at first. In fact, you will notice how they will never get mentioned during the definition of our iterator. Tags are used to select the most efficient algorithm if your container is passed to one of the Standard Library functions from the <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code> library. Wrong tags mean sub-optimal performance! The iterator category is also used to set algorithm requirements, for example: <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/fill"><code>std::fill</code></a> wants a Forward Iterator, while <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/reverse"><code>std::reverse</code></a> wants a Bidirectional Iterator. Passing the wrong iterator will result in a compilation error.</p>
<h2>Define the iterator constructors</h2>
<p>All iterators must be <em>constructible</em>, <em>copy-constructible</em>, <em>copy-assignable</em>, <em>destructible</em> and <em>swappable</em>. Let's translate those requirements into code for our iterator:</p>
<pre><code>struct Iterator 
{
    // Iterator tags here...

    Iterator(pointer ptr) : m_ptr(ptr) {}

private:

    pointer m_ptr;
};
</code></pre>
<p>Easy! We just need a custom constructor to initialize the private member variable <code>m_ptr</code>, which points to an element of the <code>Integers</code> container. The custom constructor satisfies the <em>constructible</em> requirement, while all others are covered by the implicitly-declared constructors and operators kindly provided by the compiler.</p>
<h2>Implement operators</h2>
<p>We are building a mutable Forward Iterator, which inherits properties from both Input and Output Iterators. The resulting iterator must support the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>*iterator</code> and <code>iterator-&gt;x</code> — dereferenceable, to get the value it points to;</li>
<li><code>++iterator</code> and <code>iterator++</code> — incrementable, to move it one step forward, both prefix and postfix versions. The latter must return something dereferenceable;</li>
<li><code>iterator_a == iterator_b</code> and <code>iterator_a != iterator_b</code> — comparable with another iterator;</li>
</ul>
<p>This is done by implementing some custom operators in the <code>Iterator</code> class, like this:</p>
<pre><code>struct Iterator 
{
    // Iterator tags here...

    // Iterator constructors here...

    reference operator*() const { return *m_ptr; }
    pointer operator-&gt;() { return m_ptr; }

    // Prefix increment
    Iterator&amp; operator++() { m_ptr++; return *this; }  

    // Postfix increment
    Iterator operator++(int) { Iterator tmp = *this; ++(*this); return tmp; }

    friend bool operator== (const Iterator&amp; a, const Iterator&amp; b) { return a.m_ptr == b.m_ptr; };
    friend bool operator!= (const Iterator&amp; a, const Iterator&amp; b) { return a.m_ptr != b.m_ptr; };     

private:

    pointer m_ptr;
};
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see every operator involves the usage of the private pointer <code>m_ptr</code>. Also, notice the <code>friend</code> declaration for the two comparison operators: this is handy way to define the operators as non-member functions, yet being able to access private parts of the <code>Iterator</code> class (rationale  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4421706/what-are-the-basic-rules-and-idioms-for-operator-overloading/4421729#4421729">here</a>).</p>
<h2>Prepare the container</h2>
<p>Our iterator is good to go. The last step is to give our custom container the ability to create <code>Iterator</code> objects. This is done by adding two public methods <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code> that return instances of the <code>Iterator</code> class, representing the first and the last element respectively:</p>
<pre><code>class Integers
{
public:

    // Iterator definition here ...

    Iterator begin() { return Iterator(&amp;m_data[0]); }
    Iterator end()   { return Iterator(&amp;m_data[200]); } // 200 is out of bounds
};
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>end()</code> method returns an iterator that refers to an <em>invalid</em> memory address, past the end of our raw array. Such iterator is just a placeholder used to determine when the boundary has been reached: it should never be accessed directly.</p>

<!-- internalpointers responsive -->
<h2>Time to test our iterator</h2>
<p>Both the custom container and its iterator are now ready. Let's test them with the range-based for loop:</p>
<pre><code>Integers integers;
for (auto i : integers)
    std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "\n";
</code></pre>
<p>This code will magically print the value of each integer in the container. It works because the range-based for loop is just syntactic sugar created by the compiler for the following:</p>
<pre><code>for (auto it = integers.begin(), end = integers.end(); it != end; ++it) { 
    const auto i = *it; 
    std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "\n";
}
</code></pre>
<p>In words: two iterators <code>it</code> and <code>end</code> are created. The first one points to the beginning of the container, the other one points to the end. Then, on each loop, the <code>it</code> iterator is incremented until it's equal to <code>end</code>, that is until the end of the container has been reached. The actual value is obtained by dereferencing <code>it</code> in a local variable before being printed.</p>
<p>Notice how the compiler makes use of all the operators and functions we have previously implemented: the <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code> methods in the custom container, the ability to compare the two iterators with the <code>!=</code> operator, the ability to increment <code>it</code> with the prefix syntax and finally the ability to dereference it to grab the actual value it points to.</p>
<p>Let's now try a function from the Algorithm library, <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/fill"><code>std::fill</code></a> for example:</p>
<pre><code>Integers integers;

std::fill(integers.begin(), integers.end(), 3);
</code></pre>
<p>The function assigns all elements in the container the value <code>3</code>. It works because <code>std::fill</code> is usually implemented like this:</p>
<pre><code>template &lt;typename ForwardIterator, …</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While exploring D recently, I remembered a game I played while at university 15 years ago. For a long time, I couldn’t remember the name at all, only that it was from a Japanese developer. After some search wrangling, I finally managed to find the name of the game: <strong>Torus Trooper!</strong></p>
<p>You can find it there: <a href="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/windows/tt_e.html">http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/windows/tt_e.html</a></p>
<p><img src="https://speps.fr/media/articles/tt1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is a copy of the tt0_22.zip file archived: <a href="https://github.com/speps/tt/archive/legacy.zip">https://github.com/speps/tt/archive/legacy.zip</a></p>
<p>What made me remember this game is that :</p>
<ul>
<li>It came with <a href="https://github.com/speps/tt/tree/legacy/src/abagames">source code</a>, quite unusual at the time for me</li>
<li>Written in D, a language I didn’t know at all while I was busy studying C++</li>
<li>It’s awfully addictive!</li>
</ul>
<p>What better project than try to compile a <strong>D v0.110</strong> project in a modern version of D and possibly porting the game to WebAssembly+WebGL! So here we are…</p>
<h2 id="switching-from-ant-to-dub">Switching from Ant to DUB</h2>
<p>The game used Ant and its <code>build.xml</code> file to generate the executable, resources, etc. Since then, D added DUB as a build system / package manager so let’s use that!</p>

</div><p>I did try a few searches without success so I asked on the D community forums and a few people guessed right, it’s of course a <code>not &gt;=</code>, equivalent to <code>&lt;</code>. However, <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/post/rec3d1$toc$1@digitalmars.com">thanks to Walter Bright</a>, I got a link to the <a href="https://www.digitalmars.com/ctg/ctgNumerics.html#comparisons">original documentation from Digital Mars</a>. The subtle difference with <code>!&gt;=</code> is that it will also return <code>true</code> if any operands are <code>NaN</code>. Suggested fix seems to have worked:</p>

</div><h2 id="replacing-char-with-string">Replacing <code>char[]</code> with <code>string</code></h2>
<p>D1 used to have <code>char[]</code> as the string type, and functions in <code>std.string</code> in Phobos to manipulate this type. D2 replaced this with an <code>alias string = immutable(char)[]</code>. As a result, a lot of the code needs updating to deal with this. That includes the code in the custom bindings.</p>
<p>Most of the changes here are similar to this</p>

                <p>I am proud to present my latest project - the Astropanel.</p>

<p>This program will help you decide when you should bring out your telescope.</p>

<p>Feature list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Weather forecast for the next 9 days with coloring (red/yellow/green) based
on your limits for cloud cover, humidity, temperature and wind</li>
  <li>Easy graphic representation of when the Sun, Moon and planets are visible
with the Moon’s phase showing in how light the representing bar is</li>
  <li>Extra information for each day: Fog, wind gust speed, dew point temperature,
air pressure, UV Index, Sun and Moon precise rise and set and Moon phase.
The Moon phase is expressed as a number between 0 and 100 where 50 is the
full moon.</li>
  <li>Astronomical events for each of the 9 days, with option to list them in one
view</li>
  <li>Starchart showing in the terminal for the selected day and time of day</li>
  <li>A table showing RA, Dec, distance, rise, set and transit for the planets</li>
  <li>Show today’s Astronomy Picture Of the Day</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from always having a verb at the end, Japanese does not depend on sequence.  Japanese is a grammar defined by <em>grammar particles</em>, functional “words” that glue on to nouns to indicate what purpose the noun serves.</p>



<p>Here we highlight some common Japanese particles in a slice of the ひらがな [hiragana] syllabary.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1069" height="834" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/japanese-particles.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>You can practice your 🎵 listening comprehension👂 of the ひらがな 🎎 <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/hiragana">here</a>.  But we digress, Japanese relies on <em>grammatical particles</em> to indicate the <strong>who, what, when,  where, and how</strong> of a sentence.</p>



<h2><strong>Who, what, when, where, and how</strong>.</h2>



<h2>で  (de) <strong>where and how</strong></h2>



<p>For example, で [“deh”] implies <em>manner of accomplishment</em> or <em>setting-locality where something takes place.</em> Mapping to English, we cover the <strong>where</strong> [setting] and <strong>how</strong> [means] with で。</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="246" height="142" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.34.24-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<hr>



<h2>に (ni) where and when</h2>



<p>For destinations, or specific times, or precise physical points of existence (being), Japanese relies on the use of the <em>grammatical particle</em> に [“ni” as in, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIV4poUZAQo">“we are the knights who say…”</a>].  に [“knee!”] therefore covers <strong>where</strong> [destination] and <strong>when</strong> [moment].</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="648" height="446" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.36.55-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<hr>



<h2>が  (ga) who and what</h2>



<p>The <em>grammatical particle</em> が [“ga”] is used to explain <strong>who</strong> and <strong>what</strong> when used as the <strong>grammatical subjects</strong> of a sentence.  </p>



<p>For example: Vegetables are delicious.  Candy is sweet.<br>  (Veggies are <strong>what</strong> is delicious)<br>  (The candy is <strong>what</strong> is sweet)</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="366" height="295" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.38.46-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<hr>



<p>Finally, in this brief primer, we want to show the concept of <strong>bunsetsu jar</strong> which we have featured on our <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/reverse-engineer/">“Reverse Engineer Some Japanese”</a> page.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="737" height="138" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.41.05-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>Within a <strong>bunsetsu jar</strong>, we place a noun and cap off the <strong>jar</strong> with a <strong>lid</strong> containing a <em>grammatical particle</em> such as が、に、で or one of the many others.  </p>



<p>In total, there is an estimated 233 + particles (some are multi-mora, that is, multiple letters) and we teach them in a gradual and comprehensible way in <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/?p=83">Japanese Complete</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, a sentence-final verb is placed at the end of a sentence.  In English, this would be akin to moving the “is/are” or “be/exists” verb to the end of every sentence.  Japanese fun is.  Grammar easy is.  Japanese-about thinking = interesting is.</p>



<p>So that’s it. You pick your nouns, you pick the <em>grammatical particles</em> to match based on the meaning of <strong>who, what, when, where, and how</strong>, and you figure out the sentence-final verb element.  Now you’re thinking in Japanese.</p>



<p>Of course, developing the reflex and intuition around this takes some practice, which is why we devised quizzes for Japanese Complete that help train your intuition on the particles, one-by-one.  You can watch a brief video showing some of the quizzes in action on our <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/guide">free guide page</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Kanji in English Context</h2>



<p>In order to accelerate Kanji comprehension into English context, as you can see in a sonnet by Shakespeare on <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/learning-to-read">this page</a>.  This pattern follows a similar pattern of adoption that native Japanese took: grab kanji from mainland Asia for their ideographic value and smash them together with your native syllabary to add helpful meaning, nuance, and context.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="496" height="177" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.46.27-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong>Temple NI arrive.</strong> [unstated subjects arrive to the temple]</p>



<p><strong>Enter-before NI, hands OH let’s wash, NE.</strong> [before entering, let’s wash our hands, right?]</p>



<p>We’ve created a substack newsletter to share <em>Kanji in English Context </em>once or twice a month, you can <a href="https://japanesecomplete.substack.com/p/coming-soon">sign up for it here</a> if you’re interested in getting interesting <em>Kanji in English Context</em> lessons to your inbox.</p>



<hr>



<p>One great thing about Japanese grammar is that the <strong>bunsetsu jars</strong> can be arranged in any sequence before the final verb, provided each noun has its appropriately matching <em>grammar particle</em> glued on and intact.  This leads to great fun with parsing, as one can create a <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/?p=811">rudimentary Japanese grammar parser</a> from a 5-line EBNF grammar.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1080" height="1349" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/osaka-castle.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>Hopefully this post made the inner mechanics of Japanese more clear.  Developing intuition and unlocking the language takes study, practice, and determination!  If you’re looking for a program to break the language down logically <strong>and</strong> provide practice and training to help your newfound understanding become intuitive and fast, might we humbly suggest <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/">Japanese Complete</a>.</p>
